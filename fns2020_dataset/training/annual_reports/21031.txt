Ashmore Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 EMERGING MARKET
Expanding urbanisation and the growing savings pools of  
ever -increasing Emerging Markets populations are catalysts  
for innovation in asset management. The opportunities  
we have today to create wealth and value are as diverse  
as Emerging Markets themselves.
Over the past two decades we have developed and built 
up a secure foothold in Emerging Markets across the globe 
because we recognised early on that they would become 
the engine room of global growth. T oday, we are strongly 
positioned to capitalise on these opportunities and translate 
them into real value for our investors, our shareholders,  
our people and the communities close to our hearts.

2 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Chairman’s statement
A YEAR OF SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
Market conditions were buoyant for most of  
the year, though in the last months there was  
a sharp and largely indiscriminate sell-off in risk 
assets across most of the Emerging Markets,  
largely caused by concerns over the timing of the 
withdrawal of quantitative easing by the US Federal 
Reserve. Ashmore’s specialist knowledge and active 
investment management style come to the fore  
in such difficult periods. 
Overall the Group has had a successful year  
with strong growth in assets under management,  
up by 22% to stand at US$77 .4 billion, coming from 
both new and existing clients, and is a direct result  
of the investment we have made in our distribution 
activities. We have also continued to build our 
domestic asset management presence within 
Emerging Markets, establishing offices in Indonesia 
and in China.
The Group’s financial performance was solid. 
Profitability was maintained at an industry-leading 
level, with an EBITDA margin of 71%. Profit before 
tax increased 6% to £257 .6 million and diluted 
earnings per share rose 1 1% to 28.69p.
Recognising the financial performance achieved 
during the year, and the Board’s confidence in future 
growth, the Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 11 .75p per share for the year ended  
30 June 2013, which, subject to shareholders’ 
approval, will be paid on 6 December, to those 
shareholders on the register on 8 November.  
The Board intends to pay a progressive dividend  
over time, taking into consideration factors such  
as prospects for the Group’s earnings, demands  
on the Group’s financial resources, and the markets  
in which the Group operates.
Corporate governance
The Board considers corporate governance  
matters and adherence to codes of best practice  
to be of upmost importance. As Chairman of the 
Board, I believe that it has operated effectively 
through the year and that its role and its 
composition are well defined, appropriate and 
support the long-term development of the Group. 
As a unitary Board, one of our principal tasks  
is to ensure that our membership has the right  
skills and knowledge base relevant to our business, 
and to plan for succession, as existing directors 
come to the end of their tenures. These issues  
are a regular topic of discussion during the Board 
evaluation process, and where we have a specific 
vacancy to fill or where we have decided to add 
further to the Board, the Nominations Committee 
will engage an independent search consultant,  
with no connection to the Group, to assist us  
in this process.
Jonathan Asquith retired at the Group’s AGM  
in October and I should like to thank him for the 
contribution he made to the Board over four years.  
In February the Group announced the appointment 
to the Board of two Non-executive Directors:  
Dame Anne Pringle DCMG, and Charles Outhwaite. 
Dame Anne has considerable and valuable 
experience as a diplomat with the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office, focusing in particular  
on the EU, Russia and Eastern Europe, including  
serving as Ambassador to the Russian Federation 
from 2008 to 201 1 . Charles has over 25 years of 
experience in corporate finance, with a particular 
focus on financial services. He is currently a senior 
advisor to Evercore Partners. 
Solid performance and resilience in the face of tougher 
market conditions towards the end of the year

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Both the new Directors have undertaken a full 
induction programme, with the support of the  
Board and senior management, to familiarise them 
with their duties and responsibilities and all relevant 
aspects of the Group’s business. In due course they 
will be appointed to Board committees to suit their 
particular experience and expertise.
Good business momentum as a result of prior investment, 
and an enhanced Board to support future growth.
The Board now comprises eight members  
of whom six are non-executive and two are female;  
I am therefore pleased to report that the Board 
complies with the best practice recommendations  
of the Davies Report in respect of its composition.  
The Nominations Committee considers diversity, 
including the balance of skills, experience, gender 
and nationality amongst many other factors when 
reviewing the appointment of new Directors, but 
does not consider it appropriate to establish quotas 
or targets in this regard. Furthermore, and consistent 
with the emphasis the Board places on maintaining 
high standards of corporate governance, I am 
delighted that in May this year the Group became  
a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible 
Investment. A more detailed report on corporate 
governance is provided on pages 40 to 46.
Ashmore’s investment processes, distribution 
platform and operational infrastructure are well 
placed to cope with the prevailing uncertain market 
conditions. Notwithstanding the accomplishments  
of the year, there remains much to do, to build  
out the Group’s access to capital and investment 
opportunities around the world, and the Group  
faces this task with confidence.
The Board recognises and is grateful for the  
hard work and commitment of everyone across  
the Group’s operations over the past year.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Chief Executive Officer’s report
concerns over a reduction in quantitative easing (QE) 
in the United States. Local currency assets were 
particularly affected in the sell-off, as technical 
factors, such as the presence of leveraged and 
speculative positions that were particularly sensitive 
to the Federal Reserve’s tapering message in  
May, outweighed the largely benign fundamental 
backdrop. This served as a reminder that Emerging 
Markets still comprise a broad spread of relatively 
inefficient asset classes, where misconceptions 
abound. However, historically such a divergence 
between market movements and underlying 
fundamentals has provided good opportunities  
for Ashmore’s value-based investment approach.
For the Group overall, the percentage of AuM 
outperforming benchmarks at 30 June 2013 was very 
good, at 92% over three years (30 June 2012: 86%) 
and 96% over one year (30 June 2012: 23%). It is 
particularly pleasing to note the improvement in the 
equities theme, with 39% of AuM outperforming 
over three years (30 June 2012: 21%) and 87%  
over one year (30 June 2012: 22%) as the specialist 
funds have continued to perform and the actions 
implemented to refine the Broad Global Active 
investment process have delivered.
The recent volatile market environment highlights 
once again the benefits of being a specialist active 
manager in Emerging Markets, and the investment 
returns described above demonstrate the benefits  
of bringing to bear over two decades of investment 
experience for the Group’s clients.
Financial performance
Revenue
Net revenue for the year of £355.5 million was  
7% higher than in the prior year. This resulted from  
a 4% increase in management fee income net  
of distribution costs to £311 .2 million, driven by  
an increase in average AuM levels offset by a 
reduction of average net management fee margins  
by 6bps to 68bps. 
The margin reduction was primarily the result  
of theme and client mix effects, together with 
notable success in winning relatively large mandates, 
particularly in the local currency theme, which 
The results for the year ended 30 June 2013 
illustrate the substantial progress made in building a 
more diversified business, with strong performance 
across the Group, record subscriptions following  
a period of investment in distribution, and an 
operational platform that is capable of processing 
and managing far higher levels of AuM. The 
experience of over two decades of investing solely  
in Emerging Markets, across equities, fixed income 
and alternatives, is invaluable in assessing the risks 
and opportunities inevitably presented by a period  
of market turbulence such as we witnessed towards 
the end of the financial year. During this period, 
Ashmore continued to outperform and to achieve 
strong client flows. 
AuM development
Assets under management increased 22% from 
US$63.7 billion to US$77 .4 billion during the year,  
with average AuM rising 13%, principally the result of 
strong net inflows of US$13.4 billion. Good investment 
performance over most of the year was offset by 
pronounced market weakness in late May and June.
Record gross subscriptions of US$27 .2 billion 
(FY2011/12: US$13.0 billion) were primarily into  
the debt themes, and particularly local currency  
and corporate debt where the investment universe 
and potential investment returns are both attractive. 
Demand for blended debt is also strong, as it 
represents a natural first step for an Emerging 
Markets allocation as well as satisfying the 
increasing trend for clients to specify bespoke 
benchmarks against which to measure investment 
performance. Pleasingly, the Group’s equities  
theme achieved gross subscriptions in each  
of the four quarters during the year. 
Gross redemptions increased in absolute terms  
to US$13.8 billion (FY2011/12: US$11 .7 billion) but  
at 19% of average AuM (FY2011/12: 18%) remained  
at a reasonable level and low by industry standards. 
Investment performance
Investment performance contributed US$0.3 billion; 
however, this masks good performance for the 
majority of the year negated by the sharp market 
declines in the fourth quarter, catalysed primarily by 
OVER TWO DECADES OF EMERGING 
MARKETS INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE
Emerging Markets GDP will be the driving force of global 
economic growth over the next 30 years. Ashmore is 
positioned at the heart of this growth
6 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 naturally attract a lower revenue margin. Specifically, 
among the local currency mandate wins during  
the period was a number of segregated accounts 
over US$500 million in size. These funds earn  
an appropriate management fee margin and are 
efficient to manage. Some competition is also 
evident, although its nature and intensity varies  
by theme, and in the context of an asset class  
that is growing rapidly and where many investors, 
particularly those in the developed world, are 
profoundly underweight, the presence of other 
Emerging Markets advocates is welcome.
Performance fees increased to £33.4 million 
(FY2011/12: £25.4 million), with the second half 
contribution slightly stronger than expected due  
to continued market strength in the third quarter. 
Performance fees represented 9% of net revenues 
for the period, broadly in line with the prior year 
(FY2011/12: 8%).
Cost structure
Ashmore keeps a firm control over its cost base, 
while continuing to invest appropriately, including  
in the expansion of the international office network.
The structure of staff costs is a defining characteristic 
of the Group’s business model, with a relatively low 
cap on basic salaries across the Group and a strong 
bias to performance-related variable compensation. 
The latter element places an emphasis on long-term 
equity ownership. In the year to 30 June 2013, 
variable compensation as a percentage of earnings 
before variable compensation, interest and tax  
(VC/EBVCIT) was 20% (FY201 1/12: 18%). 
Profitability
Operating profit for the year was £232.0 million 
(FY2011/12: £225.1 million). 
EBITDA, defined as operating profit excluding 
depreciation and amortisation, for the year was 
£252.2 million (FY2011/12: £236.2 million). The 
EBITDA margin of 71% for the year was unchanged 
(FY2011/12: 71%) and, consistent with the view 
expressed in previous years, our expectation is  
that the Group’s margin will move into the ‘60s’ 
over time.
Net finance income increased from £18.1 million  
to £25.7 million. As in the prior year, it includes 
several items relating to acquisition of AshmoreEMM, 
now operating under the Ashmore brand, and seed 
capital, on which more detail is provided in the 
Business review. 
Profit before tax for the year increased 6%  
to £257 .6 million (FY2011/12: £243.2 million). 
Earnings per share for the year were 29.98p 
(FY2011/12: 26.82p).
Capital Markets Day
In April, the Group held a capital markets 
event to enhance understanding of our 
strategy, the business, and the drivers of 
its future growth, as well as to introduce 
members of the investment, research and 
distribution teams to investors and 
analysts. The presentations were positively 
received and we will continue to pursue 
similar opportunities to further the 
understanding among stakeholders of 
Emerging Markets and our business.

Distribution
In previous periods we have invested to expand the 
Group’s product range and to support rapid growth  
in distribution headcount. This year we demonstrated 
success from this investment through stronger 
gross and net subscriptions. 
Gross subscriptions of US$27 .2 billion represent  
a record for the Group and were sourced from a 
diversified range of clients, both existing and new, 
and were invested efficiently in a range of fixed 
income and equity products. The nature of our largely 
institutional business is that the pattern of client flows 
can be irregular, but the flows generated during the 
period are testament to the relationships established 
and developed by an enhanced distribution team, 
some of which can take many months, if not years,  
to come to fruition. Many of our clients are making 
Mapping the Main Fixed Income Investment Themes
7
Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 long-term allocations to the Emerging Markets asset 
class, providing us with high-quality resilient assets  
to manage, and therefore we experienced relatively 
limited impact from the market weakness at the end 
of the year. Understandably in our view, some clients 
saw this re-pricing of assets as an investment 
opportunity and increased allocations accordingly. 
T o target particularly the third-party intermediary 
business, the Group established and expanded  
a range of open-ended fund conduits in late 2010  
and through 201 1, in the US and Europe, which over 
the course of the next financial year will establish 
three-year investment performance track records. 
This is of particular relevance to the US 40-Act 
mutual funds, which rely heavily on this factor to 
stimulate demand. Nonetheless, with a relatively 
small and focused distribution team, we are pleased 
to have raised AuM of nearly US$1 billion in the US 
intermediary market to date. We plan to modestly 
and steadily increase the headcount in our 
intermediary distribution teams to support growth  
in the 40-Act and SICAV funds as they reach their 
three-year milestones.
The distribution team’s headcount at the end of  
the period was 45 (30 June 2012: 41) and while we 
will invest further in distribution on a selective basis, 
headcount increases in the foreseeable future are 
unlikely to be as marked as in previous periods. The 
Group’s distribution priority is to continue to deliver 
diversified, profitable AuM growth onto its scalable 
operating platform. 
Local asset management
The third phase of the Group’s strategy seeks  
to benefit from the rapidly growing pools of 
investment capital within Emerging Markets, which 
are growing at rates far in excess of the equivalent, 
though today larger, pools of capital in the developed 
world. The traditional investor preference for 
deposit-based products, typically manufactured  
and distributed by banks, is being challenged as real 
interest rates have declined and regulators scrutinise 
the services provided by the incumbents. There  
is a clear opportunity for independent managers  
such as Ashmore to offer credible and attractive 
investment opportunities to domestic Emerging 
Markets investors. 
During the year we established businesses in 
Indonesia and China. The subsidiary operation in 
Jakarta, Indonesia was established in July 2012 and 
launched three funds in the second half of the financial 
year: two equity funds (all-cap and small-cap) and a 
fixed income fund. The Group’s strategy is to combine 
local talent with Ashmore’ s global asset management 
expertise; this approach will enable us to grow a 
leading business in the Indonesian asset management 
market, and in support of this ambition the Group  
has committed seed capital to the three funds.
In China, we acquired the maximum permitted 49% 
stake in a Shanghai-based fund management joint 
venture with Central China Securities Co. (CCSC), 
and we launched two equity-related funds towards 
the year end.
T oday we manage approximately US$1 billion  
in our local Emerging Markets businesses and we 
aim to grow this substantially in the coming years,  
as previously high barriers to entry are broken down 
and the merits of allocating to an independent 
manager with a strong investment pedigree become 
increasingly apparent. The Group has an ongoing 
focus to develop the scale of existing domestic 
businesses and also envisages supplementing  
this growth with opportunities in further markets 
over time.
Seed capital
The ability to seed funds is an important competitive 
advantage for Ashmore, as it supports both entry into 
new markets and the development of new product 
structures and distribution channels, such as the  
US 40-Act funds, and can be considered to underpin 
future AuM growth. During the second half of the 
year the Group committed seed capital to support 
the launch of three funds in Indonesia. Other seed 
capital investments made during the period enabled 
the launch of investment grade blended debt funds 
as well as providing greater scale to enhance the 
distribution potential of several equity funds on the 
SICAV platform. 
The seed capital programme is actively managed, 
has inherent value with funds recycled back into 
cash when appropriate, and is subject to strict 
monitoring by the Board within a framework of set 
limits. Its scale has grown materially, nearly tripling 
from £61 .0 million invested three years ago to  
£170.6 million at 30 June 2013; during the financial 
year, £149.0 million was invested in 15 different 
funds and £129.9 million was recycled from 
investments previously made in a similar number  
of funds. While not its primary purpose, the active 
management of seed capital has generated profits 
for shareholders. The accounting treatment for seed 
capital is explained fully in the notes to the accounts, 
but for clarity the aggregate income statement 
contribution from seed capital-related activity was 
£17 .2 million (FY2011/12: £1 .7 million).
People and culture
The Group’s headcount has increased to 291 at the 
end of the year (30 June 2012: 257) reflecting further 
investment in support functions and the Group’s local 
fund management businesses.
Chief Executive Officer’s report continued
8 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The commitment, expertise and motivation of 
colleagues across the Group were manifest in  
the ability to source, invest and control the strong 
asset flows that Ashmore generated during the year. 
I should like to thank everyone for their tremendous 
effort over the past year, and I am confident that  
as a team we will continue to deliver for our clients 
and shareholders during the current financial year 
and beyond.
Outlook
The fundamental Emerging Markets story  
remains strong and resilient, and is represented  
by the established and powerful GDP per capita 
convergence trend. While Emerging Markets GDP 
per capita has grown rapidly, in absolute terms it  
is still only comparable to Developed Markets in  
1980, with many economies at a far earlier stage of 
development. Across Emerging Markets, political and 
fiscal accountability is leading to improved economic 
stability, and capital markets and domestic pools of 
capital continue to deepen. As a consequence, the 
balance of world economic power is shifting in favour 
of Emerging Markets, such that it is increasingly 
difficult for investors to justify ignoring the asset class 
or to persist with a profoundly underweight position.
The factors behind this positive long-term view 
should not be confused with the noise that arises 
from the inevitable, but shorter-lived, volatility 
associated with the business cycle. In recent 
months, the cyclical slowdown in certain Emerging 
Markets has been extrapolated by the market  
into something abysmal; and at the same time, 
expectations of a sustained and inflation-less  
US economic recovery have increased, influenced  
by the Federal Reserve’s signal in May of imminent  
QE tapering. Our expectation is that both of these 
projections will be wrong. 
Developed markets remain structurally challenged. 
Their immense indebtedness will dampen economic 
recovery and will have to be addressed in due course 
through inflation and currency devaluation, with the 
US furthest down this path, albeit still with total 
public and private sector debt in excess of 400% 
of GDP .
In contrast, the ability of Emerging Markets  
to withstand cyclical and external stresses has 
improved dramatically over the past two decades. 
They have on average one-tenth the leverage of the 
US economy; the debt they have is overwhelmingly 
in local currency and owned by domestic institutions; 
they operate with increasingly orthodox and effective 
inflation policies; they control 80% of the world’s 
foreign exchange reserves; and where it occurs, 
currency depreciation restores competitiveness.
Y et inefficiencies, misconceptions and prejudices  
still abound. Developments in one country or region 
are often extrapolated across the Emerging Markets 
asset class. The price volatility induced by these 
myopic swings in sentiment should not be mistaken 
for higher risk; economic fundamentals ultimately 
reassert themselves. Emerging Markets are not 
homogeneous, and the presence of idiosyncratic 
risks and rewards across more than 65 countries 
provides tremendous opportunities for a specialist, 
active investment manager.
Dedicated long-term investors recognise these 
characteristics of the Emerging Markets asset class, 
and can take advantage of the asset re-pricing that 
results from technical factors rather than a change  
in fundamentals. Demand for Emerging Markets 
themes with relatively low correlation to the  
US treasury market will continue: equities, local 
currency assets, blended debt and shorter duration, 
higher yielding corporate debt offer attractive 
prospective returns. 
The market volatility of recent months should  
not mask the fact that the Emerging Markets 
opportunity is undiminished, and one that Ashmore 
purposefully seeks to capture on behalf of clients. 
The Group’s investment experience over more  
than two decades is a powerful tool in this regard, 
and our long-term investment experience is strong. 
However, we are not complacent; we will continue  
to strive to generate outperformance for our clients, 
and to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders.

Average AuM
Average net management  
fee margins
Definition
The movement between opening and 
closing AuM provides a good indication  
of the overall success of the business 
during the period, both in terms of  
net subscriptions/redemptions and 
investment performance.
The average AuM balance during  
the period, along with the average  
margins achieved, determine the level  
of management fee revenues. The AuM  
and margin trends are lead indicators  
for short-term profitability.
The average net management fee 
margin is calculated in US dollars,  
and is assessed after management  
fee rebates. The average is affected  
by changes in the product and investor  
mix. Certain themes attract higher gross  
fee levels, generally where investment 
return opportunities are higher.
Relevance to strategy
Ashmore’s strategy as a specialist  
Emerging Markets fund manager is to  
grow AuM; firstly by establishing the  
asset class, secondly by diversifying  
developed world capital and thirdly  
by mobilising Emerging Markets capital.
Ashmore aims to maintain high revenue 
margins reflecting the specialist  
characteristics of many of the investment 
themes it manages.
Long-term achievements
US$77.4bn
2012: US$63.7bn
68bps
2012: 74bps
AuM increased by 22% and average AuM 
increased 13%, through strong net inflows 
of US$13.4 billion and positive performance 
of US$0.3 billion. Record gross inflows were 
driven by strong client demand across all  
of the Group’s fixed income themes and 
specialist equity funds. Institutional  
investors account for 89% of AuM.
The reduction in management fee margin 
was the result of client and theme mix 
effects and the influence of large segregated 
mandate wins, particularly in the local 
currency theme.

(VC)/EBVCIT
Y ear end  
headcount
EBITDA margin measures operating profit 
(excluding depreciation and amortisation) 
against net revenues. Net revenues are 
calculated after deducting distribution costs 
and any rebates. Included within costs are 
both fixed and variable personnel expenses 
as well as other operating costs.
The Group’s variable compensation 
represents the majority of the overall 
personnel expenses payable, and is 
assessed as a percentage of earnings  
before variable compensation, interest  
and tax. The amount includes performance-
related bonuses, and share-based payments 
and associated social security costs.
The Group analyses its headcount  
by function (investment vs support) and  
by business (global asset management  
vs local asset management subsidiaries).
Ashmore aims to maintain an industry 
leading EBITDA margin while growing  
the scale of the business. 
The Group maintains a tightly controlled  
cost structure, with a low proportion of 
recurring costs and a large proportion of 
variable performance-related costs. This 
enables the Group to achieve an industry 
leading EBITDA margin.
The year end headcount highlights the 
overall scalability of the business platform. 
The local asset management headcount is  
a vital part of the third phase of the Group’s 
strategy – mobilising Emerging Markets 
capital managed domestically.
71%
2012: 71%
20%
2012: 18%

2012: 257
Ashmore has maintained an EBITDA  
margin above 70% for each of the  
last five years. Consistent with the view 
expressed in previous years, our expectation 
is that the Group’s EBITDA margin will 
maintain an industry leading level but will 
move into the ‘60s’ over time.
The Group’s (VC)/EBVCIT ratio is determined 
by performance in the period. The ratio 
increased for FY2012/13 to 20% to reflect 
continued good performance of the overall 
business over the year, and particularly 
strong relative investment performance  
and net asset raising. 
The increase in headcount is in line  
with the Group’s strategic initiatives 
surrounding domestic Emerging Markets 
fund management and operational  
support functions.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Business review
The Group recorded operating profit before tax  
for the year ended 30 June 2013 of £232.0 million 
(FY2011/12: £225.1 million); EBITDA of £252.2 million 
(FY2011/12: £236.2 million); an EBITDA margin  
of 71% (FY2011/12: 71%); a profit before tax of  
£257 .6 million (FY2011/12: £243.2 million); and  
a profit after tax of £201 .6 million (FY2011/12:  
£185.7 million). 
The table below reclassifies items relating to  
seed capital and acquisitions to aid clarity and 
comprehension of the Group’ s operating performance.

operating profit is based on adjusted EBITDA

The financial results, including the reclassified items, 
are analysed further below.
Assets under management and fund flows
During the year AuM increased by 22% from 
US$63.7 billion to US$77 .4 billion, comprising net 
inflows of US$13.4 billion and a small contribution 
from investment performance of US$0.3 billion. 
Ashmore achieved strong levels of gross 
subscriptions which totalled US$27 .2 billion 
(FY2011/12: US$13.0 billion). Inflows from new and 
existing clients reflected in the main the investment 
the Group has made in its distribution platform over 
the previous few years, and the institutional nature  
of the majority of the Group’s clients provided some 
resilience when markets weakened towards the end 
of the period.
During the financial year there was continued strong 
demand for local currency mandates, particularly, 
though not exclusively, from government-related 
institutions such as central banks and sovereign 
wealth funds. We believe this growth has a structural 
element to it in that such institutions will seek to 
diversify substantial US dollar-based asset holdings 
over time, and the strong fundamentals, growing 
issuance volumes and attractive yields available  
in Emerging Markets local currency markets  
will continue to influence allocations positively.
Similarly, corporate debt experienced strong AuM 
growth through net subscriptions, from a diversified 
range of new and existing clients. Strong new 
issuance levels, a benign default environment, and 
an appreciable yield pick-up versus equivalent-rated 
credits in Developed Markets all underpin continued 
growth in this asset class. Demand is concentrated 
in US dollar-denominated assets, but the Group can 
access the much larger local currency corporate debt 
market, which has had relatively little invested in it to 
date from international investors. The Group is also in 
the process of launching a private debt fund, thereby 
providing to clients one of the most comprehensive 
opportunity sets in this asset class.
Blended debt continues to be a natural starting  
point for new allocations to Emerging Markets  
fixed income, and is the most popular theme on the 
US 40-Act mutual fund platform. The theme is also 
attractive to clients that are invested elsewhere in the 
Emerging Markets universe and wish to define a 
bespoke performance benchmark or to extend their 
investments beyond a pure external debt mandate. 
These factors were evident during the period in some 
of the outflows we experienced from external debt, 
that returned as subscriptions to blended debt funds. 
During the period there was ongoing client demand 
for external debt exposure, across both public funds 
and segregated accounts. A proportion of the gross 
subscriptions reported in this theme arose from 
ASHMORE’S PROFITABLE 
OPERATING MODEL HAS  
BEEN MAINTAINED
22 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 clients moving from public funds to segregated 
accounts, with corresponding gross redemptions 
also being recorded in the theme.
It is pleasing to report that demand for high-
performing and higher-margin specialist equity funds 
was strong throughout the period from a wide range 
of clients, including public pensions and government-
related entities. 
The absolute levels of gross redemptions increased to 
US$13.8 billion (FY201 1/12 US$1 1 .7 billion) but were at 
a reasonable level of 19% of average AuM (FY201 1/12: 
18%) and remain low by industry standards. 
Equities outflows were lower in the second half  
of the year compared with the first six months, as 
focus on and improvements to the Broad Global 
Active investment process have increasingly led  
to outperformance against the funds’ benchmark. 
Outflows from Japanese retail multi-strategy funds 
were also biased towards the first half of the year. 
Redemptions in the second half of the year were 
lower as Y en weakness benefited investment 
performance and quantitative easing led to greater 
investor risk appetite. However, this remains a 
market that is highly cyclical.
New funds and accounts
With record gross subscriptions, the year was a busy 
one for new account openings and fund launches. 
There were more than 30 segregated accounts and 
white label/dual brand mandates won during the 
period, across all debt themes and also equity and 
multi-strategy themes. The greater number of 
segregated mandates reflects increasing client 
demand for this structure, and we have seen a 
number of clients move existing capital from public 
funds to new segregated accounts. The investment 
made in operational support in recent periods 
ensured we were able to deliver the additional 
complexity that typically accompanies such funds. 
We also increased the public fund range, including 
three funds in Indonesia, and additional equity, local 
currency, corporate debt and blended debt funds on 
the SICAV platform. The Group ended the period with 
177 funds (FY2011/12: 136 funds).
There continues to be client demand for investment 
grade assets, driven in some cases by regulatory 
requirements and therefore this is a trend that can 
be expected to persist. On a dedicated basis, such 
funds now represent 5% of the Group’s AuM.
AuM movements by investment theme 
In line with the interim results and the historically 
reported quarterly updates, the AuM by theme as 
classified by mandate is shown in the table below. 
This details gross subscriptions and redemptions, 
investment performance and average net 
management fee margins for each theme.
Reclassifications typically occur when a fund’s 
investment objectives, investment guidelines  
or performance benchmark change such that its 
characteristics cause it to be included in a different 
theme. During the period this was particularly the 
case with clients that were previously invested in 
external debt funds and chose to define bespoke 
benchmarks incorporating other fixed income 
themes; these funds are then classified as  
blended debt.

24 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 71% (30 June 2012: 67%) of AuM. Government-
related entities account for 41% of Group AuM but 
this is diversified across central banks (18% of Group 
AuM), sovereign wealth funds (8% of Group AuM) 
and governments (15% of Group AuM).
The proportion of Group AuM sourced through 
third-party intermediaries – including electronic 
platforms, brokers and other distributors – was  
stable at 1 1%, and increased by US$1 .4 billion to 
US$8.2 billion in absolute terms, notwithstanding  
the cyclical headwind from Japanese redemptions 
described above. Developing AuM sourced through 
such intermediaries, where the end customers are 
typically retail/high net worth individuals, is one  
of the Group’s strategic objectives.
The appeal of the Emerging Markets asset class  
to investors globally is demonstrated by the Group’s 
continued diverse geographic investor profile, in line 
with the prior period.
Management fees and performance fees
As the Group’s AuM are predominantly US dollar-
based, the majority of management and performance 
fees are also US dollar-denominated. The table  
below sets out AuM, net management fees, net 
management fee margins, and performance fees,  
by theme in US dollars. 
AuM – as invested
The charts on page 24 show AuM ‘as invested’  
by underlying asset class which adjusts from  
‘by mandate’ to take account of the allocation into 
the underlying asset class of the multi-strategy and 
blended debt themes; and of cross-over investment 
from within certain external debt funds. This analysis 
continues to demonstrate the greater significance  
of the local currency and corporate debt themes, 
with the former being the largest single theme on  
an ‘as invested’ basis.
The Group’s AuM ‘as invested’ remains diversified  
by geography, with 29% invested in Latin America, 
29% in Asia Pacific, 12% in the Middle East and 
Africa, and 30% in Eastern Europe. The Emerging 
Markets universe comprises more than 65 countries 
and with substantial opportunities not covered by 
benchmarks, thus highlighting the benefits of being  
a specialist, active manager capable of investing with 
the support of a network of domestic platforms. 
Investor profile 
Investor type
The Group’s AuM is predominantly institutional in 
nature (30 June 2013: 89%; 30 June 2012: 89%) and 
the most significant sub-categories of institutional 
investor are government-related entities and private 
and public pension plans, together accounting for

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Business review continued
Management fees
Management fee income net of distribution costs  
in Sterling terms increased by 4% to £31 1 .2 million  
as a function of increased levels of average  
AuM (FY2012/13: US$72.2 billion; FY201 1/12: 
US$63.9 billion), stable GBP/USD foreign exchange 
rates (FY2012/13: 1 .57 effective; FY201 1/12: 1 .59 
effective) and a reduction in average net management 
fee margins (FY2012/13: 68 bps; FY201 1/12: 74 bps). 
The average net management fee margin reduction 
was the result of a number of factors. Theme and mix 
effects, including the respective weighting of the 
Group’s higher and lower margin themes as they 
were differently affected by flows and performance, 
accounted for 2.5bps of the 6bps movement.  
The margin was also influenced by the winning  
of several relatively large mandates, particularly  
in the local currency theme, which naturally attract  
a lower revenue margin. Specifically, among the  
local currency mandate wins during the period was a 
number of segregated accounts over US$500 million 
in size. These funds earn an appropriate management 
fee margin and are efficient to manage.
Performance fees
T otal performance fee income for the year was  
£33.4 million (FY2011/12: £25.4 million), earned 
across the investment themes and throughout  
the financial year, as the market correction occurred 
late in the period, thus not having an impact on the 
performance fees generated.
At the year end the Group was eligible to earn 
performance fees on only 18% of AuM (30 June 2012: 
30%), or 31% of funds (30 June 2012: 37%). Of these 
funds, 56% (30 June 2012: 54%) of them, while able 
to generate performance fees in the future, were 
ineligible to do so in FY2012/13 either as a result  
of such fees only being available at the end of the 
multi-year fund life, such funds not earning a fee in the 
performance year, or as a result of rebate agreements.
Operating costs and EBITDA margin
The Group has maintained its tightly controlled cost 
structure, with a low proportion of recurring costs 
and a large proportion of variable performance-
related costs. Closing headcount increased from 257 
at 30 June 2012 to 291 at 30 June 2013, with the 
average headcount rising from 251 to 280. The 1 1% 
increase in wages and salaries to £20.0 million 
(FY2011/12: £18.0 million) is consistent with the 
increase in average headcount. There has been 
further recruitment this year to facilitate the future 
growth of the business, with continued focus on  
the expansion and development of our local fund 
management and operational support teams. 
Variable compensation costs represent the majority 
of overall personnel expenses and consist of 
performance-related cash bonuses, share-based 
payments and associated social security costs. 
Variable compensation is calculated as a percentage 
of earnings before variable compensation, interest 
and tax. The rate of variable compensation applied  
in the year to 30 June 2013 increased to 20% 
(FY2011/12: 18%). The higher level of variable 
compensation from the prior year reflects continued 
good performance of the overall business over the 
year, and particularly strong relative investment 
performance and net asset raising.
The five-year trend graphs of total employee 
numbers and total employment costs are shown 
opposite. These demonstrate how the Group’s 
operating model has been maintained.
The overall total for other expenses for the  
year to 30 June 2013 was £44.9 million (FY2011/12: 
£34.4 million) with the principal factor behind the 
year-on-year increase being a higher combined 
charge for amortisation and impairment of intangible 
assets of £16.1 million, described in the Goodwill  
and intangible assets section below, as other costs 
were broadly unchanged. The intangibles impairment 
charge was partially offset by a £10.8 million credit 
resulting from an adjustment to the contingent 
consideration payable for the equities acquisition,  
as described in the Finance income section below.
EBITDA of £252.2 million increased 7% compared 
with the prior year (FY201 1/12: £236.2 million), and 
results in an EBITDA margin of 71% (FY201 1/12: 71%). 
Reclassification of items relating to acquisitions  
and seed capital investments adds clarity and aids 
comprehension, and leads to adjusted EBITDA of 
£249.2 million, an increase of 5% compared with the 
prior year (FY201 1/12: £237 .0 million). The adjusted 
EBITDA margin is 70% (FY201 1/12: 71%). 
Finance income
Included in finance income are items relating to the 
equities acquisition. The main item is a £10.8 million 
credit (FY2011/12: £16.8 million) following an 
adjustment to the contingent consideration payable 
to reflect its fair value at the period end. The 
undiscounted value of the estimated payments  
in respect of the acquisition of AshmoreEMM has 
fallen to £0.6 million (30 June 2012: £12.5 million).  
The amount to be paid for the business will therefore 
be some £85 million less than the maximum possible 
under the terms of the acquisition, reflecting that the 
transaction structure, with its substantial emphasis 
on contingent consideration, provided significant 
protection for the Group and its shareholders.
26 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Also included in finance income are items relating to 
seed capital investments, described in detail below.
Excluding the seed capital and acquisition-related 
items, the Group’s net finance income was  
£1 .6 million (FY2011/12: £2.5 million).
T axation  
Ashmore is committed to paying tax in accordance 
with all relevant laws and regulations and complying 
with all fiscal obligations in the territories in which 
we operate. T o facilitate this, we work to create and 
maintain transparent and open working relationships 
with all tax authorities. As a Group, we aim to 
maximise value for our shareholders and customers 
by managing our businesses in a tax efficient and 
transparent manner, within the remit of the 
applicable tax rules.
The majority of the Group’s profit is subject to  
UK taxation; of the total current tax charge for the 
year of £60.6 million, £56.7 million relates to UK 
corporation tax. The Group’s effective tax rate for  
the year is 21 .74% (FY2011/12: 23.7%) which is less 
than the blended UK corporation tax rate of 23.75% 
(FY2011/12: 25.5%). Account Note 12 provides  
a full reconciliation of this deviation from the blended 
UK corporation tax rate. Key reconciling items relate 
to (i) disallowable expenses relating to accounting 
entries that are not tax deductible; (ii) deferred tax 
credits arising on temporary differences between the 
accumulated amortisation and impairment charges 
booked in relation to certain intangible assets and the 
related tax deductions available; and (iii) current tax 
deductions in respect of share-based awards vesting 
during the period.
There is a £21 .0 million deferred tax asset on the 
Group’s balance sheet at 30 June 2013 (30 June 2012: 
£15.1 million), principally arising as a result of timing 
differences in the recognition of the accounting 
expense and actual tax deductions in connection with 
share price appreciation on share-based awards.
Balance sheet management and cash flow
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a strong balance 
sheet in order to support regulatory capital 
requirements, to meet the commercial demands  
of current and prospective investors, and to fulfil 
development needs across the business which 
include funding establishment costs of distribution 
offices and local asset management ventures, 
seeding new funds, trading or investment in funds  
or other assets and other strategic initiatives.
As at 30 June 2013, total equity attributable to 
shareholders of the parent was £628.7 million,  
as compared to £537 .3 million at 30 June 2012.  
There is no debt on the Group’s balance sheet.
Cash
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents balance 
increased by £48.9 million in the year to  
£395.5 million. The Group continues to generate 
significant cash from operations, totalling  
£280.2 million in the year (FY2011/12: £238.8 million), 
from which it paid the following significant items: 
£110.9 million in cash dividends (FY2011/12:  
£106.9 million); £59.4 million of taxation (FY2011/12: 
£58.2 million); £21 .2 million for net new seed  
capital investments (FY2011/12: £6.2 million); and  
£30.8 million for purchase of own shares to satisfy 
share awards (FY2011/12: £40.8 million).
The Group’s cash balances are invested with the 
objective of optimising returns within a strict 
framework which emphasises capital preservation, 
security, liquidity and counterparty risk. The Group’s 
cash and cash equivalents, comprised of short-term 
deposits with banks and liquidity funds, are 
predominantly held with counterparties with credit 
ratings ranging from A- to AAAm as at 30 June 2013 
(2012: A to AAAm).

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Seed capital investments
As at 30 June 2013 the amount invested was  
£170.6 million (at cost), with a market value  
of £182.2 million (30 June 2012: £140.1 million and 
£148.9 million, respectively). The at-cost investment 
represents 31% of Group tangible equity (30 June 
2012: 32%). During the period the largest seed 
capital investments were made in support of the 
launch of three funds in Indonesia. Several seed 
capital investments made previously were recycled 
profitably during the year.
Further details of the movements of seed capital  
items during the year can be found in note 21 to  
the accounts. In aggregate, taking into account 
consolidated funds, held-for-sale assets, available- 
for-sale assets and non-current asset investments,  
the income statement includes total profits of  
£17 .2 million (FY2011/12: £1 .7 million) related to  
seed capital investments. This comprises operating 
expenses of £0.7 million (FY2011/12: £nil), gains on 
investment securities of £4.9 million (£0.4 million 
loss), third-party interests in consolidated funds  
of £1 .2 million (£0.4 million), finance income of  
£1 .6 million (£1 .3 million) and other gains on seed 
capital investments of £12.6 million (£1 .2 million).
Purchase of own shares
The Group purchases and holds shares through  
an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) in anticipation  
of the exercise of outstanding share options and  
the vesting of share awards. At 30 June 2013 the 
EBT owned 35,205,106 (30 June 2012: 32,668,764) 
ordinary shares.
Goodwill and intangible assets
T otal goodwill and intangible assets on the Group’s 
balance sheet at 30 June 2013 are £84.3 million  
(30 June 2012: £98.1 million). The year-on-year 
decrease of £13.8 million is explained by amortisation 
charges of £5.1 million (FY2011/12: £6.2 million), 
combined with an intangibles impairment charge  
of £11 .0 million (FY2011/12: £1 .2 million), partly offset 
by FX retranslation gains of £2.3 million arising on 
non-Sterling denominated goodwill and intangible 
assets (FY2011/12: £2.3 million). This gain is included 
within the Group’s other comprehensive income.
As described in note 15 to the accounts,  
the intangibles impairment charge comprises  
£1 .6 million in respect of the interim AshmoreEMM 
brand which was replaced in January 2013 by the 
Ashmore brand for the Group’s equities business; 
and a £9.4 million charge in respect of the 
intangible value of fund management relationships 
to reflect the redemptions experienced in the 
equities theme.
Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)
The Group carries on its balance sheet unamortised 
deferred acquisition costs of £0.6 million (FY2011/12: 
£4.7 million) in respect of the launch of Ashmore 
Global Opportunities Limited (AGOL), a publicly listed 
closed-ended investment company incorporated 
in 2007 . 
Market sentiment towards listed vehicles with illiquid 
underlying assets such as AGOL remained weak 
during the year and AGOL ’s shares continued to trade 
at a discount to their NAV . In the light of these factors, 
Ashmore, the AGOL Board and its advisers consulted 
with AGOL shareholders upon a range of proposals 
with the objective of resolving the discount issue  
and delivering a positive outcome for shareholders. 
Subsequently a managed wind down of AGOL  
was proposed and approved by AGOL shareholders  
in March 2013. AGOL has since returned over  
US$100 million to shareholders representing over 
20% of its NAV as at 31 December 2012. Under  
the terms of the wind down, Ashmore is entitled  
to receive a reimbursement of certain launch costs 
which were borne at the time of AGOL ’s IPO in 2007 . 
As at 30 June 2013, US$3.7 million of such costs  
had been reimbursed.
Foreign exchange management
The Group’s long-standing policy is to hedge up to 
two-thirds of the notional value of foreign exchange 
exposure in connection with its net management fee 
cash flows, using either forward foreign exchange 
contracts or options for up to two years forward.  
The GBP/USD exchange rate to 30 June 2013 ranged 
between GBP1 .00:1 .4979 – 1 .6228USD.
The Group experienced an overall foreign exchange 
gain for the year to 30 June 2013 of £4.7 million 
(FY2011/12: £2.8 million gain), comprising a gain  
of £5.9 million (FY2011/12: gain of £2.7 million)  
on the translation of non-Sterling denominated 
assets and liabilities combined with a loss  
of £1 .2 million (FY2011/12: gain of £0.1 million)  
on realised and unrealised hedging transactions. 
The notional level of foreign exchange hedges  
in place at 30 June 2013 is US$141 .0 million.  
This consists of options (US$136.0 million) and 
forwards (US$5.0 million) in respect of FY2013/14 
and FY2014/15 net management fee cash flows. 
The foreign exchange hedges protect the Sterling 
value of US$141 .0 million of the Group’ s forecast 
management fee revenue cash flows for FY2013/14 
and FY2014/15 from being impacted by currency 
movements (outside the contracted ranges for the 
nil-cost option collars). 
Business review continued
28 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The options and forwards have been marked-to-
market at the year-end rate of GBP1:1 .5213USD. 
As designated hedges, the mark-to-market movement 
in the value of the options and forwards will be taken 
through reserves, until such time as they and the 
associated hedged revenues mature, so long as the 
hedges are assessed as being effective. If assessed 
as ineffective, the mark-to-market of the options and 
forwards will be taken through the income statement.
Regulatory capital
As a UK listed asset management group, Ashmore  
is subject to regulatory supervision by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Prudential 
Sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and 
Investment Firms. The Group has one UK-regulated 
entity, Ashmore Investment Management Limited 
(AIML), on behalf of which half-yearly capital 
adequacy returns are filed. AIML held surplus capital 
resources relative to its requirements at all times 
during the period under review.
Further, since 1 January 2007 , the Group has  
been subject to consolidated regulatory capital 
requirements, whereby the Board is required  
to assess the degree of risk across the Group’s 
business, and hold sufficient capital against these.
The Board has assessed the amount of Pillar II  
capital required to cover such risks as £87 .0 million 
(FY2011/12: £65.6 million). Thus, given the 
considerable balance sheet resources available  
to the Group, the Board is satisfied that the  
Group is adequately capitalised to continue its 
operations effectively. 
Further information regarding the Group’s capital 
adequacy status and Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP) can be found in the 
Group’s Pillar III disclosures, which are available  
on our website at www.ashmoregroup.com.
Risk
Risk is inherent in all businesses and is therefore 
present within the Group’s activities. The Group 
seeks to identify, quantify, monitor and manage each 
of its risks effectively. The ultimate responsibility for 
risk management rests with the Board. However, 
from a practical perspective some of this activity is 
delegated and the Group actively promotes a risk 
awareness culture throughout the organisation.
The principal risks, their mitigants, and their delegated 
owners are set out on pages 32 and 33 for each  
of the four risk categories that Ashmore considers 
most important: strategic and business, investment, 
operational, and treasury – with reputational risk being 
a common characteristic across all four categories.
During the year the Group’s risk control framework 
has been enhanced to take account of changing 
business and market conditions, with refinement  
of the Group Risk Matrix, which seeks to identify  
the principal risks to the Group, as well as current 
mitigants and forward-looking action plans.
Further details of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems and reporting are described  
in the Corporate governance report on pages 40 to 46.
Dividend
In recognition of the Group’s financial performance 
during the period, and of our confidence in the 
Group’s future prospects, the Directors are 
recommending a final dividend of 1 1 .75p per share  
for the year ended 30 June 2013, which, subject to 
shareholder approval, will be paid on 6 December 
2013 to those shareholders who are on the register 
on 8 November 2013. 
An interim dividend for the six-month period  
to 31 December 2012 of 4.35p per share  
(31 December 2011: 4.25p per share) was paid on  
12 April 2013. Together, these result in a full-year 
dividend of 16.10p per share (2012: 15.00p per 
share), an increase of 7%.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Corporate social responsibility
Investment
Business Conduct and Integrity
We believe that our reputation as an ethical, 
trustworthy provider of investment services is 
essential to our core purpose of helping our clients to 
build their financial security. We seek to establish and 
maintain long-term relationships with our clients and 
intermediaries. We believe this to be a fundamental 
pre-requisite for the growth of our business. 
Responsible investing across our themes
We aim to ensure that investments we make comply 
with their own industry standards and best practice, 
treat their employees fairly, have active community 
programmes and operate with sensitivity to the 
environment. Ashmore has made investments in  
a number of renewable energy projects in different 
countries including hydro-electricity, geothermal 
energy and sugar-based ethanol production. 
Investments have also been made in a Middle East 
based technology company which provides systems 
products and services for the reduction and recycling 
of waste and the preservation, protection and 
restoration of the environment; and, in China, in a 
company which makes batteries for electric vehicles, 
principally for use in buses. These investments  
on behalf of our clients reflect our overall approach  
to combining ethical investing with sound 
business practice. 
Amongst the initiatives we are undertaking  
in South America, we have established an 
Environmental and Social Management System 
(ESMS) for the management of investments  
of a new investor fund in Colombia within the 
Alternatives investment theme. This fund has  
been developed in a form and substance acceptable 
to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and 
International Finance Corporation (IFC).
Our funds and segregated accounts each have  
a specific investment mandate which sets out  
the parameters for investment. Within our Equities 
and Corporate debt themes we are able to screen 
our client portfolios to meet client requirements for 
geographic, sector and stock specific restrictions. 
Stock specific restrictions may include securities 
which meet clients’ own ESG criteria. 
Examples of investment areas where we can offer 
screening of portfolios based on (or informed by) 
client requirements (using recognised investment 
industry identifiers and coding into our portfolio 
management system) include:
 – Alcohol
 – Animal/Food products
 – Armaments manufacturers or dealers 
 – Gambling
 – Pornography
 – Tobacco
At a geographical level, we also screen across  
all of our investment themes for countries which  
are on the United Nations Sanctions and the US 
Office of Foreign Assets and Control (OFAC) lists.
Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) philosophy 
Public equities
ESG criteria tend to be focused primarily on equity 
investing because of the influence which shareholder 
interests are able to exert on the management of  
a particular company. 
Ashmore believes that the way in which companies 
manage their relations with stakeholders can have an 
impact on business performance. These stakeholders 
encompass employees, local communities, wider 
society, governments, supply chains, customers  
and the natural environment. There is a wide range  
of environmental and social issues which could be 
relevant for a company depending on the industry  
in which it operates and its specific business profile. 
Environmental and social issues can become  
new sources of risk or opportunities for companies 
and a company’s ability to respond to these issues 
can therefore act as an early signal of long-term 
competitiveness. T o the extent practicable, Ashmore 
monitors the environmental, social and corporate 
governance performance of the companies in which 
it invests through ongoing company visits and other 
information channels.
A COMBINATION OF ETHICAL 
INVESTING WITH SOUND  
BUSINESS PRACTICE
34 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Generally, companies disclose corporate governance 
practices through corporate policies, stock market 
listings (for example, Brazil’s stock exchange has  
a separate category for companies committed  
to corporate governance best practice) and market 
press releases. They disclose environmental and 
social practices in annual reports and other reports  
to investors. 
As a global investor, Ashmore recognises that 
legislation and best practice standards vary among 
countries and regions, and that they must remain 
sensitive to these differences. However, at  
a minimum, Ashmore expects the companies  
in which it invests to comply with the national 
legislation that applies to them.
Alternatives
Ashmore’s Alternatives investment theme often 
involves our funds taking significant controlling 
stakes in investee companies. In such circumstances 
we are in a position to positively engage with the 
management of these companies. In many cases  
we believe it to be beneficial to our investors  
to be proactive in promoting our brand locally by 
improving the livelihoods of the employees in those 
companies where we have a controlling stake. When 
undertaking initial due diligence on any investments 
within our Alternatives theme our deal memorandum 
checklist takes into account the consideration of ESG 
issues within the investment analysis and decision 
making process, and the investee company’s own 
ESG practices. 
Fixed income
Within our Emerging Market debt segregated 
accounts, we offer clients the flexibility to implement 
their ESG constraints related to specific countries, 
sectors and securities (for example – restricted lists, 
concentration limits etc).
Engagement 
Within mature markets, ethical investing has often 
been portrayed as a ‘negative’ concept i.e., it involves 
a decision not to invest in a certain way. Whilst these 
concepts are well accepted in mature markets we 
believe that they are not necessarily conducive to 
helping emerging economies develop. In the context 
of developing countries we believe that it is also 
possible to apply other concepts such as 
engagement with the ethical investment debate. 
In our public equities theme we believe that good 
corporate governance helps to align the interests  
of company management with those of its 
shareholders. Where possible, we seek to maintain 
constructive dialogue with company management. 
We consider whether companies have corporate 
governance frameworks that are in line with 
applicable country codes and serve shareholder 
interests. Views on corporate governance do not
 constrain investment decisions however; often the 
best investments can be in companies where we 
anticipate an improvement in corporate governance 
practices. In many jurisdictions, and to the extent 
consistent with our fiduciary duty to our clients,  
we exercise our voting rights as a means to signal 
our views to company management. We have 
developed detailed guidelines to guide our voting 
decisions, but will, as appropriate, consider 
resolutions on a case-by-case basis taking into 
account all available information. 
The majority of our assets continue to be invested  
in either external debt (the majority of which is 
sovereign) or local currencies. In the case of external 
debt investments, our ability to have an influence  
is generally limited to a decision whether or not to 
invest. However, at a country level we believe that  
we are able to exert an influence through dialogue 
with governments and central banks. Engagement 
with a country, as opposed to disengagement, is akin 
to many small pressures every day as opposed to one 
‘big stick’. By remaining engaged over an extended 
period of time it is often possible to have a positive 
influence and to add credibility. 
Where Emerging Markets are concerned therefore, 
we believe that in certain circumstances it may  
be more beneficial to keep investment flowing 
combined with the influence which accompanies  
it in order to continue being able to help a country’s 
population. In country specific terms at the extreme, 
being cut off from capital may allow undemocratic 
rulers to control their people by attributing blame  
for economic problems to foreign actions. Sanctions 
may be counter-productive and may reduce the 
welfare of the population considerably. Hence we 
take investment and engagement/disengagement 
decisions on a case-by-case basis relative to the 
specific circumstances and investment criteria  
in the best interests of our clients.
Proxy Voting and Corporate Actions
Subject to specific mandate restrictions, Ashmore 
is generally responsible for voting proxies and 
taking decisions in connection with proxy voting 
with respect to equities, bonds, loans or other  
debt instruments held by or held on behalf  
of the clients for which it serves as investment 
manager/adviser.
As a global investor, Ashmore recognises that legislation 
and best practice standards vary among countries and 
regions, and that they must remain sensitive to these 
differences. However, at a minimum, Ashmore expects 
the companies in which it invests to comply with the 
national legislation that applies to them.

The Ashmore Foundation:  
Making a positive difference 
The Ashmore Foundation currently has seven priority 
countries (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, India, Indonesia, 
Philippines and Turkey) based on the location  
of Ashmore offices and significant investments,  
as well as the existence of a strong civil sector  
and clear social needs on which the Foundation  
can focus. Supporting locally based NGOs in the 
Emerging Markets reflects Ashmore’s desire to  
‘give back’ to the countries that have contributed  
to its profitability, supporting empowerment and 
local capacity in the Emerging Markets.
The Foundation channels financial support through 
two schemes: 
1 .  Small Grants scheme, providing grants of up to 
£5,000 to a range of eligible charities, throughout 
the Emerging Markets (prioritising Ashmore 
employee recommendations), and
2.  Partnership Grants scheme for larger grants and 
longer-term relationships with strong organisations 
based in priority countries, where their missions 
are clearly aligned with our focus and where there 
is demonstrable evidence of an effective approach. 
Whilst the Foundation does review unsolicited 
proposals which fulfil the eligibility criteria, grantees 
– particularly at partnership level – are primarily 
sourced or recommended and invited to apply 
following research to ensure a strong match.  
All organisations are assessed using a standard 
process as outlined below: 
UK Stewardship Code
Details on how, and the extent to which, Ashmore complies with the 
principles of the UK Stewardship Code are described separately on the 
Ashmore website at:
https://www.ashmoregroup.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance
Where Ashmore is given responsibility for proxy 
voting and corporate actions, it will take reasonable 
steps under the circumstances to ensure that 
proxies are voted in the best interests of its clients. 
Protecting the financial interests of its clients is the 
primary consideration for Ashmore in determining 
how to protect such interests. This generally means 
proxy voting with a view to enhancing the value  
of the securities held by or on behalf of Ashmore’s 
clients, through maximising the value of securities, 
taken either individually or as a whole. 
The Ashmore Foundation’ s assessment process  
is designed to review a whole organisation – taking 
into consideration management, strategies, activities, 
results, resources and accountability – before 
considering any specific projects proposed for funding. 
The level and depth of due diligence is proportionate  
to the size of the grant under consideration.
In addition to the Ashmore Foundation’ s Small  
and Partnership Grants programme, the Ashmore 
Foundation supports through a funding partnership 
the STARS Foundation, which provides awards  
to a handful of exceptional frontline NGOs changing 
the lives of children in developing countries each  
year from thousands of applications. This strategic 
partnership brings together the resources of the 
Ashmore Foundation with the expertise of the STARS 
Foundation in sourcing, assessing and awarding  
‘the best’ local NGOs working worldwide to solve 
global challenges, and shining a light on the hallmarks 
of effective NGO practice. The collaboration has 
enabled the sharing of methodologies, capabilities  
and resources and has highlighted new co-funding 
opportunities. We are delighted that this partnership 
which began in 2012 has enabled both the STARS 
Foundation and the Ashmore Foundation to reach 
more outstanding organisations in more locations, 
impacting more lives.
The Foundation is supported solely by Ashmore and 
its employees globally. Crucially, this support from 
employees extends beyond financial aid through  
to active engagement in fundraising and a network  
of support which includes mentoring and helping 
NGOs expand their network of contacts.
Through the Ashmore Foundation, close to  
£1 .85 million has been donated/committed to more 
than 45 charitable causes throughout the Emerging 
Markets since inception in 2008. In 2012 alone, 
grants from the Ashmore Foundation benefited  
more than 40,000 underprivileged community 
members with a range of services and support.
Employees
At year end Ashmore employed approximately  
300 people in 1 1 countries worldwide. Ashmore’s 
people have always been its most important asset,  
at the heart of everything it does. Ashmore has many 
talented people and it remains a priority to develop, 
manage and retain this talent in order to deliver the 
potential of the organisation. Ashmore wants to be 
an employer which the most talented people aspire 
to join wherever it operates.
36 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Ashmore seeks to ensure that its workforce reflects, 
as far as practicable, the diversity of the many 
communities in which it is located. Ashmore  
also recognises the diverse needs of its employees 
in managing the responsibilities of their work  
and personal lives, and believes that achieving  
an effective balance in these areas is beneficial  
to both the Company and the individual. 
Ashmore encourages employees to act ethically and 
to clearly uphold the standards of practice which its 
clients have come to expect. It also means ensuring 
that its employees understand the strategic aims and 
objectives of the Group and are clear about their role 
in achieving them.
The Group recognises that the involvement  
of its employees is key to the future success  
of the business and adopts a practice of keeping 
employees informed on significant matters affecting 
them, via email and in meetings arranged for the 
purpose. The Group has consistently operated  
a remuneration strategy that recognises both 
corporate and individual performance.
The Group is also committed to following good 
practice in employment matters, recognising the part 
this plays in attracting and retaining staff. The Group 
promotes the importance of high ethical standards  
to all employees and staff have the opportunity  
to voice any concerns they may have, either direct 
with management or on a confidential basis via the 
whistle-blowing process.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to ensuring that all 
employees are treated fairly and with dignity and 
respect. This commitment is reflected in the Staff 
Handbook that all employees receive on joining. 
The policies and practices in place within the Group  
to deter acts of harassment and discrimination are 
regularly monitored. 
It is the Group’s policy that no employee shall be 
treated less favourably on the grounds of their age, 
sex, sexual orientation, race, religion, nationality  
or marital status or on the grounds of disability.  
This policy applies, without limitation, to promotion, 
training, placement, transfer, dismissal, remuneration, 
grievance and disciplinary procedures and 
decisions. This policy also applies to persons  
from outside the workplace and the treatment  
of contract workers.
Health and safety
The Group has in place a global health and safety 
policy which can be accessed by all staff via an 
internal database. The aim of this policy is to provide 
both staff and visitors with a safe and healthy 
working environment. The Group is committed  
to adhering to the high standards of health and  
safety set out by its policies and procedures  
and to providing training as necessary.
Environment
As an investment manager, Ashmore has a limited 
direct impact upon the environment and there  
are few environmental risks associated with the 
Group’s activities. Ashmore does not own any  
of the buildings where it occupies floorspace and 
invariably buildings in which it does have a lease are 
multi-tenanted and costs are apportioned to each 
tenant pro-rated according to occupancy. Ashmore’s  
largest property occupancy is at its headquarters  
at 61 Aldwych, London, and where it occupies  
a single floor of approximately 19,000 square feet  
in a nine storey multi-tenanted building.
Water and gas supplied into the building are metered 
centrally by the building management and costs 
apportioned to each tenant pro rata according to 
floor occupancy.
Electricity usage in London is separately monitored 
by floor with renewable energy accounting for a 
minimum of 10% of supply. Energy efficient lighting 
is installed in the building with sensors which  
turn lights off when no movement is detected.  
The building has received an Energy Performance 
Certificate with an Asset Rating of 98. 
New website for the 
Ashmore Foundation
2013 saw the launch of a dedicated 
Ashmore Foundation website. The site 
is designed to help increase the 
efficiency of the grant process by 
explaining the different application 
stages and by providing a simple online 
form for potential grantees. 
Importantly the site also allows the 
Foundation to showcase its grantees. 
We hope that the short case studies  
of beneficiaries will help NGOs to  
share best practices and also hopeful 
applicants will better understand  
the types of projects funded by  
the Foundation.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Emissions reporting
As of 1 October 2013 all companies listed on the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange will have 
to report their Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHGs)  
in their Annual Report after 30 September 2013. 
Ashmore will be one of the organisations required to 
report Scope 1 and 2 emissions for its reporting year 
1 July 2013-30 June 2014. Ashmore has however 
chosen to present the required emissions data in  
this report for the current reporting year in advance 
of the obligations coming into effect. Further details 
on emissions reporting can be found in the CSR 
report on our website at www.ashmoregroup.com.
Air travel accounts for the greatest amount of overall 
emissions (2,099 tonnes CO
2
e, 78%). Nearly 20%  
of Ashmore’s emissions come from purchased 
electricity across the business (543 tonnes CO
2
e). 
Natural gas, refrigerants, water and waste account 
for the lowest level of emissions, though it is noted 
that data was not available for all offices for 
these categories.

published annually by Defra. https://www.gov.uk/measuring-
and-reporting-environmental-impacts-guidance-for-businesses
Corporate social responsibility continued
Emissions have also been calculated using an 
‘intensity metric’, which will enable Ashmore to 
monitor how well we are controlling emissions  
on an annual basis, independent of fluctuations in 
the levels of their activity. As Ashmore is a ‘people’ 
business, the most suitable metric is ‘emissions  
per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee’. Ashmore’s 
emissions per person are shown in the table below.

Travel
Although we endeavour to make maximum use of 
available technology, such as video conferencing, our 
business model as an investor in Emerging Markets 
inevitably requires that our investment professionals 
and other members of staff travel frequently to these 
countries to investigate and monitor opportunities.
Recycling
Ashmore has in place recycling programmes  
for waste paper, photocopier toners and other 
disposable materials.We seek to minimise the  
use of paper as part of our clear desk policy  
and electronic scanning is actively encouraged.  
All printing is two sided by default. 
At Ashmore we are conscious of minimising  
our impact on the environment. For this reason, 
wherever possible we choose paper stocks that  
have been sustainably sourced and which are Forest 
Stewardship Council© (FSC) accredited (or equivalent) 
for our marketing materials and business stationery.
Ashmore provides obsolescent computers  
to Computer Aid International (Computer Aid),  
a UK registered charity that aims to reduce poverty 
through practical ICT solutions. Computer Aid sends 
these PCs to various projects across Africa and 
South America and furnishes Ashmore with details 
of where they are used. Any units that are not 
usable are disposed of in an environmentally 
friendly fashion.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Corporate Governance
Chairman’s introduction
In May 2010 the FRC published a new edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code which applies to financial 
years beginning on or after 29 June 2010. 
The Group has been in compliance with the Code and 
its predecessor versions since Admission to listing  
on the London Stock Exchange on 17 October 2006, 
except where the Directors consider that in particular 
limited circumstances, departure may be justified 
and explained. 
No departures from the Code occurred during the year 
under review.
A new edition of the Code was published in September 
2012 and applies to reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 October 2012. 
The Group has chosen to adopt the new provisions  
in the revised Code for the year under review and 
references to ‘the Code’ in this Annual Report are to the 
2012 version of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
This report describes the Group’s corporate governance 
arrangements, explaining how it has applied the 
principles of the Code.
Michael Benson
Chairman

Committee
40 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 In considering Non-executive Director independence, 
the Board has taken into consideration the guidance 
provided by the Code. The Board considers Michael 
Benson, Nick Land, Melda Donnelly, Simon Fraser, 
Charles Outhwaite and Dame Anne Pringle to  
be independent. Nick Land is the Senior 
Independent Director.
During the year under review the Group complied 
with the Code requirement that at least half of the 
Board consist of independent Directors (excluding 
the Chairman).
Biographical details of the Directors are given  
on page 39. 
The Board meets a minimum of six times during  
the year to review financial performance and strategy 
and to follow the formal schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision. Comprehensive Board 
papers, comprising an agenda and formal reports  
and briefing papers, are sent to Directors in advance 
of each meeting. Throughout their period in office, 
Directors are continually updated by means of 
written and verbal reports from senior executives 
and external advisers on the Group’s business,  
and the competitive and regulatory environments  
in which it operates, as well as on legal, corporate 
governance, corporate social responsibility and other 
relevant matters.
In addition to its formal business, the Board received 
a number of briefings and presentations from 
executive management during the year covering a 
wide range of topics across the range of the Group’s 
business. All Directors have access to independent 
professional advice, if required, at the Company’s 
expense as well as to the advice and services of  
the Company Secretary. New Directors appointed  
to the Board will receive advice as to the legal and 
other duties and obligations arising from the role  
of a director of a UK listed company within a full, 
formal and tailored induction programme. The 
Company Secretary, under the direction of the 
Chairman, is responsible for maintaining an adequate 
continuing education programme, reminding the 
Directors of their duties and obligations on a regular 
basis, ensuring good information flows between  
the Board, its committees and management and 
assisting with Directors’ continuing professional 
development needs. 
The Company’s Nominations Committee  
considers the appointment and replacement  
of Directors subject to the rules set out in the 
Articles, a summary of which is set out below. 
Under the Articles, the minimum number of 
Directors shall be two and the maximum shall be 
nine. Directors may be appointed by the Company  
by ordinary resolution or by the Board. A Director 
appointed by the Board must offer himself/herself  
for election at the next Annual General Meeting of 
the Company following his appointment but he is not 
taken into account in determining the Directors or 
the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation 
at that meeting. 
The Directors to retire by rotation must be those 
who held office at the time of the two preceding 
Annual General Meetings and did not retire at either 
of them or if they have held office with the Company 
for a continuous period of nine years or more at  
the date of the Annual General Meeting. The office 
of Director shall be vacated in other circumstances, 
including where (i) that Director resigns or is asked  
to resign; (ii) they are or have been suffering from 
mental ill health; (iii) they are absent without 
permission of the Board from meetings of the  
Board for six consecutive months; (iv) they become 
bankrupt or compound with their creditors generally; 
or (v) they are prohibited by law from being a 
Director. Notwithstanding these provisions the  
Board has adopted provision B.7 .1 of the Code and 
therefore all Directors will retire and seek re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting on 30 October 2013.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles, the Companies 
Acts and any directions given by the Company by 
special resolution, the business of the Company  
is managed by the Board, who may exercise all 
powers of the Company, whether relating to the 
management of the business of the Company or not.
Annual performance evaluation
The Code recommends that the Board should 
undertake a formal annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its committees and 
individual Directors and that an externally facilitated 
evaluation should be undertaken at least once every 
three years. An independent externally facilitated 
evaluation was undertaken by Condign Board 
Consulting (which has no other connection with the 
Company) in the reporting year FY201 1/12. For the 
year under review the Board conducted an internal 
evaluation of its own performance and that of its 
committees and individual Directors led by the 
Chairman and assisted by the Company Secretary. 
Meetings were held between each Director and  
the Chairman in which issues and developments 
over the year were discussed and performance was 
considered by reference to the objectives of the 
Board and its committees. The issues raised during 
this process were discussed by the Board together. 
The Non-executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Non-executive Director also evaluated 
the performance of the Chairman and gave feedback 
which was also reflected in the Board discussion. 
41 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Corporate Governance continued
The Board believes that, following the completion  
of the performance evaluation, the performance of 
the Directors continues to be effective and that they 
continue to demonstrate commitment to their roles.
Any Directors who are not members of Board 
Committees are also invited to attend meetings  
of such Committees as necessary.
Board committees
The Board has appointed Audit and Risk, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees  
to assist in the execution of its duties.
All of these committees operate within written terms 
of reference, which are reviewed annually. The terms 
of reference of the committees are reviewed  
annually consistent with changes in legislation  
and best practice. 
The chairman of each committee reports regularly  
to the Board. 
Each of the committees is authorised, at the 
Company’s expense, to obtain external legal or other 
professional advice to assist in carrying out its duties. 
Only the members of each committee are entitled  
to attend its meetings but others, such as senior 
management and external advisors, may be invited 
to attend as appropriate.
Current membership of the committees is shown  
in the relevant sections below. The composition  
of these committees is reviewed annually, taking 
into consideration the recommendations of the 
Nominations Committee.
Audit and Risk Committee
During the year under review the Audit and Risk 
Committee comprised the following Non-executive 
Directors and was fully compliant with the Code:

and thereafter Nick Land, Melda Donnelly and Simon 
Fraser had and have recent and relevant commercial

Fraser has previously served as Global Chief 
Investment Officer with Fidelity International.
A report on the activities of the Audit and

Relations with shareholders
The Company places great importance on 
communication with its investors and aims  
to keep shareholders informed by means of regular 
communication with institutional shareholders, 
analysts and the financial press throughout the year. 
Annual and interim reports and trading updates  
are widely distributed to other parties who may  
have an interest in the Group’s performance.  
These documents are also made available on  
the Company’s website where formal regulatory 
information service announcements are also posted. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance 
Director make regular reports to the Board on 
investor relations and on specific discussions with 
major shareholders and the Board receives copies  
of all research published on the Company. 
The 2013 Annual General Meeting will be attended 
by all Directors, and the Chairmen of the Audit and 
Risk, Nominations and Remuneration Committees 
will be available to answer questions. Private 
investors are encouraged to attend the Annual 
General Meeting.
The Senior Independent Director is available  
to shareholders if they have concerns which  
contact through the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer or Group Finance Director 
has failed to resolve or for which such contact  
is inappropriate. The Company continues to offer 
major shareholders the opportunity to meet any  
or all of the Chairman, the Senior Independent 
Director and any new Directors. 
The Group will announce via a regulatory information 
service the number of proxy votes cast on 
resolutions at the Annual General Meeting and any 
other general meetings.
Internal control and risk management
In accordance with the principles of the Code, the 
Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems and for 
reviewing their effectiveness. Such systems and their 
review are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives,  
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Within the Group’s over-arching corporate 
governance framework, through which the Board 
aims to maintain full and effective control over 
appropriate strategic, financial, operational and 
compliance issues, an internal control framework has 
been established, against which the Company is able 
to assess the effectiveness of its risk management 
and internal control systems. The Group’s system  
of internal control is embedded within its routine 
operations, and a strong control culture is combined 
with clear management responsibility and 
accountabilities for individual control. The internal 
control framework provides an on-going process  
for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s 
principal risks, and has been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of approval of the 
annual report and accounts. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board, and accords with the 
guidance in the document ‘Internal Control: Revised 
44 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, 
October 2005’ (T urnbull Guidance) published  
by the Financial Reporting Council.
The Executive Directors oversee the key risks  
and controls and the risk management process  
on a day-to-day basis, and have put in place an 
organisational structure with clearly defined lines  
of responsibility and delegation of authority. 
The Group’s Risk and Compliance Committee (RCC), 
which meets monthly, is responsible for maintaining 
a sound risk management and internal control 
environment and for assessing the impact of the 
Group’s ongoing activities on its regulatory and 
operational exposures. The RCC is chaired by the 
Group Head of Risk Management and Control – the 
other members are the Chief Executive, the Group 
Finance Director, the Group Head of IT , Operations 
and Performance Management, the Group Head  
of Compliance, the Group Head of Information 
T echnology, the Group Head of Legal and T ransaction 
Management the Group Head of Finance, the Group 
Head of Distribution and the Group Head of Internal 
Audit. Responsibility for risk identification is shared 
amongst these senior management personnel, with 
each such individual being responsible for day-to-day 
control of risk in their business area.
There are established policies and procedures to 
enable the Board, through its regular meetings, to 
monitor the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control systems, which cover all 
significant identified internal and external strategic, 
operational, financial, compliance and other risks, 
including the Group’s ability to comply with all 
applicable laws, regulations and clients’ requirements. 
The Board receives regular financial and other 
management information related to the control  
of expenditure against budget and the making  
of investments, and for monitoring the Group’s 
business and its performance, and regular 
compliance and risk reports. 
The Board has conducted an annual review and 
assessment of the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems, and  
has identified no significant failings or weaknesses 
during this review. In conducting this review, the 
Board has considered the periodic reports received 
throughout the year on compliance and risk matters, 
including reports provided by the internal audit 
function, and the annual report on risk management 
and internal control processes from the RCC. The 
Board is satisfied that appropriate planned actions 
continue to be effective in improving controls as the 
Group develops, and its overall assessment of the 
control framework continues to be satisfactory.
The main features of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems are as follows:
Policies
 – core values and policies together comprising  
the Group’s high level principles and controls,  
with which all staff are expected to comply;
 – manuals of policies and procedures, applicable to 
all business units, with procedures for reporting 
weaknesses and for monitoring corrective action;
 – a code of business conduct, with procedures  
for reporting compliance therewith; and
 – a defined operational framework and 
organisational structure with appropriate 
delegation of authority with accountability that  
has regard to acceptable levels of risk.
Processes
 – a planning framework is maintained, which 
incorporates a Board approved strategic plan,  
with objectives for each business unit;
 – an in-depth annual budget is reviewed and 
approved by the Board and is regularly subject to 
update through a formal re-forecasting process;
 – regular reviews of the performance of the Company 
and its subsidiaries are undertaken by senior 
management to proactively manage progress 
against the delivery of the Group’ s strategic plan;
 – detailed investment reports are prepared and 
discussed at each of the sub-committee meetings 
of the Group’s Investment Committee, which take 
place weekly or monthly depending on investment 
theme, with follow up actions agreed and 
implemented within a strict operational framework;
 – oversight of the valuation methodologies used for 
clients’ fund investments that cannot be readily 
externally priced is the responsibility of the Group’s 
Pricing Methodology and Valuation Committee 
(PMVC) which meets monthly to review the 
current valuation methodology for each of these 
investments and to propose an updated valuation 
methodology where appropriate;
 – quarterly senior management systems and controls 
reviews are undertaken by the Group Finance 
Director with the Group Head of Compliance, and 
the Group Head of Risk Management and Control 
in which the Chief Executive Officer participates at 
least annually and which are also coordinated and 
documented by the Group Company Secretary. 
These reviews include evaluation of the potential 
impact and likelihood of identified risks and 
possible new risk areas;

 – a matrix of top risks identifies key business, 
operational, financial and compliance risks, and 
considers the likelihood of those risks crystallising 
and the resultant impact. The inherent risk within 
each business activity has been identified, with 
the adequacy and mitigating effect of existing 
processes being assessed to determine a current 
residual risk level for each such activity. On the 
basis that further mitigants may be employed over 
time, a target residual risk for each activity after 
one to two years has been defined and progress 
to target is formally tracked;
 – key risk indicator (KRI) statistics are reported to and 
analysed by the RCC. The KRIs indicate trends in the 
Group’s risk profile, assist in the reduction of errors 
and potential financial losses and seek to prevent 
exposure by proactively dealing with a potential risk 
situation before an event actually occurs; 
 – strong financial controls are maintained to ensure 
accurate accounting for transactions, appropriate 
authorisation limits to contain exposures, and 
reliability of data processing and integrity of 
information generated;
 – Board members receive monthly management 
information including accounts and other  
relevant reports, which highlight actual financial 
performance against budget/forecast and prior 
year period;
 – there are well-defined procedures governing the 
appraisal and approval of corporate investments, 
including seeding of funds and purchase of own 
shares, with detailed investment and divestment 
approval procedures, incorporating appropriate 
levels of authority within a framework of set limits, 
and regular post-investment reviews;
 – oversight and management of the Group’s foreign 
currency cash flows and balance sheet exposures 
are the responsibility of the FX Management 
Committee which determines the appropriate 
level of hedging required and appropriate 
accounting treatment;
 – the Group has secure information and 
communication systems capable of capturing 
relevant and up to date information by relevant 
personnel, with oversight and direction provided 
by the Group’s IT Steering Group, which 
implements the IT strategy, establishing and 
overseeing the operation of all IT projects;

46 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Audit and Risk Committee report
The composition and summary terms of reference  
of the Audit and Risk Committee are set out on 
pages 42 and 43.
The principal activities of the Audit and Risk 
Committee through the year, and the manner in which 
it discharged its responsibilities, were as follows:
Financial statements 
The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the 
FY2012/13 Annual Report, Interim Results, 
Preliminary Results and reports from the external 
auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, on the outcome of their 
reviews and audits in 2013.
Significant accounting matters
During the year the Committee considered key 
accounting issues matters and judgements in 
relation to the Group’s financial statements and 
disclosures relating to:
i) The carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets. 
As more fully explained in note 15 on page 91  
the goodwill balance within the Group relates 
principally to the acquisition of Emerging Markets 
Management LLC (EMM) in May 2011 . During the 
year ended 30 June 2013 the Committee critically 
reviewed the analyses performed by management 
on goodwill and intangibles and agreed with the 
adjustments made to intangibles and that no 
impairment to goodwill was necessary. 
ii) Assessment of contingent 
consideration in relation to EMM. 
Ashmore acquired a 62.94% equity stake in EMM  
in May 201 1 for which initial and future consideration 
was payable under an earnout provision contingent 
on the achievement of agreed milestone targets. The 
Committee has reviewed the accounting valuations 
of the contingent consideration and assessed it to  
be nil as measured at 31 May 2013.
iii) The accounting treatment relating to the 
acquisition of a minority interest in China
Following the acquisition of a 49% stake in Ashmore-
CCSC Fund Management based in China, the 
Committee considered IAS 28 (Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures) and determined that 
the newly formed entity would be treated as a joint 
venture using the equity method of accounting.
iv) Seed capital investments 
The Committee reviewed and considered a report 
from management on the change in treatment of 
seed capital classified as held-for-sale investments  
as defined by IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement). Gains and losses 
associated with seed capital classified as held for 
sale are reflected in the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income.
v) Share-based payments
It is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee 
to address, and report upon, compensation matters 
including share-based payments made to directors 
and employees of the Group. The Audit and Risk 
Committee considers in its review of the financial 
statements and receives a report from the external 
auditors on the quantification and accounting 
treatment related to such payments which are 
explained in note 10 of the accounts.
vi) Future IFRS and UK GAAP 
developments
The Committee has received a report from 
management and discussed future accounting 
developments likely to affect the presentation  
of the Group’s financial statements.
vii) Revenue recognition
During the year the Committee received a 
management report from the external auditors 
regarding the processing of fee rebates and its 
treatment on revenue recognition. The method of 
accounting for revenue recognition is described more 
fully on pages 81 and 83 in the notes to the accounts.
viii) Other accounting matters
During the year, the Committee received 
communications from management and from  
the external auditor on other accounting matters 
including tax strategy, revenue recognition and 
overseas reporting.
UK Corporate Governance Code
Following the early adoption by the Company  
of the revised version of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, which applies to financial years commencing  
on or after 1 October 2012, the Board requested that  
the Committee advise them on whether it believes  
the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’ s performance, business model and strategy.
External auditor 
The external auditors attend all meetings of the 
Committee. It is the responsibility of the Committee 
to monitor the performance, objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor. The Committee 
discusses and agrees the scope of the audit plan  
for the full year and the review plan for the interim 
statement with the auditors.
The external auditors provide reports at each 
Committee meeting on topics such as the  
control environment, key accounting matters and 
mandatory communications. The Committee also 
received a comprehensive presentation from the 
auditor demonstrating to its satisfaction how their 
independence and objectivity is maintained when 
providing non-audit services. 
47 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements The Committee has agreed the types of permitted 
and non-permitted non-audit services and those 
which require explicit prior approval. All contracts  
for non-audit services in excess of £25,000 must  
be notified to the Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee and approved by him. 
During the year the value of non-audit services 
provided by KPMG amounted to £0.6 million 
(FY201 1/12: £0.5 million). Whilst non-audit services  
as a proportion of audit services amount to 
approximately 120%, the overall quantum of non-audit 
services is not considered to be material given that 
Ashmore operates within a highly regulated market 
and that a significant proportion of the non-audit 
services provided relate to the following matters: 
 – reporting on our half-year financial statements; 
 – providing regular assurance reports to the FCA  
(as the regulator of Ashmore Investment 
Management Limited); 
 – the provision of tax compliance services;
 – acting as reporting accountant in appropriate 
circumstances provided there is no element  
of valuation work involved; 
 – reporting on internal controls as required under 
ISAE 3402 pursuant to investment management 
industry standards;
 – auditing the controls and procedures employed by  
the Company relating to the production of investment 
performance figures over one, three and five year 
periods to conform to the investment management 
industry’ s Global Investment Performance Standards. 
The assurance provided by the Group auditor on the 
items listed above are considered by the Committee  
to be strictly necessary in the interests of the business 
and, by their nature, these services could not easily  
be provided by another professional auditing firm. 
The provision of tax advisory services, due diligence/
transaction services and litigation services may be 
permitted with the Committee’ s prior approval. The 
provision of internal audit services, valuation work and 
any other activity that may give rise to any possibility of 
self-review are not permitted under any circumstance. 
During the year there were no circumstances where 
KPMG Audit Plc was engaged to provide services 
which might have led to a conflict of interests. 
From time to time during the year the Non-executives 
met with the external and internal auditors without  
the Executive Directors being present so as to provide 
a forum to raise any matters of concern in confidence. 
The Committee also received a report from the 
independent KPMG team responsible for the audits  
of the Ashmore publicly traded funds. 
KPMG have acted as the auditor to the Company since 
the IPO in October 2006 and the lead audit partner 
rotates every five years to assure independence. The 
Audit and Risk Committee report continued
Committee recognises the new requirement in the Code 
that the external audit contract be put out to tender at 
least every ten years. The Committee continues to be 
satisfied with the work of KPMG and that they continue 
to remain objective and independent. The Committee has 
therefore recommended to the Board that a resolution be 
put to shareholders for the re-appointment of the auditor, 
and their remuneration and terms of engagement, at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company. 
Internal controls and risk management 
The Group Head of Risk Management and Control 
attends each meeting of the Committee and provides 
reports to each. These reports have addressed a 
number of risk related topics and have demonstrated 
how the output of the different Investment, Risk & 
Compliance and Pricing and Valuation Methodology 
Committee discussions throughout the period have 
been effective in highlighting, tracking and contributing 
towards managing key market, counterparty risk and 
operational risk. In particular, in relation to operational 
risk, the Committee has also reviewed and discussed 
the Group’s T op Risk Matrix which continues to serve 
as an effective tool to highlight and monitor the principal 
risks of the Group and its continued evolution, and 
reflects changes in the business profile of the Group 
and the corresponding impact to internal controls and 
related processes. 
The Committee also received an interim report on, and 
conducted a review and evaluation of, the system of 
internal controls and risk management operated within 
the Company pursuant to the Financial Reporting Council 
guidance, ‘Internal Controls: Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code’ (formerly the T urnbull 
Guidance), prior to review by the Board.
Internal audit
Ernst & Y oung have acted as internal auditor since  
1 July 2009 reporting directly to the Committee. The 
Committee has received reports on its findings and 
programme of reviews at each of its meetings during 
the course of the year. During the year the Committee 
decided to move to an internally resourced Internal 
Audit function and this was completed in July 2013 
with a handover process and timetable agreed with 
Ernst & Y oung. 
Audit and Risk Committee effectiveness
The members of the Committee conducted a review 
of its effectiveness and concluded that it was working 
effectively. In FY201 1/12 an independently facilitated 
review of the effectiveness of the Board, its 
Committees and the Directors was conducted in 
accordance with provision B.6.2 of the Code.

accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable

with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the  
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and  
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, 
Directors’ remuneration report and corporate 
governance statement that comply with that law  
and those regulations.

as a whole, provides the information necessary  
to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy and is fair, balanced and

development and performance of the business 
and the position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Directors’ report continued
Purchase of own shares
In the year under review the Company did  
not purchase any of its own shares for treasury.  
The Company is, until the date of the next Annual 
General Meeting, generally and unconditionally 
authorised to buy back up to 70,666,510 of its own 
issued shares. The Company retains a total of 
5,368,331 shares for T reasury which were acquired 
at an average price of 129 pence per share. The 
Company is seeking a renewal of this authority  
at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
Power to issue and allot shares
The Directors are generally and unconditionally 
authorised to allot unissued shares in the Company 
up to a maximum nominal amount of £23,579.08 
(and £47 ,158.16 in connection with an offer by way  
of a rights issue). 
A further authority has been granted to the  
Directors to allot the Company’s shares for cash,  
up to a maximum nominal amount of £3,556.58, 
without regard to the pre-emption provisions of the 
Companies Acts. No such shares have been issued 
or allotted under these authorities, nor is there any 
current intention to do so, other than to satisfy 
outstanding obligations under the employee share 
schemes where necessary.
These authorities are valid until the date of the  
next Annual General Meeting. A resolution for  
the renewal of such authorities will be proposed  
at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
Employees
Details of the Company’s employment practices 
(including the employment of disabled persons)  
can be found in the CSR Report on pages 34 to 38.
Carey Pensions and Benefits Limited as trustee  
of the Ashmore 2004 Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
has discretion as to the exercise of voting rights  
over shares which it holds in respect of unallocated 
shares, namely those shares in which no employee 
beneficial interests exist. The current arrangement  
is that the EBT will consider a recommendation(s) 
before voting such shares at a general meeting of 
the Company, subject to an overriding duty to act in 
the interests of the class of beneficiaries of the EBT .
Corporate governance
The Company is governed according to the 
applicable provisions of company law and by  
the Company’s Articles. As a listed company, the 
Company must also comply with the Listing Rules 
and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued by 
the United Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA). Listed 
companies are expected to comply as far as possible 
with the Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate 
Governance Code, and to state how its principles 
have been applied. A report on corporate governance 
and compliance with the provisions of the Code is 
set out on pages 40 to 46. 
Board diversity
The Board has noted the recommendations  
of the Davies Report issued in February 201 1 relating 
to Board diversity. The Nominations Committee 
considers diversity, including the balance of skills, 
experience, gender and nationality, amongst many 
other factors, when reviewing the appointment of 
new Directors but does not consider it appropriate  
to establish targets or quotas in this regard. The Board 
currently consists of two executive and six non-
executive directors of whom two are women thereby 
constituting 25% female representation. 
The Nominations Committee may from time to time 
engage the services of an external search consultant 
for the purpose of seeking new candidates for Board 
membership, conditional upon such consultant 
having no connection to the Company. 
Charitable and political contributions
During the year, the Group made charitable 
donations of £0.1 million (FY2011/2012: £0.1 million). 
The work of the Ashmore Foundation is described  
in the corporate social responsibility section of this 
report on page 36. It is the Group’s policy not to 
make contributions for political purposes.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy and practice in the UK is to  
follow its suppliers’ terms of payment and to make 
payment in accordance with those terms subject  
to receipt of satisfactory invoicing. Unless otherwise 
agreed payments to creditors are made within  
30 days of receipt of an invoice. At 30 June 2013,  
the amount owed to the Group’s trade creditors in 
the UK represented approximately 26 days’ average 
purchases from suppliers (FY2011/12: 30 days).
52 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Auditors and the disclosure  
of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval 
of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they 
are each aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and 
each Director has taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as Directors to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
Resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditor  
and to authorise the Directors to agree their 
remuneration. Note 11 to the financial statements 
sets out details of the auditor’s remuneration.

Remuneration Committee Chairman’s summary statement
I am pleased to present the Remuneration report for the year to 30 June 2013. 
As shareholders will be aware, Ashmore has a 30 June year end, and as a result  
is not required to comply with the new regulations governing disclosure of 
Directors’ remuneration until 2014. However, the Remuneration Committee has 
chosen to present this year’ s report in accordance with the disclosure 
requirements under the new regulations.
Ashmore’s successful team-based approach to investment management is well 
supported by our Remuneration Policy; Executive Directors, members of the 
investment team, and indeed all other employees, participate in a single capped 
incentive pool and all employees are long-term shareholders in the business. 
Ashmore’ s Remuneration Policy has remained unchanged since the listing of the 
business in 2006, and has always been closely aligned to the interests of both 
clients and shareholders. The policy includes:
• A capped basic salary, at £100,000 for Executive Directors, to contain the fixed 
cost base;
• A cap on the total variable compensation available for all employees as a 
percentage of profits, which has yet to be fully utilised; and,
• A deferral for five years of a substantial portion of variable compensation into 
Company shares (or equivalent), which, in the case of Executive Directors are 
also subject to additional performance conditions measured over five years.
As described in detail in other sections of the Annual Report, Ashmore has made 
substantial progress during the year in building a more diversified business, with 
solid performance across the Group. AuM increased by 22% to US$77 .4 billion, 
and despite tougher market conditions towards the year end, investment 
performance remains very good with 92% of AuM outperforming benchmarks 
over three years. The combination of these results has led to solid financial 
performance, with an EBITDA margin of 71% and profit before tax increasing by 
6% to £257 .6 million. We are also continuing to make progress in developing our 
support functions, although there is still more to do in this area. Notwithstanding 
the progress made over the year, there is much to do to capture the diverse 
growth opportunities presented by Emerging Markets. 
This performance is reflected in the variable compensation received by employees 
including the Executive Directors for the year under review, with variable 
compensation as a percentage of earnings before variable compensation, interest 
and tax (VC/EBVCIT) being 20% (FY 201 1/12: 18%). 
Annual bonuses for Executive Directors were on average 45% higher than in the 
prior year.
As in previous years, there have been no increases in base salary for the two 
Executive Directors – they remain capped at £100,000.
The Directors Remuneration Policy for the forthcoming year is set out in the first 
section of the report. 
The Committee would welcome your support for our Remuneration report.
Y ours sincerely
Nick Land
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
54 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors Remuneration Policy
Considerations elsewhere in the company
The Company applies a consistent remuneration 
philosophy for employees at all levels. 
The cap on base salary means that Executive 
Directors’ base salaries are set at the same level as 
other senior investment and professional employees 
in the Company, and the base salary range from 
lowest to highest in the Company is considerably 
narrower than the market norm.
All employees are eligible for a performance-related 
annual bonus, and the principle of bonus deferral  
into Company shares or equivalent applies to annual 
bonuses for all employees who have at least one  
full year’s service.
Rates of pension contribution and fringe benefit 
provisions are consistent between executives and 
other employees within each country where the 
Company operates. 
The Company does not operate formal employee 
consultation on remuneration. However, employees 
are able to provide direct feedback on Remuneration 
Policy to their line managers or the Human 
Resources department. The Committee monitors 
the effectiveness of the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy in recruiting, retaining, engaging and 
motivating employees, and receives reports from 
the Chief Executive Officer on how the Company’s 
remuneration policies are viewed by employees  
and whether they are meeting business needs.
The Committee does not seek to apply fixed ratios 
between the total remuneration levels of different 
roles in the Company, as this would prevent it from 
recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in a 
highly-competitive employment market. However, 
the base salary multiple between highest and lowest 
paid UK-based employee in the Company is less  
than 4x (pre-tax).
Future policy table
The table overleaf summarises the key aspects  
of the Company’s Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors effective from 1 July 2013.  
This policy remains unchanged from the year  
ended 30 June 2013. 
This section of the Remuneration report has  
been prepared in accordance with Part 4 of The 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013. It sets out the Remuneration Policy for the 
Company. The Policy has been developed taking  
into account the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 and shareholders’ executive 
remuneration guidelines. The Policy Report is not 
required to be subject to a binding shareholder  
vote in 2013; the first binding vote on Ashmore’s 
remuneration policy will take place in 2014. 
Policy overview
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) 
determines and agrees with the Board, the 
Company’s policy on the remuneration of the  
Board Chairman, Executive Directors and other 
members of executive management including 
employees designated as Code Staff under the  
FCA ’s Remuneration Code. The Committee’s terms 
of reference are available on the Company’s website.
In determining the Remuneration Policy, the 
Committee takes into account the following: 
 – the need to attract, retain and motivate talented 
Executive Directors and senior management
 – consistency with the remuneration approach 
applied to Ashmore employees as a whole
 – external comparisons to examine current market 
trends and practices and equivalent roles in 
similar companies taking into account their size, 
business complexity, international scope and 
relative performance; 
 – the requirements of the Remuneration Code  
of the UK financial services regulator
How the views of shareholders are taken 
into account
The Committee regularly compares the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy with shareholder guidelines, 
and takes account of the results of shareholder votes 
on remuneration.
If any material changes to the Remuneration Policy 
are contemplated, the Committee chairman consults 
with major shareholders about these in advance. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution 
to approve last year’s Remuneration report are 
provided in the annual report on remuneration 
section of this report.

Maximum

Base salary
(Fixed pay)
Provides a level of fixed 
remuneration sufficient 
to permit a zero bonus 
payment should that  
be appropriate. The cap 
on base salary helps to 
contain fixed costs.
 Base salaries are capped. The current cap  
is £100,000.
The cap is reviewed 
periodically; the Policy 
permits the cap to be 
changed if this is deemed 
necessary to meet 
business, legislative or 
regulatory requirements.
Fringe benefits
(Fixed pay)
Provide cost-effective 
benefits, to support the 
wellbeing of employees.
The Company currently provides fringe benefits such  
as medical insurance and life insurance. In the event of 
relocation of an executive, the Company could consider 
appropriate relocation assistance. Specific benefits 
provision may be subject to minor change from time  
to time, within this policy.
Fringe benefits are not 
subject to a specific cap, 
but represent only a small 
percentage of total 
remuneration. 
Pension
(Fixed pay)
Provides a basic level of 
Company contribution, 
which employees can 
supplement with their 
contributions.
Company contributions are made, normally on a defined 
contribution basis, either to a pension plan or in the form  
of an equivalent cash allowance.
The current level of 
Company contribution  
is 7% of base salary.  
The contribution level  
is reviewed periodically;  
the Policy permits the 
contribution rate to be 
amended if necessary.
Variable 
compensation
(Discretionary)
Rewards performance 
and aligns executives 
closely with other 
shareholders.
Executive Directors are considered each year for a 
discretionary variable pay award
1
 depending on personal 
and Company performance, by applying a range of 
performance indicators such as growth in AuM, investment 
performance, profits, and strategic and operational 
achievements. The variable pay award comprises: a cash 
bonus (part of which may be voluntarily deferred); and a 
long-term incentive in the form of both a restricted share 
award and a matching share award on any voluntarily 
deferred cash bonus:
1. Cash bonus (60% of total award).  
The executive may voluntarily commute up to half  
the cash bonus in return for the same value in  
a Bonus Shares award (or phantom equivalent) deferred 
for five years. The deferred shares are eligible for 
matching shares subject to performance conditions 
(see 3 opposite).
Directors Remuneration Policy continued
1 .  Executives may request to waive any portion of their total award, and the Committee will then consider a request from the executive for an appropriate equivalent 
donation to a registered charity or charities.

Long-term incentives under The Company Executive 
Omnibus Incentive Plan – (Omnibus Plan):
2. Restricted shares award (40% of total award).  
This is compulsorily deferred into Company shares  
(or phantom equivalent) for a period of five years.  
This deferred portion is subject to performance 
conditions on vesting, and does not qualify for 
matching. The Policy permits the Committee to  
set the performance conditions for each award.  
The performance condition for the most recent award 
was relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured 
against an asset management peer group, measured 
over five years. Zero vests below median TSR; 25%  
of the award vests at median; 100% vests at upper 
quartile (straight-line proportionate vesting between 
median and upper quartile).
3. Matching shares awarded on the voluntarily 
commuted cash bonus (from 1 above).  
Matching is provided on the voluntarily commuted  
cash bonus, subject to the same performance condition 
as that described in 2 above. The maximum match used 
to date on any award made under the current policy 
was one-for-one; the policy permits the matching level 
to be changed for future awards but not to exceed 
three-for-one.
 Dividends or dividend equivalents on the total number  
of Restricted, Matching and Bonus share (or phantom 
equivalent) awards will be accrued and paid out at the 
time the award vests and to the extent of vesting.  
For awards made prior to 2013 the dividend or dividend 
equivalent payments are made on shares in full, under 
previous commitments made to participants; this policy 
was changed by the committee with effect from awards 
made in 2013.
 In addition to the TSR condition described above, 
‘claw-back’ can be applied to the long-term incentive 
components during the five-year deferral period, if 
performance has been materially misstated or there  
is gross misconduct.
 The Remuneration Policy permits the award of deferred 
remuneration in alternative forms such as share 
options, although none has been granted in recent 
years, and to vary the percentage split of award 
between cash and share awards to meet business, 
legislative or regulatory requirements.
The aggregate variable 
compensation pool for  
all employees including 
executives is capped, 
currently at 25% of 
earnings before variable 
compensation, interest  
and tax (EBVCIT). The policy 
permits the Committee  
to vary this cap if necessary 
to meet business needs. 
The policy is not to  
cap individual variable 
compensation awards 
(other than indirectly 
through the impact of  
the aggregate pool cap),  
as this is not market 
practice for most of the 
Company’s peer group  
and would make the 
Company uncompetitive.
The high proportion of 
variable compensation 
deferral, with vesting  
after five years and subject 
to on-going performance 
conditions, encourages  
a prudent approach to risk 
management, in support  
of the Company’s risk and 
compliance controls.
57 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors compared to other employees
The Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is generally 
consistent with that for employees across the Company as a 
whole. However, there are some differences which the Committee 
believes are necessary to reflect the different responsibilities of 
employees across the Company. Below executive director level, 
whilst the same deferral policy applies, the deferred portion of  
the variable pay award and any matching shares on the voluntarily 
commuted cash bonus, are not subject to the relative TSR 
performance condition. 
External Non-executive Director positions
Executive directors are permitted to serve as Non-executive 
Directors of other companies where there is no competition  
with the Company’s business activities and where these duties  
do not interfere with the individual’s ability to perform his duties  
for the Company. Neither of the Executive Directors currently  
has such appointments.
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance  
of the Company’s business, any fees received are remitted  
to the Company. If the appointment is not connected to the 
Company’s business, the Executive Director is entitled to retain  
any fees received. 
Approach to remuneration for new executive 
director appointments
The remuneration package for an externally recruited new 
executive director would be set in accordance with the terms  
and maximum levels of the Company’s approved remuneration 
policy in force at the time of appointment. 
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or 
share-based elements when it considers these to be in the  
best interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders).  
In considering any such payments the Committee would take 
account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former 
employer and the nature, vesting dates and any performance 
requirements attached to the relinquished remuneration. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the  
time of appointment. 
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded  
in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to 
its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.  
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing  
prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put  
to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity. 
For external and internal appointments, the Company may  
meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Service contracts and loss of office payment policy
Service contracts normally continue until the director’s agreed 
retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. The service 
contracts contain provision for early termination. Notice periods are 
limited to 12 months by either party. Service agreements contain 
no contractual entitlement to receive variable pay; participation  
in these arrangements is at the Committee’s discretion.
If the employing company terminates the employment of an 
executive director without giving the period of notice required 
under the contract, the executive director would be entitled  
to claim recompense for up to one year’s remuneration subject  
to consideration of the director’s obligation to mitigate the loss. 
Such recompense is expected to be limited to: base salary due  
for any unexpired notice period; any amount assessed by the 
Committee as representing the value of other contractual benefits, 
and pension, which would have been received during the period.  
In the event of a change of control of the Company there is no 
enhancement to these terms.
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months
T ermination payment in the  
event of termination by the 
Company without due notice
Base salary plus value of benefits 
(including pension) paid monthly 
and subject to mitigation.
Change of control Same terms as above  
on termination.
Any outstanding share-based entitlements granted to an 
executive director under the Company’s share plans will  
be determined based on the relevant plan rules. The default 
treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation  
of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, 
such as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances  
at the discretion of the Committee (taking into account the 
individual’s performance and the reasons for their departure) 
‘good leaver’ status can be applied. 
An Executive Director’s service contract may be terminated without 
notice and without any further payment or compensation, except 
for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence  
of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy report includes authority  
for the Company to honour any commitments entered into  
with current or former directors that have been disclosed to 
shareholders in previous Remuneration reports. Details of any 
payments to former directors will be set out in the implementation 
section of this report as they arise.
Reward scenarios
The Company’s Policy results in the majority of the remuneration 
received by the Executive Directors being dependent on  
Company performance. 
As noted earlier, the policy is not to cap individual awards, but 
rather the aggregate pool. As such it is not possible to demonstrate 
minimum, target and maximum remuneration levels. In lieu of this, 
Figure 2 illustrates the minimum (fixed) remuneration, and provides 
an indication of the potential range of total remuneration using the 
highest and lowest variable pay awards in a rolling five-year period 
and assuming full vesting, five years later, of the long-term 
incentive components based on upper quartile TSR.

The Board Chairman is paid a single fee for  
all his responsibilities. The level of the fee is 
reviewed periodically by the Committee, with 
reference to market levels in comparably sized 
FTSE companies, and a recommendation is  
then made to the Board (without the Chairman 
being present). 
The current fee for the Chairman is 
£150,000 but is subject to review 
periodically under this Policy. 
Non-executive

The Non-executives are paid a single inclusive

The fee levels are reviewed periodically by the 
Chairman and Executive Directors.
The current fee for Non-executive 
Directors is £60,000, but is  
subject to review periodically  
under this Policy.
Non-executive Directors are engaged under letters of appointment 
and they do not have contracts of service. They are appointed for  
an initial three-year period, subject to annual shareholder re-election. 
Their continued engagement is subject to the requirements of the 
Company’s Articles relating to the retirement of directors by rotation. 
The letters of appointment are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office during normal business hours. 
There is an aggregate cap on fees for the Chairman and  
Non-executive Directors which is currently set at £500,000.  
As a result of the increased number of Non-executive Directors  
on the board, it is the Company’s intention to increase this cap  
to £750,000 at the 2013 AGM.
Compliance with the Remuneration Code
The Committee regularly reviews its remuneration policy’s 
compliance with the principles of the Remuneration Code  
of the UK financial services regulator, as applicable to Ashmore.  
The remuneration policy is designed to be consistent with the 
prudent management of risk, and the sustained, long-term 
performance of the Company.

1. Benefits for Executive Directors include membership of the Company medical scheme.
2. Long-term incentives vesting relates to awards with performance conditions where the performance period has ended in the relevant financial year and payments 
of dividends or dividend equivalents on such awards.
3. In respect of the year ended 30 June 2012, Mark Coombs chose to waive 10% of any element of his potential variable remuneration award in return for the  
Remuneration Committee considering and approving a contribution to charity or charities nominated by himself. The ‘Cash bonus’, ‘Voluntarily deferred share 
bonus’ and ‘Total bonus’ figures are shown excluding the amount waived. 
4. Mark Coombs’ and Graeme Dell’s variable compensation is made up of 60% cash bonus and 40% deferred restricted share or restricted phantom awards. They 
may commute up to 50% of their cash bonus in favour of an equivalent amount of bonus share or bonus phantom awards and an equivalent value in matching 
share or matching phantom awards. All share or phantom awards will be reported in the Directors’ share award and phantom award tables in the year of grant.
As described in detail in other sections of the Annual Report, 
Ashmore has made substantial progress during the year ending  
30 June 2013 in building a more diversified business, with solid 
performance across the Group. AuM increased by 22% to  
US$77 .4 billion,and despite tougher market conditions towards  
the year end investment performance remains very good with 92% 
of AuM outperforming their benchmarks over three years. The 
combination of these results has led to solid financial performance, 
with an EBITDA margin of 70% and profit before tax increasing  
by 6% to £257 .6 million.
For additional information, Figure 6 shows the history of financial 
results for the last five years.

Long-term incentive scheme interests awarded 
during the year ended 30 June 2013
Figure 7 below provides details of the long-term incentive awards 
that were made during the year. These were made within the 
Directors Remuneration Policy, and represent the mandatory 
deferral of 40 per cent of Executive Directors’ bonus award for  
the year ended 30 June 2012 into Restricted Shares award, and  
the Matching Award on the voluntarily commuted portion of cash 
bonus in respect of year ended 30 June 2012.
Both the Restricted shares and Matching shares awards vest  
on the fifth anniversary of the award date, to the extent that the
relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition  
is met. TSR is measured relative to an asset management peer 
group. The TSR vesting scale and peer group are shown in Figures 
8 and 9 respectively. TSR is a well established and recognised 
performance measure, which aligns the interests of the Executive 
Directors with those of shareholders. In the absence of any other 
dedicated emerging markets investment management companies, 
a comparator group of 18 companies has been selected from the 
global investment management sector. The Committee reviews the 
peer group periodically to take account of de-listings, new listings 
or other sector changes that are relevant.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy 
in the year commencing 1 July 2013
The Committee intends to continue to apply broadly the same 
metrics and weightings to annual variable remuneration as in the 
year ended 30 June 2013. 
For long-term incentive awards (Restricted Shares, Matching Shares 
and their Phantom equivalents), the Committee intends to apply the 
same relative TSR performance metric as used the previous year, 
subject to any changes to the peer group that may be necessary  
to take account of de-listings, new listings or other sector changes 
that are relevant.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee are listed in the table below.  
All of these are independent Non-executive Directors, as defined 
under the Corporate Governance Code, with the exception of the 
Company Chairman who was independent on his appointment. 
Remuneration Committee attendance
Number of meetings attended out of 
potential maximum
Nick Land 100%

 The Company’s CEO attends the meeting by invitation and 
assists the Committee in its deliberations, except when his 
personal remuneration is discussed. No Directors are involved  
in deciding their own remuneration. The Company Secretary acts  
as Secretary to the Committee. Other executives may be invited  
to attend as the Committee requests.
External advisors
The Remuneration Committee received independent advice  
from New Bridge Street (NBS) consultants throughout the  
period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. NBS abides by the 
Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct, which requires  
it to provide objective and impartial advice. NBS fees for the year 
ending 30 June 2013 were £30,344. The Company participates in 
the McLagan Partners compensation survey from which relevant 
data is provided to the Remuneration committee. Neither of the 
above provide other services to the Company.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 
Opinion on financial statements  
We have audited the financial statements of Ashmore Group plc 
for the year ended 30 June 2013 set out on pages 70 to 109. In 
our opinion:  
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the  
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs  
as at 30 June 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year  
then ended;  
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by  
the EU);  
– the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and  
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation.  
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Group financial 
statements the risks of material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our Group audit were as follows: 
– Revenue – as detailed in the summary of significant 
accounting policies in page 81 and the Audit and Risk 
Committee report on pages 47 to 48, revenue consists of 
primarily management fees and performance fees, both net  
of rebates to investors. Performance fees and fee rebates  
are considered significant audit risks due to the quantum and 
the complexity of some performance fees and fee rebates 
agreements and calculations.  
We performed a recalculation of performance fees earned 
during the year on a sample basis to determine whether they 
had been calculated in accordance with the fee agreements. 
This included determining the basis for actual and benchmark 
performance data used in the calculation. We inspected the 
investment management agreements for a selection of clients 
and funds to test whether the information in the fee database, 
used to calculate fees, was complete and accurate.  
For rebates, we assessed the controls around the 
maintenance of terms sheets used to record all clients’ 
entitlement to fee rebates. We also performed a recalculation 
of fee rebates on a sample basis. 
– Seed capital investments – as set out in the summary of 
accounting policies on page 78 and 79, the Group may, from 
time to time, invest in funds that are managed by a Group 
subsidiary. As described in the report from the Audit and Risk 
Committee on pages 47 to 48, the seed capital investments 
may be consolidated or classified as either held-for-sale (HFS) 
or as one of two types of financial assets – available-for-sale 
(AFS) or fair-value-through-profit-and-loss (FVTPL). 
The classifications, which depend on judgments about 
subjective matters particularly in relation to HFS, may make  
a material difference to the financial statements. If a fund is 
consolidated, the fund’s gross assets are included in the 
Group financial statements on a line-by-line basis and a liability 
is also recognised representing the third party investors’ 
interests. If classified as HFS, the gross assets would be 
shown as a single line and third party investors’ interests are 
shown as liabilities. If an asset is classified as AFS or FVTPL 
the Group’s holding in the funds is shown as an investment. 
Gains and losses would also be recognised on different basis 
and be presented differently. Appropriate classification is 
therefore a key audit risk.  
We critically assessed the Directors’ rationale for classifying 
seed capital investments as HFS. We considered their plans, 
to reduce Group’s holding in the 12 months following 
acquisition to below the consolidation threshold, against the 
pattern of reduction of Group’s seed capital investments to 
the year end and against our own expectations based on our 
experience. Where, as at the year end, an HFS fund had 
already been held for a significant period we examined the 
changes in holding that occurred in the period and the 
Directors’ specific plans to further reduce the Group’s holding 
against the particular requirements of accounting standards.  
For all investments, we tested Ashmore’s holding in absolute 
and percentage terms to independent third party 
confirmations. We independently priced all the underlying 
investment securities consolidated into the Group financial 
statements using our in-house valuation tool. For HFS 
investments and consolidated funds we also recalculated the 
interest of external investors which is classified as liabilities. 
– Goodwill and intangibles – as detailed in the summary of 
significant accounting policies on pages 78 and 79 and the 
Audit and Risk Committee report on pages 47 to 48, goodwill 
and intangibles are reviewed for impairment using a value in 
use model. Goodwill remained unimpaired; the assessment 
showed there is significant headroom, as set out in note 15 
on page 91. There is less headroom in the intangible asset 
assessment, the outcome of which could vary significantly if 
different assumptions were applied in the model. Therefore 
this is considered a key audit risk.  
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing  
the principles and integrity of the model used, comparison  
of the input assumptions to externally and internally derived 
data as well as our own assessments in relation to key inputs 
such as market performance, subscription/redemption levels 
and fee rates. We assessed the overall consistency of the 
assumptions and of the estimated inputs, including the 
potential risk management bias. We considered the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures (see Note15) in respect of 
impairment testing and whether disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment  
to changes in key assumptions properly reflected the risks 
inherent in the key assumptions and the requirements of 
accounting standards.

– Share-based payments – The Group issues share awards  
to employees under share-based compensation plans. As 
explained in the report of the Audit and Risk Committee on 
pages 47 to 48, the key risk associated with share-based 
compensation arrangements is the quantification of such 
arrangements, as certain assumptions need to be taken into 
account in determining the fair value of those share-based 
compensations that are subject to market-based performance 
conditions. This is therefore the key area we focused on 
during our audit. 
We assessed the Directors’ basis for determining the impact 
of market-based conditions at the start of the vesting period 
(and both equity and cash-settled share-based schemes) and 
at the end of the period (applicable only to the cash-settled 
scheme). We evaluated those assessments (particularly those 
in respect of the cash-settled scheme, which have the greater 
financial effect) in the light of the movement in the share price 
from the start of the relevant vesting period to the year end 
and the total shareholders return of the peer Group over the 
same period. 
For all share-based payments we agreed on a sample  
basis shares granted, exercised and forfeited in the year 
to supporting documentation and, based on that together  
with the assessed market-based performance conditions and 
other inputs, tested the calculation of charges and liabilities. 
We also considered the disclosures in note 10 in relation to 
the schemes.  
Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit  
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £13.0 million. This has been calculated using a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation which we believe  
is the key benchmark used by members of the company in 
assessing financial performance.  
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected 
and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit 
with a value in excess of £0.65 million, in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at the key 
reporting components in the following countries: UK (2 entities) 
and US (1 entity). These audits covered 96% of total Group 
revenue; 94% of Group profit before taxation; and 98% of total 
Group assets.  
The Group audit team performed the audits of the Group 
reporting packs of the UK and the US components in 
accordance with the materiality levels used for local audits, 
which ranged from £0.6 million to £10.1 million.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and  
– the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception  
Under the terms of our engagement we are required to report  
to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or 
the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that 
is otherwise misleading. In particular, we are required to report 
to you if:  
– we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or 
– the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Group Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit and  
Risk Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to  
you if, in our opinion:  
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or  
– the parent company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or  
– we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
– the Directors’ statement, set out on page 53, in relation  
to going concern;  
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages  
40 and 46 relating to the company’s compliance with the  
nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (2010) 
specified for our review; and 
– certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on Directors’ remuneration marked as audited. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 49, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility  
is to audit, and express an opinion on, the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the UK Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of an audit of financial statements performed 
in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland) 
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements  
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.  
The risks of material misstatement detailed in the section  
of this report titled “Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement”, are those risks that we have deemed, in our 
professional judgment, had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in our audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. Our audit 
procedures relating to these risks were designed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. Our opinion 
on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any 
of these risks, and we do not express an opinion on these 
individual risks. 
Materiality is a term used to describe the acceptable level of 
precision in financial statements. Auditing standards describe a 
misstatement or an omission as “material” if it could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of the financial statements. The auditor has to apply 
judgment in identifying whether a misstatement or omission is 
material and to do so the auditor identifies a monetary amount 
as “materiality for the financial statements as a whole”. 
Whilst the audit process is designed to provide reasonable 
assurance of identifying material misstatements or omissions  
it is not guaranteed to do so. Rather the auditor plans the audit 
to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of 
uncorrected and undetected misstatements does not exceed 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole. This testing 
requires us to conduct significant depth of work on a broad 
range of assets, liabilities, income and expense as well as 
devoting significant time of the most experienced members  
of the audit team, in particular the senior statutory auditor,  
to subjective areas of the accounting and reporting process. 
The purpose of this report and restrictions on its use 
by persons other than the members of the Company,  
as a body 
Our report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, in respect of the reporting as if ISA (UK and 
Ireland) 700 (revised June 2013) applied to this reporting period, 
on terms we have agreed with the company. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and, in respect of the reporting as if ISA (UK and 
Ireland) 700 (revised June 2013) applied to this reporting period, 
we have expressly agreed to state to them in our report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members, as a body, for our audit 
work, for our report, or for the opinions we have formed.

– Share-based payments – The Group issues share awards  
to employees under share-based compensation plans. As 
explained in the report of the Audit and Risk Committee on 
pages 47 to 48, the key risk associated with share-based 
compensation arrangements is the quantification of such 
arrangements, as certain assumptions need to be taken into 
account in determining the fair value of those share-based 
compensations that are subject to market-based performance 
conditions. This is therefore the key area we focused on 
during our audit. 
We assessed the Directors’ basis for determining the impact 
of market-based conditions at the start of the vesting period 
(and both equity and cash-settled share-based schemes) and 
at the end of the period (applicable only to the cash-settled 
scheme). We evaluated those assessments (particularly those 
in respect of the cash-settled scheme, which have the greater 
financial effect) in the light of the movement in the share price 
from the start of the relevant vesting period to the year end 
and the total shareholders return of the peer Group over the 
same period. 
For all share-based payments we agreed on a sample  
basis shares granted, exercised and forfeited in the year 
to supporting documentation and, based on that together  
with the assessed market-based performance conditions and 
other inputs, tested the calculation of charges and liabilities. 
We also considered the disclosures in note 10 in relation to 
the schemes.  
Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit  
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £13.0 million. This has been calculated using a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation which we believe  
is the key benchmark used by members of the company in 
assessing financial performance.  
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected 
and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit 
with a value in excess of £0.65 million, in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at the key 
reporting components in the following countries: UK (2 entities) 
and US (1 entity). These audits covered 96% of total Group 
revenue; 94% of Group profit before taxation; and 98% of total 
Group assets.  
The Group audit team performed the audits of the Group 
reporting packs of the UK and the US components in 
accordance with the materiality levels used for local audits, 
which ranged from £0.6 million to £10.1 million.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and  
– the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception  
Under the terms of our engagement we are required to report  
to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the annual report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or 
the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that 
is otherwise misleading. In particular, we are required to report

statement that they consider that the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or 
– the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Group Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit and  
Risk Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to  
you if, in our opinion:  
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or  
– the parent company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or  
– we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:

Notes to the financial statements 
 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 77 
Financial statements Performance Governance 
Strategic overview 
1) General information  
Ashmore Group plc (the Company) is a public limited company 
listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the 
Group) for the year ended 30 June 2013 were authorised for 
issue by the Board of Directors on 9 September 2013. The 
principal activity of the Group is described in the Directors’ 
report on page 50. 
2) Basis of preparation 
The Group and Company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) 
effective for the Group’s reporting for the year ended 30 June 
2013 and applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for 
the measurement at fair value of certain financial assets that are 
available-for-sale or classified as fair value through profit or loss.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 
408 of the Companies Act 2006 which allows it not to present 
its individual statement of comprehensive income and  
related notes.  
The preparation of financial statements requires management  
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect  
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various 
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making 
the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. Further information about key 
assumptions and other key sources of estimation and areas of 
judgement are set out in note 32.  
3) Effects of new and amended IFRSs  
New standard applied 
The following amended IFRS has been adopted by the Group 
and the Company during the year: 
– Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income impacts the Group’s and Company’s 
statements of comprehensive income by requiring the 
grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income 
based on whether or not they will be reclassified to profit or 
loss in future. Adoption of the amendment did not impact 
earnings per share.  
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee has 
recently issued the following new standards and amendments 
which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2014, unless stated otherwise, and have not been 
applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.  
– IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 
which is the first phase of a wider project to replace IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, 
replaces the current models for classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. Financial assets are  
to be classified into two measurement categories: fair value 
and amortised cost. Classification will depend on an entity’s 
business model and the characteristics of contractual cash 
flow of the financial instrument. The standard is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. 
The Group will continue to measure all equity investments  
at fair value with an irrevocable option to recognise through 
equity fair value, gains and losses on equity investments  
that are not held for trading. However, gains and losses 
recognised through equity cannot be subsequently recycled  
to profit or loss on impairment or disposal of the investments 
as is the case for equity investments currently classified as 
available-for-sale.  
As at the time of publication of these financial statements,  
the IASB is re-deliberating the requirements for classification 
and measurement in IFRS 9 while the requirements of latter 
phases of IFRS 9 are in development and therefore remain 
uncertain. The Group continues to monitor developments  
and will provide an impact assessment once the IASB has 
completed the project subject to endorsement by the EU.  
– IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements revises the 
concept of control to relate it to whether an investor has 
exercisable power over an investee and consequently has 
exposure or rights to variable returns. Consolidation 
procedures remain unchanged. 
The expected impact of IFRS 10 is that some funds managed 
by the Group may have to be consolidated, resulting in a 
grossing up of the Group’s assets and liabilities, but with 
minimal net impact on profit or net assets. The Group is 
currently assessing the full impact of the new standard.  
– IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities consolidates 
and enhances disclosure requirements relating to interests  
of an entity in other entities. It includes the disclosure 
requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, 
including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose 
vehicles and unconsolidated structures. 
The new standard is likely to result in increased disclosures 
regarding interests in other entities particularly in respect of 
significant judgments and assumptions made in determining 
control and the nature of, and changes in, the risks associated 
with such interests. The Group is currently assessing the full 
impact of the new standard. 
The following new standards which are relevant for the Group 
are not expected to have a material impact.  
– Amendment to IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation 
provides additional guidance for offsetting financial assets and 
liabilities while amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: 
Disclosures set out corresponding new disclosure 
requirements. The amendment is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

3) Effects of new and amended IFRSs continued 
– IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements requires joint ventures to be 
accounted for using the equity accounting method while  
joint operations are accounted for based on the rights and 
obligations of each party in the arrangement. 
– IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement aims to improve consistency 
and reduce complexity by providing guidance on how to 
measure fair value where fair value is required or permitted 
across IFRSs and enhances disclosures requirements 
(effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013).  
4) Significant accounting policies 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied 
consistently where applicable to all years presented in dealing 
with items which are considered material in relation to the Group 
and Company financial statements, unless otherwise stated.  
Basis of consolidation  
These financial statements consolidate the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are those 
entities, including investment funds, over which the Company 
has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial  
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control  
is transferred to the Group until the date that control ceases. 
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or 
income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from 
the effective date of acquisition.  
Based on their nature, the interests of third-parties in funds that 
are consolidated (consolidated funds) are classified as liabilities 
and appear as ‘Third-party interests in consolidated funds’ in  
the Group’s balance sheet.  
The Group has an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) that acts  
as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based 
compensation plans. Accordingly, the EBT is included within  
the Group and Company financial statements.  
Associates and joint ventures 
Associates are partly owned entities over which the Group has 
significant influence but no control. Joint ventures are entities 
through which the Group and other parties undertake an 
economic activity which is subject to joint control. 
Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are 
recognised using the equity method of accounting. Under this 
method, the investments are initially recognised at cost, 
including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for 
the post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets. 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income.  
Where the Group’s financial year is not coterminous with those  
of its associates or joint ventures, unaudited interim financial 
information is used after appropriate adjustments have been made. 
Foreign currency translation  
The Group’s financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling (Sterling), which is also the Company’s functional  
and presentation currency. Items included in the financial 
statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured  
using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates; the functional currency. Transactions 
in foreign currencies are translated by the Group’s entities at  
the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the 
prevailing exchange rate. Foreign exchange differences  
arising on translation are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date  
of the transaction.  
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including 
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation,  
are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rates  
ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses  
of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at rates 
approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the  
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences  
arising on translation are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method (acquisition accounting). The cost of a business 
combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date  
of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
equity instruments issued by the acquirer and the amount  
of non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The fair value of  
a business combination is calculated at the acquisition date  
by recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their 
fair values at that date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed 
as incurred. The acquisition date is the date on which the 
acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the  
acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition  
date. Subsequently, changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration that is deemed to be a liability will be recognised 
in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss. If the contingent 
consideration is classified as equity, it will not be re-measured. 
Goodwill 
The cost of a business combination in excess of the fair value  
of net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, including intangible 
assets identified, is recognised as goodwill and stated at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill has an indefinite 
useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually  
for impairment or when there is an indication of impairment.  
Intangible assets 
The cost of intangible assets, such as management contracts 
and brand names, acquired as part of a business combination 
are their fair value as at the date of acquisition. The fair value  
at the date of acquisition is calculated using the discounted cash

3) Effects of new and amended IFRSs continued 
– IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements requires joint ventures to be 
accounted for using the equity accounting method while  
joint operations are accounted for based on the rights and 
obligations of each party in the arrangement. 
– IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement aims to improve consistency 
and reduce complexity by providing guidance on how to 
measure fair value where fair value is required or permitted 
across IFRSs and enhances disclosures requirements 
(effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013).  
4) Significant accounting policies 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied 
consistently where applicable to all years presented in dealing 
with items which are considered material in relation to the Group 
and Company financial statements, unless otherwise stated.  
Basis of consolidation  
These financial statements consolidate the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are those 
entities, including investment funds, over which the Company 
has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial  
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control  
is transferred to the Group until the date that control ceases. 
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or 
income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from 
the effective date of acquisition.  
Based on their nature, the interests of third-parties in funds that 
are consolidated (consolidated funds) are classified as liabilities 
and appear as ‘Third-party interests in consolidated funds’ in  
the Group’s balance sheet.  
The Group has an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) that acts  
as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based 
compensation plans. Accordingly, the EBT is included within  
the Group and Company financial statements.  
Associates and joint ventures 
Associates are partly owned entities over which the Group has 
significant influence but no control. Joint ventures are entities 
through which the Group and other parties undertake an 
economic activity which is subject to joint control. 
Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are 
recognised using the equity method of accounting. Under this 
method, the investments are initially recognised at cost, 
including attributable goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for 
the post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets. 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income.  
Where the Group’s financial year is not coterminous with those  
of its associates or joint ventures, unaudited interim financial 
information is used after appropriate adjustments have been made. 
Foreign currency translation  
The Group’s financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling (Sterling), which is also the Company’s functional  
and presentation currency. Items included in the financial 
statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured  
using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates; the functional currency. Transactions 
in foreign currencies are translated by the Group’s entities at  
the foreign exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the 
prevailing exchange rate. Foreign exchange differences  
arising on translation are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date  
of the transaction.  
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including 
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation,  
are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rates  
ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses  
of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at rates 
approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the  
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences  
arising on translation are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method (acquisition accounting). The cost of a business 
combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date  
of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
equity instruments issued by the acquirer and the amount  
of non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The fair value of  
a business combination is calculated at the acquisition date  
by recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their 
fair values at that date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed 
as incurred. The acquisition date is the date on which the 
acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the  
acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition  
date. Subsequently, changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration that is deemed to be a liability will be recognised 
in accordance with IAS 39 in profit or loss. If the contingent 
consideration is classified as equity, it will not be re-measured. 
Goodwill 
The cost of a business combination in excess of the fair value  
of net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, including intangible 
assets identified, is recognised as goodwill and stated at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill has an indefinite 
useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually  
for impairment or when there is an indication of impairment.  
Intangible assets 
The cost of intangible assets, such as management contracts 
and brand names, acquired as part of a business combination 
are their fair value as at the date of acquisition. The fair value  
at the date of acquisition is calculated using the discounted cash

flow methodology and represents the valuation of the net 
residual revenue stream arising from the management contracts 
and brand name in place at the date of acquisition.  
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at  
cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised, if appropriate, over their useful 
lives which have been assessed as being between 31 months 
and 10 years.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  
Cost is determined on the basis of the direct and indirect costs 
that are directly attributable. Property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful lives, assessed to be five years for office equipment and 
four years for IT equipment. The residual values and useful lives 
of assets are reviewed at least annually. 
Deferred acquisition costs 
Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment 
management contract are deferred if they can be identified 
separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they  
will be recovered. Deferred acquisition costs represent  
the contractual right to benefit from providing investment 
management services and are charged as the related revenue  
is recognised. 
Financial instruments 
Recognition and initial measurement 
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of an instrument, initially  
at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets 
classified at fair value through profit or loss. Purchases or sales 
of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the 
date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive 
cash flows from the investments have expired or been 
transferred or when the Group has transferred substantially  
all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are 
derecognised when the obligation under the liability has been 
discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Subsequent measurement 
The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends 
on their classification in accordance with IAS 39. 
Financial assets 
The Group may, from time to time, invest in funds where an 
Ashmore Group subsidiary is the investment manager or an 
advisor (seeding). Where the holding in such investments is 
deemed to represent a controlling stake and is acquired 
exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or 
dilution, these seed capital investments are recognised as non-
current financial assets held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5 
Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations. 
The Group recognises 100% of the investment in the fund as  
a “held-for-sale” asset and the interest held by other parties as 
a “liability held-for-sale”. Where control is not deemed to exist, 
and the assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as 
available-for-sale financial assets. Where the assets are not 
readily realisable, they are recognised as non-current asset 
investments. If a seed capital investment remains under  
control of the Group for more than one year from the original 
investment date, the underlying fund is consolidated line by line. 
Investment securities 
Investment securities represent listed securities, other than 
derivatives, held by consolidated funds. These securities are 
held at fair value with gains and losses recognised through  
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Non-current financial assets held-for-sale 
Non-current financial assets held-for-sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell 
except where measurement and re-measurement is outside  
the scope of IFRS 5. Where investments that have initially been 
recognised as non-current financial assets held-for-sale, because 
the Group has been deemed as holding a controlling stake, are 
subsequently disposed of or diluted such that the Group’s 
holding is no longer deemed a controlling stake, the investment 
will subsequently be classified as an available-for-sale  
financial asset. Subsequent movements will be recognised  
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for the  
newly adopted classification.  
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are either financial assets 
allocated specifically to this category or are financial assets that 
cannot be assigned to any other category. They are carried at 
fair value and changes in fair values are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or 
impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is included in profit 
for the year as part of comprehensive income.  
Other fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) financial assets 
FVTPL financial assets include non-current asset investments 
and derivatives. 
(i) Non-current asset investments 
Non-current asset investments include closed-end funds which 
are classified as FVTPL. They are held at fair value with changes 
in fair value being recognised through the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. Fair value is assessed  
by taking account of the extent to which potential dilution of 
gains or losses may arise as a result of additional investors 
subscribing to the fund where the final close of a fund has  
not occurred. 
(ii)  Derivatives 
Derivatives include foreign exchange forward contracts and 
options used by the Group to manage its foreign currency 
exposures and those held in consolidated funds.  
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
on which a derivative contract is entered and subsequently 
 re-measured at fair value. Transaction costs are recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. All 
derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is 
positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives are taken directly in profit or loss, except for the 
effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised  
in other comprehensive income.

Trade and other receivables  
Trade and other receivables are initially recorded at fair value 
plus transaction costs. The fair value on acquisition is normally 
the cost. Impairment losses with respect to the estimated 
irrecoverable amount are recognised through the statement of 
comprehensive income when there is appropriate evidence that 
trade and other receivables are impaired. However, if a longer-
term receivable carries no interest, the fair value is estimated  
as the present value of all future cash payments or receipts 
discounted using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. 
The resulting adjustment is recognised as interest expense or 
interest income. Subsequent to initial recognition these assets 
are measured at amortised cost less any impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash represents cash at bank and in hand and cash equivalents 
comprise short-term deposits and investments in money market 
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Financial liabilities 
Non-current financial liabilities held-for-sale 
Non-current financial liabilities represent interests held by other 
parties in funds in which the Group recognises 100% of the 
investment in the fund as a held-for-sale financial asset. These 
liabilities are carried at fair value with gain or losses recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income within finance 
income or expenses. 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL include derivative financial 
instruments and third-party interests in consolidated funds.  
They are carried at fair value with gains or losses recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income within finance income 
or expense. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities including trade and other payables are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. 
Fair value estimation 
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange or dealt on any 
other regulated market that operates regularly, recognised and 
open to the public, are valued at the last known available closing 
bid price. If a security is traded on several actively traded and 
organised financial markets, the valuation is made on the basis 
of the last known bid price on the main market on which the 
securities are traded. In the case of securities for which trading 
on an actively traded and organised financial market is not 
significant, but which are bought and sold on a secondary 
market with regulated trading among security dealers (with the 
effect that the price is set on a market basis), the valuation may 
be based on this secondary market.  
Where instruments are not listed on any stock exchange or not 
traded on any regulated markets, valuation techniques are used 
by valuation specialists. These techniques include the market 
approach, the income approach or the cost approach for which 
sufficient and reliable data is available. The use of the market 
approach generally consists of using comparable market 
transactions or using techniques based on market observable 
inputs, while the use of the income approach generally consists 
of the net present value of estimated future cash flows, 
adjusted as deemed appropriate for liquidity, credit, market 
and/or other risk factors.  
Investments in open-ended funds are valued on the basis  
of last available NAV of the units or shares of such funds. 
The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price  
at the balance sheet date. 
Hedge accounting 
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the 
transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria.  
To qualify, the following conditions must be met: 
– formal documentation of the relationship between the 
hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s) must exist at 
inception; 
– the hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must 
present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could 
ultimately affect profit and loss; 
– the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; and 
– the hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness 
assessed on an ongoing basis. 
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of  
the effective hedging instrument is initially recognised in other 
comprehensive income and is released to profit for the year as 
part of comprehensive income in the same period during which 
the relevant financial asset or liability affects profit or loss.  
Where the hedge is highly effective overall, any ineffective 
portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in profit and 
loss. Where the instrument ceases to be highly effective as a 
hedge, or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting  
is discontinued. 
Impairment 
General 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is 
recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital. For an asset that does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss  
is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used  
to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.

 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2013 81 
Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is 
an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based on management’s judgements regarding the future 
prospects of the business, estimates of future cash flows and 
discount rates. When assessing the appropriateness of the 
carrying value of goodwill at year end, the recoverable amount is 
considered to be the greater of fair value less costs to sell or 
value in use. The pre-tax discount rate applied is based on the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital after making 
allowances for specific risks.  
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with 
asset allocations, research and other such operational practices 
reflecting the commonality of approach across all fund themes. 
Therefore, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, 
the Group is considered to have one cash-generating unit to 
which all goodwill is allocated and, as a result, no further split  
of goodwill into smaller cash-generating units is possible and  
the impairment review is conducted for the Group as a whole. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees  
and other revenue. Revenue is recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income as and when the related services are 
provided. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Specific revenue recognition 
policies are: 
Management fees 
Management fees net of rebates are accrued over the period  
for which the service is provided. Where management fees are 
received in advance these are recognised over the period of the 
provision of the asset management service.  
Performance fees 
Performance fees net of rebates relate to the performance of 
funds managed during the period and are recognised when the 
quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable 
that the fee will crystallise. This is usually at the end of the 
performance period or upon early redemption by a client. 
Other revenue 
Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and 
administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs 
incurred by the Group. This revenue is recognised when the 
related services are provided.  
Distribution costs 
Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third parties and 
are recognised over the period for which the service is provided.  
Employee benefits 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income when payable in accordance with the 
scheme particulars. 
Share-based payments  
The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-
based compensation plans.  
For equity-settled awards the fair value of the amounts payable 
to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the vesting period after adjusting for 
estimated number of shares that are expected to vest. The fair 
value is measured at grant date using an appropriate valuation 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the instruments were granted. At each balance sheet date prior 
to vesting, the cumulative expense representing the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and management’s best 
estimate of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest is 
computed. The movement in cumulative expense is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income with a 
corresponding entry within equity. 
For cash-settled awards the fair value of the amounts payable  
to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
liability on the Group’s balance sheet. The fair value is measured 
using an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the 
estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and the 
terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. 
During the vesting period, the liability recognised represents the 
portion of the vesting period that has expired at balance sheet 
date multiplied by the fair value of the awards at that date. 
Movements in the liability are recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income.  
Operating leases  
Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in  
the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line  
basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are 
recorded as a reduction in premises costs.  
Finance income and expense 
Finance income includes interest receivable on the Group’s  
cash and cash equivalents, realised gains on available-for-sale 
financial assets and both realised and unrealised gains on held-
for-sale assets.  
Finance income also includes adjustments in relation to the 
Group’s contingent consideration liabilities related to 
acquisitions and charges in respect of unwinding of net present 
value discounts.  
Finance expense includes the unwind of the discounts applied 
to contingent consideration liabilities on the Group’s balance 
sheet using the effective interest method.

Taxation  
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current  
and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates  
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. 
Current tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group 
operates, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The 
following differences are not provided for:  
– goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; and  
– differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to  
the extent that they will probably not reverse in the  
foreseeable future.  
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when shareholders’ rights to receive 
payments have been established. 
Equity shares 
The Company’s ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each are 
classified as equity instruments. Ordinary shares issued by the 
Company are recorded at the fair value of the consideration 
received or the market price at the day of issue. Direct issue 
costs, net of tax, are deducted from equity through share 
premium. When share capital is repurchased, the amount of 
consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a change in equity. 
Own shares 
Own shares are held by the EBT. The holding of the EBT 
comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally  
to employees of the Group. In both the Group and Company, 
own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from  
retained earnings.  
Treasury shares 
Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from the sale and original cost being taken to retained earnings. 
Segmental information 
Key management information, including revenues, margins, 
investment performance, distribution costs and AuM flows, 
which is relevant to the operation of the Group, is reported to 
and reviewed by the Board on the basis of the investment 
management business as a whole and, hence, the Group’s 
management considers that the Group’s services and its 
operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis and 
comprise one business segment (being provision of investment 
management services).

The Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan (Omnibus Plan) 
The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, market 
value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options, phantoms and/or nil cost options to employees. The 
Omnibus Plan will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares. These elements 
can be used singly or in combination. Awards granted under the Omnibus Plan typically vest after five years from date of grant,  
with the exception of bonus awards which vest after the shorter of five years from date of grant or on the date of termination  
of employment. Awards under the Omnibus Plan are accounted for as equity-settled, with the exception of phantoms which  
are classified as cash-settled.  
The share-based payments relating to the Omnibus Plan represent the combined cash and equity-settled payments.

The fair value of awards granted under the Omnibus Plan is determined by the average Ashmore Group plc closing share price for 
the five business days prior to grant. 
Where the grant of restricted and matching share awards is linked to the annual bonus process the fair value of the awards is spread 
over a period including the current financial year and the subsequent five years to their release date when the grantee becomes 
unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares. The fair value of the remaining awards is spread over the period from date of grant 
to the release date. 
The liability arising from cash-settled awards under the Omnibus Plan at the end of the year and reported within trade and other 
payables in the consolidated balance sheet is £12.0million (30 June 2012: £8.7 million) of which £nil (30 June 2012: £nil) relates  
to vested awards. 
The Approved Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) 
The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of 
market value options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding £30,000 per employee. The 
CSOP qualifies as a UK tax approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC. To date,  
there have been no awards made under the CSOP.

Other arrangements 
US subsidiary operating agreement 
Under the terms of a US subsidiary’s operating agreement, certain employees are eligible to receive part of their variable 
compensation in the form of partnership units. These awards, which typically vest five years from the date of grant depending  
on the satisfaction of service conditions, are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments. The fair value of awards  
granted is based on the equity valuation of the subsidiary at the date of grant. Upon vesting, the holders are entitled to receive units 
in the subsidiary.

Phantom Bonus Plan  
In August 2012, the Phantom Bonus Plan, a cash-settled share-based payment plan, was set up to provide long-term incentives to 
certain employees. The units typically vest after 5 years from date of grant, contingent upon continued employment. Units awarded 
under the plan carry no voting rights. The fair value of units granted under the plan is determined with reference to the equity 
valuation of the underlying employing entity. 
13,229 awards were granted during the year and none were forfeited or vested during the year. As at 30 June 2013, 13,229 awards 
were outstanding and the related liability reported within trade and other payables in the consolidated and Company balance sheet is 
£0.1 million of which £nil relates to vested awards. 
Acquisition of Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. (formerly Ashmore EMM L.L.C.) 
On acquisition of Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C., employees and management held unvested shares 
representing 17.9% of its partnership shares. These awards, which vest after five years depending on the satisfaction of service 
conditions, are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payment which results 
in an annual charge to the statement of comprehensive income during the period of vesting. Upon vesting, the holders are entitled 
to receive shares in Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. which may be exchanged for shares in Ashmore Group 
plc or cash at the discretion of the Group. The grant date fair value was based on the intrinsic value proportionate with the value 
implied from the purchase consideration paid by the Group to acquire Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C..  
During the year, no awards were granted (FY2011/12: none), 5,463 awards vested (FY2011/12: none) and 71,587 awards 
(FY2011/12: 16,760 awards) were forfeited. 317,400 awards (30 June 2012: 394,450 awards) are outstanding as at year end.

Phantom Bonus Plan  
In August 2012, the Phantom Bonus Plan, a cash-settled share-based payment plan, was set up to provide long-term incentives to 
certain employees. The units typically vest after 5 years from date of grant, contingent upon continued employment. Units awarded 
under the plan carry no voting rights. The fair value of units granted under the plan is determined with reference to the equity 
valuation of the underlying employing entity. 
13,229 awards were granted during the year and none were forfeited or vested during the year. As at 30 June 2013, 13,229 awards 
were outstanding and the related liability reported within trade and other payables in the consolidated and Company balance sheet is 
£0.1 million of which £nil relates to vested awards. 
Acquisition of Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. (formerly Ashmore EMM L.L.C.) 
On acquisition of Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C., employees and management held unvested shares 
representing 17.9% of its partnership shares. These awards, which vest after five years depending on the satisfaction of service 
conditions, are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payment which results 
in an annual charge to the statement of comprehensive income during the period of vesting. Upon vesting, the holders are entitled 
to receive shares in Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. which may be exchanged for shares in Ashmore Group 
plc or cash at the discretion of the Group. The grant date fair value was based on the intrinsic value proportionate with the value 
implied from the purchase consideration paid by the Group to acquire Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C..  
During the year, no awards were granted (FY2011/12: none), 5,463 awards vested (FY2011/12: none) and 71,587 awards 
(FY2011/12: 16,760 awards) were forfeited. 317,400 awards (30 June 2012: 394,450 awards) are outstanding as at year end.

A reduction to the main rate of UK corporation tax from 24% to 23% was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012 and became 
effective from 1 April 2013. The effect of this rate reduction has been reflected in the figures set out above and the 23% rate used  
in the calculation of the UK’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The rate is set to fall to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 
thereafter to 20% from 1 April 2015. These rate reductions were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.  
13) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax for the financial period attributable to equity holders of the 
parent of £202.2 million (FY2011/12: £181.5 million) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, 
excluding own shares. 
Diluted earnings per share is based on basic earnings per share adjusted for all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There is no difference 
between the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. 
Reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is shown below.

Goodwill 
The goodwill balance within the Group relates principally to the acquisition of Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. 
in May 2011.  
The goodwill balance within the Company relates to the acquisition of the business from ANZ in 1999.  
The annual impairment review of goodwill was undertaken for the year ending 30 June 2013. The recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated was determined by a value in use calculation. The calculation was based on the 
forecast future profitability and cash flow projections of the cash-generating unit over a 10-year period which management believes 
is the most appropriate timescale to review and consider performance. Budgets and plans approved by management cover the first 
three years of the 10-year projections. A pre-tax discount rate of 13.0% based on the Group’s cost weighted cost of capital was 
used in calculating value in use. Adjustments required in determining the discount rate from the weighted cost of capital were not 
considered to have a material impact. No growth was assumed in determining projected cash flows beyond the period covered by 
the approved budgets and plans. 
Based on management’s value in use calculation, the recoverable amount was in excess of the carrying amount and no impairment 
was therefore deemed necessary. An increase in the discount rate by 5.0% (30 June 2012: 5.0%) would not result in the 
recoverable amount being lower than the carrying amount. 
Fund management relationships and the brand name 
Intangible assets are comprised of fund management relationships related to profit expected to be earned from clients of Ashmore 
Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. acquired in 2011 and its brand name.  
During the year to 30 June 2013, as a result of the impairment indicator of the loss of certain historical fund management clients and 
rebranding of the equities business, it was identified that some of the Group’s fund management relationships and brand name were 
likely to be impaired. As a result, a review of the recoverable amounts of the fund management relationships and the brand name 
intangible assets was undertaken during the year. The recoverable amount of each intangible asset was derived from the cumulative

pre-tax net earnings anticipated to be generated over the remaining useful economic life, discounted to present value using the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 13.0% per annum. Cumulative net earnings associated with the fund management 
relationships intangible asset were derived from the annual operating profit contribution that would arise as a result of the remaining 
fund management relationships, adjusted for investment performance and investor attrition. Cumulative net earnings associated 
with the brand name intangible asset were derived from the forecast annual royalties that would be earned as a result of the 
remaining assets under management, adjusted for investment performance and investor attrition.  
Both intangible assets were determined to be impaired as a result of the recoverable amounts being lower than the carrying values 
at the date of the impairment test and consequently impaired. 
A combined impairment charge of £11.0 million during the year (FY2011/12: £nil) has been included within other expenses in the 
Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Individual impairment charges in the year for the fund management 
relationships and the brand name intangible assets were £9.4 million (FY2011/12: £nil) and £1.6 million (FY2011/12: £nil) respectively.  
The remaining amortisation period for fund management relationships is six years (30 June 2012: seven years). 
Other intangible assets 
In addition, in order to incentivise Amundi, who were formerly a shareholder in Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) 
L.L.C., to retain existing AuM within the business and to further increase AuM, there is an incentive fee payable after three years 
tied to the level of such AuM at that time. As the purpose of this is to benefit the Group going forward, a corresponding intangible 
asset was recognised. During the year to 30 June 2013 there has been no downward adjustment to the net present value of the 
incentive fee payable to Amundi at the end of the agreement. Consequently management have concluded that the associated 
intangible asset is not impaired. No impairment charge (FY2011/12: £1.2 million) has been included within other expenses in the 
Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income, reducing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its recoverable 
amount. Other intangible assets are being amortised over a three-year period up to May 2014.

The deferred acquisition costs shown above are in respect of the launch of Ashmore Global Opportunities Limited (AGOL), a publicly 
listed closed-ended investment company incorporated in 2007, and are being charged to the Group’s statement of comprehensive 
income over seven years. 
During the year, the Group recovered £2.4 million of deferred acquisition costs related to the managed wind down of AGOL which 
was proposed and approved by AGOL shareholders in March 2013. The wind down entitles the Group to receive a reimbursement  
of certain launch costs which were borne at the time of AGOL’s IPO in 2007.

20) Fair value of financial instruments 
There are no material differences between the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities and their fair values at the balance 
sheet date.  
Fair value hierarchy 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the 
measurements.  
– Level 1: Valuation is based upon a quoted market price in an active market for an identical instrument.  
– Level 2: Valuation techniques are based upon observable inputs, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).  
– Level 3: Valuation techniques use significant unobservable inputs.  
The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments which are carried at fair value at year end is summarised below:

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year (FY2011/12: none).  
There were no material unlisted investment securities requiring use of valuation techniques.

a) Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held-for-sale 
Where Group companies inject seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group and the Group is actively seeking to 
reduce its investment and it is considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within a year, the interests in the funds are 
treated as held-for-sale and are recognised as financial assets and liabilities held-for-sale. During the year, six funds (FY2011/12: 
three) were seeded in this manner, met the above criteria and consequently the assets and liabilities of these funds were initially 
classified as held-for-sale.  
The non-current assets and liabilities held-for-sale at 30 June 2013 were as follows: 
 
2013 
£m 
2012
£m
Non-current financial assets held-for-sale 104.9 49.9
Non-current financial liabilities held-for-sale (26.9) (15.1)
Seed capital investments classified as being held-for-sale 78.0 34.8
Investments held for less than a year cease to be classified as held-for-sale when they are no longer controlled by the Group. A loss 
of control may happen either through sale of the investment and/or dilution of the Group’s holding. When investments cease to be 
classified as held-for-sale they are classified as available-for-sale financial assets (see below). One such investment (FY2011/12: two) 
was transferred to available-for-sale assets after the Group reduced its interests following investment inflows from third parties. 
There was no impact on net assets or profit or loss as a result of the reclassification.  
If the fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year from the original investment date it will cease to be 
classified as held-for-sale, and will be consolidated line-by-line after considering the proximity of loss of control and the extent to 
which consolidation of the fund on a line by line basis would be material to the presentation of the Group’s financial statements. 
During the year, two such funds (FY2011/12: six) with an aggregate carrying amount of £25.2 million (FY2011/12: £32.4 million)  
were transferred to consolidated funds. There was no impact on net assets or profit or loss as a result of the transfer.  
As the Group considers itself to have one segment (refer to note 1), no additional segmental disclosure of held-for-sale assets  
or liabilities is applicable. 
Gains and losses in relation to held-for-sale investments are included within finance income and expenses respectively (refer to note 8).

22) Financial instrument risk management  
Group 
The Group is subject to strategic, business, investment, operational and treasury risks throughout its business as discussed in the 
Business Review. This note discusses the Group’s exposure to and management of the following principal risks which arise from 
financial instruments it uses: credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk. Where the Group holds 
units in investment funds, classified as either held-for-sale, available-for-sale or non-current asset investment financial assets, the 
related financial instrument risk disclosures in the note below categorise exposures based on the Group’s direct interest in those 
funds without looking through to the nature of underlying securities. 
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Group’s senior management as noted in the Corporate Governance report on  
pages 44 to 46. 
Capital management 
It is the Group’s policy that all entities within the Group have sufficient capital to meet regulatory and working capital requirements 
and conducts regular reviews of its capital requirements relative to its capital resources. 
As the Group is regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), it is required to maintain appropriate capital 
and perform regular calculations of capital requirements. This includes development of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP), based upon the FCA’s methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive. An overview of the ICAAP can be 
found on our website at www.ashmoregroup.com. The Group’s Pillar 3 disclosures covering the year to 30 June 2013 indicated that 
the Group had surplus capital of £453.6 million (year to 30 June 2012: surplus of £381.8 million) over the level of capital required to 
meet operational risks under a Pillar II assessment. The objective of the assessment is to check that the Group has adequate capital 
to manage identified risks and the process includes conducting stress tests to identify capital and liquidity requirements under 
different future scenarios including a potential downturn.  
All regulated entities with the Group have complied with regulatory requirements and filings that apply in the jurisdictions they operate. 
Equity, as referred to in the Group’s balance sheet, is the capital for the business. 
Credit risk 
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full 
amounts when due.  
Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by senior management and the Group’s Risk Management and Control 
team. The Group has a counterparty and cash management policy in place which, in addition to other controls, restricts exposure to 
any single counterparty by setting exposure limits and requiring approval and diversification of counterparty banks and other financial 
institutions. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets. The table 
below lists financial assets subject to credit risk.

Investment securities, derivative financial instruments, non-current financial assets held-for-sale and available-for-sale financial assets 
expose the Group to credit risk from various counterparties which is monitored and reviewed by the Group. 
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents, comprised of short-term deposits with banks and liquidity funds, are predominantly held 
with counterparties with credit ratings ranging from A- to AAAm as at 30 June 2013 (30 June 2012: A to AAAm).  
All trade and other receivables are considered to be fully recoverable and none were overdue at year end (30 June 2012: none).  
They include fee debtors that arise principally within the Group’s investment management business. They are monitored regularly 
and, historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship 
between the Group and the client. There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.  
In order to manage inherent liquidity risk there is a liquidity policy within the Group to ensure that there is sufficient access to funds 
to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 12 months.

Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. 
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in 
interest rates. This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business. The Group has a cash management policy which 
requires management to monitor cash levels and returns within set parameters on a continuing basis. 
Bank and similar deposits held at year end are shown on the consolidated balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents. The effective 
interest earned on bank and similar deposits during the year is given in the table below: 
Effective interest rates applicable to bank deposits 
 
2013
%
2012
%
Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 0.85 0.79
Deposits with banks and liquidity funds are repriced at intervals of less than one year. 
At 30 June 2013, if interest rates over the year had been 50 basis points higher or 50 basis points lower (30 June 2012: 50 basis 
points higher or 50 basis points lower) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £1.5 million 
higher/£1.5 million lower (FY2011/12: £1.3 million higher/£1.3 million lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest on cash 
balances. An assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the 
model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits. 
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk from seed capital investments. The following table provides a summary of the 
Group’s direct exposure to interest rate risk from investments held by the Group as investment securities in consolidated funds.

Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes  
in foreign exchange rates. 
The Group’s revenue is almost entirely denominated in US dollars, whilst the majority of the Group’s costs are Sterling-based. 
Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the GBP/USD exchange rate. In addition, the Group operates globally 
which means that it may enter into contracts and other arrangements denominated in local currencies in various geographic areas. 
The Group also holds a number of seed capital investments which are denominated mainly in either US dollars, Brazilian real or 
Indonesian rupiah. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge the Group’s revenue by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts and options for  
up to two years forward. The Group also sells US dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.  
The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to a 1.0% exchange movement in the US dollar, Brazilian real and Indonesian rupiah, 
net of hedging activities.

Price risk 
Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes. 
Seed capital 
The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in market prices in respect of seed capital investments. Such price risk is borne by the 
Group directly through interests in available-for-sale and non-current asset seed capital investments or indirectly either through line 
by line consolidation of underlying financial performance and positions held in certain funds or potential impairments when fair values 
less costs to sell of seed investments held-for-sale are less than carrying amounts. Details of seed capital investments held at year 
end are given in note 21. 
The Group has well defined procedures governing the appraisal and approval as well monitoring the performance of seed capital 
investments. 
At 30 June 2013, a 5% movement in the fair value of these investments would have had a £7.7 million (FY2011/12: £7.3 million) 
impact on net assets and impact on profit before tax would have been £4.9 million (FY2011/12: £3.3 million).  
Management fees 
The Group is also indirectly exposed to price risk in connection with the Group’s management fees which are based on a percentage 
of value of AuM and fees based on performance. Movements in market prices, exchange and interest rates could cause the AuM to 
fluctuate which in turn could affect fees earned. Performance fee revenues could also be reduced in severe market conditions. 
Management and performance fees are diversified across a range of investment themes and are not measurably correlated to any 
single market indices in Emerging Markets. In addition, throughout Ashmore’s history, the policy of having funds with year ends 
staged throughout the financial year has meant that in periods of steep market decline, some performance fees have still been 
recorded. The profitability impact is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including the reduction of the 
variable compensation paid to employees.  
Based on the year end AuM of US$77.4 billion and the year’s average net management fee rate of 68bps, a 5% movement in  
assets under management would have a US$26.3 million impact on management fee revenues (FY2011/12: based on assets under 
management of $63.7 billion and an average net management fee rate of 74bps, a 5% movement in assets under management 
would have had a US$23.6 million impact on management fee revenues).  
Hedging activities 
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and options to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk. These hedges, which have 
been assessed as effective cash flow hedges as at 30 June 2013, protect a proportion of the Group’s revenue cash flows from 
foreign exchange movements and occur consistently throughout the year. The cumulative fair value of the outstanding foreign 
exchange hedges liability at 30 June 2013 was £2.1 million (30 June 2012: £1.3 million) and is included within the Group’s derivative 
financial instrument liabilities.

When hedges are assessed as effective, intrinsic value gains and losses are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and 
later reclassified to comprehensive income as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise. Time value in relation to the Group’s 
hedges is excluded from being part of the hedging item and, as a result, the net unrealised loss related to the time value of the 
hedges is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year. 
A £0.4 million intrinsic loss (FY2011/12: £0.1 million gain) on the Group’s hedges has been recognised through other comprehensive 
income and £nil intrinsic value (FY2011/12: £nil) was reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income in the year.  
Included within the realised and unrealised hedging loss of £1.2 million (note 7) recognised at 30 June 2013 (£0.1 million gain  
at 30 June 2012) are: 
– a £0.5 million loss in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the financial year ending  
30 June 2014 (FY2011/12: £0.5 million loss in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2013); and 
– a £0.7 million loss in respect of crystallised foreign exchange contracts (FY2011/12: £0.6 million gain).

Contingent consideration 
The Group’s contingent consideration liabilities comprise amounts payable in future periods subject to achievement of agreed 
milestone targets by the relevant maturity date of 31 May 2014. The total contingent consideration liability of £0.5 million is 
considered to be payable in less than one year and classified as a current liability.

The Group’s contingent consideration liabilities were adjusted down at the end of the year, in line with accounting standards, to 
reflect its fair value. Such a movement in fair value was driven principally by the levels of equities AuM managed by Ashmore 
Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. at 30 June 2013, compared with the relatively higher levels forecast when the fair 
values of the contingent consideration liabilities were established.  
The fall in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at 30 June 2013 resulted in a downward adjustment £10.8 million 
(FY2011/12: £16.8 million) at that date. The reduction of the discounted liability, the corresponding entry to which is reported  
within finance income, reflects a reduction in the Group’s expected payments as a result of performance against contingent 
consideration milestones to date. 
The potential undiscounted value of future annual payments that the Group could be required to make under contingent 
consideration arrangements is between £nil and a maximum of £40.7 million/US$61.9 million (30 June 2012: nil and  
£65.3 million/US$102.5 million). In addition to the annual earn-out payments, the Group could be required to pay a further  
£44.4 million/US$67.5 million (FY2011/12: £17.1 million/US$26.9 million) as a result of catch up provisions relating to prior  
periods. The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated by reference to forecast management fee earnings over  
the remaining period to 31 May 2014 and discounted using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%. The  
assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to assess the potential sensitivities and impact on the Group. The undiscounted  
value of the estimated payments was £0.6 million/US$0.9 million (30 June 2012: £12.5 million/US$ 19.7 million). At maturity, 
contingent consideration will be settled using a combination of cash and new Ashmore ordinary shares at the prevailing market 
price. The current estimate of the undiscounted contingent consideration is all due to be settled in cash, with no further option  
for Ashmore to settle in equity (30 June 2012: £3.0 million/US$4.7 million of the then estimate of the undiscounted contingent 
consideration amount could be settled with equity). The discount applied to the contingent consideration will unwind until the  
time when the final payment is made in May 2014. 
It is management’s judgement that a 10.0% movement in key assumptions would not materially impact the value of contingent

Contingent consideration 
The Group’s contingent consideration liabilities comprise amounts payable in future periods subject to achievement of agreed 
milestone targets by the relevant maturity date of 31 May 2014. The total contingent consideration liability of £0.5 million is 
considered to be payable in less than one year and classified as a current liability.

The Group’s contingent consideration liabilities were adjusted down at the end of the year, in line with accounting standards, to 
reflect its fair value. Such a movement in fair value was driven principally by the levels of equities AuM managed by Ashmore 
Equities Investment Management (US) L.L.C. at 30 June 2013, compared with the relatively higher levels forecast when the fair 
values of the contingent consideration liabilities were established.  
The fall in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at 30 June 2013 resulted in a downward adjustment £10.8 million 
(FY2011/12: £16.8 million) at that date. The reduction of the discounted liability, the corresponding entry to which is reported  
within finance income, reflects a reduction in the Group’s expected payments as a result of performance against contingent 
consideration milestones to date. 
The potential undiscounted value of future annual payments that the Group could be required to make under contingent 
consideration arrangements is between £nil and a maximum of £40.7 million/US$61.9 million (30 June 2012: nil and  
£65.3 million/US$102.5 million). In addition to the annual earn-out payments, the Group could be required to pay a further  
£44.4 million/US$67.5 million (FY2011/12: £17.1 million/US$26.9 million) as a result of catch up provisions relating to prior  
periods. The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated by reference to forecast management fee earnings over  
the remaining period to 31 May 2014 and discounted using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%. The  
assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to assess the potential sensitivities and impact on the Group. The undiscounted  
value of the estimated payments was £0.6 million/US$0.9 million (30 June 2012: £12.5 million/US$ 19.7 million). At maturity, 
contingent consideration will be settled using a combination of cash and new Ashmore ordinary shares at the prevailing market 
price. The current estimate of the undiscounted contingent consideration is all due to be settled in cash, with no further option  
for Ashmore to settle in equity (30 June 2012: £3.0 million/US$4.7 million of the then estimate of the undiscounted contingent 
consideration amount could be settled with equity). The discount applied to the contingent consideration will unwind until the  
time when the final payment is made in May 2014. 
It is management’s judgement that a 10.0% movement in key assumptions would not materially impact the value of contingent 
consideration liabilities.

32) Accounting estimates and judgements 
Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are regularly evaluated and are based upon management’s 
assessment of current and future events. The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below. 
Goodwill 
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based upon value in 
use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. The carrying value of goodwill and intangibles 
on the Group’s balance sheet at 30 June 2013 was £84.3 million (30 June 2012: £98.1 million). Management considers that 
reasonable possible changes in any of the key assumptions applied would not cause the carrying value of goodwill to materially 
exceed its recoverable value.  
Performance fees 
The Group assesses the recognition of performance fees to determine whether receipt of the fees is considered probable and  
the amount reliable. The assessment is made using management’s judgement of the circumstances relevant to each performance 
fee entitlement.  
There were no outstanding performance fees receivable at 30 June 2013 (30 June 2012: none).  
Earnout arrangements 
The Group assesses the expected payments to be made under earnout arrangements to determine whether the estimates are 
reasonable based on current information. The assessment is made using management’s judgement of the likelihood of the 
conditions of the earnout being met taking into account the revenue earning capability of the underlying AuM. The fair value of the 
contingent consideration is then calculated by reference to those estimates, weighted according to management’s estimates of their 
probabilities and discounted using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The combined liability of all earnout arrangements 
on the Group’s balance sheet at 30 June 2013 was £0.5 million (30 June 2012: £10.7 million) (refer to note 26). 
Contingent consideration 
A number of assumptions are made in deriving the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration, including assumptions 
around future net management fee margins, net subscriptions, market performance and the average cost of capital. While the Group 
believes that a set of prudent assumptions and estimates have been used that best reflect current market conditions, there remains 
a degree of uncertainty. In the event that future results or revised assumptions contribute to an upward revision in the contingent 
consideration, the reduction recognised during the period, reported within finance income, could be partially or fully reversed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is possible that this document could or may contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs, 
as well as assumptions about future events. These forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate 
only to historical or current facts. Forward looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, 
plan, goal, believe, will, may, should, would, could or other words of similar meaning.  
Undue reliance should not be placed on any such statements because, by their very nature, they are subject to known and unknown 
risks and uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, and the Group’s plans and objectives, to 
differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. There are several factors that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements are changes in the global, political, economic, 
business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business 
combinations or dispositions. The Group undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statement contained within 
this document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Sharegift 
Shareholders with only a small number of shares whose value 
makes them uneconomic to sell may wish to consider donating 
to charity through Sharegift, an independent charity share 
donation scheme. 
For further information, please contact either the Registrar or 
see the Sharegift website at www.sharegift.org. 
Frequent shareholder enquiries 
Enquiries and notifications concerning dividends, share 
certificates or transfers and address changes should be sent to 
the Registrar; the Company’s governance reports, corporate 
governance guidelines and the terms of reference of the Board 
committees can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.ashmoregroup.com. 
Notifying the Company of a change of address 
You should notify Equiniti Registrars in writing. 
If you hold shares in joint names, the notification to change 
address must be signed by the first-named shareholder.  
You may choose to do this online, by logging on to 
www.shareview.co.uk. You will need your shareholder 
reference number to access this service – this can be found  
on your share certificate or from a dividend counterfoil. 
You will be asked to select your own PIN and a user ID will  
be posted to you. 
Notifying the Company of a change of name 
You should notify Equiniti Registrars in writing of your new 
name and previous name. You should attach a copy of your 
marriage certificate or your change of name deed, together with 
your share certificates and any un-cashed dividend cheques in 
your old name, so that the Registrar can reissue them. 
Dividend payments directly into bank or building 
society accounts 
We recommend that all dividend payments are made directly 
into a bank or building society account. Dividends are paid via 
BACS, providing tighter security and access to funds more 
quickly. To apply for a dividend mandate form, contact the 
Registrar, or you can find one by logging on to 
www.shareview.co.uk (under Frequently Asked Questions) or 
by calling the helpline on 0871 384 2812 (calls to this number 
cost 8p per minute from a BT landline, other providers’ costs 
may vary. Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday). 
International shareholder helpline: +44 121 415 7047 
Transferring Ashmore Group plc shares 
Transferring some or all of your shares to someone else (for 
example your partner or a member of your family) requires 
completion of a share transfer form, which is available from 
Equiniti Registrars. The form should be fully completed and 
returned with your share certificate representing at least the 
number of shares being transferred. The Registrar will then 
process the transfer and issue a balance share certificate to you 
if applicable. The Registrar will be able to help you with any 
questions you may have.

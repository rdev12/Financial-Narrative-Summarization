The Group’s strategy is to develop leading brands and to be 
diversified and balanced across geographies and sectors. 
Our spread of operations minimises the dependence on any 
single market, so reducing the impact from market 
fluctuations and other external factors. Each brand is a 
specialist in their niche market, enabling them to understand 
the needs of clients and candidates alike, allowing them to 
attack the market vertically rather than horizontally.
Our vision is to be a leading, international, specialist staffing 
group delivering a quality service to our customers and 
candidates and creating a sustainable business for the 
long-term benefit of shareholders.

The Group has three main service lines, 
temporary and contract recruitment, 
permanent recruitment and offshore 
recruitment services. Overall we aim for a bias 
in temporary recruitment, which is generally 
more stable throughout the economic cycle, 
but this also depends on the maturity of the 
staffing sector in each country, with less mature 
markets focused purely on permanent sales.
We target professional and specialist job levels 
where our brands can offer a higher value 
added service to clients.
AT A GLANCE
The Group operates in 19 countries across four 
geographic regions and across seven key sectors, with 
each brand an expert in their niche market. We focus on 
growth markets, whether this is country or sector based. 32%

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Further year of progress
The Group has 
delivered another 
year of strong 
growth in profit and 
adjusted earnings 
per share
The Group has delivered another 
year of strong growth in profit  
and adjusted earnings per share. 
We have again demonstrated the 
strength of our multi-branded 
business model, with a strategy  
to be diversified by geography  
and sector and to develop leading 
brands with sector expertise.  
As we enter 2017, the Group 
continues to strengthen its 
position, as our focus on 
delivering against our strategy  
is reflected in our trading 
performance and resilience to 
uncertain market conditions.
 Revenue grew by 44%, primarily in the 
Technical & Industrial sector and from  
the investments made in 2016. Additionally,  
our business mix has changed following 
our decision in the last few years to  
reduce our exposure to low margin, high 
volume business in the UK Technical & 
Industrial sector
 Net fee income grew by 20% with profit 
before tax up 11% (23% on an adjusted 
basis). We are pleased to report fourteen 
consecutive quarters of year-on-year 
growth in net fee income
 Share of net fee income from Temporary 
recruitment is up to 60% (2015: 55%), 
continuing our focus to deliver a higher 
proportion of our income from contracting, 
which is generally more predictable than 
permanent recruitment
 A balanced and diversified spread of 
operations, with 68% of net fee income 
from outside the UK (2015: 63%). We 
generate 72% of our net fee income from 
the four largest staffing markets in the 
world (USA, Japan, UK and Germany)  
but also 28% from high growth markets 
including South East Asia, China, India  
and Australia
 We have invested in two sectors with 
exciting long-term growth prospects 
through our investments in Rishworth 
Aviation (Aviation sector) and ConSol 
Partners (IT, Digital & Design sector).  
These transactions completed three 
important investments in a 12-month 
period to October 2016, starting with 
Pharmaceutical Strategies in October 
2015, adding strong brands to the Group 
that have good growth potential in the 
years to come

Group revenue of £270.4m was up 44% on 
the prior year of £187.3m, with a 50% growth 
in Temporary revenue and 7% growth in 
Permanent revenue. The growth in net fee 
income was 20%, with a reduced Temporary 
margin of 14.5% (2015: 16.7%). This is largely 
due to Rishworth Aviation having a lower 
margin than the rest of the Group at 6%, 
although this margin is earned over a long 
period as their temporary contracts typically 
last between three and five years. Also, in 
Germany there was a reduced margin from 
changes in the client mix and tariffs.
We continued to see an improvement in our 
conversion ratio, for the fifth year in a row, 
increasing from 16.3% to 16.6% with costs 
controlled despite further investments in the 
business. Operating profit grew 12% to £8.5m 
(2015: £7.6m), after a £0.7m increase in 
amortisation charges to £1.1m. With interest 
costs higher due to the debt taken on to help 
fund the investments, profit before tax growth 
was 11% to £7.9m (2015: £7.1m). On an 
adjusted basis, excluding amortisation, 
exceptional items and fair value charges on 
the acquisition of non-controlling interests, 
both operating profit and profit before tax 
grew 23% over the prior year.
Diluted earnings per share was unchanged at 
9.3p, again impacted by higher amortisation 
costs. On an adjusted basis it grew by 14%  
to 11.3p, delivering the fifth year in a row of 
double-digit growth.
The results this year have been impacted by 
currency movements, especially in the second 
half of the year. There was a small negative 
impact on the trading results but overall it has 
been positive for the Group, with a benefit from 
the translation of overseas profits into Sterling. 
On a constant currency basis revenue growth 
was 33%, net fee income was up 10% and 
adjusted profit before tax was up 11%. 
After seeing our total debt level reduce 
through 2014 and 2015, this year it increased 
to £10.5m (2015: £7.3m) as we took the 
decision to fund our investments in the year  
by using operating cash flows and new bank 
debt. We entered into a five-year revolving 
credit facility with HSBC Bank plc on 30 June 
2016. Interest rates are at low levels and are 
generally expected to remain low in the short 
term. This access to low cost debt with our 
long-term banking partner provided the best 
option to finance the investments in 2016. 
Our underlying philosophy remains to fund 
investments through equity or operating cash 
flows and to use debt for working capital 
funding. We continue to target a ‘debt to 
debtors’ ratio of no more than 25%. We 
measure this by excluding the cash held by 
Rishworth Aviation for pilot bonds, which 
ultimately is repayable to pilots at the end  
of their contracts, and at year end this ratio 
was 38% (2015: 23%) (see note 18 for further 
details). We expect to reduce this to 25% by 
the end of 2018, in line with our five-year plan.
Investments
We follow an Invest and Develop strategy,  
with a focus on investing in our existing 
brands, to help develop them to build 
long-term sustainable profit streams. To 
complement this, we also look for external 
investment opportunities to accelerate the 
growth of the Group and increase our 
presence in sectors where we feel we are 
under-represented.
In line with this strategy, in 2016 we made  
two significant investments. In July 2016 we 
invested in Rishworth Aviation, a pilot leasing 
staffing business operating from offices in 
New Zealand and Sweden, servicing clients 
throughout Asia Pacific, UK, Continental 
Europe and Africa. Rishworth provides pilots 
on a contracting basis and is already 
diversified geographically. Air travel is 
predicted to increase with high growth rates 
over the mid term, especially in the emerging 
markets in Asia and Africa where Rishworth 
has a good presence, and we see good 
prospects for the business over the medium 
and long term.
In October 2016 we invested in ConSol 
Partners, which operates in the IT staffing 
sector, servicing the high growth areas of 
Communications & Mobile, Cloud Technologies 
and the Digital supply chain. They have offices 
in the UK and USA, with the UK team primarily 
servicing clients across the UK and Continental 
Europe and the USA team focused on its 
domestic market. This investment strengthens 
the Group’s presence in an important sector, 
which is exhibiting strong growth trends and 
has excellent potential.
People
A key part of our business model is subsidiary 
management equity, aligning key management 
and Empresaria shareholder interests through 
brand management holding shares in their 
operating companies. This approach helps 
Empresaria to attract and retain the best people. 
At the end of the year we had 57 management 
shareholders, owning shares in different 
Group companies, up from 42 last year.
The Group has a dedicated Board and we  
are working hard to deliver growth, manage 
risk and improve our long-term financial 
performance, to generate higher shareholder 
returns. The Board is extremely experienced, 
with over 100 years of combined staffing 
industry experience.
The success of the Group comes from the 
hard work and commitment of our staff and 
the Board would like to thank every individual 
for their contribution to the business.
Governance
We have an established governance system in 
place to deliver on our vision. The Group follows 
high standards of corporate governance 
which we believe is a core requirement for a 
successful business operating a decentralised 
model across different regions and brands. 
There is a strong culture of financial control  
in the Group, with clear policies covering 
corporate conduct and governance. The 
Board develops the Group’s corporate 
governance arrangements with reference  
to the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The values and culture of the Group, which 
are based on shared ownership and true 
operational autonomy for brand managers, 
are very important to the Board and key to  
our long-term growth prospects. We focus  
our investments towards people that share 
these values.
Dividend
The Board has reviewed the dividend in the 
light of the positive trading result and overall 
financial position. In line with our progressive 
dividend policy, for the year ended 
31 December 2016 the Board has proposed  
a final dividend of 1.15p per share (2015: 1.0p 
per share) which, if approved by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid  
on 31 May 2017 to shareholders on the 
register on 5 May 2017.
Outlook
The Group’s strategy has delivered strong 
profit and adjusted earnings per share growth. 
We are confident that 2017 will be another 
year of profit growth with the Group benefiting 
from the potential within its existing brands 
and also the investments made in 2016 
contributing for a full year.
Our diversification by geography and sector 
helps to mitigate against difficult markets  
and as such we continue to see exciting 
opportunities to develop our Group, deliver 
increased profits and so enhance shareholder 
value. We look forward to the year ahead  
with confidence.

MARKET DRIVERS
Market drivers shaping our industry
The size of a market illustrates the existing 
opportunity for staffing companies and the 
level of specialism in the market, with larger 
markets having a greater degree of specialism. 
The world economy is increasingly inter-
connected with businesses operating in global 
markets across international boundaries. The 
labour markets are reacting to this with people 
becoming more mobile and working outside 
their country of birth.
Staffing is driven by confidence, clients  
having the confidence to hire and invest and 
candidates having the confidence to move  
job. Confidence builds from good economic 
conditions, with growing economies creating 
new roles and candidates moving between 
existing roles. This dual impact means staffing 
markets are generally expected to grow  
at higher rates than country GDP.
Description
There is a growing divide between the 
qualifications and skills of workers and the 
evolving demands of the labour market.
The population size in emerging markets, and 
the trend for growth in the number of middle 
class and education levels, points to long-term 
growth prospects for their staffing markets as 
skills improve and more people require work.
There is also an ongoing trend for 
urbanisation, leading to a concentration  
of workers in the key economic centres, 
especially in emerging markets. The 
concentration of workers to the largest cities 
means these cities are the main drivers  
of economic growth.
Talent shortages exist in certain sectors; 
making it difficult for clients to find suitable 
staff, as there are insufficient workers with  
the necessary skills to meet demand. Clients 
have a number of routes to find candidates 
themselves, but where there is a scarcity of 
talent a staffing agency is invaluable to help 
with difficult to find candidates. There is an 
ageing population in developed economies 
which is further exacerbating this skills 
shortage. In some sectors there is an 
expected reduction in the number of low 
skilled jobs in the future due to advances in 
technology and automation making these jobs 
obsolete. Conversely, new roles are being 
created that did not exist a few years ago  
and there are very few people available with 
experience in these areas. 
external advisers act as the mechanism  
for providing staffing services to clients.  
This reduces the interaction, sometimes 
completely, between the end client  
and staffing agency.
Also, advances in technology are helping  
the development of new business models  
for the industry that could change the way 
businesses find and hire talent in the future. 
Some of these models are helpful to the 
staffing agency and some would look to 
bypass the agency. With the supply and 
demand for job markets becoming 
increasingly digitalised it can be difficult  
to sift through the sheer volume of data online 
to find the best match. This is where a staffing 
agency can provide added value by managing 
the process and analysing the data to find the 
ideal candidate.
The level of regulation in a market indicates 
how sophisticated it is and can be a key driver 
of market growth, with well-regulated markets 
encouraging temporary employment by 
protecting the rights of temporary workers and 
ensuring the right to equal pay and conditions. 
This is illustrated by the temporary penetration 
rate, which represents the number of agency 
workers in a country as a percentage of the 
total working population.
With the rise of new business models and 
growth of workers in the gig economy, 
regulations are being reviewed and amended 
to deal with taxation of income and profits.
In established staffing markets we see an 
increased use of Vendor Management 
Systems (‘VMS’) and Managed Service 
Providers (‘MSP’) where software solutions or 
The rise of social media makes it easier to 
communicate with potential workers across 
the world, providing them with instant access 
to information about clients, helping them to 
make more informed choices about their 
career options. 
In global markets outsourcing practices allow 
companies to control costs by using labour in 
lower cost jurisdictions for non-core tasks and to 
allow them to adjust the size of their workforce 
more easily. This is a trend seen in both the wider 
economy and the staffing industry. 
There is an ongoing trend towards flexible 
working practices. This is being driven by both 
clients wanting solutions for specific projects, 
to manage their costs and to improve 
productivity, and candidates wanting flexibility 
on when, where and how they work. This

The German staffing market is less mature, 
having only de-regulated in 2004, but it is the 
largest economy in Europe and we expect 
their staffing market to grow to be the biggest 
in Europe over the medium term. With the 
exception of Japan and Australia, the Asian 
and Latin American staffing markets are 
relatively immature. There are low levels of 
temporary recruitment in South East Asia, but 
as the staffing market develops we expect this 
will start to grow and we are well positioned to 
benefit from this. These emerging markets 
have high growth prospects and as they 
develop and mature, this should lead to  
more specialisation.
Our brands operate across 19 countries so we 
are able to service client and candidate needs 
across the world. It is an important part of our 
strategic plan to identify opportunities for 
brands to cross-border their expertise and 
provide an international service.
We have a good spread of operations across 
both established and emerging staffing 
markets, with 72% of our net fee income 
derived from the UK, Germany, Japan and 
USA, which are the four largest staffing 
markets in the world. These markets provide  
a significant market opportunity for our brands 
to operate as niche market experts as well as 
being able to find experienced managers who 
have the skills and expertise to develop 
international brands.
Our opportunity
the previous generations. We have a good 
presence in the emerging markets with a 
particular focus on Asia Pacific, India and Latin 
America. As these markets develop we are 
positioned to grow with them.
In our markets we focus on the key economic 
centres, where we will see the best return  
on our investment. We do not have large 
networks of branch offices but focus where 
the workers and clients are concentrated,  
so having access to the greatest pool of 
vacancies and candidates.
Our brands are specialists, with knowledge 
and expertise of their niche markets. We 
believe this gives them an advantage when 
working in talent shortage markets as they 
know where to find candidates and how to 
communicate with them. Our primary focus  
is also on professional and specialist job roles 
where we believe the biggest talent shortages 
exist and where recruitment agencies are 
needed to help identify hard-to-find 
candidates. We also expect these roles to be 
less impacted from changes in technology.
There is a significant long-term growth 
potential in the emerging staffing markets due 
to the size of their populations, concentration 
of work in large cities and increasing levels of 
middle class with better education levels than 
We keep a close eye on new technologies  
and business models but we believe the key 
benefit of using a staffing agency is the 
expertise and knowledge they have of their 
market, so helping to source hard to find 
candidates and make the best possible match 
against job specifications. We encourage staff 
training and development across the Group 
and our multi-branded model develops niche 
sector expertise.
In established markets we have a high 
proportion of temporary recruitment and we 
closely monitor changes in regulations across 
our territories. We participate in consultation 
exercises with the regulators to help them 
understand the benefits and attraction to 
workers of temporary labour solutions. In 
those markets where there is no or little 
regulation of labour markets we focus on 
permanent recruitment, but with the expertise 
around the Group we are well placed to 
develop temporary recruitment solutions  
as these markets develop.
We have a fast-growing Offshore Recruitment 
Services business operating out of India and 
providing a range of recruitment services, 
primarily to clients in the USA and UK.
We have an overall bias towards temporary 
recruitment, offering workers the flexibility to 
work when they want or to help people get into 
the working environment. We expect this trend 
to increase and as markets get more regulated 
it removes any negative sentiment towards 
temporary working. We use social media 
across our brands to help communicate 
effectively with candidates. Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
Our strategy
The Group’s strategy is focused on growth, facilitating 
our vision to be a leading international, specialist 
staffing group.
Develop a solid financial foundation 
Having a strong financial foundation is key to delivering long-term 
sustainable results for the Group.
Funding being available to allow the Group to pursue investment 
opportunities.
Objective How
Develop leading specialist brands with sector expertise
We invest in our brands to ensure they have sufficient scale and 
strength to deliver sustainable profits. Leading brands should be more 
financially stable during the economic cycle and will benefit from 
synergies in operational processes, training, systems and marketing.
Focus on professional and specialist job levels where there are 
the greatest talent shortages, which in turn supports higher margins.
Sectors with good long-term growth prospects where our  
niche sector expertise helps us to deliver to the needs of clients  
and candidates.
Maintain diversification and balance by geography and sector
Having a spread of operations across geographies and sectors reduces 
the reliance on any single market and minimises the impact on the 
Group from market fluctuations and external shocks. 
Footprint in key economic centres where there is the highest 
concentration of workers and business so delivering the best return  
on investment.
Established and emerging staffing markets allows access to both 
stable mature markets and high growth emerging markets.
We follow an ‘Invest and Develop’ approach to deliver on  
our strategy.
Develop
It is important that our existing brands develop and grow their 
profits over the long term. Organic investment helps them to 
develop their services and grow scale and coverage. This is 
done by the following:
 Increase the headcount in an existing brand
 Add a new vertical specialism to an existing brand
 Enter a new or existing geography with an existing brand
 Start up in a niche sector
Invest
To accelerate our growth we also look at external investments, 
to fill gaps in our sector or geographic coverage or to bring in 
specific market knowledge into the Group.
External investment will occur where we don’t currently have  
a presence in a region or sector or to help develop an existing 
brand by filling in gaps in their service offering:
 Enter a new geography or sector with a new brand
 Grow an existing brand with a bolt-on acquisition
Financial discipline
Our investment activity is dependent on the resources we have 
available. We are in an overall debt position and we target a ‘debt  
to debtors’ ratio of 25%. 
Our preference is for investments to be funded through equity or from 
operating cash flows and debt to be used for working capital funding. 
We review investment opportunities and funding options based on our 
expectations for the business and the costs of raising new funds to 
deliver the best overall result for shareholders. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

We increased our net debt levels in 2016 to £10.5m (2015: £7.3m) by using debt to help finance 
our external investments. If we exclude the cash held for pilot bonds in Rishworth Aviation, the 
net debt increases to £15.7m, representing 38% ‘debt to debtors’ ratio against our target of 
25%. We see opportunities to bring this back in line with our target over the next two years.  
This also represents a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 (2015: 0.8).
Progress and outlook
 Net fee income from professional and specialist job roles consistent at 86% (2015: 86%)
 Investments made in leading brands in the Aviation and IT sectors
 Monroe Consulting plans to launch in Vietnam in 2017
 Increased average staff numbers to 1,282 from 1,096

 Invested in IT sector through ConSol Partners
 Split of net fee income by region is 32% UK, 28% Continental Europe,  
32% Asia Pacific and 8% Americas
From a sector perspective we are keen to increase our presence in the Healthcare and 
Professional services sectors, which we see as having good long-term growth prospects  
and we are currently under-represented in. From a regional perspective we are keen to  
increase our presence in Latin America to build more scale in this region.

Investing in new markets
Rishworth Aviation
Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016
12
In July 2016 we made an investment in 82.6% 
of the shares in Rishworth Aviation Limited 
and its sister companies (‘Rishworth’).  
This represents an excellent strategic fit for  
the Group:
 Leading brands 
Rishworth is a leading independent staffing 
company providing pilots and aviation 
personnel to the Aviation industry, with 
clients throughout Asia Pacific, UK, 
Continental Europe and Africa. 
 Focus on professional and specialist  
job levels 
Rishworth provides 100% professional 
jobs, so improving the Group’s ratio. 
 Bias to temporary recruitment 
Rishworth is a 100% contract recruitment 
business, with pilot contracts typically 
lasting between three and five years.  
This provides good visibility over  
future earnings. 
 Sectors with good long-term growth 
prospects 
There is a global shortage of pilots and 
demand for air travel is expected to 
increase, especially in Asia and Africa. 
 Maintain diversification and balance 
by geography and sector 
Rishworth is an international company, with 
offices in New Zealand and Sweden 
servicing clients across South and North 
Asia, UK, Continental Europe and Africa, 
further diversifying the Group. They have a 
good spread of clients and this represents 
a new sector for the Group.  
 Financial foundation 
Rishworth is profitable and cash generative 
and the investment is expected to improve 
the Group’s KPIs. Due to the long-term 
nature of its pilot contracts, the temporary 
margin as a percentage is low at circa  
6%, but they operate with a high 
conversion ratio.
The senior management team of Rishworth 
hold 17.4% shares in the Company. They have 
signed up to our standard shareholder 
agreements with the shares expected to be 
held for a minimum holding period of between 
three and four years, before they can be 
voluntarily offered for sale to Empresaria over 
a minimum two-year period.
The long-term prospects for the sector are 
positive, with the International Air Transport 
Association (‘IATA’) forecasting that passenger 
demand will double over the next 20 years  
to 7.2 billion passengers by 2035, based on  
a 3.7% annual compound growth rate. The 
biggest driver of demand will be the Asia 
Pacific region and it is expected to be the 
source of more than half the new passengers 
over the next 20 years. The IATA expects 
China to become the largest aviation market, 
with India displacing the UK into third place 
and Indonesia entering the top 10. Vietnam  
is also forecast to be one of the five fastest 
growing markets. The developing markets 
share of passenger traffic has risen over the 
past decade from 24% to nearly 40% and this 
trend is expected to continue. Rishworth 
already has a strong presence in the Asia 
Pacific region with clients across the territory 
and is well placed to benefit from the growth 
in the market over the next 20 years.
www.rishworthaviation.com
Studies from both Boeing and Airbus in 2016 
forecast that between 2016 and 2035 the 
world’s commercial aviation industry will 
need approximately 600,000 new pilots, 
driven by new airplane deliveries and fleet 
mix. 40% of the demand will be from the 
Asia Pacific region due to the growth in low 
cost carriers. These businesses are interested 
in flexible labour solutions and using pilots on 
temporary contracts.
The strength of the management team, size 
and scale of the existing business, focus on 
compliance and quality and long-term industry 
growth trends give us confidence in their 
ability to deliver continued growth as part  
of the Empresaria Group. Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

ConSol Partners
Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016
14
In October 2016 we made an investment in 
65% of the shares in ConSol Partners 
(Holdings) Limited (‘ConSol’), strengthening 
our presence in the high growth IT staffing 
sector. This represents an excellent strategic 
fit for the Group:
 Leading brands 
ConSol provides staffing solutions to 
organisations behind the internet 
revolution, with a focus on 
Communications & Mobile, Cloud 
Technologies and the Digital supply chain. 
 Focus on professional and specialist  
job levels 
ConSol provides 100% professional jobs, 
so improving the Group’s ratio. 
 Bias to temporary recruitment 
ConSol provides both permanent and 
temporary staffing services. In 2016 51% 
of their net fee income was from contract 
services, although this is more heavily 
weighted to the UK and European business 
with a majority of permanent sales in 
the USA. 
 Sectors with good long-term  
growth prospects 
The growth trends for the internet 
technology space are very positive with  
a global talent shortage across these 
markets. ConSol has placed staff in more 
than 50 countries since it started in 2008. 
 Maintain diversification and balance 
by geography and sector 
ConSol operate from two key locations. 
The UK office services clients primarily in 
the UK and Continental Europe and the 
USA office covers their domestic market. 
The business launched organically into the 
USA in 2013. The net fee income is spread 
evenly between the three main regions of 
the UK, USA and Continental Europe 
(including the rest of the world), so adding 
to the Group’s diversification. It also 
strengthens the Group’s presence in the  
IT & Digital sector, which has been one  
of our key focus areas. 
 Financial foundation 
ConSol is profitable and cash generative 
and the investment is expected to improve 
the Group’s KPIs.
The senior management team of ConSol hold 
35% shares in the Company and are 
committed to delivering on their growth plans 
for the business. They have signed up to our 
standard shareholder agreements with the 
shares expected to be held for a minimum 
holding period of between three and four 
years, before they can be voluntarily offered 
for sale to Empresaria over a minimum 
two-year period.
We believe that ConSol is positioned in the 
right locations and niche markets to take 
advantage of the predicted growth in the 
industry and to help companies solve their 
staffing needs in talent shortage markets. 
Staffing Industry Analysts (‘SIA’) data shows 
the largest IT staffing market in 2015 was the 
USA (52%), followed by Europe (27%) and 
Asia Pacific (17%). In that year IT staffing 
represented 36% of the global market for 
professional staffing. Demand for IT 
professionals is being fuelled by the 
interconnected developments in cloud 
computing, big data, mobile connectivity, 
digital marketing and data security, all markets 
that are being serviced by ConSol.
www.consolpartners.com
The IT industry forecasts huge growth in 
internet related areas which suggests good 
prospects for IT staffing over the next few 
years. In the USA IT staffing has outpaced 
overall staffing over the last 15 years and this 
trend looks set to continue. Gartner Group Inc 
projects there are 6.4 billion ‘connected 
things’ in 2016, up 30% on 2015 and it 
forecasts this will grow to 21 billion by 2020, 
and this is one of the more conservative 
forecasts out there. The Cisco Global Cloud 
Index forecasts that annualised cloud IP traffic 
will reach 14.1ZB (zettabytes) by the end of 
2020, up from 3.9ZB in 2015, a compound 
annual growth rate of 30%. The ‘Worldwide 
Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Spending 
Guide’ from IDC expects worldwide revenues 
for big data and business analytics to grow 
from nearly $122bn in 2015 to more than 
$187bn in 2019, an increase of more than 50% 
over the five-year forecast period. More than 
half of this will come from the USA. A number 
of sources, including IBM estimate that as 
much as 90% of the data in the world today 
has been created in the last two years. This 
kind of growth should lead to increasing 
demand for IT staff over the medium term.
The strength of the management team, their 
successful organic expansion into the USA, 
their ambitions to grow the business and 
long-term industry growth trends give us 
confidence in their ability to deliver growth as 
part of the Empresaria Group. Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Delivering profitable growth
We are pleased to 
finish the year with 
a record profit level 
We are pleased to finish the year 
with a record profit level, an 
adjusted profit before tax of £9.2m 
(2015: £7.5m). We also grew the 
Group with two high quality 
brands joining during the year, 
helping to strengthen our 
presence in the IT, Digital & 
Design sector and entering into 
the new high growth Aviation 
sector. Both brands are already 
diversified by geography and we 
believe we can help them to grow 
further by being part of our Group.
Our strongest results were in Germany with 
Headway, Japan with Skillhouse and South 
East Asia with Monroe Consulting. We also 
saw solid performances in Finland, Australia, 
China, India, Chile and within the UK market 
the Technical & Industrial sector grew well. 
Group revenue increased by 44% to £270.4m 
(2015: £187.3m) and net fee income was up 
20% to £59.0m (2015: £49.2m). Our organic 
development was offset by weakness within 
the UK and Middle East markets. The UK was 
negatively impacted by market-wide lower 
confidence levels due to the EU referendum 
and in the Middle East, a permanent 
recruitment market, weak economic conditions 
persisted throughout the year. We have 
mitigated the effects of this with some 
restructuring and we believe this will help those 
businesses deliver improved results in 2017. As 
seen historically, the Group has demonstrated 
a good track record for quickly responding to 
issues within our business and returning those 
businesses to growth and as an active 
management team we continue to closely 
monitor results for all our brands and assist 
them with both challenges and opportunities 
alike. The level of diversification across the 
Group mitigates against any individual 
business, sector or market having an undue 
influence on the wider Group results.
The weakening of Sterling during the year 
helped the translation of our overseas results. 
On a constant currency basis we saw revenue 
growth of 33%, net fee income growth of 10% 
and adjusted profit before tax up 11%. The 
underlying growth in net fee income was 
effectively from the investments made in 
Rishworth Aviation and ConSol Partners in 2016 
and the full year impact from Pharmaceutical 
Strategies that joined the Group in October 
2015. Again, this demonstrates the benefit of 
our strategy to be diversified and balanced by 
geography and sector and to focus on both 
organic development as well as making 
selective external investments, with a slow 
down in one sector or region offset by 
stronger results elsewhere. 2014

Five-year plan
2014–2018
For 2016 we have more than two thirds of our 
net fee income generated from outside the 
UK, with Asia Pacific and UK both at 32%, 
Continental Europe at 28% and Americas  
at 8%. We analyse our regional performance 
based on the locations where key 
management and staff are situated, with  
the majority of our brands only working in  
their domestic market.
Pharmaceutical Strategies, the investment  
we made in 2015, has integrated well into the 
Group. We are pleased that it has grown its 
client base and seen an improved penetration 
across existing clients. Our decision to invest 
in the management team, bringing in 
additional staff to support the future 
development of the business and their largest 
client reducing its overall spend on staffing 
requirements has resulted in a short-term 
impact on profitability. The long-term drivers  
of growth in the US healthcare market of an 
ageing population, increasing levels of obesity 
and positive economic conditions remain in 
place and give us confidence in the prospects 
for this business.
The two investments made in 2016 were both 
clearly aligned to our strategic goals, being 
established brands in their sectors, focused 
on professional and specialist job roles in 
sectors with good long-term growth 
prospects. They are already diversified 
geographically but can also benefit from the 
Group’s coverage and global footprint. They 
both have a strong contractor bias and have 
delivered good profit growth and we see 
opportunities for further growth in the next  
few years. We are focused on integrating 
these businesses into the Group, to ensure 
they get the maximum benefit from being part 
of Empresaria. We continue to see external 
investment as an important avenue of growth 
and development for the Group and we will 
look to build up our portfolio of opportunities 
through the coming year, especially in areas 
where we feel we are under-represented as  
a Group. From a sector point of view that is 
Healthcare and Professional Services and 
regionally Latin America, but we keep an open 
mind to opportunities that present themselves.
As part of our vision to deliver sustainable 
growth in earnings per share, we are following 
a five-year growth plan to 2018. We have made 
further progress against this plan with growth 
in net fee income of 20% (10% in constant 
currency) and an increase in the conversion 
ratio to 16.6%, the fifth year of continued 
improvement. Our ‘debt to debtors’ ratio 
increased from 23% to 38%, when calculated 
after excluding the cash held for pilot bonds in 
Rishworth Aviation, so moves away from our 
25% target. This was following our decision to 
use debt finance to help fund the investments 
made in the year. We expect to achieve our 
25% ‘debt to debtors’ target by 2018.
Organic growth is a core part of our business 
model and we have specific plans with each 
brand to help them develop into leading 
brands in their sectors. We are confident that 
the plans we are following will help the Group 
deliver profitable growth across all of our 
regions in 2017. 25%

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW – REGIONAL PERFORMANCE
Our regions
The investment in ConSol Partners strengthened 
our presence in the IT, Digital & Design sector, 
with our existing brands operating within the 
creative niche of this sector. The contribution 
from ConSol Partners was positive at the net  
fee income level with a small profit contribution 
before amortisation charges, but this is offset  
by the legal and due diligence costs incurred  
in making the investment. We expect to see a 
significant profit contribution in 2017 , their first  
full year in the Group. Within the creative niche 
our brands saw a reduced result, following 
increased property costs and short-term 
impacts from changes in management. We  
are confident of an improved result from these 
businesses next year.
Our brands in Domestic services, Recruitment-
to-recruitment sales and Retail (new house 
sales) delivered broadly flat profits year-on-year. 
We saw the biggest impact from the EU 
referendum within the Professional Services 
sector, with net fee income and profit both down 
year-on-year. The market stabilised following the 
vote, but activity levels were lower and costs 
were higher in the year from both property and 
staff costs as they invested in building up a 
service offering in Finance and Accounting.

Revenue increased by 12% and net fee income 
was up 3%, due to the addition of ConSol 
Partners from October 2016 and an improved 
result in the Technical & Industrial sector 
following the move away from low value work  
in the last few years. This focus on higher value 
work also helped lessen the impact from the 
change in rules on travel and subsistence in April 
2016. At the beginning of 2017 we merged the 
operations of the FastTrack and Reflex brands. 
Both operate within the Technical & Industrial 
sector and are complementary in terms of niche 
focus and client base. We expect to see cost 
savings in the back office and a streamlined 
management structure, which we hope will  
also lead to improved top line performance.  
The combined business has a good coverage 
across the UK with offices in the North, 
Midlands, London and South and we have plans 
to grow their fee-earning staff numbers in 2017 .

The Logistics division in Germany also had 
strong results through increased penetration 
with key clients. In the temporary staffing 
division, investments have been made in 
training and sales staff to help drive future 
growth. The business confidence in Germany 
is positive as we move into 2017, however, we 
are cautious about the short-term prospects 
for the market. There are elections in Germany 
in September 2017 and new legislation will be 
implemented in April 2017 which will limit the 
time a worker can be on a temporary contract 
with a client to 18 months, as well as new 
equal pay regulations being introduced. We 
believe the new rules will be positive for the 
industry over the medium term but there may 
be a short-term dampening effect on demand 
as clients get to grips with the new rules. The 
first direct impact of this legislation will be in 
October 2018 and we are working with clients 
and advisers on plans to deal with the new 
rules where they have long-standing 
temporary workers.
Our Healthcare business continues to 
improve, with an increasing proportion of 
temporary workers from Finland and lower 
costs, having closed their Estonian presence 
at the end of 2015. We are pleased with the 
progress being made.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW – REGIONAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED
Our regions
There were strong performances from 
Skillhouse in Japan (IT, Digital & Design sector) 
and Monroe Consulting in South East Asia 
and China (Executive Search sector). Also,  
we were pleased with the results in India and 
Australia. In India, we opened up a third office 
in November 2015 to accommodate growth 
and it is operating in line with expectations, 
but profit growth was curtailed due to 
currency impacts, as sales and receivables 
with the UK contributed less due to exchange 
rate movements. The Monroe Consulting 
brand saw particularly strong results from 
China and Malaysia, with China operating in  
its first full year under the Monroe brand and 
Malaysia profitable in its second full year.  
They are planning to open up in Vietnam 
during 2017. The restructuring of our training 
business in Indonesia has been successful, 
but we expect profit growth to be slow. 
Overall the region benefited from currency 
movements, with underlying results excluding 
currency and investments reducing year-on-
year, due to poor results in the Middle East. 
The market was negatively affected by the 
drop in oil price and the weak economic 
conditions continued into the second half of 
the year. This resulted in a loss of business 
confidence with delayed hiring decisions 
which quickly impacted this purely permanent 
staffing market. Our net fee income was down 
50% over the year. We have restructured the 
business, with a reduced headcount and 
lower costs and believe it is right-sized for the 
local market moving into 2017. A small team 
has also started operating in the UK market,  
to help ex-pat candidates returning from the 
Middle East.

Revenue grew from £29.2m in 2015 to £77.3m 
in 2016, helped from July 2016 by our 
investment in Rishworth Aviation. The growth 
in net fee income was 31%, as Rishworth 
Aviation has a low temporary margin of 6%, so 
there is a greater impact on revenue. Although 
the temporary margin is low, the quality of the 
business is high with contractors on long-term 
assignments and the Company operating with 
a good conversion ratio. This investment 
made a positive contribution to profit, despite 
the legal and due diligence costs associated 
with the investment. It provides the Group with 
an entry to the Aviation sector and is one of 
the leading staffing companies in this niche 
sector. We expect it to deliver improved profits 
in 2017 as it contributes for the full year.

impact on profits. The future structure and 
funding of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain 
following the recent change in the US 
Government. This has been one of the drivers 
of growth in the healthcare sector in recent 
years, but the key underlying factors of an 
ageing population, rising obesity levels and 
good economic conditions continue to exist 
and we believe they will drive growing demand 
for healthcare over the medium term.
We also benefited from three months of trading 
from the ConSol Partners USA business.
In Chile, we were pleased with the continued 
growth, with the developing areas of 
permanent and temporary staffing delivering 
the highest growth and the traditional 
outsourcing business remaining solid.
The Monroe Consulting (Executive Search 
sector) operations in Mexico and Chile are 
slowly gaining traction in those markets, but 
progress is not as quick as we would like to 
see. We are closely monitoring the economic 
situation, especially in Mexico, following the 
new US Government’s approach to regional 
trade.

FINANCE REVIEW
A year of progress
The Board has 
proposed an 
increased dividend 
of 15%
A description of the performance of the 
business in the year is included in the 
Chairman’s statement and Chief  
Executive’s review.
Finance income and costs
Finance income was £0.1m (2015: £0.1m),  
all being bank interest income. Finance costs 
were £0.7m (2015: £0.6m), which primarily 
related to interest payable on invoice 
discounting, bank loans and overdrafts. It  
also included £0.1m of interest on the late 
payment of tax following conclusion of a tax 
audit in Germany.
Taxation
The total tax charge in the year is £3.5m 
(2015: £2.6m); representing an effective tax 
rate of 44% (2015: 36%). This rate is higher 
than the UK rate due to a number of factors:
 – The mix of profits is weighted towards 
higher tax jurisdictions, including Germany, 
Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand
 – A deferred tax asset has not been 
recognised for certain of the tax losses 
around the Group and the asset previously 
recognised for tax losses has reduced
 – The level of non-deductible expenses in the 
year, including the legal and due diligence 
costs related to the investments in 
Rishworth Aviation and ConSol Partners
Dividend
During the year, the Group paid a dividend  
of £0.5m in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2015, amounting to 1.0p per 
share. For the year ended 31 December 2016, 
the Board is proposing a dividend of 1.15p per 
share, which if approved by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 
31 May 2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 5 May 2017.
Impairment charges and release of 
contingent consideration
There is a credit to the income statement  
of £0.6m from the release of contingent 
consideration for Pharmaceutical Strategies. 
This is based on the current and expected 
trading level over the next year (being the 
period covered by the contingent 
consideration) and reflects our best estimate 
of the amount payable.
There is an impairment charge of £0.6m, 
following a review at year end of the 
recoverable amounts of the Group’s tangible 
and intangible assets.

This arose on the following companies:
 – BW&P operating in the Middle East. 
Following a slow-down in the local 
economy and contraction in the staffing 
market we have restructured the business, 
right-sizing it for the current conditions. We 
expect improved returns from this business 
in 2017, but due to the continuing 
uncertainties in the market we have fully 
impaired the intangibles and goodwill,  
an amount of £0.2m
 – Our training business in Indonesia, 
Learning Resources, has delivered a small 
profit in the year following restructuring in 
the prior year, turning around the losses 
incurred in 2015. However, we remain 
cautious on the prospects for growth in 
profit over the next few years and so have 
fully impaired the goodwill, an amount  
of £0.2m
 – In Japan our fashion retail brand, FINES, 
has delivered consistent results but profit 
levels are small. We have a clear plan to 
increase the profit level but there is 
uncertainty on how successful this will be. 
We have recognised an impairment charge 
against goodwill of £0.2m
Treasury and risk management
Treasury
The Group’s treasury function is managed 
centrally. Under the Group’s treasury policy 
speculative transactions are not permitted and 
where possible liabilities, typically debt, match 
the location and currency of the related 
assets. The following matters are reserved for 
Board approval:
 – Changes to the Group’s capital structure
 – Approval of Group financing arrangements 
or significant changes to existing 
arrangements
 – Approval of treasury policies and any 
activity involving forward contracts, 
derivatives, hedging activity and significant 
foreign currency exposures
 – Approving the appointment of any of the 
Group’s principal bankers
Treasury is managed to deal with the following 
risk areas.
Liquidity and funding risk
The Group maintains a range of appropriate 
facilities to manage its working capital and 
medium-term financing requirements. At the 
year end the Group had banking facilities 
totalling £52.0m (2015: £36.7m) with the 
increase mainly coming from the new 
revolving credit facility. We also increased 
overdraft and loan facilities overseas, and the 
UK invoice financing facility increased by 
£4.0m with ConSol Partners joining the Group 
and adding their facility. We aim to transfer 
them to our Group facility during the first  
half of 2017. The amount of facility undrawn  
of £15.4m (2015: £15.6m) excludes the 
headroom on the invoice financing facility, 
which is available to the UK companies only. 
At 30 June 2016 we entered into a new 
£10.0m revolving credit facility with HSBC 
Bank plc to provide investment funding. There 
is also a £5.0m accordion which has been 
agreed in principle by the bank but would 
need new credit approval for any draw down 
from this amount.

pilots or the client when their contract ends. 
When calculating our ‘debt to debtors’ ratio 
we exclude the cash held as pilot bonds and 
this net debt level was £15.7m (2015: £7.3m). 
The ‘debt to debtors’ ratio has increased to 
38%, from 23% last year due to the 
investment spend.

As part of the new revolving credit facility we 
need to meet bank covenant tests on a 
quarterly basis, the first test being for the 
quarter ended 30 June 2016. All tests have 
been met during the year. The covenants, and 
our performance against them at year end are 
as follows:
Covenant Target Actual
Net debt:EBITDA* < 2.75 times 0.6
Interest cover > 5.0 times 19.3
Debt service cover > 1.25 times 6.5
* Target started at 3.0, reducing to 2.75 from the quarter 
ended 31 December 2016 and to 2.5 from the quarter 
ended 31 December 2017
Interest rate risk
The Group’s bank facilities are subject to 
floating interest rates. This is expected to 
match the interest costs with the economic 
cycle (eg when interest rates are higher there 
is typically better economic growth and so for 
a cyclical industry such as recruitment, profits 
should be greater when the economy is 
performing positively). The overdraft and 
invoice financing facilities are used to fund 
working capital requirements for temporary 
recruitment businesses. During a downturn 
there is typically an unwinding of working 
capital as trade receivables are collected,  
so reducing the financing requirement and 
subsequent interest cost.
Within the UK Group the majority of bank 
accounts are included in a cash pooling 
arrangement. An interest optimisation model 
allows currency balances (including overdrafts) 
to be included within the cash pooling 
arrangement. With interest income not 
generally paid on current accounts, the  
Group aims to minimise the external interest 
cost by repatriating surplus funds from  
around the Group to minimise the use of the 
overdraft facilities. Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016
24
Finance costs were £0.7m (2015: £0.6m), 
which primarily related to interest payable on 
bank facilities but also included £0.1m for 
interest on late paid tax. The effective interest 
rate for bank facilities for the year was 2.6% 
(2015: 2.8%).
Foreign exchange risk
There was no foreign exchange from trading  
in the year (2015: gain of £161,000).
The Group remains open to translation risk 
from reporting overseas results in Sterling.  
We do not actively hedge this exposure, with 
the diversity of operations across different 
countries providing an element of natural 
hedge. During the year we were positively 
impacted by movements in exchange rates  
on the translation of Group results, the largest 
are detailed below:
Currency
Decline in 
Sterling in the 
year using 
average rates 
(P&L)
Japanese Yen 20%
Indonesian Rupiah 12%
US Dollar 12%
Australian Dollar 11%
Euro 11%
Chilean Peso 8%
There are a small number of forward  
currency contracts in place at IMS and ConSol 
Partners. The amount covered by these at 
year end was £0.6m (2015: Nil).
Credit risk
The main credit risks arise through the use of 
different banks across the Group and on the 
Group’s trade receivables. The credit ratings 
of the banks used within the Group are 
monitored with a target that no more than 
10% of Group cash is held in banks with a 
rating below BBB (Fitch rating) or equivalent. 
This target was fully met throughout the year.
Debtor days are reviewed monthly with high 
balances followed up with local management. 
Average debtor days for the Group in 2016 
were 47 (2015: 51), with a year end balance  
of 41 (2015: 52 days). These figures were 
helped by Rishworth Aviation joining the 
Group as they have low debtor days, with 
airlines typically paying either in advance or 
within a short period for pilot salary costs.  
On a comparative basis, excluding Rishworth 
Aviation, the year end and average Group 
debtor days were 52.
The debtor days in UAE remain higher than 
the Group average. The outstanding debtor 
balance has reduced, but with the poor 
economic conditions in the region we have 
seen a higher level of bad debt write off than 
normal. As a Group our bad debt expense 
was £0.6m in the year, up £0.3m on the  
prior year.

Management equity philosophy, minority 
interests and investments
Management equity philosophy
A key component of our business model is 
management equity, where senior 
management own shares directly in the 
operating companies they are responsible for. 
This is described in more detail below.
Senior management has the 
opportunity to retain or acquire 
shares in the operating company  
they are responsible for.
Management have the opportunity to 
create a meaningful capital value over time 
if they can grow the profit in their business. 
This works well with our decentralised 
structure, as the local management team 
run their business with a high level of 
operational autonomy.
This aligns the interests of 
management with Empresaria as a 
majority shareholder and it 
encourages a long-term view for the 
business. This is a key tool for both 
attracting good quality managers, 
as well as staff retention. 
Typical 5 year  
holding period
 –
 – At least 51% of the shares are 
owned by Empresaria
 – Shares are retained by managers 
or acquired at fair value
 – Shares can be offered for sale after a 
specified holding period
 – Shares are sold over a 2–3 year 
minimum period 
 – Decision to purchase the shares is at 
Empresaria’s sole discretion. No put 
options in place
 – Decision based on each specific situation, 
with consideration of the management 
succession plan in place, the recent 
trading performance and projections for 
growth in the next few years
 – Valuation basis agreed in 
shareholders agreement
 – The valuation is typically based on 
the average profit after tax for the 
previous three full years before the 
shares are sold, using the 
Empresaria trading multiple (share 
price divided by last EPS) less 0.5, 
to ensure it is earnings-accretive 
to Empresaria shareholders. The 
multiple is capped at a maximum 
of 10
FINANCE REVIEW CONTINUED
Where we acquire a majority stake in a business, the shares remaining with the founder are called ‘first generation shares’. There are no material 
changes to the rights belonging to these first generation shares retained by founder management. Our model also enables senior management to 
acquire ‘second generation shares’. This will often be when the first generation shares have been acquired by Empresaria and we want to 
incentivise the next tier of management in the operating company to grow its business to the next level. Management buy these second generation 
shares at market value, investing their own cash, which is at risk if the business does not perform. To help lower the market value of the second 
generation shares (to make it affordable for management to acquire a meaningful stake in the business they are responsible for) and to protect the 
profit that we have already acquired, we set a ‘threshold profit’ level for valuing second generation shares. These second generation shares only 
start creating value for management if the profit grows above the ‘threshold profit’ level. The second generation shares typically have restrictions, 
such as limited or no entitlement to dividends and the fair value paid by the management shareholder reflects these restricted rights. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Non-controlling interests
Based on the results for the year ended 
31 December 2016, the total value of all 
non-controlling interests (shares held by 
management in the operating companies they 
are responsible for), if purchased in full in 2017 
using the valuation mechanisms in existing 
shareholders agreements, would total £9.0m 
(2015: £3.6m, ignoring any potential discounts 
under the shareholders agreements. There is 
no obligation on the Group to acquire the 
shares held by management at any time.
In some situations the consideration payable 
under the shareholders agreement for second 
generation equity may be greater than the fair 
value of the shares under IFRS 13, where there 
are restrictions over the rights of the shares, 
typically over dividends. The valuation 
mechanism in the shareholders agreements 
uses an earnings multiple, which does not 
differentiate between shares with restricted 
rights and those without restrictions. If the price 
paid for the shares is in excess of this fair value, 
this additional amount paid is recognised as a 
charge in the income statement. These charges 
are treated as adjusting items when presenting 
the adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit 
before tax and adjusted earnings per share.
In June 2016 we increased our shareholding  
in Monroe Consulting (Thailand) by 10%, taking 
our interest up to 70%. The consideration of 
£0.2m was paid in cash, which was charged  
in the income statement (2015: £Nil). Based  
on the results for the year ended 31 December 
2016, for those shares with restricted rights,  
the amount payable using the valuation 
mechanisms in the existing shareholders 
agreements that is in excess of the fair value,  
if purchased fully in 2017 would total £2.4m 
(2015: £1.3m), ignoring any potential discounts 
under the shareholders agreements.
In April 2016 we increased our interest in Ball 
and Hoolahan (IT & Design sector in the UK) 
from 75% to 100%, acquiring first generation 
shares from the founder who left the business 
as part of a planned transfer of ownership. The 
consideration was £0.2m, all paid in cash and 
accounted for as an increase in our investment.
During the year ended 31 December 2016, 
management acquired second generation 
shares in the Headway Group of companies, 
Pharmaceutical Strategies and Monroe 
Consulting (Malaysia). These shares all  
have restricted rights. Details of the share 
percentage held by the Group can be found in 
note 6 to the accounts of the Parent Company.
Investments and disposals
During the year, the Group made the following 
investments:
 – On 5 July 2016 we invested in 82.6% of  
the shares in Rishworth Aviation. Total 
consideration was US$10.0m (£7.5m), paid 
fully in cash on completion. The remaining 
17.4% interest is held by the senior 
management team in line with our 
management equity philosophy. 
Management have entered into our 
standard shareholders’ agreement, with 
shares expected to be held for a minimum 
holding period of three to four years before 
they can be offered for sale, over a 
minimum of a further two years, with no 
obligation on Empresaria to acquire them
 – On 6 October 2016 we invested in 65% of 
the shares in ConSol Partners. Total 
consideration was £9.5m, with £3.9m paid in 
cash on completion and a deferred amount 
of £5.6m payable in the first quarter of 2017 . 
In January 2017 £3.2m was paid in cash and 
a further £2.4m is expected to be paid before 
the end of March 2017 . Management have 
entered into our standard shareholders’ 
agreement, with shares expected to be held 
for a minimum holding period of three to four 
years before they can be offered for sale, 
over a minimum of a further two years,  
with no obligation on Empresaria to  
acquire them
A deferred consideration payment of £3.0m 
was paid in cash in relation to the acquisition 
of Pharmaceutical Strategies in October 2015. 
No further payments are expected under this 
agreement, with a £0.6m release in the year 
ended 31 December 2016 to reflect our best 
estimate of the amount payable.
The Group received £0.1m in deferred 
consideration from disposals made in 2013 of 
the Bar 2 payroll business and in March 2015 
of the GiT business. 
Cash flow
Net debt increased by £3.2m in the year to 
£10.5m (2015: £7.3m). The main areas of 
expenditure were on business investments,  
a net £6.4m including cash acquired as part  
of the investment of £7.9m. This includes cash 
held for pilot bonds, which is £5.2m at year 
end. These bonds are repayable to the pilot or 
client over the period of the pilot contract and 
a corresponding liability is recognised on the 
balance sheet. There was also capital 
expenditure on fixed assets of £0.8m, 
dividends to shareholders of £0.5m, with a net 
£0.4m working capital inflow. Tax payments 
were £4.7m, significantly up on the prior year, 
through a combination of increasing profits 
and the conclusion of a tax audit requiring an 
additional tax payment.
Post balance sheet events
There were no post balance sheet events.
Going concern
The Board has undertaken a recent and 
thorough review of the Group’s budget, 
forecasts and associated risks and 
sensitivities. The Group’s UK and German 
overdraft facilities were renewed in February 
2017 for a further 12 months. Given the 
business forecasts and early trading 
performance, the Group is expected to be 
able to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future, being a period of at 
least 12 months from the date of approval of 
the accounts. As a result, the going concern 
basis continues to be appropriate in preparing 
the financial statements. Further details on 
going concern are found in note 1.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Delivering on our numbers
This demonstrates return to 
shareholders, in line with our 
strategy of delivering a 
sustainable growth in earnings 
per share.
The variable remuneration of the 
Executive Directors (annual bonus) 
This demonstrates how much 
cash is available for the Group  
to cover tax, financing and 
investments. It is measured as  
the operating profit of the Group, 
excluding non-cash items and 
including working capital 
movements.
Sustainable growth in net fee 
income is needed to deliver 
long-term growth in net profit 
and earnings per share. 
This demonstrates how efficiently 
the business is operating and how 
well the cost base is being 
managed. It is calculated as the 
percentage of adjusted operating 
profit out of net fee income.

This demonstrates how many 
senior managers around the 
Group are incentivised through 
equity ownership in their 
companies, a key element  
of our business model.
This demonstrates how much of 
the business is from professional 
and specialist positions.
Target: We want to maximise our 
exposure to professional and 
specialist job levels as these are 
generally higher margin sectors 
This demonstrates the overall staff 
productivity, calculated as the 
ratio of net fee income generated 
per £1 of staff cost. The staff  
cost includes all sales and 
administrative staff, reflecting the 
true cost of operating the Group.
This demonstrates how leveraged 
the Group is. The Group needs a 
sound financial foundation for 
long-term sustainability and to be 
able to react to opportunities in 
the market. 
Target: All brands have 
management holding equity.
Progress: The total number of 
managers holding equity in their 
company is 57, up 15 on the prior 
year. Currently one brand has no 
management holding equity 
(2015: two).

Progress: At 1.79 in 2016 we have 
seen an improvement  
over 2016.
Target: To reduce this to 25%  
by 2018.
Progress: By adding back the pilot 
bonds of £5.2m, this increased to 
38% from 23% in the prior year, so 
is now above our target.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Managing our risk
Impact on business
The Group’s businesses are subject to legislation, regulations and changes in 
political sentiment in each of their locations. In particular, this impacts temporary 
recruitment which is regulated to protect the rights and treatment of temporary 
workers and in developing staffing markets where new regulations are introduced 
as the market develops. Any changes to labour regulations, tax laws or political 
views on the staffing industry could impact on the manner in which any business, or 
the Group as a whole, conducts its business and could therefore affect the financial 
performance of the Group. In some territories a recruitment licence is required. If 
local laws and regulations are not followed it could lead to sanctions being taken 
against the Company, including penalties, fines and licences being revoked.
Social changes impact how people search for jobs and where they are likely to live. Our 
businesses need to target the locations where people want to work. They need to be 
able to identify and communicate with candidates to ensure job vacancies are filled.
The performance of staffing businesses has historically shown a strong correlation 
with the performance of the economies in which they operate. An economic 
slowdown will impact on the demand for recruitment services and could reduce  
the Group’s profits.
The Group’s success relies on recruiting and retaining 
senior management and other key employees. 
The loss of a key staff member without a suitable 
successor in place could lead to a reduction in trading  
and profitability. The choice of the wrong manager for  
a business could lead to sub-optimal decision-making  
and losing ground to competitors or failing to operate 
procedures properly and so being liable to fines  
or penalties.
Changes in risk profile in the year
No change
In the UK there is new legislation planned for 2017 which will increase costs for 
staffing agencies, in particular the Apprenticeship Levy (from April 2017) and 
changes to IR35 (for the public sector). The impact on the Group of these is 
expected to be small but demonstrates the continued trend of legislation impacting 
the staffing industry.
In the USA President Trump has said he plans to make changes to the Affordable 
Care Act. At this stage it is not clear what changes, if any, will actually be made, but 
any changes could negatively impact the Pharmaceutical Strategies business in 2017.
In Germany there is new legislation starting in April 2017 which will limit the length 
of time a worker can be a temporary worker to 18 months and new minimum wage 
regulations. This could have a short-term negative impact on the demand for 
temporary labour services or reduce margins for this work.
There are elections coming up in Germany and Chile in 2017. Also elections in 
France and the Netherlands could have an impact on the stability of the Euro zone.
Increased
The global economy overall is expected to grow in 2017. However, the economic 
recovery is not symmetrical across the world and there are always risks that 
threaten these forecasts. 
In the UK the Government has announced it will invoke Article 50 in the first quarter 
of 2017, to start the process of leaving the EU. Whilst this has been taken into 
account in economic forecasts, the full impact is unknown and could lead to 
economic instability, especially in the short term.
In the USA the election of President Trump could lead to protectionist trade policies 
which could impact on global economic growth. 
The oil price at current levels continues to impact on the economies of the Middle 
East in particular.
Reduced
We have increased the number of management holding 
equity in the period. 
We have invested in two new brands in the last year.
There have been a number of changes in management 
during 2016 which we believe will help their brands to 
develop positively in 2017.
Actions taken to mitigate risk
The Group closely monitors the legal and regulatory environment in our markets,  
in particular where we operate temporary recruitment as this is an area with greater 
levels of regulations. The Group has membership of many local industry 
associations and we use professional advisers with good local knowledge and 
understanding of the relevant laws and labour regulations to ensure we are 
compliant in the territories in which we operate. 
Our strategy is designed to minimise the negative impact from any political and 
social changes:
 – Diversification and balance across sectors and regions helps to reduce the 
potential impact in any one area
 – Focus on professional and specialist job levels reduces the exposure to changes 
in legislation, which are typically introduced to protect the most vulnerable and 
lowest paid workers
 – Focus on key economic centres means we are targeting the main centres where 
candidates want to work
By developing leading brands in our sectors we are experts in our markets, 
helping us to react to changes in legislation, as well as making it easier to attract 
candidates because of our reputation and knowledge.
The Group’s strategy is designed to minimise the negative impact from an 
economic downturn in any one market, whilst acknowledging that a significant 
economic downturn will impact all businesses:
 – Sector and geographic diversification
This was improved in the year by investments in Rishworth Aviation and  
ConSol Partners
 – Develop core brands
By creating more robust businesses they should be able to better withstand any 
economic downturn 
We focus on temporary recruitment as this is typically less volatile than permanent 
recruitment during the economic cycles. Overall our exposure to permanent 
recruitment has reduced in the year which reduces this risk.
The Group’s business model is based on management 
equity, so incentivising key management through equity 
ownership and tying them to the business for the long 
term. We monitor the number of managers with equity in 
their own businesses and work with existing shareholders 
to identify key staff to purchase equity in the future.
Currently there is one brand in the Group with no 
management shareholder (2015: two brands).

The risk management process consists of a Group risk register which is reviewed by the Board at each meeting with risks added, amended or 
removed as appropriate and actions updated. The Group register is prepared based on individual brand registers which are updated during the 
annual budget cycle and reviewed regularly during the year with senior management at brand-level Board meetings. 
The Audit Committee reviews the control framework which helps to mitigate the risks. Group companies operate under a system of internal 
controls which includes, but is not limited to, a clear delegated authority to operational management, formal risk appraisals through the annual 
budget process, a comprehensive financial reporting system, investment evaluation and significant capital expenditure approval process and  
the self-certification by operating company management of compliance with controls and Group policies and procedures.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
Managing our risk
Impact on business
There is a risk of losing value from poorly executed investments. If an investment is 
overvalued the Group will pay too much for it and risks a lower return in the future 
from profits being generated. A poorly executed integration into the Group could 
lead to lost value or lost opportunities. 
Organic investments in new offices will generally be loss making in the first 1–2 
years so this needs to be carefully managed to minimise the costs to the business. 
New office openings increase the risk of lower returns than planned if costs are not 
managed well.
The Group is reliant on debt financing to fund the working capital of  
the business.
By operating in 19 countries the Group is exposed to movements in 
foreign currency rates. The Group reports in Sterling but has 
operations in countries with different currencies. Negative movements 
in exchange rates would impact the reporting of Group profitability and 
may devalue the cash and assets around the Group.
If the Group was unable to secure funding at current levels it could be 
forced to dispose of parts of the business to repay the existing debt. 
An increase in interest rates will increase costs and so reduce the profit 
in the business.
The risk of cyber-attacks has increased in the wider business 
environment, so there are threats from hackers, viruses or sensitive 
information being accessed without authorisation. 
A successful breach could lead to the loss of sensitive data on clients 
or candidates, damage to our brand reputation, business disruption or 
the loss of commercially sensitive information.
With increasingly stringent regulatory environments around data 
protection there is an ongoing risk of failing to comply with regulations, 
leading to fines and damage to brand reputation.
Changes in risk profile in the year
Increased
We have made two external investments in 2016 and continue to follow an ‘invest 
and develop’ strategy to grow the Group.
In 2017 we plan to open a new office in Vietnam with the Monroe Consulting brand.
We continue to look for new investment opportunities to benefit the Group.
Increased
In 2016 we have benefited from movements in currency rates to 
translate results into our reporting currency, however, we have seen 
high levels of currency volatility and this is expected to continue  
in 2017.
The Group’s total debt has increased during 2016 following external 
investments made and is now above our target rate of 25% of trade 
receivables. We intend to reduce this over 2017 but we are now more 
exposed to changes in interest rates. The US Federal Reserve started 
to raise interest rates at the end of 2016. During March 2017, The US 
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 25 basis points.
Increased
There have been a number of high profile cyber-attacks reported in 
2016. The threat from this is always changing and as we grow our 
brands in size, they are more likely to be a target for hackers and 
criminals.
New legislation is proposed to be introduced in May 2018 (General 
Data Protection Regulation), which introduces new rights for individuals 
and promotes good data governance and accountability amongst 
organisations. This is likely to lead to changes in how the Group 
companies operate and there are significant fines for non-compliance.
Actions taken to mitigate risk
All investments, whether organic or external, must have Board approval. 
Investments must have a clearly defined integration plan, with responsibility for 
implementation of the plan with the Executive Directors. Due diligence findings 
need to be acted upon to minimise any risks identified pre-acquisition. Any funding 
requirements must be taken into account for Group cash flow forecasts to ensure 
sufficient and appropriate funding is in place.
When investing in organic growth or bolt-on acquisitions for existing brands it is key 
that local management are fully involved and driving the process to ensure the best 
chance of success. 
With any investment activity the fit of the people is the most important factor. This is 
especially important in our Group where there is a highly decentralised structure. 
This is the first criteria that must be met before any investment activity is pursued.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of cash reserves 
from retained profit, bank borrowings and issuing new equity. Treasury 
management is led by the Group finance team, which manages and 
monitors external and internal funding requirements and maintains the 
key Group banking relationships. 
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates for its primary 
facilities. The Group does not currently hedge this exposure but 
monitors movements in the relevant interest rates to be able to react if 
the rates move adversely.
Approximately two thirds of the Group’s business is transacted outside 
of the UK so we are exposed to movements in exchange rates. The 
Group does not currently hedge translation risk as there is to some 
degree a natural hedge from our strategy of being diversified by region. 
Intra-Group balances are hedged, where possible, using cash or 
overdraft balances to act as a natural currency hedge, for US Dollar, 
Euro, Japanese Yen, Singapore Dollar and Australian Dollar. 
A limited number of forward contracts have been used to hedge 
trading currency risks for IMS and ConSol Partners.
We have policies in place to safeguard assets and data within the 
Group. We also use external advisers to monitor the security of our 
Group websites and systems to meet a minimum standard of security 
and we continue to monitor ongoing cyber-security threats.
We are reviewing the new GDPR legislation to ensure that all Group 
companies are compliant by May 2018.

especially important in our Group where there is a highly decentralised structure. 
This is the first criteria that must be met before any investment activity is pursued.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of cash reserves 
from retained profit, bank borrowings and issuing new equity. Treasury 
management is led by the Group finance team, which manages and 
monitors external and internal funding requirements and maintains the 
key Group banking relationships. 
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates for its primary 
facilities. The Group does not currently hedge this exposure but 
monitors movements in the relevant interest rates to be able to react if 
the rates move adversely.
Approximately two thirds of the Group’s business is transacted outside 
of the UK so we are exposed to movements in exchange rates. The 
Group does not currently hedge translation risk as there is to some 
degree a natural hedge from our strategy of being diversified by region. 
Intra-Group balances are hedged, where possible, using cash or 
overdraft balances to act as a natural currency hedge, for US Dollar, 
Euro, Japanese Yen, Singapore Dollar and Australian Dollar. 
A limited number of forward contracts have been used to hedge 
trading currency risks for IMS and ConSol Partners.
We have policies in place to safeguard assets and data within the 
Group. We also use external advisers to monitor the security of our 
Group websites and systems to meet a minimum standard of security 
and we continue to monitor ongoing cyber-security threats.
We are reviewing the new GDPR legislation to ensure that all Group 
companies are compliant by May 2018.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

social responsibility is an important part 
of the Group’s culture and looks to

Our staff Candidates, clients, suppliers  
and shareholders
Making it a good place to work with 
opportunities to develop skills and 
experience to improve staff careers 
As a diversified international business, we recognise the 
importance of working in a culturally sensitive way with local 
communities and follow non-discriminatory employment policies. 
We encourage the employment of local nationals at all levels in  
the Group.
Employees are selected and promoted on the basis of merit and 
ability, regardless of age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation 
or disability.
The Group recognises the need to provide a safe working 
environment for its staff and clients. Each office is responsible for 
ensuring that their business operates in compliance with Group 
policies and local health and safety legislation.
The Group operates an employee exchange programme which 
allows staff to spend between a week and a month working in an 
office of another Group company in another country, to learn how 
their business operates and to swap ideas and best practice. 
The Group communicates with staff by providing regular Group 
news through a quarterly newsletter. News is also made available 
on its intranet site, which also stores key Group policies and 
procedures.
Upholding high ethical and  
corporate governance standards, 
promoting integrity in dealing with  
all stakeholders
Empresaria’s business is all about finding people jobs and so 
helping them develop their careers. This is important to enable 
people to provide for themselves and their families and we aim  
to provide candidates and clients with the best possible service. 
The Group actively promotes integrity in its dealings with 
employees, shareholders, customers and suppliers and the 
authorities of the countries in which it operates. Empresaria 
recognises that its reputation is a valuable asset gained over  
a long period.
The Group promotes high ethical standards in carrying on its 
business activities and has a Code of Conduct for dealing with 
gifts, hospitality, corruption, fraud and the use of inside 
information. All staff must comply with the laws and regulations  
of the country in which they operate.
The Group aims to provide a high quality service to clients  
and candidates alike and seeks to build strong and lasting 
relationships with both parties. The Group ensures that advertising 
and public communications avoid untruths or overstatements. 
Empresaria builds relationships with suppliers based on mutual 
trust and undertakes to pay suppliers on time and in accordance 
with agreed terms of business.
The Group builds relationships with candidates based on trust and 
quality of service. It recognises that information about candidates 
is sensitive and confidential and must be kept securely and not 
disclosed without a candidate’s permission. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

The Board gives due consideration to risks arising from 
social, environmental and ethical issues as part of its 
ongoing risk review process. We have a responsibility 
towards all stakeholders and believe this is an important 
consideration for the long-term growth of the business.
Local communities Society at large
A positive contributor  
to the community 
 
The Group and senior management are fully supportive and encourage staff to  
work with their local communities and charitable concerns. The decision on what 
contribution to make is down to the local staff in each country.
Group companies are involved in a range of activities to provide help, support or 
money to local communities in their country of operation. Some examples of the 
work being done are detailed below.
In Indonesia staff at Monroe Consulting donated their performance awards and 
additional items for everyday use to an orphanage for impoverished, abandoned 
children in Jakarta. They also provide financial support a local charity MAIN, set  
up to promote child health. The team also volunteered to work at a health clinic  
for disadvantaged children at the Bantar Gebang rubbish dump in Jakarta.
In the Philippines the team adopted 16 special needs children for a day of fun at  
a therapeutic summer camp organised by the PVI Foundation, whilst in Thailand  
the team spent a day organising and engaging in fun activities with up to 120 
underprivileged children for the Gift of Happiness Foundation. They then provided 
lunch and distributed clothing to the children.
In the UK LMA work with the Blackfriars Settlement, running employability clinics  
to help train people that are either long-term unemployed, disadvantaged or have 
mental illness. Staff provide advice on how to write CVs, how to go about a job 
search and how to conduct themselves in an interview. Staff at Mansion House 
raised money for charities through volunteer work, fun runs and bake sales.
At Become consultants work with ‘Pitch It’, a social enterprise aiming to help students 
from less advantaged backgrounds connect with London’s creative industries.  
A consultant mentors a student, providing support through face-to-face meetings.
In Mexico the Monroe Consulting team provided free recruitment services to  
a non-profit children’s home.
In India the IMS team are involved in a range of activities from giving blood, fund 
raising events and donating books, clothes and other basic necessities to local 
deprived children.
In the USA, staff at Pharmaceutical Strategies donate new toys as part of the ‘Toys for 
Tots’ programme run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve, which distributes 
toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas.
Environmental  
impact 
 
Whilst it is recognised that the Group operates in 
a business sector that has a low environmental 
impact, the Group remains committed to 
minimising its impact on the environment. The 
Group is aware that this is an area of increasing 
importance to employees, shareholders and 
customers alike. The Group is not involved in the 
manufacture of any tangible products and has 
identified the principal areas of environmental 
impact as energy use, waste recycling, paper 
and printing and travel. 
The Group encourages the recycling of office 
waste and waste paper and has seen a 
continued reduction in the use of printed 
materials around the Group by increasingly 
relying on electronic media for its primary 
marketing activity. The full Annual Report is also 
provided to the majority of shareholders in an 
electronic format to further reduce our printing 
costs and environmental impact, with a much 
smaller summary report sent to all shareholders.
As an internationally diverse group we recognise 
that some travel is inevitable and necessary  
for the effective management of the business, 
however, full use is made of telephonic 
conference facilities and working from home  
to minimise this as far as is practical. Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
Union and the AIM rules and have chosen to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 (‘FRS 102’). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group’s financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website 
(empresaria.com). Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
1. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
2. the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
3. the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 21 March 
2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Corporate governance
Since listing on AIM in late 2004, the Group has developed and grown 
in line with its strategic aims, significantly increasing its geographical 
and sector spread. The Board recognises that with this growth comes 
the need to provide a sound framework of corporate governance. The 
Board is therefore committed to the continued review, implementation 
and development of corporate governance practices, which will help 
support the Group businesses as the Board continues to deliver its 
strategic objectives for the benefit of shareholders over the longer term.

* The Board held nine scheduled meetings in the year which were attended by all 
Directors. There were also three meetings outside the normal course of events, 
which were each attended by all Directors
Division of responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer, with no one individual having unfettered powers 
of decision. The statement of division of responsibilities can be found 
on the Company’s website (empresaria.com).
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the running of the Board. The 
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for implementing Group strategy.
The Chairman
The Board is led by the Chairman. The Chairman has not been 
considered as independent from the date of his appointment, due to 
his significant shareholding in the Company. 
All meetings have a pre-agreed formal agenda setting out those 
matters for discussion, together with supporting papers. Time is 
allocated at all meetings to discuss any other business, which all 
Directors are invited by the Chairman to raise. 
Non-Executive Directors
Director’s biographies can be found on pages 34 and 35. The Board 
believe that both Zach Miles and Penny Freer continue to be 
independent. 
All Non-Executive Directors participate in strategy development and 
decisions required to implement actions to progress towards meeting 
the objectives of the Company. 
Effectiveness
Composition of the Board
The Board has a balance and depth of skills and experience, together 
with suitable knowledge of the Group, to enable them to discharge 
their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. Biographies of 
the Directors can be found on pages 34 and 35.
Conflicts of interest of all Directors are reviewed on an annual basis and 
Directors have continuing obligations to update the Board on any 
changes to these conflicts. Situations which may create a conflict of 
interest are presented to the Board for review and approval as 
appropriate.
Independence
The independence of all Non-Executive Directors is reviewed on an 
annual basis, with reference to their independence of character and 
judgement and whether any circumstances or relationships exist that 
could affect their judgement. The review of independence is also 
considered in relation to Committee memberships in line with 
recommendations of the Code. The Board considers that Penny Freer 
and Zach Miles continue to remain independent. For Penny Freer, who 
has served for 11 years as a Director, the Board note in particular her 
skills and external experience as well as her involvement and insight in 
Board meetings and considers that her period of service does not 
affect her independence. Penny holds a shareholding in the Company 
but the Board considers this to be highly immaterial and considers that 
this does not affect her independence. The Chairman, Tony Martin, is 
considered to remain non-independent due to his significant 
shareholding in the Company.
Appointments to the Board
A Nomination Committee is in place to review the appointment of new 
Directors. No new Directors have been appointed since the Committee 
was formed. 
Details of the work of the Nomination Committee can be found in the 
Nomination Committee report on page 46.
Commitment
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of 
appointment, which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and at the Annual General Meeting.
The annual time commitments are as follows:
 – Chairman – not less than 25 days
 – Non-Executive Directors – not less than 20 days
During 2016 Penny Freer served four additional days. The time 
commitments were reviewed by the Nomination Committee, which was 
satisfied with the current letters of appointment. 
Neither Executive Director holds any external Non-Executive Director 
role.

Development
All Directors determine the training requirements appropriate to their 
role and the needs of the Company’s business. Examples of events 
attended include the attendance by the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer at two annual Staffing Industry Analysts Executive Conferences 
and workshops, in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and in London. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee has attended seminars on 
Governance, Risk and Internal Assurance. The Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee attended several seminars delivered by 
Deloitte LLP on audit, corporate governance, remuneration and 
succession planning, as well as attending one-on-one sessions with 
industry experts at a specialist remuneration consultancy. 
Developments in corporate governance are reported to the Board by 
the Company Secretary. It has not been deemed necessary to 
formalise a training and development programme for each Director.
Information and support
Prior to the beginning of each year, Board meetings are scheduled in 
line with the key financial reporting dates. A more detailed agenda, 
together with the Board papers, is distributed in a timely manner before 
each Board meeting. All Directors receive sufficient relevant information 
on financial, business and corporate issues to enable informed 
decisions to be taken by them at the Board meetings. Any specific 
actions arising during meetings are agreed by the Board and a 
follow-up procedure monitors their completion. Monthly financial and 
operational reviews are distributed to the Board, irrespective of whether 
a scheduled meeting is to take place. This assists the Board to keep 
informed of developments on a regular basis.
The Directors are able to take independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties if necessary.
Evaluation
The Board has considered the benefits from undertaking formal 
evaluations of its performance and those of its Committees and 
individual Directors. Formal Executive Director performance evaluations 
are conducted annually in preparation for the review and approval of 
the annual remuneration packages. Each Non-Executive Director’s 
performance is evaluated as an outcome of the formal performance 
evaluations of the Committee(s) of which they are a member.
The Audit and Remuneration Committees oversee an annual self-
evaluation process, which is used by the Board and by each 
Committee to determine their effectiveness and opportunities for 
improvement. Further details of the Committee performance reviews 
can be found in the Audit Committee report as set out on page 42 and 
the Directors’ remuneration report as set out on pages 43 to 45.
The Board considers that the evaluation of the Executive Directors and 
the Committees provides an appropriate review of each Director’s 
performance in relation to their specific roles. A formal evaluation of 
Board performance has not been deemed necessary due to the size 
and composition of the Board.
Re-election
All Directors, in accordance with the Code, submit themselves for 
re-election at least once every three years. Any Directors appointed to 
the Board during the year will submit themselves for re-election at the 
next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. In 
accordance with the Articles, one third of the Board is required to retire 
by rotation each year.
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, Spencer Wreford was re-elected 
to the Board. At the 2017 Annual General Meeting, Tony Martin will 
retire and offer himself for re-election, having been last appointed by 
shareholders on 22 May 2014.
Summary of the Directors’ appointments by shareholders:

Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Board reviews and approves all reports on the Company’s position 
and prospects to present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy. This includes reports of a statutory and regulatory nature, 
as required by the AIM rules, which are of a price-sensitive nature.
Risk management and internal control 
Risk management remains the responsibility of the Board. The Audit 
Committee has delegated responsibility to keep under review the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial 
controls and internal control and risk management system. Risk 
management is reviewed at every Board meeting as part of the formal 
Board process.
The Board has identified and evaluated the significant risks faced by 
the Group for the delivery of the Group strategy. The Board has agreed 
how each risk is to be addressed and the necessary actions to be 
taken. Details of the principal risks identified are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 28 to 31. 
The Audit Committee meets specifically to review the effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and to 
review the Group and subsidiary risks identified and progress of 
actions taken to manage the risks. Following the review, progress and 
actions are reported to the Board. A separate Audit Committee report 
is set out on page 42 and provides details of the role and activities of 
the Audit Committee and its relationship with the external auditor.
Remuneration
The level and components of remuneration and procedure
A separate Directors’ remuneration report is set out on pages 43 to 45 
and provides details of the remuneration policy, level and components 
of remuneration and procedure for fixing the individual remuneration 
packages of individual Directors.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The Directors seek to maintain a mutual understanding of objectives 
between the Company and its shareholders by:
 – making annual and interim presentations to institutional investors;
 – meeting shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain their 
views;
 – presenting to shareholders at externally run events; and
 – communicating regularly during the year.
Relations with shareholders are managed principally by the Chief 
Executive Officer and Group Finance Director. The views of 
shareholders are communicated to the Board as a whole through 
regular Board meetings and communication between meetings. 
Although primary responsibility for effective communication with 
shareholders lies with the Chairman, the Executive Directors prepare 
presentations for institutional and private investors following the interim 
and preliminary announcements. The annual and interim presentations 
made to investors are made available to all shareholders on the 
Company’s website, as well as any recorded interviews with the 
Executive Directors.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate 
with shareholders. Shareholders are encouraged to participate in the 
Annual General Meetings, at which the Chairman presents updates on 
the Group’s performance. The Board, together with the Chairmen of 
the Committees, will be available at the 2017 Annual General Meeting 
to answer questions from shareholders.

Role and composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, to 
monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, review 
the adequacy of internal control and risk management systems and 
oversee the relationship with the external auditor. The terms of 
reference for the Audit Committee can be found on the Company’s 
website (empresaria.com). 
The Audit Committee makes whatever recommendations to the Board 
it deems appropriate, on any area within its remit, where action or 
improvement is needed.
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the independent 
Non-Executive Directors of the Company, with a minimum requirement 
of two such Directors, one of whom should be a financially qualified 
member. Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board and 
are for a period of up to three years, which may be extended for further 
periods of up to three years, provided the Director still meets the criteria 
for membership of the Committee. The independent Non-Executive 
Directors who served on the Committee during the year are:
Name
Date of appointment to the 
Committee Qualification
Zach Miles (Chairman) 1 October 2008 Chartered accountant
Penny Freer 2 November 2011
Director’s biographies can be found on pages 34 and 35.
Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet formally twice per year. 
During 2016, the Committee held five formal meetings, which were 
scheduled around the financial reporting timetable. Since the beginning 
of 2017 to the date of this report the Committee has met twice to fulfil 
its responsibilities including those relating to the 2016 audit process.
The Audit Committee invites the Group Finance Director and senior 
representatives of the external auditor to attend all of its meetings, 
although it reserves the right to request any of these individuals to 
withdraw from the meeting.
Audit Committee activity
Financial and business reporting
Since the beginning of 2016 to the date of this report, the Audit 
Committee has reviewed the 2015 and 2016 financial statements, the 
2016 interim statement (unaudited) and carried out a going concern 
review. Reviews of the financial statements included the accounting 
policies, significant financial reporting issues and key judgements and 
estimates underpinning the financial statements, including:
 – going concern;
 – carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and investments; 
 – accounting for investments and disposals;
 – appropriateness of provision balances; 
 – tax accounting, including deferred tax assets value; and
 – deferred and contingent consideration.
For going concern and the carrying value of goodwill and investments, 
the Committee examined the assumptions supporting the Group’s 
profit and cash flow forecasts and the sensitivities applied to those 
forecasts, the banking facilities available and the assessment of the 
Group’s covenant compliance based on the forecasts. Details of the 
matters reviewed are included in notes 3 and 14.
For the other key judgements and estimates, the Committee was satisfied 
with the assumptions made and the accounting treatments adopted.
During the year the Audit Committee oversaw an enquiry from the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Conduct Committee (FRC) relating to the 
2014 annual report and accounts. All observations made have been 
suitably addressed; disclosures have been revised in the 2016 annual 
report and accounts where necessary and the enquiry concluded 
satisfactorily.
Risk management and internal control
Risk management is the responsibility of the Board. Further details 
about the process followed and principal risks and uncertainties that 
could affect business operations can be found in the Strategic Report 
on pages 28 to 31. The Audit Committee keep under review the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and risk 
management systems.
Due to the size of the Group, and the costs involved, the Audit 
Committee continues to recommend to the Board that there is no 
requirement for a separate internal audit function; however, during 
2016, an independent audit firm was engaged to conduct testing of 
internal controls for the Group’s UK subsidiaries. Following this 
successful trial, the Audit Committee is looking at options to extend 
this across the wider Group. A summary of the internal controls for 
Group companies is presented to the Audit Committee, including 
updates on the resolution of any control weaknesses identified.
Every year the Audit Committee review the Group’s treasury policy, for 
approval by the Board. The Audit Committee also review the Group’s 
risk framework reports, to be presented to and discussed by the 
Board. 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy contains arrangements for the 
Company Secretary to receive, in confidence, complaints on 
accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing issues and related 
matters. 
The Group has a mandatory Code of Conduct, which sets out the 
minimum expected behaviours for all employees. A copy of this can be 
found on the Company’s website (empresaria.com).
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external audit. 
The Terms of Reference assign responsibility to the Audit Committee 
for overseeing the relationship with the external auditor. During 2016, 
the Audit Committee has continued to manage the relationship with the 
external auditor, including in relation to the 2015 and 2016 Audit 
Committee reports.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor. The Group’s policy on non-audit related 
services prescribes the types of engagements for which the external 
auditor can be used and those engagements which are prohibited. For 
engagement for services which are non-recurring in nature, prior 
approval must be sought from the Audit Committee.
Note 7 includes disclosure of the auditor’s remuneration for the year, 
including an analysis of audit services, audit related services and other 
non-audit services under those headings prescribed by law. 
Deloitte LLP was first appointed as the Company’s auditor in October 
2002. Following an external tender process during 2013 Deloitte LLP 
was reappointed for the 2014 and subsequent audits, resulting in a 
current tenure of 14 years. 
Following completion of the 2016 audit process, the Audit Committee 
is satisfied with the performance of Deloitte LLP and has 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP is reappointed.
Assessment of the Audit Committee
Following completion of the 2016 audit process, the Audit Committee 
conducted a self-assessment of its performance during the year. The 
evaluation process measured performance against its Terms of 
Reference including:
 – Presentation of compliance reports by the Compliance Officer
 – Review and implementation of risk management processes by 
subsidiaries
 – Ongoing, regular reviews of internal controls
 – Monitoring developments in corporate governance and compliance
The Board concluded that the Audit Committee has acted in 
accordance with its Terms of Reference and had ensured the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the work of the 
Committee.

The Board has considered the principles of Schedule 8 to the Accounting 
Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 and has complied where 
practical and where it supports the Board’s policies. This Directors’ 
remuneration report meets the relevant requirements of the AIM rules and 
describes how the Board has applied, where appropriate, the principles 
relating to Directors’ remuneration in the Code. 
A resolution to approve the Directors’ remuneration report will be 
proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting. The Companies Act 
2006 requires the auditor to report to the Company’s members on 
certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and to state whether 
in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The Directors’ 
remuneration report has therefore been divided into separate sections 
for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Role and composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility, on behalf of the 
Board, for setting the remuneration policy for all Executive Directors 
and the Company’s Chairman and recommending and monitoring the 
level and structure of remuneration for senior management. The Terms 
of Reference for the Remuneration Committee can be found on the 
Company’s website (empresaria.com). 
The Remuneration Committee is required to report to the Board on its 
proceedings after each meeting on all matters within its duties and 
responsibilities.
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board from the 
independent Non-Executive Directors, with a minimum requirement of 
two such Directors. No Director is involved in any decisions as to their 
own remuneration.
The independent Non-Executive Directors who served on the 
Remuneration Committee during the year were:
Name Date of appointment to the Committee
Penny Freer (Chairman) 13 December 2005
Zach Miles 1 October 2008
Meetings
The Remuneration Committee is required to meet at such times as the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee shall require. During 2016, 
the Remuneration Committee held three formal meetings. The 
Chairman of the Company has been invited to attend meetings where 
appropriate. Since the beginning of 2017 to the date of this report the 
Remuneration Committee has met twice to determine and approve the 
extent of annual bonus payable based on achievement of 2016 targets, 
the bonus targets for 2017 and the vesting of Awards granted in 2013 
and to consider making new Awards.
Remuneration practices
The Remuneration Committee recommended and monitored the level 
and structure of remuneration for senior management as well as 
monitoring remuneration trends across the Group. A review was 
carried out on the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the 
remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee determined the 2017 individual 
remuneration packages, targets for annual bonus scheme and pension 
arrangements for the Executive Directors and the 2017 fees for the 
Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain, motivate 
and reward Executive Directors, whilst aligning rewards with the business 
objectives and performance and the interests of shareholders. 
Link between business objectives and remuneration policy
It is the Company’s policy for performance-related pay of Executive 
Directors to be linked to key performance indicators of the Company. 
The Company’s key objectives include developing sustainable growth 
in earnings, through a combination of organic growth and investments, 
alongside a gradual reduction in debt levels. The performance 
measures chosen to link executive remuneration to the achievement of 
these objectives are growth in earnings per share and cash generated 
from operations. For 2017 these performance measures have been 
changed as detailed in the Annual bonus section below.
Executive Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have 
contracts with indefinite terms providing for a maximum of 12 months’ 
notice by the Company or the individual. In the event of early 
termination, the Executive Directors’ contracts provide for 
compensation up to a maximum of the basic salary for the notice 
period.
The details of the Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised as 
follows:
Director Effective date of contract Notice period
Chief Executive Officer 
(Joost Kreulen) 1 January 2012 12 months
Group Finance Director 
(Spencer Wreford) 4 May 2010 6 months
Basic salary
The basic annual salary of each Executive Director is reviewed annually 
by the Remuneration Committee with changes taking effect on 
1 January. The salaries for the Executive Directors for the 2015 to 2017 
financial years are as follows:
Director
2017
£000
2016
£000
2015
£000
Chief Executive Officer 221 216 211
Group Finance Director 175 170 154
Pension and other benefits-in-kind 
In addition to the basic remuneration payable under the service 
agreements, each of the Executive Directors is entitled to a pension 
provision and a range of other benefits, including private medical insurance 
and car allowance. The Company has agreed to make contributions into 
the Executive Directors’ private pension schemes as follows:
 – Chief Executive Officer – 15% of basic salary
 – Group Finance Director – 10% of basic salary 
Annual bonus
The Remuneration Committee establishes the objectives that must be 
met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid to the 
Executive Directors. For the 2016 financial year the targets and % of 
bonus payable for the Executive Directors is summarised as follows:
Maximum bonus as % of basic salary 100%
% applied to cash generated from operations 50%
% applied to earnings per share (‘EPS’) 50%
Bonus payable at 80% of target 0%
Bonus payable at 100% of target 50%
Bonus payable at 120% of target 100%
80% of all targets must be met for any bonus to be payable. The entire 
bonus is payable in cash. Based on the delivery against the performance 
targets for 2016, a bonus is payable at an aggregate rate of 22% of base 
salary (equivalent to 22% of the maximum potential bonus).
The Remuneration Committee continues to review the effectiveness of 
the Executive Director bonus performance targets and percentage 
payable, taking into account factors including the Group’s strategy, City 
expectations and the Group budget approved by the Board. New 
targets have been set for the 2017 financial year, using EPS growth, 
conversion ratio and debtor days performance targets. As with the 2016 
bonus, 80% of all targets must be met for any bonus to be payable, the 
maximum bonus is 100% of basic salary and is payable in cash.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
In July 2008 the Company gained shareholder approval to introduce a 
LTIP for the Executive Directors and senior executives within the 
business. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for supervising 
the scheme and making awards under its terms. The maximum value of 
ordinary shares that could be awarded in the year was 175% of basic 
salary. The current policy is to review the final audited results of the 
Company prior to agreeing if awards are to be made.

In March 2016 and March 2017, Awards of share options in the Company were made under the LTIP. The full Awards granted to the Executive 
Directors on 28 September 2011 vested in 2015 and 70.6% of the Awards granted to the Executive Directors on 6 September 2013 vested on

shares) and James Chapman (19,124 ordinary shares). These Awards were made based on a share price of GBP1.438 per ordinary share, being 
the average quoted closing mid market price of an ordinary share on the five trading days from 2 March 2017 to 8 March 2017. The performance 
criteria are based on EPS and share price performance. Vesting of these Awards is subject to the achievement of the performance criteria of the 
LTIP over the holding period to March 2020, following release of the Company’s preliminary results for the financial period 1 January 2019 to 
31 December 2019.
Shareholding guidelines
There are no requirements for Executive Directors or senior executives to hold shares in the Company. The details of those ordinary shares held 
by Directors can be found in the Directors’ report on pages 36 and 37.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, serve under letters of appointment, which either party can terminate on three months’ written 
notice. Their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles and is based on information on fees paid in similar 
companies and the skills and expected time commitment of the individual concerned. The fees are reviewed each year as part of the annual 
budgeting process. The Non-Executive Directors do not receive any additional remuneration for chairing Committees. The annual fees for the 
Non-Executive Directors for the 2015 to 2017 financial years are as follows:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF EMPRESARIA GROUP PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Empresaria Group 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the 
consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 29. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2016 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial 
statements of Empresaria Group plc for the year ended 31 December 
2016 and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that 
is described as having been audited.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Basis of preparation and general information
Empresaria Group plc is a company incorporated in the UK under the 
Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is Old 
Church House, Sandy Lane, Crawley Down, Crawley, West Sussex 
RH10 4HS. Its company registration number is 03743194. The 
consolidated financial statements are for the 12 months ended 
31 December 2016. The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and 
therefore the Group financial statements comply with AIM rules. The 
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention except that they have been modified to include the 
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The 
measurement bases and principal accounting policies of the Group are 
set out below. These consolidated financial statements are presented 
in Pounds Sterling (£) because that is the presentational currency of the 
Group. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies 
set out in note 2.
Changes in accounting policies
In the current year, the following accounting policy has been revised
 – Amendment to the presentation of the movement of invoice 
financing in the cash flow statement (details described in note 29)
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and 
interpretations have been adopted.
 – Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment entities: 
Applying the consolidation exception
 – Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for acquisitions of interests in 
joint operations
 – Amendments to IAS 18: Disclosure initiative
 – Amendments to IAS 18 and IAS 38: Clarification of acceptable 
methods of depreciation and amortisation
 – Annual improvements to IFRS 2012–2014 Cycle
No amendments to these financial statements have been made as a 
result of adopting new and revised standards and interpretations.
 
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some 
cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
 – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
 – IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 – IFRS 16 Leases
 – IFRS 2 (amendments): Classification and measurement of Shared-
based payment transactions
 – IAS 7 (amendments): Disclosure initiative
 – IAS 12 (amendments): Recognition of Deferred tax assets for 
unrealised losses
 – IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or contribution of assets 
between an investor and its associate or joint venture
IFRS 9 may impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial 
instruments and IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition 
and related disclosures. Beyond the information above it is not 
practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the impact of IFRS 9 
and IFRS 15 until a detailed review has been completed.
IFRS 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, 
presentation and disclosure of leases, with the objective of ensuring 
that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully 
represents those transactions. Under IFRS 16 significant changes are 
introduced to lessee accounting, with the distinction between 
operating and finance leases removed and assets and liabilities 
recognised in respect of all leases (subject to limited exceptions for 
short-term leases and leases of low value assets).
Subject to EU endorsement, IFRS 16 would apply for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group is currently 
assessing the impact of accounting changes that will arise under 
IFRS 16. 
Going concern
The Group’s activities are funded by a combination of long-term equity 
capital and bank facilities, primarily term loans, a revolving credit 
facility, invoice discounting and overdrafts. The day-to-day operations 
are funded by cash generated from trading and the use of invoice 
discounting and overdraft facilities. The Board has reviewed the 
Group’s profit and cash flow projections, and applied sensitivities to the 
underlying assumptions.
These projections demonstrate that the Group will meet its obligations 
as they fall due with the use of existing facilities. During 2016 we 
entered into a new £10.0m revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc 
to provide investment funding. The Group’s overdraft facilities are due 
for renewal in January and February 2018 and, based on informal 
discussions the Board has had with its lenders, we have no reason to 
believe that these facilities will not continue to be available to the Group 
for the foreseeable future. The financial statements do not reflect the 
adjustments that would be necessary were the trading performance of 
the Group to deteriorate significantly or if the funding available from 
invoice discounting or overdrafts were to become unavailable. Thus the 
Group continues to prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and 
all of its subsidiary from the date on which the Group obtains control 
and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group 
ceases its control. 
Control is achieved when the Group:
 – has the power over the investee;
 – is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with 
the investee; and
 – has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.
Intra-Group transactions and profits are eliminated fully on 
consolidation. Amounts reported in the financial statements of 
subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries 
are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-
controlling interest consists of the amount of those interests at the date 
of the original business combination and the non-controlling interest’s 
share of changes in equity since the date of the combination taking into 
account any restrictions on non-controlling interests. Total 
comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if 
this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance. The 
results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a 
loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are 
adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and 
attributed to the owners of the Company.  Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit 
or loss as incurred. Where applicable, the consideration for the 
acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. 
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of 
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. The 
measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the 
date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date and is a maximum 
of one year. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability are recognised in the 
income statement as per IFRS3 (2008). Changes in the fair value of 
contingent consideration classified as equity is accounted for within 
equity. Consideration linked to post-combination employee services are 
identified separately from the business combination. Payment for these 
services is accounted for as post-acquisition remuneration separately 
from the acquisition accounting. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for deferred 
tax assets and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit 
arrangements which are recognised and measured in accordance with 
IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the 
end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group 
reports provisional amounts for items for which the accounting is 
incomplete, which are adjusted during the measurement period, or 
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect the new 
information obtained.
Non-controlling interest
In applying the Group’s management equity philosophy, subsidiary 
management may be offered the opportunity to acquire shares in the 
subsidiary that they are responsible for, at market value. There are no 
services supplied by any employee in relation to this purchase of the 
shares in the subsidiary. After an agreed period, management may 
offer to sell the shares back to the Company. The Company does not 
have any obligation to acquire these shares. If amounts are paid for 
non-controlling interests in a subsidiary that exceed the fair value of the 
equity acquired this excess amount is charged to the income 
statement.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination is recognised as an asset 
at the date that control is acquired and is stated after separating out 
identifiable intangible assets.
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of 
the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. If, after measurement, the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the 
excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain 
purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment. 
Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units. If 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is first allocated 
against goodwill and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata 
basis. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the 
calculation of profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisitions 
before the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2006) has been retained 
at the previous UK GAAP carrying amount. 
Intangible assets 
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset 
without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the 
asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. 
Intangible assets acquired separately – intangible assets with finite 
useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful life. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with any changes being 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination – Intangible 
assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately 
from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition 
date (regarded as their cost). They are subsequently reported at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment on the 
same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.
Amortisation of intangible assets 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement and calculated using 
the straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: 
Customer relations  up to 15 years 
Trademarks  up to 15 years 
Software   up to 3 years
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding 
goodwill
The carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets are 
reviewed against their recoverable amount for any indication of 
impairment at each balance sheet date or whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of 
an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, such that it does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have existed had no impairment loss been recognised. The reversal of 
the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the 
cost or valuation of the assets less their residual values over their useful 
lives as follows: 
Leasehold property    over the term of the lease up 
to a maximum of 10 years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment up to 3 years 
Motor vehicles   up to 5 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with any changes 
accounted for on a prospective basis. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds 
with carrying amounts. These are included in the income statement.
Borrowing costs
Interest costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they 
are incurred. Facility arrangement fees incurred in respect of 
borrowings are amortised over the term of the agreement.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand, deposits held at 
call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included 
within the balance sheet in current liabilities – short-term borrowings.  Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Invoice financing
The Group’s operating activities in the UK are part funded by an invoice 
discounting facility. The debt provider has full recourse to the Group for 
any irrecoverable debt; these debts are presented within current 
borrowings and the asset due from the customer in current assets in 
the Group’s Balance sheet.
Movements in the invoice discounting balance are treated as ‘Cash 
flow from financing activities’ in the Group’s Cash flow statement.
Interest charges on invoice discounting are included in finance costs 
and service charges are included in administrative costs in the Group’s 
Income statement.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet and, 
other than hedging instruments, can be divided into the following 
categories: 
 – loans and receivables 
 – financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 
 – available-for-sale financial assets 
Financial assets are assigned to the different categories on initial 
recognition, depending on the characteristics of the instrument and its 
purpose. A financial instrument’s category is relevant for the way it is 
measured and whether resulting income and expenses are recognised 
in profit or loss or charged directly against equity. 
Generally, the Group recognises all financial assets using transfer value 
basis. An assessment of whether a financial asset is impaired is made 
at least at each reporting date. For receivables, this is based on the 
latest credit information available, (ie recent third-party defaults and 
external credit ratings). Financial assets that are substantially past due 
are also considered for impairment. All income and expense relating to 
financial assets are recognised in the income statement line item 
finance costs or finance income, respectively.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. Any change in their value is recognised in profit or 
loss. The Group’s trade and other receivables fall into this category of 
financial instruments. 
Individual receivables are considered for impairment when they are 
past due at the balance sheet date or when objective evidence is 
received that a specific third party will default.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to 
the substance of the contractual arrangements. 
Financial liabilities 
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other 
payables (including finance lease liabilities). They are recognised initially 
at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual agreements of the instrument. All interest-related 
charges and, if applicable, changes in the instrument’s fair value that 
are reported in the profit or loss are included in the income statement 
line items finance costs or finance income. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as 
a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the 
effect is material.
Revenue and revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for the sale of services provided in the ordinary course of the 
Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, trade 
discounts, rebates and other sales-related taxes. 
Permanent placement revenue is recognised at the point when the 
candidate commences employment. Contract placement revenue 
(including outsourced services) is recognised on the basis of actual 
work performed in the relevant period based on timesheets submitted. 
Training revenue is recognised at the point when the training is 
provided to clients.
Net fee income
Net fee income represents revenue less the remuneration cost of 
temporary workers. For permanent placements net fees are equal to 
revenue. For Training and Offshore Recruitment services net fee income 
represents revenue less costs of staff directly providing those services.
Employee benefits
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments made to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are 
charged to the income statement as they fall due. 
Share based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to the 
Executive Directors, which are measured at fair value (excluding the 
effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant and 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Monte Carlo 
simulation model and Black-Scholes model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Leases
Leases that result in the Group receiving substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as finance leases. An 
asset held under a finance lease is recorded in the balance sheet and 
depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease 
term. Future instalments net of finance charges are included within 
borrowings. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the 
finance charge element, which is allocated to each period to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining liability and charged 
to the income statement and the principal element which reduces the 
outstanding liability. 
Rental costs arising from operating leases are charged on a straight-
line basis over the period of the lease. Where an incentive is received to 
enter into an operating lease, such incentive is treated as a liability and 
recognised as a reduction to the rental expense on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the lease.
Forward contract for foreign currency
Forward currency contracts are stated at fair value, with any gain or 
losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
Current and deferred tax 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax. Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.  Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and 
their tax bases and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally provided in full, with no 
discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be 
able to be offset against future taxable income. However, deferred tax 
is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability, unless the related transaction is a 
business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. The carrying 
amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that there 
will be sufficient future taxable profit to allow the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able 
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
relevant period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a 
component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they 
relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case 
the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity. 
Foreign currencies 
(i) Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the individual financial statements of each Group 
company are measured using the individual currency of the primary 
economic environment in which that subsidiary operates (its ‘functional 
currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. Exchange 
differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign 
operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur 
(therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) 
are recognised initially in other comprehensive income. These 
exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss on 
disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
(iii) Group companies 
The results and financial position of Group companies (none of which 
has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional 
currency different from the Company’s presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 – assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; 
 – income and expenses for each income statement are translated at 
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the dates of the transactions); and 
 – all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 
component of equity within the retranslation reserve.
(iv) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of net investment hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign 
currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Gains and losses 
accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified 
to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at closing rate. 
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other 
sources. These estimates and judgements are continually evaluated 
and are based on historical experience and other relevant factors. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Accounting judgements which have a risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the 
estimates and assumptions which have a risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below.
Business combinations, contingent consideration, intangible 
assets (including goodwill)
Business combination accounting involves a number of fair value 
estimations. Due to the size of the investment these can be a material 
judgement area. The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as 
part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s 
judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of 
future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of 
an appropriate cost of capital.
In addition, management must assess the value of any contingent 
consideration that is due to the seller following the completion of the 
initial purchase. The value of this consideration is frequently based on 
the financial performance of the business post acquisition. Therefore, 
management must assess the likely value of this performance and so 
give a value to the expected contingent consideration. Actual post-
completion performance may vary from management’s estimate. The 
fair value of contingent consideration are reviewed on a regular basis, 
at least annually, and any changes are reflected in the income 
statement.
Furthermore, management must estimate the expected useful lives of 
intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly. 
Further details on the intangible assets and goodwill are disclosed in 
notes 14 and 15. Details of business combination can be found in notes 
2 and 6. 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based on the 
value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the 
estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. Details 
of the impairment review calculation are set out in note 14. The same 
judgements are required if intangibles are tested for impairment.
Recognition of deferred tax asset 
The ability to use brought-forward tax losses depends on future 
profitability in the company with the losses and the tax regulations in 
the country. Management must assess the likelihood of being able to 
use the losses and so whether to recognise a deferred tax asset. 
Details of the deferred tax balances are set out in note 20.
Provisions
Impairment of trade receivables: Individual trade receivables are 
considered for impairment when they are past due at the balance sheet 
date or when objective evidence is received that a specific third party 
will default. The provision for impairment of trade receivables requires 
significant judgement as the Group evaluates, amongst other factors, 
ageing of the debt, the potential likelihood of default, taking into 
account current economic conditions, the risk profile of a customer 
and other credit rating factors, such as financial health, historical 
experience of and near-term business outlook for a customer.
Other provisions: Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the 
effect is material.  Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

At 31 December 36.0 25.2 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that 
goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) at 
lowest level of cash flow, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of that income-generating unit. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs 
are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows:
Operating profit and pre-tax cash flows
The operating profit and pre-tax cash flow is based on approved annual budget for the CGUs approved by the Group’s Management Board 
which are compiled using expectations of fee growth, consultant productivity and operating costs. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts 
derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term 
growth rates using margins that are consistent with the business plan approved by the Group’s Management Board.
Discount rates
The pre-tax, country-specific rate used to discount the forecast cash flows ranges from 10% to 20% (2015: 13% to 21%) reflecting current local 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant CGUs. These discount rates reflect estimated industry 
weighted average cost of capital in each market.
Pre-tax discount rates used for various cash-generating units in operating segments are as follows:
UK:   10%
Continental Europe:  10%
Asia Pacific:  11.5% to 20%
Americas:   11% to 17%
Growth rates
Growth rates used to extrapolate beyond the most recent forecasts and to determine terminal values are based upon the long-term average GDP 
growth forecast, which are consistent with external sources, for the relevant country. Growth rates range from 1.8% to 7.9%. Any growth rate in 
excess of 3.0% was capped for the purpose of this calculation. GDP growth is a key driver of our business, and is therefore a key consideration in 
developing long-term forecasts.
Growth rates used for various cash generating units in operating segments are as follows:
UK:   1.8%
Continental Europe:  1.3% to 1.5%
Asia Pacific:  0.7% to 3.0% (capped)
Americas:   3.0%
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated. An impairment charge of £0.5m related to Asia Pacific region has been provided at 31 December 2016. 
Further details of the impairment charge can be found in the finance review on pages 22 and 23.
As part of the impairment review, management has considered the sensitivity of the recoverable amount for each unit to changes in the growth 
rates and discount rate. This sensitivity analysis showed that the long-term growth rate could reduce to Nil without giving rise to any additional 
impairment of goodwill. The discount rates were also increased by adding an additional 3% to the country specific pre-tax discount rates. None of 
these changes in the key assumptions are expected to reasonably occur.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. 
The carrying amount of goodwill as per operating segments has been allocated as follows:

During the year a new five-year UK multi-currency revolving credit facility of £10.0m was entered into expiring in June 2021. This facility has 
part-funded the investments in Rishworth Aviation and ConSol Partners. As at 31 December 2016 the balance outstanding was £8.5m. Interest is 
payable at 1.5% plus LIBOR or EURIBOR.
At 31 December 2016 the UK term loan, expiring in 2018, had a balance of £3.5m (2015: £1.6m). Further drawdowns from this term loan of £2.9m 
were made during the year to part fund the investment in Rishworth Aviation and also fund the contingent consideration payment due for 
Pharmaceutical Strategies. £1.0m of this loan was repaid during the year and £1.5m is expected to be repaid during the year ending 
31 December 2017. Interest is payable at 1.5% above UK base rate. A German bank loan of €5.0m (2015: €5.0m) remains outstanding with an 
expiry in 2018. Interest is payable at EURIBOR plus 3%.
Overdraft facilities are in place in the UK with a limit of £5.0m (2015: £5.5m). The balance as at 31 December 2016 was £0.9m (2015: £Nil). The 
interest rate was fixed during the year at 1.0% above applicable currency base rates. A $1.5m overdraft facility to provide working capital funding 
to Pharmaceutical Strategies had a balance of $0.7m (2015: $1.1m) as at 31 December 2016. Interest on this USD facility is payable at 2% over 
currency base rates. An €8.0m overdraft facility is also in place in Germany. The balance at 31 December 2016 was €1.2m (2015: €2.2m). Interest 
is payable at EURIBOR plus 2.3%.
The UK facilities are secured by a first fixed charge over all book and other debts given by the Company and certain of its UK subsidiaries, 
Headway in Germany and Rishworth Aviation in New Zealand.
Other overseas overdraft and loans had interest rates of between 1.6% and 2.3%.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £2.4m (2015: £2.5m) available for offset against future taxable profits. A deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of £0.6m (2015: £1.4m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the 
remaining £1.8m (2015: £1.1m) as it is not considered probable that the losses will be fully utilised before they expire.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £5.7m (2015: £3.9m) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future. Empresaria Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016

22 Financial instruments 
The principal financial assets of the Group are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The main purpose of these financial 
instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The principal financial liabilities are trade and other creditors that arise directly from 
operations, amounts owed to invoice discounters and bank loans. Further information on the Group’s treasury policy and activities during the year 
can be found in the finance review on pages 22 to 25.
Credit risk analysis
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

Cash and cash equivalents 18.0 7.7
Trade and other receivables* 47.6 34.0
* Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments, tax and social security total amounting £2.6m (2015: £1.9m).
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the third parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is 
evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group has no significant concentration of risk, with exposure spread over 
a large number of third parties and customers.

Total trade receivables (note 17) 41.1 31.8
Average trade receivables days during the year was 47 days (2015: 51 days).
All of the Group’s trade receivables have been reviewed for indicators of impairment and a provision of £1.0m (2015: £0.4m) has been recorded 
accordingly. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £30.1m (2015: £23.4m) which are not past due and 
a carrying amount of £11.0m (2015: £8.4m) which are past due at the reporting date. For these balances the Group has not provided as there  
has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral  
over these balances.

Liquidity risk analysis
The Group’s funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the 
Group. The Group monitors its liquidity risk on an ongoing basis with regular cash flow forecasts. In order to ensure continuity of funding, the 
Group seeks to arrange funding ahead of business requirements and maintain sufficient undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

Market risk analysis
The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to currency risk, interest rate risk and certain other 
price risks.
Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the 
borrowings and cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 19 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 21 and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Board reviews the capital structure of the Group on an ongoing basis, considering the cost of capital and the risks associated with each 
class of capital. The Board closely monitors the level of borrowings.

Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in the local currency of the respective country the business is operating in. However, the 
Group does undertake transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuation arise. The majority 
of exposures to currency exchange rates arising from overseas sales are mitigated by incurring purchases and cost of sales in the same currency.
To mitigate the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk, non-local currency cash flows are monitored and if applicable, forward exchange 
contracts are entered into in accordance with the Group’s risk management policies. Generally, Empresaria’s risk management procedures 
distinguish short-term foreign currency cash flows (due within six months) from longer-term cash flows. Where the amounts to be paid and 
received in a specific currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further hedging activity is undertaken. 
As at 31 December 2016 there were a small number of forward currency contracts in place. The amount covered by these at year end was £0.6m 
(2015: Nil). The fair value of these as at 31 December 2016 were (£0.1m) (2015: £Nil).
The Group’s currency exposures are on the translation of subsidiaries results into Pounds Sterling, sales and purchase transactions in foreign 
currency and on foreign currency monetary items. There is an element of natural hedge by having operations in different countries. The amount of 
currency retranslation gain recognised in equity was £5.1m (2015: loss £0.7m).
Foreign currency monetary items and its sensitivity analysis
The carrying amounts of the Group’s significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are 
is set out below:
A 10% weakening of the following currencies against relevant functional currency at 31 December would have (decreased)/increased equity and 
the income statement by the amounts shown below. Calculations are performed based on net monetary items balances at 31 December for 
same currency. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. Actual results in the future may differ 
materially from those projected, due to development in the global financial market.

A 10% strengthening of the above currencies against relevant functional currency at 31 December would have had the equal but opposite effect 
on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis does not completely represent the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year end exposure 
does not reflect the exposure during the year.

Interest rate risk
The Group manages its interest rate risk through a combination of cash pooling, shareholder funding and borrowing. Management monitors 
movements in interest rates to determine the most advantageous debt profile for the Group. At 31 December 2016, Empresaria is exposed to 
changes in market interest rates through its bank borrowings, which are subject to variable interest rates. For further information see note 19.

All the options have a zero cost exercise price. The total aggregate fair value of the options granted is £1,047,000. In 2016 a total expense of 
£226,000 (2015: £162,000) was recognised in the income statement. Cumulatively to the end of December 2016, the total amount expensed for 
the above options is £726,000. The fair value was estimated using a Black-Scholes model for the EPS element and a Monte Carlo model for the 
total shareholder return element. Details of the performance conditions can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 43 to 45.
The inputs into these models are as follows:

Weighted average exercise price Nil Nil Nil
Expected volatility 36.1% 43.7% 45.0%

Expected dividend yields 1.03% 0.65% 1.0%
Vesting dates March 2019 March 2018 March 2017
The expected volatility is determined from the daily log normal distributions of the Company share price over a period equal to the expected 
holding period calculated back from the date of grant. The risk free rate was the zero coupon bond yield derived from UK government bonds at 
the date of grant, with a life equal to the expected holding period.
Included in the total number of share options above are 1,220,000 share options which vested in March 2015. As of the date of this report none of 
those options have been exercised. Further details can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 43 to 45.
29 Restatement of prior year Cash flow statement presentation
Following a review of the Group’s accounting policy, the presentation of the movement in invoice financing in the cash flow statement has been 
amended with a restatement of the prior year presentation, to provide shareholders with a clearer understanding of the operating cash flows of 
the Group. Under the revised accounting treatment this is now presented as part of ‘Cash flow from financing activities’ rather than ‘Cash flow 
from operating activities’.
The impact of the restatement is summarised below

We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of Empresaria Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 which comprise the 
Parent Company balance sheet, the Parent Company statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 10. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Parent Company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in 
the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 – the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
 
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Empresaria Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2016.

payable at 1.5% plus LIBOR or EURIBOR.
At 31 December 2016 the UK term loan, expiring in 2018, had a balance of £3.5m (2015: £1.6m). Further drawdowns from this term loan of £2.9m

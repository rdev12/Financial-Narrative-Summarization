158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt1_158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt1  31/05/2012  22:05  Page 1 It was an honour to have been asked to chair this fascinating enterprise last June and it gives me great pleasure to
be providing the first Chairman’s statement of Circle Holdings plc (‘Circle’, the ‘Group’) since it was admitted to
trading on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’) of the London Stock Exchange. The Group’s unique model in
healthcare of sharing ownership between capital and labour has continued to attract widespread attention and
acclaim. While still a work in progress, the past year has seen a number of key milestones that underpin Circle’s
potential as an effective and successful commercial model.
Key achievements
On a like for like basis, increasing operational revenues, patient volumes, and ongoing implementation against our
pipeline of projects signal that the Group is on track in its ambitious programme to redefine UK healthcare.
The Group’s current flagship hospital, CircleBath, has made important strides in providing proof of concept. The
positive impact of clinician engagement and exceptional patient service has been powerfully demonstrated in
increasing market share, revenues and gross margins. In addition, clinical results and customer satisfaction have
been maintained at very high levels across all our hospital sites. On key benchmarks such as readmission rates after
day surgery and patient recommendations, the Group has enjoyed remarkable success.
Highlights
The Group’s admission to AIM in June 2011 signalled its increasing maturity. Its ability to attract over £53,000,000
(before costs) of new investment during the year through equity investments from existing and new shareholders,
at a time of considerable political risk and market volatility, speaks volumes for the uniqueness and strength of the
business model.
A key landmark in the past year was the signing of the formal contract to manage the Hinchingbrooke Health Care
NHS Trust (‘Hinchingbrooke’), which commenced at the beginning of February 2012. The Group has brought its
proven strengths to the task and the early indications in terms of feedback and metrics are very encouraging. The
Circle approach of clinician leadership, staff engagement, a customer centric ethos and re-engineering processes to
drive productivity and enhance patient experience is already transforming the hospital. In addition, patient numbers
at CircleBath have continued to grow and our overall business strategy is developing well.
The Board
Concurrent with the listing, a Board was formed with a majority of independent Directors. The Board now consists
of four independent Non-Executive Directors, two Non-Executive Directors representing major institutional
investors in Circle, along with the three Executive Directors.
I was delighted to be able to attract Lorraine Baldry, Peter Cornell and Andrew Shilston to the Board. Each of them
brings extraordinary and diverse experience and maturity to our deliberations and I am confident that the
governance of Circle is in good hands.
Likewise, at this stage in the development of the Group, we benefit greatly from the insights and perspectives of
institutional shareholder representation on our Board. Tim Bunting and Jamie Wood are important and intelligent
contributors to our collective thinking.
The engagement of the new Non-Executive Directors with the co-founders of Circle, Chief Executive Officer Ali
Parsa and Chief Medical Officer Massoud Fouladi, and with Chief Financial Officer Paolo Pieri, has resulted in a
constructive and cohesive approach to the Group’s opportunities and challenges.
I am delighted and privileged to be working with such a strong combination of talent, expertise and experience.

Chairman’s Statement
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt1_158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt1  31/05/2012  22:05  Page 2 The Team
The differentiating element of Circle is the quality and engagement of the people within the Group. Whether in the
executive or administrative teams, or in our hospital operations, it is the skill and commitment of the wider group
that will ultimately determine our future success. The Circle Partnership under the leadership of Massoud and Ali is
executing the vision and the Board and I would like to recognise their central importance to the Circle business
model.
The Group recognises that to create an enterprise of scale, three ingredients need to be brought together and
incentivised in fair measure: entrepreneurial drive, employee passion and financial resources. To that end, the Group
is focused on ensuring the model continues to incentivise all parties appropriately.
The Outlook
I believe that there are significant opportunities for the Group as a new and distinctive player in the UK healthcare
space. The recent conditional agreement to raise a further £47,500,000 is testament to the confidence that our new
and existing investors have in the Group’s prospects. This fully finances the business for the medium term, allowing
the management to fully exploit the market opportunity. With the support of the Board, the Executive team, the
Circle Partnership and our external constituencies, I remain confident that we will make further progress in the
coming year.

Chairman’s Statement (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt1_158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt1  31/05/2012  22:05  Page 3 The year ended 31 December 2011 was another year of progress for the Group. Operational revenues and EBITDA
have progressed steadily and according to plan, with overall revenues increasing by 19.5% in continuing facilities to
£64,618,000 (2010: £54,058,000). Both of our flagship facilities, CircleBath and Circle’s Nottingham NHS
Treatment Centre, achieved impressive clinical quality and patient recommendation metrics, which we believe rate
amongst the best in the UK. Our track record was affirmed by the Government approving the ground-breaking
Hinchingbrooke contract, allowing for the first time the independent sector to run an entire NHS hospital. In a
relatively short space of time, Circle has created an unrivalled platform.
CircleBath, our first independent hospital which opened in March 2010, has performed well in many measures.
Revenues grew by 94.2% and gross margins improved by 34.4 percentage points between the second half of 2010
(when the hospital completed its first full six months of trading) and the second half 2011, as existing operations
grew and processes matured. At the same time, we maintained an average of 99.4% patient recommendation for
the six months ended 31 December 2011 and a zero infection rate. CircleBath also became the first hospital in the
country to gain a national award for Best Building, an international award for Best Public Space globally, and a
regional award for Best Customer Service, beating stiff competition from some of the best five star hotels in the
country.
Revenue in Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, one of the largest day surgical centres in Europe, increased
by 6.6% to £51,185,000 (2010: £48,000,000), whilst operating profits were up by 85.0% to £2,390,000 (2010:
£1,292,000). Our Nottingham operation has gained national acclaim from policymakers and politicians for its
record 18.5% average compounded productivity gain and outstanding quality metrics, including readmissions after
day surgery being seven times better than the national Independent Sector Treatment Centre (‘ISTC’) threshold, and
patient recommendations averaging 99.1%. The contract to run the Nottingham Treatment Centre expires in July
2013 and we are awaiting details of the proposed re-tendering of the contract. If the re-tendering process does not
commence imminently, we expect that an extension to the current contract is a reasonable prospect.
We have been heartened by overwhelming staff, stakeholder and community support around the launch of our
franchise contract in Hinchingbrooke. In an NHS first, around 1,200 of the 1,700 hospital employees came together
to create the improvement plan for their own hospital. Collectively, they came up with the audacious goal of
becoming one of the best district general hospitals in the country within two years, and a detailed plan to achieve
this. Early metrics are encouraging with Accident and Emergency performance consistently above 98.0%,
approximately a 10.0% improvement since the beginning of February, making Hinchingbrooke the top performer in
the region.
It has also been a good year for our development pipeline, with funding deployed for CircleReading’s construction
and commissioning, and land acquisition in Manchester. Construction of CircleReading is expected to be completed
by the end of May 2012, on time and on budget, and we look forward to opening our doors to serve patients there
in the second half of 2012.
The politics of healthcare in the UK is often turbulent, yet the direction of travel has been encouragingly consistent.
Since Circle was founded, the operating environment has improved immeasurably. Significant gains in the number
of patients being offered choice, the opening of secondary and community services to independent sector provision,
and our own ground-breaking contract to run an entire NHS hospital, all confirm that there are increasing
opportunities for plural provision of NHS services.
Circle has made a number of contributions to opening up this market, with three significant and successful
campaigns. Firstly, we referred the issue of consultants’ contracted hours to the NHS Co-operation and Competition
Panel (‘CCP’) which accepted our argument that consultants should have the freedom to practice at the location
of their patients’ choice. Secondly, we referred Primary Care Trusts (‘PCT’s) that were restricting NHS patients’
choice to the CCP, which again ruled in favour of patient choice. Thirdly, we referred anti-competitive practices in
the private sector to the Office of Fair Trading (‘OFT’), which accepted our arguments and referred the entire sector
to the Competition Commission for a market investigation. It is widely accepted that UK healthcare needs more
efficient solutions, so we are confident that the environment will continue to improve.

Chief Executive Officer and entrepreneur co-founder of Circle, I am privileged to be surrounded by excellent people.
We are fortunate to have such supportive investors, wise and willing Board members, talented and dedicated

On 17 June 2011 the Group listed on AIM and raised £25,283,000 excluding proceeds from warrants, bringing the
total amount raised for the year to £53,077,000 before costs. This was achieved at a time of intense political risk
and stock market volatility, which is testament to the strength of the Group’s operating model. The listing forms
part of the overall fundraising strategy and demonstrates the Group’s increasing maturity.
Results
The Group has continued to deliver growth in its core operations, with revenues increasing by 19.5% in continuing
facilities to £64,618,000, primarily as a result of the improving performance of CircleBath, proving the concept of
clinician engagement in new-build hospitals, and the growth in Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, one of
the largest outpatient and day surgery centres in Europe. Patient attendances in continuing facilities have grown by
41.4%, with the volume mix between day case, inpatients and outpatients impacting overall revenue growth.
Overall revenues decreased year on year by 2.4% to £74,607,000, which was achieved despite the loss of the Burton
contract.

Burton NHS Treatment Centre. Exceptional finance costs of £10,097,000 (2010: £451,000) were incurred primarily due to fair value
adjustments of warrant instruments and interest rate swaps in the period.

Operating and Financial Review
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt2_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt2  31/05/2012  22:07  Page 6 A review of the key segmental operating units is as follows:
Circle Independent
The Circle Independent segment comprises privately owned hospitals and clinics which derive their revenues from
providing healthcare services to privately insured patients, self-pay private patients and NHS patients.
Segment revenue grew by 120.4% to £13,224,000 (2010: £6,000,000) primarily due to CircleBath which opened in
March 2010 and volumes have continued to grow to 33,174 patient attendances (2010: 7,232), driven by the
introduction of new consultant partners and an increase in the number of specialties offered to both private and
NHS patients. CircleBath continues to gain market share in core specialities, specifically demonstrated by the
growth in hip and knee replacement procedures. As well as volume growth, profitability has also improved with
gross margins in the year up to 19.6% (2010: 0.4%).
CircleReading is currently under construction, with the scheduled opening for the second half of 2012 continuing
on plan.
Circle NHS
The Circle NHS segment comprises business units which have NHS sponsored contracts and derive the majority of
their revenues from providing healthcare services to NHS referred patients. Circle NHS comprises Circle’s
Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, Hinchingbrooke and, until the cessation of the contract in July 2011, Circle’s
Burton NHS Treatment Centre.
Day case and outpatient numbers increased during the year at Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre by
12.5% to 87,340 with revenue increasing by 6.6% to £51,185,000. Gross margins broadly remained constant at
29.5% (2010: 30.1%) and operating profit increased by 85.0% to £2,390,000.
In March 2011, the Group was notified that the Burton NHS Treatment Centre would automatically revert to Burton
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust when the original contract expired on 10 July 2011. This contract was one of the
first drafted under the last Government’s ISTC programme and, almost uniquely, contained a clause permitting the
local NHS hospital to re-claim rather than re-tender the service upon expiry. As part of the handover, the Group
transferred all operating assets and provided training and mobilisation services to ensure the Burton NHS Treatment
Centre was able to continue operating over the transition period.
Segment revenue decreased by 13.1% to £61,175,000 (2010: £70,416,000) primarily due to the loss of the
contracts to run the Bradford NHS Treatment Centre in June 2010 and the Burton NHS Treatment Centre in July
2011. Operating profit for this segment improved from £691,000 to £5,167,000 for the year ended 31 December
2011.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt2_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt2  31/05/2012  22:07  Page 7 In November, Circle signed a contract to run the Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust in Cambridgeshire, which
will see Circle manage an estimated £1,000,000,000 of revenue over the ten year contract period. Under the terms
of the Hinchingbrooke contract, Circle has agreed to make working capital contributions of up to £5,000,000. The
contract allows either party to terminate if the Trust incurs more than £5,000,000 in aggregate deficits, at which
point Circle is also required to pay up to a further £2,000,000 in termination costs to Hinchingbrooke. Therefore
Circle’s liability under the contract is capped at £7,000,000. Circle will share surpluses generated over the term of
the contract with the Trust. The contract commenced in February 2012, and we believe there is already a clear path
to achieving our ambition of the Trust becoming one of the best district general hospitals in the country.
Other Segments and Unallocated Items
The Other Segments and Unallocated Items segment comprises property companies and the head office entities
not involved in the operation of hospitals or treatment centres. Specifically it comprises head office costs, interest
income, interest expenditure and corporation tax which are not allocated to reporting segments as they are
managed on a Group wide basis.
Financing
During 2011, the Group continued to successfully raise finance to fund business growth. In addition to the
£25,283,000 (excluding proceeds from warrants) the Group raised at the time of its listing on AIM, which brought
the total amount raised from investors in the year to £53,077,000 before costs, the Group secured a short-term
loan facility of £5,000,000 from Vinci, to enable the purchase of land in Didsbury, Manchester. This loan was repaid
on 14 December 2011 along with accrued interest of £296,000.
In May 2011, the Group secured an extension of the James Caird Asset Management (‘JCAM’) facility of
£13,300,000 from August 2012 to February 2013. Under the terms of the extension, an advance payment of
£6,204,000 was made to JCAM, of which £4,258,000 remains on the balance sheet at 31 December 2011.
More recently, despite the challenging financial markets, the Group has entered into an underwriting agreement
with Numis Securities to raise £47,500,000 by way of equity funding, before fees, subject to the terms of the
underwriting agreement and shareholder approval. Once again, this demonstrates the confidence that our investors,
both new and existing, have in the business strategy.
In addition, the Group continues to explore further financing for its real estate development in relation to both
hospital development on sites already secured, and potential future sites.
Investing
The additional funding raised from the current shareholders and the AIM listing outlined above means the Group
had net assets of £26,184,000 as at 31 December 2011 (previously net liabilities of £5,223,000 at 31 December
2010).
The Group’s new build strategy is progressing, with the construction of the second hospital, CircleReading, budgeted
to have a cost base per square metre less than CircleBath for the same quality and product, demonstrating that we
are gaining competitive advantage. In May 2011, the Group entered into an agreement to buy a 5.3 acre site in
Didsbury, Manchester, for Circle’s third new-build hospital, in the second largest private healthcare market in the
country. This was initially part financed by a loan from Vinci, secured against the land. This loan was repaid in
December 2011 along with accrued interest.
In November 2011, the Group signed a 125 year lease on a 3.4 acre site in Edgbaston, Birmingham, which is
anticipated to become Circle’s fourth new-build hospital.

The year ended 31 December 2011 was a landmark year in the development of Circle: we successfully listed on AIM,
secured further funding from existing shareholders, and we won the Hinchingbrooke contract, which was the first
of its kind and won in open competition, outshining competition from the NHS and independent sectors. We
improved volumes, revenues and profitability at both of our main sites in Bath and in Nottingham, despite
continued demand pressures in the market place.
We enter 2012 with a strong platform to build on the improvements seen in Bath and Nottingham, commencing
the operation of the Hinchingbrooke contract in February and opening the new hospital in Reading in the second
half of the year. The current contract in respect of the Nottingham facility expires in July 2013 and we are awaiting
details of the proposed re-tendering of the contract. If the re-tendering process does not commence imminently,
we expect that an extension to the current contract is a reasonable prospect. In the meantime we will continue to
seek further opportunities within the NHS.
In relation to the independent pipeline, construction of Circle’s facility in Reading is expected to be completed in
line with budget, with the facility opening in the second half of 2012. We will continue to explore funding
opportunities in challenging financial markets for the construction and commissioning of our Manchester and
future hospitals.

On 1 February 2012, the Group commenced the operation of the contract to manage the Hinchingbrooke Health
Care NHS Trust.
JCAM restructure
On 3 February 2012, the Company and JCAM agreed to restructure the Company’s existing £14,131,000 loan. The
loan was repaid and a new loan for £14,131,000 was entered into between JCAM and CH Subco Limited, a wholly-
owned Jersey subsidiary of the Company, on materially the same terms as the previous loan. As part of the
restructuring, JCAM waived any breaches under the previous loan. The Group provided enhanced security over its
assets and the Company placed £1,536,000 in a pledged account in favour of JCAM to cover any future liabilities
arising under the loan. The new loan is due to be repaid in February 2013.
2012 fund raise
On 28 May 2012, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Numis Securities and a subscription
agreement with Balderton Capital III L.P. to raise an aggregate of £47,500,000 by way of equity funding, before fees,
at a price per share of £0.70. The equity fund raise is subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement, the
subscription agreement, and shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting to be held on or about 18
June 2012. Shareholders representing in excess of 75% of the current issued share capital have irrevocably
undertaken to vote in favour of the shareholder resolutions to approve the issue of new shares in connection with
the equity fund raise.
Resolution of cross default on GE lease
The cross-default under Circle International plc’s equipment lease with GE (note 30), triggered by non-repayment
of the mezzanine loan provided to Health Properties Bath, was waived by GE on 22 May 2012 following the
completion of the restructuring of loans on 22 May 2012. Under the restructured terms, Circle Holdings plc has
granted a guarantee to Lehman in respect of the repayment of the mezzanine debt, with Circle Holdings plc’s
liability under the guarantee being capped at £625,000.
AIB loan
The Group is currently in discussion with AIB regarding the loan facility which is secured on land owned in Edinburgh
with no recourse to the Group. The loan matures on 30 June 2012 (note 21).
Future developments
Further funding is being sought from pension funds, equity investors and a number of leading banks for the next
hospitals in the build programme.
Operationally, the intention during the coming year is to increase the patient volumes treated at each of the
operating facilities, to raise the quality of care provided and to ensure that all facilities are of a world class standard.

Biographies of the current Directors are detailed on pages 10 to 11 and Directors’ beneficial interests in the Group’s
share capital and warrants are detailed on page 23 of the Directors’ remuneration report.
Directors’ indemnity
In its Articles of Association, the Company has granted an indemnity to every present and former officer in respect of
proceedings brought by third parties. The Company has procured liability insurance for all Directors and Officers of the
Company and all Group companies. There are no outstanding claims or provisions as at the balance sheet date.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations totalling £26,000 (2010: £14,600) during the year to a number of charitable
organisations within the UK.
No donation was made to any political party registered in the UK under the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 by either the Company or its subsidiaries.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Enterprise risk identification and management
The Group has an effective system of risk management in terms of identifying risks and monitoring actions to
manage these risks. Further details of the Group’s risk management process can be found in the Report on corporate
governance on pages 17 to 20.
Risk is part of doing business; the risk management system aims to provide assurance to the Board on the
effectiveness of the Group’s control framework in managing risk, including maximised resource efficiency through
controlled prioritisation of issues, review of key operational metrics in relation to clinical outcomes, patient
experience, staff engagement and value-for-money (together known as the ‘quality quartet’ review), sharing of best
practice and effective crisis management.
The following provides an overview of the principal business risk factors facing the Group, along with a description,
where relevant, of the mitigating actions in place.
As with all medical providers, clinical risk is a major consideration. The Group has an integrated corporate
governance structure which is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Massoud Fouladi, who also sits on the Board.
This structure includes senior staff across the operational, clinical and central support teams. Each hospital site has
its own local governance structure, whilst a team of clinical care quality specialists is dedicated to developing up to
date and consistent clinical and operational policies across all sites. Local governance committees work to a rigorous
assurance framework, manage day to day clinical risks through a risk register, provide appropriate training to staff
and consultants, and report their findings to the Group’s Integrated Governance Committee. This committee in turn

Directors Report (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt3_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt3  31/05/2012  22:08  Page 14 provides written risk assurance reports to the boards of the relevant Circle group companies and the Audit and Risk
committee.
Additionally, the Group’s hospitals, clinics and treatment centres are subject to Care Quality Commission (‘CQC’)
reviews on a regular basis, including a review of training and risk management procedures.
Government policy and regulatory risk
There are risks that political or policy changes may mean that the number and size of contracts awarded to the
Group are diminished and that fewer services provided by the Group are contracted. New regulations may be
introduced which could have an adverse effect on the Group’s operational and compliance costs. In addition, the
Group relies on the ability and willingness of government-funded bodies such as PCTs and NHS Trusts to pay for
the Group’s services.
Reputational risk
Reputational risk is the risk that the Group fails to provide medical care that is of a sufficiently high quality, resulting
in patient or payor dissatisfaction and negative publicity. This is mitigated by the fact that the Group provides high
quality medical care that is backed up by clinical governance and quality quartet reviews.
Attracting, developing and retaining talented employees
The ability of the Group to achieve its strategic objectives depends partly on its ability to recruit, retain and develop
highly skilled competent people at all levels. The Group has a performance review process and remuneration is
externally benchmarked to ensure ongoing competitiveness.
Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, cash
flow risk, interest rate risk and contract risk. The Group seeks to limit the adverse effects of the above risks on the
financial performance of the Group by monitoring levels of debt finance and the related finance costs, and by
matching the risks of the financing with the risk and return profiles of the assets. The risks are monitored by
Management throughout the year via monthly reviews of operational performance, cash flows, levels of individual
debt instruments and overall debt levels.
Due to the nature of the current minimum take ISTC contract with the Department of Health (‘DoH’), there is no
material price or credit risk exposure for Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre.
– Price risk
Whilst the Nottingham ISTC contract contains fixed indexation provisions, the Group generally seeks to
price contracts at levels that take account of increasing prices and, where appropriate, establish contract
terms that enable revenues to be adjusted as a result of any future increasing price levels. As the volume of
private patients is anticipated to increase, the Group will be increasingly subject to pricing changes from
private insurance companies.
– Credit risk
Most revenues arise from insured patients’ business and the NHS. Insured patients give rise to trade
receivables which are mainly due from large insurance institutions that have high credit worthiness. Credit
control procedures are designed to ensure that contracted revenue is collected according to agreed terms.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt3_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt3  31/05/2012  22:08  Page 15 – Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with
financial liabilities. The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by robustly managing cash generation across its
operations and by applying cash collection targets throughout the Group. Updated projections and forward
plans on raising funds are prepared and current cash projections show the need for fundraising to provide
ongoing working capital and to meet future growth plans.
– Cash flow risk
Cash flow risk is the exposure to variability of cash flows associated with a recognised asset or liability, such
as future interest payments on a variable rate debt (see below). Operational cash flow risks are managed
through detailed budgeting and tight cost control and where the need arises, significant costs savings are
made in the short-term by reducing Head Office costs.
– Funding risk
Funding risk is the risk that the Group is unable to obtain sufficient funding to pursue its growth plans and
expansion opportunities. This is mitigated by the fact the Group is backed by leading UK institutional
investors that have financed the Company through several financing rounds over the last seven years.
– Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense against the background
of a difficult credit market. The Group is exposed to variability of cash flows associated with future interest
payments on variable rate debt. The Group manages this risk, where possible, by interest rate swaps and
long-term debts, where appropriate. Should further interest rate hedging activities be undertaken in the
future, the Board has approved the use of interest rate swaps.
– Contract risk
Contract risk is the risk that the Group is unable to renew the NHS contracts at the end of their fixed tenure.
The Group aims to mitigate this risk by maintaining good relationships with contracting parties and actively
pursuing contract renewals and extensions ahead of time. The contract to run the Nottingham NHS
Treatment Centre expires in July 2013. Negotiations to renew the contract will commence in 2012.

The Company, being quoted on AIM, is not required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance
Code (the ‘code’). Nevertheless, the Directors are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and
have voluntarily complied with the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council. As envisaged by the Code, the
Board has established three committees: an Audit and Risk committee, a Remuneration committee and a
Nominations committee. In addition, the Board has authorised a Market Disclosure committee and an Integrated
Governance committee, with the latter reporting into the Audit and Risk committee. These committees operate
within defined terms of reference, as determined by the Board, details of which are publicly available at the Group’s
registered office. The functions and responsibilities of each committee are described below and the Chair and other
members of the committees are listed in the Board of Directors biographies on pages 10 to 11.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, three independent Non-Executive Directors, two non-
independent Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Medical Officer
and Chief Financial Officer). The profiles of the current Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors are set out
on pages 10 to 11. The Articles of Association allow no fewer than three Directors.
The Code recommends that the Board should comprise at least two Non-Executive Directors, determined by the
Board to be independent in character, judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which may affect, or
could appear to affect, the Directors’ judgement. The Board considers that the Company complies with the
requirements of the Code in this regard.
The Non-Executive Directors contribute a wide range of skills and experience, forming a strong and independent
element within the Board. The Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee for services rendered, are appointed for
an initial period of three years, which may be extended by agreement with the Board, subject to re-election by
shareholders at the AGM, and have not been employees of the Company at any time. Their opinions carry significant
weight in the decision making process, both operational and financial, and they are free from any business or
personal relationships that could interfere with their independent judgement. The Non-Executive Directors ensure
that some meetings are set aside during the year without the Executive Directors present. Lorraine Baldry is the
nominated senior independent Non-Executive Director to whom shareholders, Directors and employees may bring
concerns which normal channels have failed to resolve or are otherwise not appropriate.
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects of the role,
managing the Board, ensuring that sufficient time is allowed for the discussion of complex or contentious issues,
ensuring a regular evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole, its committees and individual Directors
and taking the lead in identifying and meeting the development needs of individual Directors and the Board as a
whole.
The Board meets at regular intervals throughout the year and has reserved for its consideration matters including:
–         the responsibility for the overall strategy of the Group;
–         significant capital expenditure projects, budget approval and any major financial proposals;
–         ensuring effective systems of internal control and risk management;
–         regulatory compliance;
–         approval of public announcements and communications with shareholders;
–         approval of Annual report and financial statements; and
–         remuneration of key senior employees.
Detailed monthly operational, clinical and financial information is provided to the Board in a timely manner to
enable it to discharge its duties. This includes information on the historic, budgeted and forecast financial
performance of the business as well as Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) covering volumes, revenue and EBITDA,
to allow the Board to challenge Management effectively. A budget is agreed by the Board annually and performance
against budget is reported monthly.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt3_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt3  31/05/2012  22:08  Page 17 The Board ensures that all Directors receive appropriate training and induction, as required, and that they are able
to take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties. The Board may appoint a Director and
revoke or terminate the appointment of a Director as it thinks fit. Any Director so appointed shall offer him or
herself for reappointment at the first Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) following appointment and at each AGM
thereafter. The shareholders may also remove a director by ordinary resolution.
Audit and Risk committee
The Audit and Risk committee’s role is to assist the Board with the discharge of its responsibilities in relation to
internal and external audits and controls, including reviewing the Group’s Annual report and financial statements,
considering the scope of the annual audit and the extent of the non-audit work undertaken by external auditors,
advising on the appointment of external auditors, reviewing the effectiveness of the internal control systems in
place within the Group and determining and reviewing the nature and extent of the risks facing the Group. The
Audit and Risk committee meets not less than four times a year.
The Code recommends that all members of the Audit and Risk committee be Non-Executive Directors and that it
is not chaired by the chairman of the Board. The Company complies with the requirements of the Code in this
regard.
Reporting into the Audit and Risk committee is the Integrated Governance Committee which is chaired by the Chief
Medical Officer, Massoud Fouladi, who also sits on the Board. Further details are provided in the principal risks and
uncertainties section of the Directors’ report on pages 14 to 16.
Remuneration committee
The Remuneration committee recommends policies the Company should adopt on executive remuneration,
determines the levels of remuneration for each of the Executive Directors, recommends and monitors the
remuneration of members of senior management and is also invited to attend meetings of the Remuneration
committee of Circle Health Limited (‘Circle Health’). The Remuneration committee generates an annual
remuneration report to be approved by the members of the Company at the AGM. The minutes of the
Remuneration committee are circulated to, and reviewed by, the Board. The Remuneration committee meets not
less than twice a year and the Directors’ remuneration report is set out on pages 21 to 23.
The Code recommends that all members of the Remuneration committee be Non-Executive Directors and the
Company complies with the requirements of the Code in this regard.
Nomination committee
The Nomination committee assists the Board in determining its composition, desired balance of skills, potential
Board candidates as the need may arise and formulates the succession plans for the Chairman. It recommends to
the Board, in conjunction with the Circle Partnership, the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer. The
Nominations committee meets at least once a year and whenever necessary to fulfil its responsibilities. The Code
recommends that a majority of the Nominations committee be Non-Executive Directors and the Company
complies with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code in this regard.
Market Disclosure committee
The Market Disclosure committee assists the Company in meeting its obligations to announce price sensitive and
other significant information and decide quickly whether an announcement obligation has arisen under the AIM
Rules for Companies and related legislation. The UK Corporate Governance Code does not require companies to
have a Market Disclosure committee but the Directors consider it best practice to have such a committee.

As the Board was only set up immediately prior to the Group listing on AIM, it has not yet undertaken a formal
evaluation of its performance to ensure the committees continue to be effective, that individual Directors
demonstrate commitment to their respective role and have sufficient time to meet their commitment to the
Company. The Board intends to do this in the coming year.
Attendance by the Directors at the various committees from 17 June 2011 when the Group listed, was as follows:

Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains a regular dialogue with fund managers, other investors and analysts, usually following the
announcement of interim and final results, to ensure that the investing community receives a balanced and
consistent view of the Group’s performance. The principal documents received by shareholders are the Interim
report, Annual report and financial statements, and any circulars as appropriate. The Company’s Annual General
Meeting provides an opportunity to respond to shareholders’ questions.
Employee involvement
Circle is a socially responsible employer and various initiatives are in place to ensure that staff are treated fairly as
they are critical to its commercial and operational success. Communication is critical to employee relations and the
Group uses weekly business updates with all sites present via tele-conference to ensure employees are fully
informed about plans and progress. Communications from the human resources department notify all staff of any
changes to personnel during the year. Bi-annual offsite meetings are held for Management and Directors to review
strategy implementation and key business opportunities. Annual performance reviews are conducted for employees
and individual training and development needs are identified to ensure staff receive supplementary training.
The Company’s principal subsidiary, Circle Health, is co-owned by the Group’s employees and clinicians who work
in the Group’s facilities. The Group encourages the involvement of employees in the performance of the Group
through participation in the share scheme operated by Circle Partnership, a related company incorporated in the
British Virgin Islands, which holds 49.9% of the share capital of Circle Health, the balance of which is indirectly
owned by the Company. For further details see note 25 to the financial statements.

The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the candidate’s
particular aptitudes and abilities are consistent with adequately meeting the requirements of the job. Opportunities
are available to disabled employees for training, career development and promotion.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy to provide continuing employment wherever
practicable in the same or an alternative position and to provide appropriate training to achieve this aim.
Environmental matters
The services provided by the Group have minimal environmental impact. However, the Board believes that good
environmental practices support the Group’s strategy by enhancing the reputation of the Group and improving the
efficiency of running hospitals. Consequently, the Group continues to put environmental responsibilities high on the
agenda. CircleReading, the next new-build hospital, is designed to be the most energy efficient hospital in the UK.
The Group and its employees try to ensure that both services and products are procured in an environmentally
friendly manner and that waste materials are disposed of appropriately, including recycling where economically
possible. The Group makes extensive use of electronic communications to reduce the amount of printing waste
produced. Where appropriate, electronic communication methods such as email, telephone and video conference
facilities are used to avoid non-essential travel. The Group does not offer a company car scheme to employees and
encourages its employees to travel to work using public transport or the ‘bike-to-work’ scheme that it has recently
introduced.
Ethical conduct
The Board is committed to uphold ethical conduct throughout the Group and has in place confidential whistle
blowing and anti-bribery policies that enable unresolved concerns to be escalated to the Board’s senior independent
Non-Executive Director. These policies are made available to all employees via a web based policy management
system that enables periodic monitoring.
Health and safety
The Group is committed to protecting and enhancing the health and safety of its employees and all patients who
are treated in the facilities it operates. The Group operates a formal health and safety risk assurance framework,
which is regularly monitored by a dedicated health and safety officer who provides monthly reports to the
management teams at the operational level and quarterly reports to the Group’s Integrated Governance
Committee. Under the framework, significant incidents are reported without delay to the Board.

Report on Corporate Governance (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011

This report sets out the Group’s remuneration policy and details of Directors remuneration.
Remuneration committee
The members of the Remuneration committee are set out on pages 10 to 11 and the role of the Remuneration
committee is set out in the Report on corporate governance on page 18.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors and to reward them for
enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of
senior management, and the determination of their annual remuneration package, is undertaken by the
Remuneration committee. The Board determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.
There are several elements to the remuneration policy:
Basic salary
Executive Directors’ base salaries are set by the Remuneration committee, taking into account the individual’s level
of responsibility, experience and performance. Salary levels are reviewed annually. In setting base salary levels, the
Remuneration committee also takes into account salary levels in comparable companies.
Taxable and other benefits
These include items such as private medical insurance and dental plans. These benefits are in line with the
remuneration policy framework. The Group did not contribute to any pension schemes on behalf of Directors in
2011. A defined contribution pension scheme was introduced in March 2012.
Share ownership plan
Circle Partnership is an employee share ownership plan and currently owns 49.9% of the shares in Circle Health. It
enables the participants (including Executive Directors) who contribute to the success and growth in value of Circle
Health to be owners of the business. The participants are issued shares in Circle Partnership, which are held by the
Circle Partnership Benefit Trust. Under the scheme, shares are awarded on deferred payment terms with the
purchase price for the shares becoming payable upon the occurrence of certain events, including the completion of
a sale of the shares by a participant. The subscription price for the shares is the Fair Market Value (‘FMV’) as
determined by an independent valuation.
Share warrants
Health Trust (Jersey), a family trust of which Ali Parsa is a beneficiary, holds a total of 2,340,765 share warrants at
an exercise price of £1.52 which entitle the holder to an equivalent number of ordinary shares in the Company. They
vest over a 24 month period from May 2011 and are exercisable from the date they vest (1/24 every month from
May 2011).
Service contracts
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors’ service contract notice periods to be no longer than 12 months,
with the Directors having to give not less than six months written notice. In the event of termination, the Company
will seek fair mitigation of contractual rights. Within legal constraints, the Remuneration committee tailors its
approach, in the event of early termination, to the circumstances of each individual case. The contracts of Executive
Directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control in the Company.
There have been no payments made during the year in relation to compensation for loss of office.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt4_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt4  31/05/2012  22:10  Page 21 Non-Executive directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, which may be extended by agreement
with the Board, subject to re-election by shareholders at the AGM. Such appointment may be terminated by the
Board or the Director with one months’ notice. None of the Non-Executive Directors are engaged on a service
contract with the Company.
The Chairman’s remuneration was determined by the Board based on industry practice and taking into account
relevant responsibilities and time commitment.
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of fees for services in connection with Board and committee
meetings. Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board, within the restrictions contained in the
Articles of Association. The levels of remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors reflect the time commitment and
responsibilities of the role. The Non-Executive Directors are not involved in deciding their fees.
Individual emoluments for the year
The table below shows a breakdown, including taxable and other benefits, for each Director for the year, or from
the date of appointment for those Directors appointed in the year:

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt4_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt4  31/05/2012  22:10  Page 23 The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Directors are required by Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The
Directors have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’), as well as applicable law. Under company law the Directors must not
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Group and the Company and the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
–         select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
–         make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
–         state whether applicable IFRS and UK accounting standards as appropriate, have been followed, subject to
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
–         prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume the
Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Group’s and Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of
the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with Companies
(Jersey) Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Disclosure of information to auditors
So far as the Directors are aware at the time the report is approved:
–         there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
–         each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make
himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are
aware of the information.
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office. A resolution concerning their
reappointment will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt4_158816 Project Halo - Report and Accounts Pt4  31/05/2012  22:10  Page 24 We have audited the Group financial statements of Circle Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which
comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of
changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the related notes. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 24 the Directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Chief Executive Officer’s Report, Chairman’s
Statement, Operating and Financial Review, Directors’ report, Corporate Governance Report and Remuneration
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
–         give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of the Group’s loss
and cash flows for the year then ended;
–         have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
–         have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Opinion on other matter
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us
to report to you if, in our opinion:
–         proper accounting records have not been kept or
–         the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
–         we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt5_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt5  31/05/2012  22:11  Page 30 1    General information
Circle Holdings plc, its subsidiaries and joint venture provide medical and property services in the UK.
The Company is a public limited company and is incorporated in Jersey. The registered office is 12 Castle Street, St
Helier, Jersey. Following a resolution on 23 May 2011 passed by the Board of Directors, the Company is now resident
in the UK for tax purposes.
2    Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and IFRIC interpretations, Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, on a
going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial
instruments and the fair valuing of share-based charges and certain loans. In their preparation, Management must
make certain critical accounting estimates and exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group’s
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement, assumption or estimates which are
significant to the consolidated financial statements are set out at the end of note 2.
Items included in the results of each of the Group’s subsidiaries and joint venture are measured using the functional
currency, which in all instances is sterling. The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling.
All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosure
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and as adopted by the European Union as at 31 December 2011. The following
new standards are effective for accounting periods beginning 1 January 2011 but have not had a material impact
on the results or financial position of the Group:
–         IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ – Amendments resulting from May 2010 Annual Improvements to
IFRSs
–         IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ – Amendments resulting from May 2010 Annual Improvements
to IFRSs
–         IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures’ – Revised definition of related parties
–         IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ – Amendments enhancing disclosures about transfers of financial
assets
–         IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ -Amendments to classification of rights issues
–         IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’ – Clarifies the requirements of IFRSs
when an entity renegotiates the terms of a financial liability
IFRS standards in issue, not yet effective as at 31 December 2011, but which will apply in the future are as follows:
•          IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ (amended regarding recovery of underlying assets)
•          IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ (as amended in June 2011)
•          IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments: classification and measurement’
•          IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial instruments’
•          IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’
•          IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’
The above amendments are not expected to materially impact the Group’s financial statements in future periods.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 31 Going concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group
will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for
a period of not less than 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements for the year ended 31
December 2011. These forecasts include the underwritten commitments received by the Company to raise a further
(i) £46,000,000 of funds from Numis Securities, subject to the terms of the placing agreement and shareholder
consent, and (ii) £1,500,000 of funds from Balderton Capital III L.P. subject to the terms of the subscription
agreement and shareholder consent, such shareholder consent expected on or about 18 June 2012 together with
existing cash balances and cash flows from the operating businesses.
The Board currently believes that, following the completion of the fundraising, the Group will have sufficient
funding to carry out its current plans. Should the Group not perform in line with the Board’s current expectations
or unforeseen circumstances occur the Group may need to seek additional debt and/or equity funding. Based on
this, the Directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future and as such, consider it appropriate for these financial statements to be prepared on a going
concern basis.
Basis of consolidation
i           Subsidiaries
The results of subsidiaries (defined as where the Group has control) are consolidated from the date on which
control of the net assets and operations of the acquired company are effectively transferred to the Group. Similarly
the results of subsidiaries disposed of cease to be consolidated from the date on which control of the net assets
and operations are transferred out of the Group.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners
of the business and the equity interests issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition
related costs are expensed as incurred.
ii          Circle Partnership share scheme
The results of Circle Partnership have been consolidated in these financial statements under SIC 12 ‘Consolidation:
special purpose entities’. The Circle Partnership share scheme is considered part of the Group owing to the nature
of the scheme (as disclosed in note 25), whereby employees, consultants and GPs who contribute to the growth in
value of the Circle Health group, subscribe for shares in Circle Partnership.
iii        Joint ventures
The Group has an interest in a joint venture. A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more
parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control and involves the establishment of a separate
entity in which each venturer has an interest. The Group recognises its interest in joint ventures using equity
accounting which requires the interest in the joint venture to be carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost
plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of its net assets and liabilities, less distributions received and
impairments in the value of individual investments. If the joint venture is in a net liability position, the Group
recognises a provision for its constructive and legal obligations in relation to the joint venture.
iv        Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings are recorded in the
consolidated income statement and balance sheet based upon the proportion of the non-controlling interest. 
This arises in Circle Health because of the portion of shares issued to employees, consultants and GPs via the Circle
Partnership share scheme which have vested unconditionally.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 32 The results of the subsidiaries and joint venture are measured as at the same reporting date as the parent company
using consistent accounting polices. Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating
decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Revenue
Revenue, which is measured as the fair value of consideration received for the activity performed, represents the
total amounts derived primarily from the provision of healthcare services in the UK, after deducting relevant
discounts and value added tax (where services provided are not exempt). Revenue is recognised on completion of
the patient’s appointment and can be broken down into the following:
–         Contracts with guaranteed volumes and payments 
Such contracts, namely the Nottingham ISTC long-term contract, offer guaranteed payments, based on
medical procedures performed, subject to various contractual provisions which require an element of the
revenue to be deferred until certain contractual obligations have been met. Profit is taken on the contract
as the appointments are completed but adjusted to reflect the contractual terms in relation to under
utilisation within contract quarters and years. Revenue is also accrued or deferred where treatment takes
place ahead or behind contractual activity levels. 
An element of this revenue is used to pay the costs of consultants.
–         Extended Choice Network 
Such NHS contracts offer payment by result, where the Group invoices directly for medical procedures
performed, following completion of the patient’s appointment. 
Again, an element of this revenue is used to pay the costs of consultants.
–         Private and self-pay 
Payment is based on procedures performed, either at contractually agreed insurance prices or self-pay rates,
which are determined by the specific procedure undertaken. 
In the case of private revenue, the insurance companies pay the consultants directly whereas for self-pay, an
element of the revenue is used to pay the costs of the consultants.
–         Other miscellaneous income 
Other miscellaneous income primarily relates to car parking revenue, property rental, advertising and
management fee income.
Operating financial asset
An element of the Nottingham ISTC income is attributable to construction services and is therefore recognised in
accordance with IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’, using the percentage of completion method. In the current
operational phase of the contract, a financial asset is recognised to the extent that the operator receives a fixed
payment from the client, irrespective of the extent of use.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 33 An element of income is allocated between interest receivable and the operating financial asset using the
contracted rate of return. Pursuant to IAS 39, an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of these
assets exceeds the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the contracted rate of return. The remainder of
the income is included within revenue in accordance with IFRIC 12. The Group only recognises income in respect of
the services provided, as it fulfils its contractual obligations and in line with the fair value of the consideration
receivable.
The underlying asset, namely the Treatment Centre, is not deemed to be an asset of the Group under IFRIC 12
‘Service concession arrangements’ because its residual ownership is deemed to lie principally with the DoH. To the
extent that there is an unconditional right to receive cash, the construction costs of the Treatment Centre are
recorded as a financial asset under the heading ‘Operating financial asset’ within ‘Trade and other receivables’ and
recognised at amortised cost.
Operating financial assets are presented as current where collection is expected within one year or less, otherwise
they are presented as non-current.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so
to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are items of income or expense,
either one-off in nature, non-cash or of such magnitude that the Directors believe separate disclosure is required
to allow readers to gain an understanding of the underlying results of the business.
Finance costs
Finance costs are recognised on an effective interest rate basis in the period in which they are incurred, except
where they are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset which takes a substantial
period of time to get ready for intended use, such as the construction of a hospital. In such cases, borrowing costs
are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset from the first date on which expenditure is incurred for the asset.
Capitalisation ceases when all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
On certain loans, interest is rolled up into the principal. This is taken into account when calculating the effective
interest rate.
Finance income
Finance income is accrued by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable.
Finance income arises on the operating financial asset, recognised at the effective interest rate of the project.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise:
i           Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business combination over the Group’s share
of the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the business acquired at the date
of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated at the lowest levels for which there are
separate identifiable cash flows for the purpose of impairment testing.
ii          Computer software
Computer software (defined as software that is not considered an integral part of the hardwareequipment)
represents third party costs incurred in relation to the Group’s information technology systems.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 34 iii        Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprise third party ‘know-how’ costs which meet the criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible
assets’. ‘Know-how’ costs are incurred in creating a ‘new build programme’ to standardise the design of
future world class hospitals by building them within a shortened time frame utilising standard build
components which have been manufactured off site.
Impairment and amortisation
Assets that have an indefinite useful life such as goodwill, or intangible assets that are still in their development
phase, are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are
indications of impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. The value in use is calculated using an appropriate discount rate. Gains and losses on disposal of
a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold.
Computer software and other intangible assets are recognised at cost, comprising purchase price from third parties
as well as internally generated development costs where relevant. Once the asset is complete, amortisation is
provided on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated useful life and the charge is
taken to administrative expenses. The intangible asset is assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication
that the asset may be impaired.
The useful economic life of the Group’s intangible assets is as follows:
Computer software – 3 years
New build programme ‘know-how’ – 5 years
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value
can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Historical cost comprises all amounts directly attributable to making assets capable of operating as intended,
including development costs and borrowing costs where relevant.
Depreciation is provided on all categories of property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold land and
assets under construction. Depreciation is based on cost less estimated residual value and is provided on a straight
line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Leasehold land – life of lease
Leasehold improvements – shorter of lease life or expected useful life (5–10 years)
Clinical equipment – 3 years
Furniture, fittings and office equipment,
(including commissioning costs) – 3 to 10 years

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 35 Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The expected useful lives of the
assets to the business are reassessed periodically in the light of experience. The carrying values of property, plant
and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes of circumstances indicate the carrying value
may not be recoverable.
Assets under construction
i           Commissioning costs in course of construction
Commissioning costs comprise staff, property, consultancy and operational costs directly related to the
commissioning of new build hospitals. Such costs are capitalised up to the point that the commissioning is
complete and the hospital is fully open for business, subsequent to which such expenditure is charged to the income
statement. Once commissioned, the asset is reclassified from ‘Assets under construction’ to the relevant property,
plant and equipment category and depreciated on a straight line basis in accordance with the estimated useful lives
as outlined above.
ii          Development costs in course of construction
Development costs which are directly attributable to the development of property are capitalised as part of the
cost of the property. The commencement of capitalisation begins when development costs for the property are
being incurred and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset ready for use are in progress. Capitalisation
ceases when all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Leases
Where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased item are transferred to the Group, the lease
is classified as a finance lease and capitalised at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value
of the minimum future lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction
of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are recognised in the income statement. Leased assets are depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
Where the Group does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, leases are
classified as operating leases. Operating lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the income
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognised over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories, primarily medical consumables, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises
purchase price less trade discounts, and is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Net realisable value means
estimated selling price, less all costs incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Obsolete stock is provided for
in the income statement.
Where title never transfers to the Group, consignment stock is held off balance sheet.
Amounts recoverable on contracts
Amounts recoverable on contracts are accounted for under IAS 11 and IAS 18. All costs incurred in advance of a
contract being awarded are written off to the income statement, until the date that, in the opinion of the Directors,
it is virtually certain that the contract has been secured. Once the Directors consider virtual certainty has been
achieved and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows, all future costs incurred up to the time
the contract becomes operational are carried as amounts recoverable on contracts, within ‘trade and other
receivables’. Once the contract is operational, the balance is accounted for as part of the accounting for the contract
as a whole in accordance with IAS 11 and IAS 18, and recognised in the income statement over the contract term.

Trade receivables represent amounts due from customers arising from the performance of services or sale of goods.
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, which includes
an allowance for impairment where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the contract. The allowance for impairment is the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows, discounted at the original
effective interest rate. The movement in the allowance for impairment is taken to administrative expenses.
Trade receivables are presented as current where collection is expected within one year or less, otherwise they are
presented as non-current.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and overnight deposits.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash at hand and overnight
deposits, less cash which is not freely available.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost. If payment is expected within one year or less, they are classified as current liabilities, otherwise
they are classified as non-current liabilities.
Pension costs
Nations Healthcare (Nottingham) Limited, Nations Healthcare (Burton) Limited and Nations Healthcare Limited
(together the ‘Nations Healthcare group’), Circle Hospital (Bath) Limited and Windsor Hand Surgery Limited operate
personal defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the income statement as they
become payable, in accordance with the rules of the scheme. The Group has no further payment obligation once
the contributions have been paid.
Current and deferred income taxation
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. The charge for current income tax is based on the results for the
period, as adjusted for items which are taxable or deductible in other accounting periods and items not taxed or
disallowed. The charge is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of
the reporting period.
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference is
due to the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction (other
than a business combination) which at the time of the transaction does not affect either taxable or accounting
profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 37 Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the
liability is settled using rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will
be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into derivative financial instrument arrangements to manage its exposure to interest rate
risk. The Group’s criteria for entering into such arrangements, namely interest rate swaps, are that the instrument
must be related to an asset or a liability and it must change the character of the interest rate by converting a
variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are classified as
current or non-current based on the timing of cash flows. Derivatives are subsequently remeasured to fair value at
each balance sheet date and the movement is recognised immediately in the income statement, in finance income
or finance costs accordingly.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation in respect of a past event, when it is probable
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and it can be reliably estimated. Provisions are
discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material, using an appropriate pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The
unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Loans and borrowings
All non-convertible loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and borrowings are carried at amortised cost, with any difference
between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowing, using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Compound financial instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible loans that can be converted to share
capital at the option of the holder. The number of shares to be issued is calculated based on the outstanding loan
commitment at the date of conversion.
The liability component of a compound instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that
does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially as the difference between
the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is
not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 38 Warrants
A warrant is an instrument issued by the Company which gives the holder the right to purchase shares in the
company at a specific price at a future date. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest
in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. A warrant is treated as a financial liability if:
–         it is a non-derivative and the Group is obliged to deliver a variable number of its shares; or
–         it is a derivative that will be settled other than by a fixed amount of cash or other assets for a fixed number
of the Company’s own shares.
Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the instrument based on the
allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are first recognised.
i           Equity warrants
The proceeds on issue of equity warrants are included within shareholders’ equity, net of transaction costs. The fair
value of the equity component is not re-measured in subsequent years. The fair value of warrants is credited to
equity with the debit being charged to the income statement or taken to non-current liabilities where the warrants
are linked to a loan.
Equity warrants are valued using an appropriate valuation methodology on a diluted pricing basis, based on the
relevant share price at the time of issue or based on an assessment of the market price at the time of issue.
ii          Financial liability warrants
Warrants issued that create a financial liability to the Group are presented as a liability in the balance sheet,
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value through profit and loss until
extinguished on conversion or redemption. The initial fair value of the warrant liability is determined using an
appropriate valuation methodology.
Share-based charges
Shares, and in some cases share warrants, are issued to employees and consultants. The fair value of the employee
services received in exchange for the grant of the warrants is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding credit
to equity. The total amount expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the warrants granted, including:
–         Any market performance conditions such as an entity’s share price;
–         Non-market performance conditions and service conditions included in assumptions about the number of
options that are expected to vest; and
–         The impact of any non-vesting conditions.
And excluding:
–         Impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (profitability, sales growth targets and
remaining an employee for a specified period of time).
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting
conditions are expected to be satisfied.
Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 39 Significant accounting judgements and estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors make judgements and estimates
concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The following judgements and estimates have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the
consolidated financial statements:
Judgements
The key judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
i           Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised on completion of a patient’s appointment. However the Nottingham ISTC contract
has certain claw-back clauses based on total contracted volumes over the quarter which means that
judgements must be made to defer a certain amount of income in the balance sheet. This includes the
recoverability of revenue recognised in excess of the minimum payments received.
ii          Lease classification
The Group has entered into various lease arrangements, the majority of which have been classified as
operating rather than finance leases under the interpretation of IAS 17 (‘Leases’).
iii        Consolidation of Circle Partnership share scheme
Circle Partnership is a special purpose entity which has been created to operate as an employee share
ownership plan. The results of this entity has been consolidated into the Group financial statements under
SIC 12 ‘Consolidation: special purpose entities’ on the basis that the entity is controlled by the Group.
iv        Amounts recoverable on contracts
Amounts recoverable on contracts which have been capitalised in accordance with IAS 11 and IAS 18, are
being amortised over the life of the contract. Estimates of future income may be inaccurate, such that profits
may not arise to support their carrying value.
Estimates
The key assumptions and estimates at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed
below:
i           Tax
The recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon an estimation of future taxable profits that will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. In the event that actual taxable
profits are different, such differences may impact the carrying value of such deferred tax assets in future
years. Based on this, management has not recognised the majority of deferred tax assets arising.
ii          Provisions
Provisions are assessed annually in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Provisions are recognised
where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will occur as a result of a past event or transaction
and a reliable estimate of the outflow can be made. In the event that estimates are wrong, this may impact
the income statement in future years.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 40 iii        Equity instruments
The issuance of equity instruments, in particular warrants, are valued dependent on the specific terms and
conditions of each instrument. Warrant valuations are calculated using several assumptions (eg: share price
volatility, probability of vesting events and time constraints) included within an option pricing model. Where
the value of any equity instrument is conditional on a number of potential outcomes, a Monte Carlo
simulation, a complex mathematical algorithm valuation (‘Monte Carlo simulation’) may be used. In the
event that estimates are wrong, this may impact the charge in future years.
iv        Share-based charges
Share-based charges are based on the warrant valuations calculated using several assumptions (eg: share
price volatility and time constraints) included within an option pricing model. In the event that estimates
are wrong, this may impact the charge in future years.
v          Useful lives and recoverability of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed on a regular basis to check they are still in use, to ensure their
useful economic life is in line with the expected life of the asset and that their carrying values are
recoverable. In the event that estimates are wrong, this may impact the income statement in future years.
vi        Fair value of financial instruments
The Group’s interest rate swaps are fair valued with their corresponding movement being recognised directly
in the income statement. These fair values are not based on quoted prices in active markets but on estimates
of observable market data. In the event that these estimates are wrong, this may impact the charge in the
income statement.
vii       Allowance for impairment of trade receivables
An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is made, based on the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest
rate. In the event that estimates are wrong, this may impact the income statement in future years.
viii     Goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill and intangibles are recognised at cost less impairment losses. The carrying amount of goodwill is
assessed annually based on value in use calculations, using cash flow projections based on three year
financial forecasts prepared by Management. Key assumptions relating to forecasts in revenue growth and
decline are used and in the event that these estimates are wrong, this may impact the income statement in
future years.
Intangible assets that are subject to amortisation are considered for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
3    Segmental reporting
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board. The Board reviews the Group’s internal
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources, and to date has divided the Group into three
reportable business segments based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. The Board
assesses the performance of the segments based on revenue, gross profit, EBITDA before exceptional items and
operating (loss)/profit. These are all measured on a basis consistent with that of the consolidated income
statement. Revenue charged between segments has been charged at arm’s length. Revenue from external customers
in the segmental analysis is measured in a manner consistent with the income statement. Geographic factors are
not considered as all of the Group’s operations take place within the United Kingdom.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 41 During the year, the Board has changed the way it reviews the results of the business and no longer allocates the
majority of head office and other central costs across the business segments. This has resulted in the 2010
segmental information being restated. ‘IFRS Improvement’ (endorsed 23 March 2010) has been adopted in relation
to non-disclosure of segment assets under IFRS 8. Assets and liabilities are not disclosed by segment as they are
not reported to the Board.
Overall, the Directors consider that the Group is principally a hospital operator, that treats privately insured, self-
pay and NHS patients. As the Group grows, a significant proportion of the independent hospitals’ revenue is likely
to derive from NHS patients, and consequently the Board going forward may manage the business as a single
segment, as the distinction between the type of patient and where they are treated becomes less distinct. This
would lead to an equivalent change in the disclosures below.

In 2011, Directors’ emoluments relate to the Non-Executive and Executive Directors, who are remunerated by Circle
Holdings plc and Circle Health. In 2010, prior to listing on AIM, there was only one Executive Director remunerated
by the Group, the remainder being employed by Capita, a fiduciary services company based in Jersey. In total, Capita
charged the Group £11,000 in the year to 31 December 2011 in their capacity as Directors of Circle Holdings plc
(2010: £22,000). Note 34 provides further details of the fiduciary services provided by Capita to the Group during
the year.
The Directors do not have any retirement benefits accruing under money purchase schemes (2010: none).
Included within 2011 is an amount for Ali Parsa, who is a beneficiary of Health Trust (Jersey), in which an associated
share-based charge arises. Note 27 provides more details.
Compensation of key management personnel
The Group made payments to key management personnel, defined as the key executive partners of the business,
for services provided to the Group as follows:
                                                                                                                                                       2011                     2010
                                                                                                                                                      £’000                    £’000
Short-term employment benefits                                                                                             624                      593
                                                                                                                                         ––––––––            ––––––––
As of May 2011, all key management personnel are also Directors of the Group and therefore from that date their
remuneration has also been disclosed within aggregate emoluments of the previous section.
Included within the above for both years is an amount for Ali Parsa, who is a beneficiary of Health Trust (Jersey), in
which an associated share-based charge arises. Note 27 provides more details.

12  Loss per share
Basic loss per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the parent by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted loss per ordinary share is calculated
by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume the conversion of all
potentially dilutive ordinary shares. Share warrants in issue represent the only category of dilutive ordinary shares
for the Group.
The following table sets out the computation for basic and diluted net loss per share for the year:

There is no difference in the weighted average number of ordinary shares used for basic and diluted net loss per
ordinary share as the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding is anti-dilutive.

Although the parent company is registered in Jersey, it became resident for UK tax purposes during the year and is
subject to UK corporation tax. The tax assessed on the Group’s loss for the year differs from the average standard
rate of UK corporation tax of 26.5% (2010: 28.0%). The differences are explained below:
                                                                                                                                                       2011                     2010

iii        Factors that may affect future tax charges
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 28.0% to 26.0% with effect from 1 April 2011. Further
changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 Budget Statement. The Finance Bill
2011 includes legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26.0% to 25.0% from 1 April 2012.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1.0% per annum to 23.0% by 1 April 2014.
Subsequently on 21 March 2012, the March 2012 Budget Statement announced that the UK Corporation tax rate
would be reduced to 24.0% from 1 April 2012. This was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012. As this rate had
not been substantively enacted at balance sheet date, deferred tax has been provided at 25.0%. There will not be
a material difference in the value of deferred tax based on the change of rate.
The proposed reduction of the main rate of corporation tax to 23.0% from 1 April 2013 is expected to be enacted
at Royal Assent in July 2012. A further reduction to 22.0% from 1 April 2014 is also expected.
The proposed rate changes may affect future tax charges and reduce the deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the
utilisation of any tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised may affect future tax charges.
iv        Deferred tax

i           Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that
business combination. CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the
Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes. The carrying amount of goodwill
has been allocated to the following CGUs:
                                                                                                                                                2011                    2010

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 51 Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently where there are indications that the
goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are determined based on value in use calculations,
using pre-tax cash flow projections based on management approved three year financial forecasts. The key
assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue growth and decline, based on past experience and
expectations of future changes in relevant CGUs. Cash flows for the three year period are discounted back to
present value using a risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate of 10.0%, which represents the industry average cost of
capital, adjusted to reflect the asset specific risks.
Based on this, the Group has impaired its goodwill on Circle Clinic Windsor by £33,000 (2010: £nil) in the year to
31 December 2011. The circumstances leading to the impairment are that the cash flows have been lower than the
original business plan. This has also resulted in a reduction to the contingent consideration and loan notes of
£15,000 (2010: £8,000, note 20) and £73,000 (2010: £27,000, note 21) respectively.
The management approved budgets for Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre are based on historic
performance and include assumptions that the contract will be renewed in July 2013 and a long-term growth rate
of 2.0%. The value in use calculations are sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the
discount rate and the long-term growth rate of 10.0% and 2.0% respectively, however it is estimated that a
quantity change in key assumptions will not cause an impairment in the goodwill related to Circle’s Nottingham
NHS Treatment Centre.
ii          Computer software
Computer software represents third party costs incurred in relation to the Group’s information technology systems.
Included within this category is £175,000 (2010: £70,000) spent on Manhattan, a relational database software with
specific abilities for facilities management.
iii        Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets include the development of ‘know-how’ for a new programme to build hospitals within a
shortened time frame. This is achieved by utilising standard build components which have been manufactured off
site at a reduced cost and reducing the amount of build time on site. During the year, Health Properties Limited
(Health Properties) invested £nil (2010: £20,000) in ‘know-how’. As the programme is still in the development
phase, amortisation has not yet been charged on these other intangibles. Once the programme has been fully
developed, the ‘know-how’ will be amortised over five years.

The Group has one joint venture, Health Properties Bath, which is incorporated in Jersey, owns the Bath hospital
building and land, and has a 25 year lease with CircleBath. Of the total allotted share capital of 3,000 ‘B’ shares and
100 ‘A’ shares in Health Properties Bath, the Group holds 1,200 ‘B’ ordinary shares, Health Estates Limited holds
1,800 ‘B’ shares and LB UK (RE) Limited (In Administration) (‘Lehmans’) holds 100 ‘A’ shares.
The ‘A’ shares and ‘B’ shares constitute different classes of shares for the purposes of law but, except as expressly
provided for in the Articles, confer upon the holders the same rights and rank pari passu in all respects. The
maximum number of Directors shall, unless otherwise determined by a special resolution, be six, of whom three
shall be ‘A’ Directors (representing the ‘A’ shareholders) and three shall be ‘B’ Directors
(representing the ‘B’ shareholders). Health Estates Limited has formally agreed to vote in accordance with the
Group and that the ‘B’ Directors of Health Properties Bath originally appointed by the Group will not change as a
result of Health Estates Limited’s shareholding. No party to the joint venture has control as a resolution can only
be made by the Board of Directors, with a majority of Directors.
As at 31 December 2011, the joint venture does not have any contingent liabilities or capital commitments. As at
31 December 2011, Group guarantees of up to £1,000,000 (2010: £4,000,000) were provided to Lehmans in respect
of certain contractual obligations of Health Properties Bath.

The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair value.
Long-term receivables have been discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.
Operating financial assets are recognised to the extent that there is an unconditional right to receive cash from the
construction of Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre through which the Group provides healthcare services.
Due to the length of the payment plans, receivables are entered at the present value of amortised costs. The annual
accumulation of interest on these discounted values is recorded as finance income (note 11) with the other portion
being deducted from receivables. In accordance with the principles of IFRIC 12, beneficial ownership of the
associated property asset lies with the purchaser of services and not with the Group as provider of those services.
Amounts owed by the joint venture are unsecured, interest-bearing and are repayable on demand. The Directors
have considered current cash flow forecasts and consider all related party balances to be fully recoverable.
During the year, there was an extension of the JCAM loan agreement from August 2012 to February 2013 and the
Group made an advance payment of £6,204,000 under the loan. Of this amount, £4,258,000 remains in
prepayments and accrued income.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:

Trade payables, accruals and amounts owed to joint ventures and other related parties are unsecured and interest-

The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximate to their fair value. Long

term
payables have been discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.
On the acquisition of Circle Clinic Windsor in 2008, contingent consideration arose, based on annual revenues over
the five years from the date of acquisition and payable in annual instalments to David Evans. These balances were
discounted to present value using a rate of 10.0%, with the discount unwinding over the five years post
-
acquisition.
During the year, the cash flow liabilities were reassessed based on actual and budgeted turnover over the remaining
life of the agreement, less payments already made during the year (note 14).
The Loan Note Instrument, which determines the unsecured loan notes and contingent consideration payable upon
the acquisition of Circle Clinic Windsor, sets out covenants and guarantees related to the acquisition. These
covenants are currently in breach due to the net asset value of the guarantor, Circle International plc, falling below
£3,000,000 in 2009 and not being remedied within 10 days of the original default. The balance has therefore been
classified as a current liability.
Movements in the balance of contingent consideration during the year have been as follows:

The Directors consider the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings to approximate to their fair value.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had breached certain covenants under the terms of the loan agreements.
A total of £13,930,000 (£13,614,000 JCAM and £316,000 unsecured loan notes) is repayable after 12 months from
the balance sheet date, but has been presented as current due to the breaches.
Details of the Group’s loans and any associated breaches are included in the notes below:
a         The Barclays Private Finance Initiative (‘PFI’) loan is secured by way of a fixed and floating charge over the
assets of Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre. Barclays also have a charge over the shares of Nations
Healthcare (Nottingham) Limited that can be exercised in the event that it does not meet its financial
obligation to Barclays. The loan is being repaid in quarterly instalments of £227,000 to £232,000, subject to
the repayment re-scheduling as agreed under the Deed of Variation (‘DoV’). Payment holidays were granted
for the scheduled payments on 1 June 2010 and 1 September 2010 and a partial repayment was granted
for the payment due on 1 December 2010. The loan has been hedged by means of an interest rate swap
(note 23), fixing interest at a total rate of 5.0% per annum.
The Barclays PFI loan of £42,621,000 (2010: £43,478,000) is not under any defaults or cross-defaults as at
31 December 2011.
b         The AIB loan facility is a term loan facility secured on land owned in Edinburgh. The loan was originally for
a one year term from 26 March 2008. The facility was extended twice during 2009, and subsequently during
2010 the facility was again extended until 31 March 2011, increasing the interest rate of the facility from
LIBOR + 3.0% to LIBOR + 4.0%. In March 2011, a further extension of the loan maturity date was agreed,
until 30 June 2012. The interest rate remains at LIBOR + 4.0% for the extension period but a requirement
of the extension agreement was to pay the entire interest amount into a restricted deposit account (note
19d).
The loan is secured on the assets of Health Properties (Edinburgh) Limited. Interest charged during the year
has been taken to the income statement.

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 58 c         The JCAM loan facility provides £13,300,000 together with rolled up interest of £831,000 giving a total
amount due at redemption of £14,131,000 (2010: £14,131,000). The loan is repayable in February 2013 and
carries an interest charge of 25.0%, payable quarterly. Warrants were issued to the lender at inception, and
the loan was fair valued, split between loans and warrants. The amount relating to warrants was valued at
£1,616,000 and taken to the warrant reserve in equity, giving rise to a loan balance at inception of
£11,684,000. At 31 December 2011 the loan was carried at £13,614,000 (2010: £13,224,000) and had an
effective interest rate of 28.8% (2010: 30.0%), taking into account both interest and accretion towards the
redemption amount. During 2011, the loan repayment date was extended from 29 August 2012 until 28
February 2013. The loan is secured over the shares of Nations Healthcare Limited, Nations Healthcare
(Burton) Limited and Nations Healthcare (North Bradford) Limited.
As a consequence of moving its tax residency to the UK in May, the Group is in technical breach under the
loan agreement with JCAM, due to the late payment of withholding tax, which has resulted in the loan being
disclosed within current liabilities. The Group reached resolution with JCAM in February 2012 to remedy this
breach and is otherwise compliant with all other obligations under the loan agreement (note 35).
In May 2011, the Group secured a short-term loan facility of £5,000,000 from Vinci to enable the purchase of land
in Didsbury, Manchester. The loan was repaid in December 2011 and the interest of £296,000 was capitalised (note
10).

In relation to the acquisition of Circle Clinic Windsor, the Group has issued loan notes to the former owners David
Evans and Pat Morrish that mature over five years from the date of acquisition and are dependent on performance
over that period. The Directors believe the undiscounted values of these loan notes are £273,000 (2010: £359,000)
and £91,000 (2010: £91,000) respectively. These are payable on 4 July 2013 and do not attract interest.
The Loan Note Instrument, which determines the unsecured loan notes and contingent consideration payable upon
the acquisition of Circle Clinic Windsor, sets out covenants and guarantees related to the acquisition. These
covenants are currently in breach (note 20) and the balance has therefore been classified as a current liability.

The Pebble Mill site lease liabilities are unsecured but are guaranteed by Circle Holdings plc. The Group can
terminate the Lease on 1 August 2046 or 1 August 2071 by giving at least six months written notice to the landlord.
In addition, the Group has two opportunities to reduce the annual rent; the first buy down right is within a period
of five years from the date of the Lease and the second buy down right is within a period of six months prior to the
first lease break date in 2046, both instances requiring payment of a premium calculated in accordance with a
formula set out in the lease and adjusted using the RPI index. There are no covenants or restrictions on the Group
imposed by this lease, and there are no contingent rents.
The value of the finance lease creditor of £4,225,000 (note 32), the implicit interest rate and the profile of the
annual rent in the early years of the lease initially gives rise to an interest charge greater than the rent payment.
The interest charge in excess of the rent payment is treated as an increase in the principal amount, which results
in the debit balance in the less than one year category.
The Singers finance lease liabilities are effectively secured as the rights to the leased asset revert to Singers in the
event of a default. At the end of the initial hire period, the Group is entitled to extend the duration of the lease and
pay an agreed secondary rental, or act as agent for the lessor in the sale of the equipment. There are no covenants
or restrictions on the Group imposed by this lease, and there are no contingent rents.

Dilapidations
This provision relates to the expected cost of returning various leased properties to their former state when the
Group exits the leases.
Onerous leases (property)
A lease for a property in West London was taken on in 2006, but since the premises are no longer required by the
Group, the site has been used to earn additional advertising revenue from the prime advertising space on top of the
building and rental income from renting out office space. The provision of £1,027,000 (2010: £939,000) has been
calculated based on the total net costs expected to be incurred by the Group until the first opportunity to exit the
lease arrangement, and has been reassessed at the year end based on the actual revenues achieved in 2011. The
resulting charge to the income statement of £549,000 (2010: net credit of £367,000) has been classified as an
exceptional item (note 7).
A lease for a property in Ashford, Kent was incepted in 2008, but since the premises are no longer required by the
Group, management intends to either sub-let the vacant premises or exit the lease early. Management are currently
negotiating with potential tenants and the provision of £154,000 (2010: £255,000) has been calculated based on
the total net costs expected to be incurred by the Group until the first opportunity to sub-let the property or exit
the lease arrangement.

was no longer in use and therefore was fully provided for until the end of the lease term. The lease has now ended
following the cessation of the contract to run the Burton Treatment Centre and there are no further commitments.
No discount has been applied to these provisions on the basis that the leases expire in the short-term and any
discount would be immaterial.

On 13 May 2011, share capital was increased from £700,000 (divided into 7,000,000 limited shares of £0.10 each)
to £2,000,000 (divided into 20,000,000 limited shares of £0.10 each).
On 1 June 2011, the shareholders passed a resolution adopting new Articles of Association ahead of the listing on
AIM. These articles, among other items, reclassified the share capital of the Company into a single class of ordinary
shares, thereby eliminating the previously authorised preference shares.
On the same date, pursuant to special resolutions passed by the shareholders of the Company at an Extraordinary
General Meeting, it was resolved that each issued and unissued ordinary share of the Company of £0.10 be sub-

Transaction costs incurred in relation to the 2011 equity raises totalled £4,336,000, of which £3,806,000 have been
capitalised within equity (2010: £27,000, all of which were expensed due to their immaterial amount). The 2011
proceeds are net of a warrant liability of £9,332,000 (31 December 2010: £1,971,000).
In March 2011, the Group received £7,500,000 of equity investment from existing shareholders. Of the total
consideration received, £23,000 has been allocated to share capital (234,375 ordinary shares at £0.10 each),
£2,277,000 to share premium, £2,959,000 to financial liabilities, being the warrants attached to the shares issued
(note 26(ii)), and £2,241,000 allocated to retained deficit.
In addition, a further consequence of the March 2011 equity raise was that all outstanding share warrants held by
those shareholders participating in the equity raise, priced at either £10.31* or £5.97*, were re-priced (note 26(i)
b).
In May 2011, the Group received £20,000,000 of equity investment. Of the total consideration received, £179,000
has been allocated to share capital (1,793,070 ordinary shares at £0.10 each), £13,448,000 to share premium, and
£6,373,000 to financial liabilities, being the warrants attached to the shares issued (note 26(ii)).
On 17 June 2011, the Group listed on AIM and raised gross proceeds of £25,577,000, before costs, in an Initial Public
Offering (‘IPO’). Of the total consideration received, £333,000 has been allocated to share capital (16,633,552
ordinary shares at £0.02 each) and £21,143,000 to share premium.

Circle Health
Circle Health (which has an authorised share capital of 100,000 ordinary shares of £0.10 nominal value that give
equal rights to the voting, dividend and capital of the company), is 50.1% owned by Circle International plc and
49.9% owned by Circle Partnership, an employee share ownership plan which therefore represents an interest
outside the Group (note 27). Circle Partnership has an authorised share capital of 100,000,000 ordinary shares of
£0.01 nominal value that give equal rights to the voting, dividend and capital of the company.
As required under SIC 12 ‘Consolidation: special purpose entities’, the results of Circle Partnership have been
consolidated into the Group financial statements as Circle Health is deemed to effectively control the Circle
Partnership.
Up to 31 December 2011, Circle Partnership had issued subscription letters for a total 47,463,000 shares (2010:
36,364,000 shares) to employees, consultants and GPs. Of these, the number of shares in Circle Partnership that
had vested unconditionally as at 31 December 2011 amounted to 26,608,000 shares (2010: 16,668,000 shares).
This portion of unconditionally vested shares gives rise to the non-controlling interest in the results of the Circle
Health group, which also includes Circle Partnership’s indirect holding in the Nations group, which is 100.0% (2010:
61.8%) owned by Circle Health.
Nations Healthcare group
The effect of the Nations Healthcare group restructure in October 2011, which has increased Circle Partnership’s
indirect holding in the Nations group from 30.9% to 49.9%, on the non-controlling interest’s share of current year
losses was £2,383,000.
Health Properties
Prior to August 2011, Health Properties was 90.0% owned by the Group and 10.0% owned by Health Properties
Benefit Trust, an employee share ownership trust for the employees of Health Properties. In August 2011, the Health
Properties Benefit Trust was wound up and all trust beneficiaries forfeited their shares in this scheme in exchange
for shares in the Circle Partnership share scheme. As a result, there is no longer a non-controlling interest in Health
Properties. Circle Holdings plc now owns 100.0% of the share capital in Health Properties, comprising 1,000,000 A
ordinary shares at £0.001 and 9,000 B ordinary shares at £1.00 each.
The effect of the winding up of the Health Properties share scheme on the non-controlling interest’s share of
current year losses was £835,000.

On 15 March 2011 some of the existing shareholders, together with Circle Health, Circle Partnership and Health
Partners, entered into a Share Transfer Agreement whereby Health Partners transferred a percentage of its holding
in Circle Holdings plc to the existing shareholders (note 34 (h)).
The transfer of these shares was conditional on Circle Health confirming it would allot shares in Circle Partnership
to Health Partners. As such, on 15 March 2011 and 24 May 2011, Circle Partnership agreed to issue ordinary shares
of £0.01 to Health Partners, equal to an aggregate 10.0% of the issued share capital in Circle Partnership. Alongside
the issuance of these shares at par value, it was agreed that in the event that Circle Partnership allotted any further
shares, Health Partners would be entitled to the same proportion, so that its 10.0% holding was not diluted.
Although these shares have yet to be issued, the grant has been authorised and there is a contractual agreement
to issue them.
The effect of the Share Transfer Agreement on the non-controlling interest’s share of current year losses was
£2,204,000. The effect of the anti-dilutive shares issued during 2011 was £535,000.
26  Warrants
The Group issues warrants which give the holders the right to purchase shares for a specific price at a future date.
The warrants are treated either as equity instruments and recorded in the warrant reserve, or as financial liabilities
and recorded in liabilities, depending on certain criteria, as outlined in the Group’s accounting policies.

re-issue of warrants to Health Trust (Jersey) are detailed in note 27.
b         In March 2011, the 623,090* warrants issued to existing shareholders in March 2008 with an exercise price
of £10.31*, and the 420,220* warrants issued to existing shareholders in November 2009 with an exercise
price of £5.97*, were modified with the exercise price being reduced to the IPO price of £1.52 per new
ordinary share issued. In total, 1,043,310* of such warrants remain in issue. The fair value of the warrants
was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, owing to the exercise price being conditional on the IPO,
and the fair value of the warrants was assessed at £1,398,000. Since this is lower than the fair value of
£6,344,000 calculated on the grant date, there is no change to the carrying value of these warrants.
* Reflects the five-for-one share split

As a result of the various equity raises with existing shareholders detailed below, in the case of a further equity raise
prior to 30 September 2011 and 30 May 2011 respectively, these existing investors would be allotted £0.10 anti-
dilutive ordinary share warrants with the number of warrants issued being based on the share price of the equity
raised in the subsequent offering. These warrants were valued by an independent external valuation firm using a
Monte Carlo simulation. Since the number of warrants to be issued was variable, the warrant portion of equity
raised was treated as a financial liability under IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments; presentation’. In June 2011 the Group
completed a further equity raise with the listing on AIM. As a result of all warrants being issued and subsequently
exercised, all associated financial liabilities have been extinguished. Further specific details are provided below:
November 2010 warrants
In November 2010, the Company raised £7,500,000 from a number of existing shareholders (note 24). The
total fair value of the accompanying anti-dilutive warrants was calculated to be £1,971,000 and the balance
was classified as current at 31 December 2010 as the liability was required to be settled at the earlier of a
further equity raise or 30 September 2011. At the point of listing on AIM, 6,229,071* warrants were issued
and exercised immediately for total consideration of £125,000. The issuance of the warrants resulted in an
exceptional mark to market charge of £7,373,000 (note 7) which represented the fair value movement of
the warrant instruments between November 2010 and the subsequent offering, being the IPO.
March 2011 warrants
In March 2011, the Company raised £7,500,000 from a number of existing shareholders (note 24). The total
fair value of the accompanying anti-dilutive warrants was calculated to be £2,959,000 and the balance was
classified as current as the liability was required to be settled at the earlier of a further equity raise or 30
May 2011. At the point of listing on AIM, 4,310,581* warrants were issued and exercised immediately for
total consideration of £86,000. The issuance of the warrants resulted in an exceptional mark to market
charge of £3,506,000 (note 7) which again represented the fair value movement of the warrant instruments
between March 2011 and the subsequent offering, being the IPO.
May 2011 warrants
In May 2011, the Company raised £20,000,000. A condition of the raise was that warrants were issued, exercisable
at nominal value, equal to 30.0% and 10.0% respectively of the warrants issued pursuant to the November 2010
and March 2011 warrant instruments. The warrants were valued by using the subscription price of £11.15* and
calculating the impact of the November 2010 and March 2011 warrants at this price. This resulted in the fair value
of the warrants being determined at £6,373,000. In June 2011 the Company completed a further equity raise with
the listing on AIM. At the point of listing, 4,215,861* warrants were issued and exercised immediately for total
consideration of £84,000. As a result of all warrants being issued and subsequently exercised the financial liability
was extinguished.

Shares and share warrants are issued to employees, consultants, GPs and external investors who contribute to the
success and growth in value of the Group. The issuance of these warrants and shares, including the issue of shares
to scheme participants and employees, qualifies as equity-settled share-based payment transactions and falls
within the scope of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’. The impact on the income statement in respect of share-based
charges is as follows. Note there is no charge associated with the transaction where the employees subscribe for
the shares at full market value:

a       Circle Partnership
Circle Partnership was established in 2008 as an employee share ownership plan and currently owns 49.9%
of the shares in Circle Health. It enables the participants (Group employees, consultants and GPs) who
contribute to the success and growth in value of Circle Health to be owners of the business. The participants
are issued shares in Circle Partnership which are held by the Circle Partnership Benefit Trust.
Under the scheme, shares are awarded on deferred payment terms. The purchase price for the shares
becomes payable upon the occurrence of certain events, including the completion of a sale of the shares by
a participant. The subscription price for the shares is the Fair Market Value (‘FMV’) as determined by an
independent valuation and as such, there is no share-based charge.
b      Health Trust (Jersey)
Health Trust (Jersey), of which Ali Parsa is a beneficiary, received 1,100,950
*
share warrants on 29 May 2008
as additional consideration for the sale of 100.0% of the shares in Health Properties to the Group and
received a further 237,450* warrants on 4 June 2008. The original exercise price was £11.93* per share and
the fair value of the warrants at the date of issue was determined to be £7.86* per warrant and £10,514,000
in total, according to the Black-Scholes pricing methodology (‘Black-Scholes’).
The share warrants, which were conditional on Ali Parsa remaining with the Group for a specified period of
up to 48 months, entitled the holder to acquire an equivalent number of ordinary shares in the Group and
have no expiry date.
c       Health Trust (Jersey) – option pool
Health Trust (Jersey) – option pool received 1,002,365* warrants on 27 November 2009. The original
exercise price was £10.31* and the fair value of the warrants at the date of issue was determined to be
£2.74* per warrant and £2,750,000 in total, according to Black-Scholes. The warrants had the same
conditions as (a) above except that they vested in 20.0% increments based upon the next five hospitals
opening during the hospital plan period and were conditional on Ali Parsa remaining with the Group at the
time of each hospital opening.

exchange for which new warrants with a different exercise price and vesting conditions were granted exclusively to
Health Trust (Jersey). Under the terms of the new warrants, the exercise price was set to the IPO price of £1.52*
per new ordinary share issued and the 2,340,765* share warrants vest over a 24 month period from May 2011 and
are exercisable from the date they vest (1/24 every month from May 2011) and do not have any expiry date. A fair
value assessment was completed based on the value of the existing warrants prior to cancellation and the fair value
of new warrants determined using Black-Scholes on a diluted pricing basis using the parameters outlined on the
next page.

The cancellation of share warrants issued to Health Trust (Jersey) and Health Trust (Jersey) -option pool and re-
issue of share warrants to Health Trust (Jersey) has been accounted for as a modification as it was intended to be
a replacement for the original awards. The incremental increase in the fair value was assessed at £1,478,000 and is
being charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period along with the residual charge relating
to the fair value at the grant date of the initial warrants.
The share-based charge recognised in the income statement for the year to 31 December 2011 is £1,597,000
(2010: £3,354,000) with the credit being recognised in the warrant reserve over the warrant vesting period. Aside
from the cancellation and re-issue outlined above, there were no new warrant issues qualifying as share-based
charges during 2011 (2010: nil). None of the warrants were exercised in 2011 (2010: nil). All the outstanding
warrants have an exercise price of £1.52* (2010: £11.93* and £10.31*).
Movements in the number of warrants outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

On 3 December 2010 Circle Hospital (Reading) Limited (‘CircleReading’) entered into an Agreement for Lease to
lease a hospital in Reading for 25 years at £4,750,000 per year from the date of completion of the hospital.
CircleReading’s obligations under the Agreement for Lease are guaranteed by the Company and its obligation to
lease the hospital is contingent upon the hospital being developed by the Developer in accordance with the terms
of the Agreement for Lease. The lease commitment is not included in the disclosure above.
During the year, non-repayment of the mezzanine loan provided to Health Properties Bath triggered a cross-default
under Circle International plc’s equipment lease with GE. The default was waived by GE on 22 May 2012 (note 35).

i           Financial risk factors
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and
interest rate risk. The Group seeks to limit the adverse effects of these risks by monitoring levels of debt finance and
the related finance costs, and by matching the risks of the financing with the risks and return profiles of the assets.
The risks are monitored by Management throughout the year via monthly reviews of operational performance, cash
flows, levels of individual debt instruments and overall debt levels.
Classes of financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise financial assets such as cash, short-term deposits, trade and other
receivables, and financial liabilities such as bank loans, loan notes, trade and other payables. In addition, the Group
is party to interest rate swaps to manage the Group’s interest rate risks arising from the Group’s sources of finance.
The following tables classify the Group’s financial instruments according to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments;
recognition and measurement’:

a       Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates or other price risks, will affect the income
from or the value of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters while optimising the return on risk.
The Group is primarily impacted by interest rate risk and other price risks which are outlined below:
1)     Interest rate risk
Financial instruments affected by market risk include bank loans, short-term deposits and derivative financial
instruments. The Group is primarily sensitive to changes in UK interest rates. This affects future cash flows
from short-term cash deposits and the cost of variable rate debt. The Group manages this risk, where
significant, by holding long-term loans and entering into interest rate swaps in order to fix the interest
payable on these. As at 31 December 2011, 62.4% (2010: 67.5%) of the Group’s loan and borrowings were
either held under fixed rate terms or fixed by interest rate swaps (note 23). Short-term deposits held at
floating rates of interest represented 22.2% (2010: 13.9%) of total assets of the Group.
The following table summarises the fixed and variable rate loans, and their effective interest rate:
                                                                          Variable                    Fixed       Interest-free                    Total

The rest of the debt in the Group is either fixed rate debt or has been fixed by means of a floating to fixed
interest rate swap. There is a zero effect of a change in interest rate on this debt. A variation in interest rates
on the cash balances would not give rise to a significant change in value and therefore have not been
included in the table above.
2)     Other price risks
The Group has a number of long-term contracts containing fixed indexation provisions. The Group generally
seeks to price contracts at levels that take account of increasing prices. As the volume of private patients is
anticipated to increase, the Group will be increasingly subject to pricing changes from private insurance
companies.
b      Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash
deposits, with their maximum exposure being represented by their carrying amount.
The Group has policies with customers that require upfront payment, where appropriate. Credit control procedures
are designed to ensure that invoiced revenue is collected according to agreed terms, that policies exist to limit
exposure to any one party and ensure approved credit limits are reviewed regularly. These all help to eliminate
significant concentrations of credit risk.
Most revenues arise from insured patients’ business and the NHS. Insured patients give rise to trade receivables
which are mainly due from large insurance institutions, who have high credit worthiness. The remainder of revenues
arise from individual self-pay patients.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 76 Due to the nature of the monthly minimum take Nottingham ISTC contract with the DoH and the interest rate
swap on the Barclays PFI loan, there is no material price or credit risk exposure for Circle’s Nottingham NHS
Treatment Centre.
Group policy is to deposit cash with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A+ by key rating
agencies.
c       Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s approach to liquidity is to manage short and long-term borrowings to ensure that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk damaging the
Group’s reputation.
This is achieved by robustly managing cash generation across its operations, by applying cash collection targets
throughout the Group and by managing liquidity risk via long-term debt and equity funding from shareholders.
The Group has received strong support from its shareholders who have provided equity cash funding when
necessary to fund the Group’s activities. These funds have been utilised to support the business plans of the Group
in accordance with the Group’s financial projections which are updated on a regular basis.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative and derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contract maturity date. The amounts
included in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows:

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 77 The risk that the outflow of cash occurs significantly earlier than the maturity analysis disclosed or for a
significantly different amount than those indicated is mitigated by the fact that the trade payables are due
imminently, and the principal and interest on the bank loans (and corresponding derivative financial instrument) are
contractual obligations whose timings are clearly defined and fixed unless a breach of covenant takes place.
ii          Capital risk
The primary objective of the Group’s management of debt and equity is to ensure the continued growth of the
business, including the financing of new hospitals, equipment and start-up costs, including Head Office overheads,
in order to provide returns for the Group shareholders, Circle Partnership and other stakeholders. The Group raises
financing when needed through a combination of equity and debt.
Objectives are set out at the beginning of each year in line with the imposed requirements of the shareholder
agreements. Covenants are tested monthly.
iii        Fair value
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by
valuation technique:
Level 1:          quoted prices in active markets,
Level 2:          inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). This level includes the majority of Over
The Counter derivative contracts, traded loans and structured debt. The sources of input parameters
like LIBOR yield curve or counterparty credit risk are Bloomberg and Reuters.
Level 3:          inputs of the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:

The transfer of shares between Health Partners and the existing shareholders was conditional on Circle
Health confirming it would allot shares in Circle Partnership to Health Partners. As such, on 15 March 2011
and 24 May 2011, Circle Partnership agreed to issue Health Partners ordinary shares of £0.01 equal to an
aggregate 10.0% of the issued share capital in Circle Partnership. Alongside the issuance of these shares at
par value, it was agreed that in the event that Circle Partnership allotted any further shares, Health Partners
would be entitled to the same proportion, so that its 10.0% holding was not diluted. The effect of the Share
Transfer Agreement on the non-controlling interest’s share of current year losses was £2,204,000.

Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust
On 1 February 2012, the Group commenced the operation of the contract to manage the Hinchingbrooke Health
Care NHS Trust.
JCAM restructure
On 3 February 2012, the Company and JCAM agreed to restructure the Company’s existing £14,131,000 loan. The
loan was repaid and a new loan for £14,131,000 was entered into between JCAM and CH Subco Limited, a wholly-
owned Jersey subsidiary of the Company, on materially the same terms as the previous loan. As part of the
restructuring, JCAM waived any breaches under the previous loan. The Group provided enhanced security over its
assets and the Company placed £1,536,000 in a pledged account in favour of JCAM to cover any future liabilities
arising under the loan. The new loan is due to be repaid in February 2013.
2012 fund raise
On 28 May 2012, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Numis Securities and a subscription
agreement with Balderton Capital III L.P. to raise an aggregate of £47,500,000 by way of equity funding, before fees,
at a price per share of £0.70. The equity fund raise is subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement, the
subscription agreement, and shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting to be held on or about 18
June 2012. Shareholders representing in excess of 75% of the current issued share capital have irrevocably
undertaken to vote in favour of the shareholder resolutions to approve the issue of new shares in connection with
the equity fund raise.
Resolution of cross default on GE lease
The cross-default under Circle International plc’s equipment lease with GE (note 30), triggered by non-repayment
of the mezzanine loan provided to Health Properties Bath, was waived by GE on 22 May 2012 following the
completion of the restructuring of loans on 22 May 2012. Under the restructured terms, Circle Holdings plc has
granted a guarantee to Lehman in respect of the repayment of the mezzanine debt, with Circle Holdings plc’s
liability under the guarantee being capped at £625,000.
AIB loan
The Group is currently in discussion with AIB regarding the loan facility which is secured on land owned in Edinburgh
with no recourse to the Group. The loan matures on 30 June 2012 (note 21).

158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt6_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt6  31/05/2012  22:14  Page 83 We have audited the financial statements of Circle Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which
comprise the company balance sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 24 the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Chief Executive Officer’s Report, Chairman’s
Statement, Operating and Financial Review, Directors’ report, Corporate Governance Report and Remuneration
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
–         give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011;
–         have been properly prepared in accordance United Kingdom Accounting Standards; and
–         have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Opinion on other matter
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us
to report to you if, in our opinion:
–         proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company; or
–         the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records;
–         we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

agreement and shareholder consent, such shareholder consent expected on or about 18 June 2012 together with
existing cash balances and cash flows from the operating businesses.
The Board currently believes that, following the completion of the fundraising, the Company will have sufficient
funding to carry out its current plans. Should the Company not perform in line with the Board’s current expectations
or unforeseen circumstances occur the Company may need to seek additional debt and/or equity funding. Based
on this, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future and as such, consider it appropriate for these financial statements to be prepared on a going
concern basis.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are valued at cost less provision for impairment. The carrying value
of fixed asset investments is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full (without discounting) based on current tax rates and law, on timing differences that
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future except as
otherwise required by FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’.
Warrants
A warrant is an instrument issued by a company which gives the holder the right to purchase shares in that
company at a specific price at a future date. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest
in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. A warrant is treated as a financial liability if:
–         it is a non-derivative and the entity is obliged to deliver a variable number of the company's own shares; or
–         it is a derivative that will be settled other than by a fixed amount of cash or other assets for a fixed number
of the company’s own shares.
Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the shares based on the
allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are first recognised.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011
158816 Halo - Report and Accounts Pt7_158816 Halo Report and Accounts Pt7  31/05/2012  22:17  Page 87 i           Equity warrants
The proceeds on issue of equity warrants are included within shareholders’ equity, net of transaction costs. The fair
value of the equity component is not remeasured in subsequent years. The fair value of warrants is credited to
equity with the debit being charged to the income statement or taken to non-current liabilities where the warrants
are linked to a loan.
Equity warrants are valued using an appropriate valuation methodology on a diluted pricing basis, based on the
relevant share price at the time of issue or based on an assessment of the market price at the time of issue.
ii          Financial liability warrants
Warrants issued that create a financial liability to the Company are presented as a liability in the balance sheet,
measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently at amortised cost until extinguished on
conversion or redemption. The initial fair value of the warrant liability is determined using an appropriate valuation
methodology.
Capital contributions
Share-based incentive schemes for employees are operated by subsidiary undertakings that are settled by equity
instruments in the Company. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to
the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised over the vesting period, which ends on the
date on which relevant employees become fully entitled to the warrants in the Company.
The grant of these warrants in the Company to the employee of the subsidiary undertaking is treated as a capital
contribution. The fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to the investment in subsidiary
undertaking, with a corresponding credit to equity.
2    Profit and loss
The result for the year is a loss of £67,728,000 (2010: profit of £24,000).
3    Auditors’ remuneration
The Company incurred £25,000 (2010: £22,000) in relation to UK statutory audit fees for the year ended
31 December 2011.
4    Directors’ emoluments
During the year £116,000 was paid directly to Directors of the Company (2010: £22,000). Remuneration was paid
to other Directors via subsidiary companies, total details of which are included in the Directors’ Remuneration
report.

On 13 May 2011, share capital was increased from £700,000 (divided into 7,000,000 limited shares of £0.10 each)
to £2,000,000 (divided into 20,000,000 limited shares of £0.10 each).
On 1 June 2011, the shareholders passed a resolution adopting new Articles of Association ahead of the listing on
AIM. These articles, among other items, reclassified the share capital of the Company into a single class of ordinary
shares, thereby eliminating the previously authorised preference shares.
On the same date, pursuant to special resolutions passed by the shareholders of the Company at an Extraordinary
General Meeting, it was resolved that each issued and unissued ordinary share of the Company of £0.10 be
sub-divided into five ordinary shares of £0.02 each, effective 14 June 2011.

b     In March 2011, the 623,090* warrants issued to existing shareholders in March 2008 with an exercise price of £10.31*, and
the 420,220* warrants issued to existing shareholders in November 2009 with an exercise price of £5.97*, were modified
with the exercise price being reduced to the IPO price of £1.52 per new ordinary share issued. In total, 1,043,310* of such
warrants remain in issue. The fair value of the warrants was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, owing to the
exercise price being conditional on the IPO, and the fair value of the warrants was assessed at £1,398,000. Since this is lower
than the fair value of £6,344,000 calculated on the grant date, there is no change to the carrying value of these warrants.

November 2010 and March 2011 warrants
As a result of the various equity raises with existing shareholders detailed below, in the case of a further equity raise
prior to 30 September 2011 and 30 May 2011 respectively, these existing investors would be allotted £0.10 anti-
dilutive ordinary share warrants with the number of warrants issued being based on the share price of the equity
raised in the subsequent offering. These warrants were valued by an independent external valuation firm using a
Monte Carlo simulation. Since the number of warrants to be issued was variable, the warrant portion of equity
raised was treated as a financial liability under IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments; presentation’. In June 2011 the
Company completed a further equity raise with the listing on AIM. As a result of all warrants being issued and
subsequently exercised, all associated financial liabilities have been extinguished. Further specific details are
provided below:
November 2010 warrants
In November 2010, the Company raised £7,500,000 from a number of existing shareholders (note 24). The
total fair value of the accompanying anti-dilutive warrants was calculated to be £1,971,000 and the balance
was classified as current at 31 December 2010 as the liability was required to be settled at the earlier of a
further equity raise or 30 September 2011. At the point of listing on AIM, 6,229,071* warrants were issued
and exercised immediately for total consideration of £125,000.

In March 2011, the Company raised £7,500,000 from a number of existing shareholders. The total fair value
of the accompanying anti-dilutive warrants was calculated to be £2,959,000 and the balance was classified
as current as the liability was required to be settled at the earlier of a further equity raise or 30 May 2011.
At the point of listing on AIM, 4,310,581* warrants were issued and exercised immediately for total
consideration of £86,000.
May 2011 warrants
In May 2011, the Company raised £20,000,000. A condition of the raise was that warrants were issued, exercisable
at nominal value, equal to 30.0% and 10.0% respectively of the warrants issued pursuant to the November 2010
and March 2011 warrant instruments. The warrants were valued by using the subscription price of £11.15* and
calculating the impact of the November 2010 and March 2011 warrants at this price. This resulted in the fair value
of the warrants being determined at £6,373,000. In June 2011 the Company completed a further equity raise with
the listing on AIM. At the point of listing, 4,215,861* warrants were issued and exercised immediately for total
consideration of £84,000. As a result of all warrants being issued and subsequently exercised the financial liability
was extinguished.

12  Capital contributions
Shares and share warrants are issued to employees, consultants, GPs and external investors who contribute to the
success and growth in value of the Company. The issuance of these warrants and shares, including the issue of shares
to scheme participants and employees, qualifies as equity-settled share-based payment transactions and falls
within the scope of FRS 20 ‘Share-based payment’. The impact on the income statement in respect of share-based
charges is as follows. Note there is no charge associated with the transaction where the employees subscribe for
the shares at full market value.

a       Circle Partnership
Circle Partnership was established in 2008 as an employee share ownership plan and currently owns 49.9%
of the shares in Circle Health. It enables the participants (employees, consultants and GPs) who contribute
to the success and growth in value of Circle Health to be owners of the business. The participants are issued
shares in Circle Partnership which are held by the Circle Partnership Benefit Trust.
Under the scheme, shares are awarded on deferred payment terms. The purchase price for the shares
becomes payable upon the occurrence of certain events, including the completion of a sale of the shares by
a participant. The subscription price for the shares is the Fair Market Value (‘FMV’) as determined by an
independent valuation and as such, there is no share-based charge.
b      Health Trust (Jersey)
Health Trust (Jersey), of which Ali Parsa is a beneficiary, received 1,100,950* share warrants on 29 May 2008
as additional consideration for the sale of 100.0% of the shares in Health Properties to the Group and
received a further 237,450* warrants on 4 June 2008. The original exercise price was £11.93* per share and
the fair value of the warrants at the date of issue was determined to be £7.86* per warrant and £10,514,000
in total, according to Black-Scholes.

up to 48 months, entitled the holder to acquire an equivalent number of ordinary shares in the Group and
have no expiry date.
c       Health Trust (Jersey) -option pool
Health Trust (Jersey) -option pool received 1,002,365* warrants on 27 November 2009. The original exercise
price was £10.31* and the fair value of the warrants at the date of issue was determined to be £2.74* per
warrant and £2,750,000 in total, according to Black-Scholes. The warrants had the same conditions as (a)
above except that they vested in 20.0% increments based upon the next five hospitals opening during the
hospital plan period and were conditional on Ali Parsa remaining with the Group at the time of each hospital
opening.
In May 2011, all of the above share warrants were cancelled, in exchange for which new warrants with a different
exercise price and vesting conditions were granted exclusively to Health Trust (Jersey). Under the terms of the new
warrants, the exercise price was set to the IPO price of £1.52* per new ordinary share issued and the 2,340,765*
share warrants vest over a 24 month period from June 2011 and are exercisable from the date they vest (1/24 every
month from May 2011) and do not have any expiry date. A fair value assessment was completed based on the value
of the existing warrants prior to cancellation and the fair value of new warrants determined using Black-Scholes on
a diluted pricing basis using the parameters outlined below.

The cancellation of share warrants in Health Trust (Jersey) and Health Trust (Jersey) -option pool and re-issue of
share warrants to Health Trust (Jersey) has been accounted for as a modification as it was intended to be a
replacement for the original awards. The incremental increase in the fair value was assessed at £1,478,000 and is
being charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period along with the residual charge relating
to the fair value at the grant date of the initial warrants.
The share-based charge recognised in the income statement for the year to 31 December 2011 is £1,597,000
(2010: £3,354,000) with the credit being recognised in the warrant reserve over the warrant vesting period. Aside
from the cancellation and re-issue outlined above, there were no new warrant issues qualifying as share-based
charges during 2011. None of the warrants were exercised in 2011 (2010: nil). All the outstanding warrants have an
exercise price of £1.52* (2010: £11.93* and £10.31*).

OVERVIEW
Chairman’s Statement
Our business model is resilient 
and our market opportunity 
remains large and attractive.
I am pleased to report that 2016 was another very good year of 
progress for 4imprint. Revenue for the year was $558.2m, an 
increase of 12% over prior year. The revenue increase on a 
like-for-like basis was 13%, after adjusting for the effects of a 53
rd
 
week in the 2015 comparative accounting period and a negative 
currency impact on the results of our UK-based business. All 
revenue growth was organic.
Underlying profit before tax rose to $38.4m, up 14% over 2015. 
Profit before tax was $34.2m, 10% higher than 2015. This result is 
consistent with our strategy to maximise revenue growth whilst 
maintaining a broadly stable operating margin percentage. 
Investment in marketing remains the primary growth driver. A 
major milestone was reached in 2016: the total number of orders 
received in the year surpassed one million for the first time.
The Group ended 2016 in a strong financial position. Low fixed 
capital requirements and good working capital management 
resulted in efficient cash conversion. The year end cash balance of 
$21.7m was an increase of $3.3m over 2015, despite a planned 
one-off pension contribution in the year of $14.5m.
Significant progress was made during 2016 in respect of the 
Group’s legacy defined benefit pension scheme. The buy-out 
process is complete. Going forward, contributions into the 
remaining plan, which consists primarily of deferred pensioners, 
will be at a much lower level over the next several years.
John Poulter retired on 30 November 2016 from his position as 
Non-Executive Chairman of the Group. John joined the Board in 
May 2010, and his leadership was instrumental in the success of 
the Group over recent years. The Board wishes to express its 
gratitude to John and to wish him well for the future. I was 
appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director in February 
2016 and subsequently as Non-Executive Chairman on 
1 December 2016. 
At the half year the Board declared an interim dividend per share 
of 16.32c, an increase of 35% over 2015. This increase was set in 
the context of expected reduced future contributions to the 
pension scheme, along with the ongoing cash generative nature of 
the Group’s trading operations. As anticipated, the Board confirms 
that it is recommending a final dividend of 36.18c, also an increase 
of 35% over prior year.
A relentless focus on customer care is at the heart of our business, 
and I would like to thank every one of our talented and dedicated 
team members for maintaining remarkable service levels as the 
business continues to grow.
Our business model is resilient and our market opportunity remains 
large and attractive. After a period of volatility in the fourth 
quarter of 2016 caused by uncertainty around the US presidential 
election, customer order activity normalised in December. The first 
few weeks of 2017 have shown a satisfactory start to the year.

The 2016 financial results are consistent with the Group’s 
established financial strategy of prioritising organic revenue growth 
whilst maintaining a broadly stable operating margin percentage.
Total Group revenue was $558.22m, which was 12% ahead of 
prior year. This growth measure was negatively influenced by the 
fact that the 2015 comparative contained an ‘extra’ week of sales 
due to a 53 week accounting period, in addition to which the 
reported revenue of our UK business was adversely affected by 
currency swings following the EU referendum in June. Adjusting 
for these two factors, the like-for-like revenue increase over 2015 
was 13%. On a similarly adjusted basis, revenue at the half year 
was up 15%, meaning that the growth rate in the second half of 
the year was slightly lower than that experienced in the first half. 
The North American business, which comprises 97% of Group 
revenue, continued to grow well ahead of the promotional 
products industry as a whole, which was estimated by US industry 
sources to have grown by approximately 3.1%. Fourth quarter 
trading patterns were disrupted, with order intake in October and 
November, particularly in respect of new customers, running 
markedly lower than the year to date run rate. This correlated 
directly with a six to eight week period of uncertainty leading up 
to, and immediately following, the US election. Leading indicators 
and order activity recovered towards the end of the year, with 
December performance returning to anticipated levels.
Reported revenue for the UK operation was 2% lower than prior 
year. This result should, however, be set firmly in the context of the 
material currency movements following the EU referendum in late 
June. In underlying currency the year on year growth rate was 11%, 
also well above the estimated UK industry growth rate of 6.1%.

Strategic  
Report Overview
More than 240,000 new customers were acquired in 2016. On a 
like-for-like basis orders from new customers were up 6% over 
prior year, and orders from existing customers increased by 15% 
compared to 2015. In total, 1,054,000 individually customised 
orders were processed by our dedicated and talented customer 
service teams – the first time that more than a million orders have 
been received in one year.
Effective and innovative marketing is the key driver of our 
continued growth. During 2016 we continued to invest a 
significant proportion of our overall marketing funds into customer 
acquisition activities. In addition to our well-established offline 
prospecting initiatives, a critical part of the 2016 marketing mix 
involved understanding and developing strategies around changes 
in the dynamics of the search engine platforms which take up a 
large part of our online marketing budget. Customer retention was 
driven in large part by our ever-popular and constantly evolving 
Blue Box™ sample mailings, complemented by our relentless focus 
on delivering remarkable customer service. Revenue per marketing 
dollar is the KPI used to assess whether our increasing investment 
in marketing remains consistent with our strategy. In 2016 this was 
$5.77, compared to $5.92 in 2015. This was in line with our 
expectations and with our financial strategy, delivering both 
organic revenue growth and a stable operating margin percentage.
Underlying operating profit, excluding Head Office expenses, 
increased by 14%, compared to a 12% increase in reported 
revenue. The resulting increase in operating margin percentage in 
the trading businesses had three major components: (i) a slightly 
improved gross margin percentage; (ii) improved revenue per 
payroll dollar, effectively offsetting the movement in revenue per 
marketing dollar; and (iii) some gearing effect from the fixed or 
semi-fixed elements in selling costs and other overheads. 
Head office costs increased by 11% compared to prior period. 
There was no significant change in the structure and activities of 
the central function. The variance arose primarily due to losses on 
the maturity of forward currency contracts taken out before the EU 
referendum to hedge cash flows from the US, partly offset by a 
favourable currency effect from the translation into reporting 
currency of costs incurred in Sterling.  
Overall, the Group’s underlying operating margin percentage for 
2016 was 6.87%, compared to 6.74% in 2015. This is within the 
bandwidth to be consistent with our strategic intention to deliver a 
broadly stable operating margin percentage.
For the ninth year in a row, the North American business was 
named on the list of the Top 25 Best Medium Sized Workplaces in 
the USA. The UK business maintains its Investors in People 
accreditation. We are proud of our workplace and our culture, and 
as such we remain confident in our ability to innovate, adapt and 
continue to generate attractive levels of profitable organic growth.
Effective and innovative marketing is  
the key driver of our continued growth. 
During 2016 we continued to invest  
a significant proportion of our overall 
marketing funds into customer 
acquisition activities.  4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 08
STRATEGIC REPORT
Strategy
Operationally, the objective is to deliver competitive advantage through sustained 
investment in marketing, people, systems technology and data analytics.
Financially, the objectives are to maximise organic revenue growth whilst 
maintaining a broadly stable operating margin percentage and to retain an efficient 
cash conversion ratio, assisted by the low capital intensity of the business.
4imprint has a rolling three year strategic planning process, providing a framework 
for the delivery of the revenue growth required to underpin both sustainable 
growth in earnings per share and a policy of progressive dividend increases.
4imprint’s strategy is to develop its position as the 
leading direct marketer of promotional products in 
the fragmented markets in which it operates.

Where we do business
We operate in two primary geographical 
markets.
• North America: The US and Canadian 
promotional products markets together 
are estimated to total around $25 
billion. 
• UK and Ireland: The UK and Irish 
promotional products market size is 
estimated at around £970 million, or 
$1.2 billion.
The promotional products marketplace is 
fragmented. The largest market, the USA, 
is served by around 23,000 distributors,  
of whom more than 20,500 have annual 
sales of less than $2.5 million. The profile 
is similar in the Canadian and UK/Irish 
markets.
4imprint is the largest direct marketer of 
promotional products in each market and 
has consistently increased market share, 
through organic growth, at a rate 
significantly ahead of the overall growth 
rate in the industry.
What we sell
We sell an extensive range of promotional 
products – merchandise custom printed 
with the logo or name of an organisation 
with the intention of promoting a brand, 
service, product or event.
Our product range comprises tens of 
thousands of individual products ranging 
from basic giveaways such as pens, bags 
and drinkware to higher value items such 
as embroidered apparel, business gifts 
and full size trade show displays. 
Merchandising specialists work closely 
with suppliers, continually updating the 
product range and developing new 
products or lines, many of which are 
exclusive to 4imprint.
Our customers
Promotional products are purchased by a 
wide range of individuals within all types 
and sizes of businesses and organisations. 
The products have many uses: as an 
integral part of sales and marketing 
activities; for recruitment or recognition 
initiatives; to promote health and safety 
programmes; and for any other method  
of making a connection between the 
customer’s organisation and the recipient 
of the item.
We define our customer as the individual 
placing the order, rather than the business 
or organisation for which the individual 
works or with which he/she is associated. 
As such, our customers can be found 
across the different areas of geography, 
industry categories, size of business/
organisation and charitable, religious or 
governmental institutions.
No single customer comprises a material 
part of 4imprint’s overall revenue.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Business Model
Our commercial operations are built around  
a direct marketing business model capable  
of introducing millions of potential customers  
to tens of thousands of customised promotional 
products.
Our model has favourable cash characteristics: minimal inventory requirements; a 
high proportion of orders paid for by credit card; and ongoing capital investment 
broadly in line with depreciation charge. Increasing investment in marketing 
activity and technology is funded out of operating cash flow, sustaining 
competitive advantage and further growth in market share.

Share option charges
The Group charged $0.43m (2015: $0.30m) in respect of IFRS2, 
“Share-based payments”. This was made up of various elements: 
the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) approved by Shareholders on 
27 April 2011, which matured in April 2016; charges under the 
2015 Incentive Plan, approved at the 2015 AGM, in respect of 2015 
actual and 2016 accrued awards; and a charge in respect of the 
2016 UK SAYE and US ESPP plans. 
Current options and awards outstanding are 144,826 shares under 
the 2016 UK SAYE and US ESPP plans and 26,128 shares under the 
2015 Incentive Plan.
Exceptional items
A total of $2.94m (2015: $0.86m) was charged to exceptional 
items in the year, which all related to pension risk reduction 
activity. There were three components of the charge: (i) $1.32m  
of buy-out related costs incurred and paid by the pension scheme;  
(ii) $1.45m representing a past service charge in respect of 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalisation; and (iii) $0.17m paid 
by the Group in respect of fees incurred on the buy-out project.
Net finance income
Net finance expense for the year was $0.03m (2015: income of 
$0.03m), reflecting non-utilisation fees on the US line of credit, 
offset partially by modest interest received on the investment of 
cash balances in short-term deposits.

Operating result
Group revenue in 2016 was $558.22m, (2015: $497.22m), an 
increase of 12% over prior year. Underlying operating profit before 
tax was $38.35m (2015: $33.55m), up 14% over the 2015 
comparative. Operating profit was $34.15m (2015: $31.16m).
2015 was a 53 week accounting period for the Group, reverting 
back in 2016 to the normal 52 week timeframe. This means that 
the comparative contains around $4.0m of additional revenue from 
the “extra” week. Another factor to note in year on year revenue 
comparisons is an adverse currency effect of around $2.2m arising 
from the translation of the results of the UK business into reporting 
currency. Adjusting the comparative for these two items, Group 
revenue growth over prior year was 13%. 
In terms of underlying operating profit, the additional week in the 
comparative had a negligible effect due to a full week of payroll 
and overheads offsetting the additional gross margin arising from a 
quiet week of revenue during the holiday season.
Foreign exchange
The US dollar exchange rates material to the Group’s 2016 results

Report Overview
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was $9.67m (2015: $8.46m), producing 
an effective tax rate of 28% (2015: 27%). The charge comprised 
current tax of $10.08m, representing tax payable in the USA, and a 
deferred tax credit of $0.41m. The increase in overall rate between 
years was due principally to increased taxable profits arising in the 
USA, which is a higher tax jurisdiction.
The tax charge relating to underlying profit before tax was 
$10.58m (2015: $8.96m), an effective tax rate of 28% (2015: 
27%).
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share was 99.01c (2015: 88.04c), an 
increase of 12%. This increase is lower than the 14% increase in 
underlying profit before tax, reflecting a higher effective tax rate 
and a slightly higher weighted average number of shares in issue.
Basic earnings per share was 87.27c (2015: 81.26c), an increase of 
7%. The primary factors causing the increase in basic earnings per 
share to be lower than the increase in underlying earnings per 
share were higher exceptional charges, share option charges and 
effective tax rate, offset by lower pension-related administration 
and finance charges, all compared to prior period.
Dividends
Dividends are determined in US dollars and paid in Sterling at the 
exchange rate on the date that the dividend is determined.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 36.18c (2015: 26.80c) 
which, together with the interim dividend of 16.32c, gives a total 
paid and proposed dividend relating to 2016 of 52.50c, an increase 
of 35% compared to prior year.
In Sterling, the final dividend paid to Shareholders will be 29.52p 
(2015: 18.82p), which, combined with the interim dividend paid of 
12.30p, gives a total dividend for the year of 41.82p, an increase of 
57% compared to prior year.
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group sponsors a legacy defined benefit pension scheme 
which has been closed to new members and future accruals for 
several years. 
At 31 December 2016, the deficit of the scheme on an IAS 19 basis 
was $19.29m, compared to $23.11m at 2 January 2016.
The change in deficit is analysed as follows:
$m
IAS 19 deficit at 2 January 2016 (23.11)
Company contributions to the scheme 17.35
Pension administration costs (0.31)
Pension costs - exceptional (2.77)
Pension finance charge (0.52)
Re-measurement gains due to changes in assumptions (12.94)
Exchange gains 3.01
IAS 19 deficit at 31 December 2016 (19.29)
During the year, the previously bought-in benefits of the majority 
of pensioner members were successfully converted to buy-out 
status. This resulted in a remaining pension obligation that  
is considerably smaller, moving from around 1,600 members  
(1,100 pensioners and 500 deferred pensioners) in December 2015, 
to around 420 mainly deferred members at the 2016 year end. 
Individual annuities were issued to the departing pensioner 
members under the terms of the contracts with the insurers. 
In financial terms, this meant that gross liabilities of $94.79m, and 
the corresponding insured asset of the same amount, were 
removed from the Group’s balance sheet. In order to extinguish 
these liabilities fully, the old scheme is in the process of being 
wound up. A new scheme with equivalent benefits has been set 
up, and members not included in the buy-out have been 
transferred to this scheme, except for those with small pension 
entitlements who opted to depart the scheme by taking winding 
up lump sum payments, resulting in liabilities of $1.98m and assets 
of an equivalent amount being removed.
In order to facilitate the buy-out process and the establishment and 
funding of the new scheme, a one-off contribution of £10.0m 
($14.5m) was paid in the first half of 2016, as previously agreed 
with the Trustee. The remainder of the $17.35m total contributions 
during the year were in respect of an interim deficit recovery 
arrangement agreed with the Trustee and the funding of some 
transfer values out of the scheme.
At 31 December 2016, gross scheme liabilities under IAS 19 were 
$34.36m, and assets were $15.07m, resulting in a net liability of 
$19.29m. This residual net liability is higher than expected. Two 
primary factors influenced this: (i) adverse movements in actuarial 
assumptions, particularly the discount rate which moved from 
3.52% in 2015 to 2.68% at the end of 2016; and (ii) a gap 
between the actuarial estimates of the split of liabilities between 
insured and non-insured members (based initially on the last full 
valuation in 2013 and rolled forward since then), and the actual 
liabilities transferred to insurers.
A new deficit recovery contribution schedule will be agreed with 
the Trustee during 2017. In the meantime, the current interim 
contribution of around £2.3m per year will continue to be paid into 
the scheme. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 14
Cash flow
The Group had net cash of $21.68m at 31 December 2016, an 
increase of $3.30m over the 2 January 2016 balance of $18.38m.
Cash flow in the period is summarised as follows:

Free cash flow 15.44 9.68
Dividends to Shareholders (12.14) (9.60)
Net cash inflow in the period 3.30 0.08
The cash generative nature of the direct marketing business model 
was demonstrated in the 2016 results. 
The underlying operating profit to cash conversion rate was 113% 
(2015: 87%, after adjusting for $9m of unusually high capital 
expenditure). This attractive cash conversion ratio was driven in 
large part by a favourable swing in the working capital position. 
Working capital at the end of 2015 was unusually high, driven by 
timing effects due to a 53 week accounting period. The 2016 
balance reflects a more normalised position.
Free cash flow was $15.44m, after the one-off pension 
contribution of $14.5m.
Balance sheet and Shareholders’ funds
Net assets at 31 December 2016 were $29.33m, compared to 
$28.45m at 2 January 2016. The balance sheet is summarised as

Shareholders’ funds increased by $0.88m, comprising: net profit in 
the period of $24.48m; $0.99m of exchange gains; net pension 
re-measurement losses of $(12.30)m; $(0.15)m of net share option 
related movements; and $(12.14)m equity dividends paid to 
Shareholders.
Balance sheet movements in respect of cash, working capital and 
pension deficit are discussed in earlier sections of the Financial 
Review.
Treasury policy
The financial requirements of the Group are managed through a 
centralised treasury policy. The Group operates cash pooling 
arrangements for its North American operations. Forward 
contracts are taken out to buy or sell currency relating to specific 
receivables and payables as well as remittances from overseas 
subsidiaries. The Group holds the majority of its cash with its 
principal US and UK bankers. A facility with the principal US bank, 
JPMorgan Chase, N.A., is available to fund the short-term working 
capital requirements of the North American business.
The Group has $20.5m of working capital facilities with its principal 
US bank. The interest rate is US$ LIBOR plus 1.5%, and the facilities 
expire on 31 May 2018 ($20.0m US facility) and 31 August 2017 
($0.5m Canadian facility). In addition, an overdraft facility of 
£1.0m, with an interest rate of bank base rate plus 2.0%, is 
available from the Group’s principal UK bank, Lloyds Bank plc.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant 
judgements or estimates and potentially result in materially different 
results under different assumptions or conditions. It is considered 
that the only critical accounting policy is in respect of pensions.
Going concern
The Board reviews several factors when considering whether the 
financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis:
• The Group’s business activities, together with management’s 
current view of circumstances likely to affect its future 
development, performance and financial position (summarised 
in the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 21).
• The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on 
pages 16 to 18 .
• The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and principal 
risks and uncertainties, net cash position, borrowing facilities 
and policies for managing financial risk, which are described in 
the Financial Review and Principal Risks & Uncertainties on 
pages 12 to 18.
As a result of this review, the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of at least twelve months from the date this report was 
approved. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Report Overview
Long-term prospects and viability
In accordance with Provision C.2.2 of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board has assessed the prospects and 
viability of the Group.
Assessment of prospects 
The Group’s strategy, market position and business model, as set 
out on pages 8 to 10 of the Strategic Report, are central to an 
understanding of its prospects. These factors provide a framework 
for the rolling three year plan which is developed as part of the 
annual budget process and reviewed by the Board to assess the 
Group’s prospects. Established and reliable demand forecasting 
models are driven by customer acquisition and retention 
assumptions, which are flexed to account for known initiatives and 
anticipated market developments over the three year forecast 
period. 
The three year timeframe for assessing both prospects and viability 
is considered to be appropriate due to the following factors:
• It is consistent with the Group’s rolling three year strategic 
planning process.
• It reflects reasonable expectations in terms of the reliability and 
accuracy of operational forecasting models.
• It acknowledges that the Group’s business model does not rely 
heavily on fixed capital, long-term contracts or fixed external 
financing arrangements. 
• It recognises that projections looking out further than three 
years become significantly less meaningful in the context of the 
fast-moving nature of the business and its markets.
Confirmation of viability
The Board’s assessment of the Group’s prospects, as described 
above, has been made with reference to current market conditions 
and known risk factors. The principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group are outlined on pages 16 to 18. In the light of the 
Group’s financial performance over recent years, the Board 
considers that the key factor which would prejudice the delivery of 
the Group’s stated financial objectives is a significant decline in 
demand, leading to lower or negative revenue growth and a lower 
return on marketing spend. Using the current three year rolling 
forecasts as a base case, alternative forecasts have been produced 
to model the effects on the Group’s liquidity and solvency of very 
severe but plausible combinations of the principal risks and 
uncertainties on demand levels in the business. 
The basis for the key assumptions used in the viability model was 
an overall effect similar to, but more severe than, that experienced 
during the 2008/9 financial crisis. New customer acquisition and 
existing customer retention metrics were significantly degraded in 
the model, but expenditure in the areas of marketing, payroll and 
technology were held steady. Revenue and profitability are clearly 
affected in this scenario, but the business retains a robust financial 
position with the Group able to maintain its external dividend 
payments at current rates. 
The assumptions used in the viability model and the resultant 
sensitised financial forecasts have been reviewed and approved by 
the Board. The conclusion of this review is that the Group has 
significant financial flexibility, starting with a net cash position, but 
remaining cash positive even under severe economic stress and 
able to continue investing in marketing, people and technology, 
which are the key differentiators in its strategy. 
Based on this review of the Group’s prospects and viability, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue to operate and to meet its liabilities, as they fall 
due, for the next three years. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 16
STRATEGIC REPORT
Principal Risks & Uncertainties
4imprint seeks to take a balanced approach to the risks and 
uncertainties which it faces. 
There is an appetite for risk-taking that contributes to both the operational agility and innovative culture which 4imprint believes is 
necessary to meet its strategic objectives. That appetite is, however, tempered by risk identification, evaluation and management. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the risk management process, although responsibility for reviewing specific risk controls may be 
delegated to the Audit Committee. The Executive Directors and operational management teams are responsible for the identification and 
evaluation of risks and the subsequent implementation of specific risk mitigation activities. It is important to note that business operations 
are conducted from centralised facilities in each territory, with short reporting lines. Consequently, the Executive Directors are close to 
day-to-day matters, facilitating early identification of, and response to, evolving risks.
 
Risk appetite, the risk management process, and associated mitigating activities are all essential elements of the Group’s strategic and 
operational planning processes. 
4imprint’s business model means that it may be affected by a number of risks, not all of which are within its control. Outlined on the 
following pages are the current principal potential risks to the successful delivery of the Group’s strategic goals. The list is not exhaustive 
and other, as yet unidentified, factors may have an adverse effect. 
Risk Potential impact Mitigating activities
Economic and market risks
Macroeconomic conditions 
The business conducts most of its operations 
in North America and would be affected by a 
downturn in general economic conditions in 
this region. The promotional products market 
would likely soften in line with the general 
economy.
• Customer acquisition and retention 
metrics could fall.
• The growth and profitability levels called 
for in the Group strategic plan may not be 
achieved.
• Cash generation could be reduced broadly 
corresponding to a reduction in 
profitability.
• Management monitors economic and 
market conditions to ensure that 
appropriate and timely adjustments are 
made to marketing and other budgets.
• The customer proposition in terms of 
promotions, price, value and quality of 
product can be adjusted to resonate with 
the prevailing economic climate.
Competition 
The promotional products markets in which 
the business operates are intensely 
competitive and the rapid development of 
internet commerce, digital marketing and 
technological innovation may allow 
competitors to reach a broader audience. In 
addition, new or disruptive business models 
may be developed by existing competitors or 
new entrants.
• Aggressive competitive activity could result 
in pressure on prices, margin erosion and 
loss of market share. All of these factors 
could impair the growth of the business 
and therefore impact the financial results.
• The Group’s strategy based on achieving 
organic growth in fragmented markets 
may need to be reassessed.
• An open-minded culture and an appetite 
for technology are encouraged, with the 
aim of positioning the business at the 
forefront of innovation in the industry.
• Management proactively monitors 
competitive activity in the marketplace. 
• Price, satisfaction and service level 
guarantees are an integral part of the 
customer proposition. Customer surveys 
and market research are used to gauge 
customer satisfaction and perception, and 
the causes of any negative indications are 
investigated and addressed rapidly.
Currency exchange 
There is some exposure to currency exchange 
risk. Although the business trades 
predominantly in US dollars, it also transacts 
business in Canadian dollars, Sterling and 
Euros, leading to some currency risk on 
trading. In addition, head office costs, pension 
scheme commitments and dividend payments 
are payable in Sterling, consequently the 
business may be adversely impacted by 
movements in the Sterling/US dollar exchange 
rate when it repatriates cash to the UK.
• The financial results of operations, and 
therefore overall profitability, may be 
negatively affected.
• The financial condition and cash position 
of the Group may differ materially from 
expectations. In particular, the Group’s 
strategic objective of delivering 
progressive dividend increases could be 
disrupted.
• The Group reports its results in US dollars, 
minimising currency impact on reported 
revenue, operating profit and net assets 
since trading operations are concentrated 
largely in North America.
• The Group uses forward contracts to 
hedge anticipated cash receipts from its 
overseas operations over a rolling 12 
month timeframe, giving some certainty 
of amounts receivable in Sterling.

Operational risks
Business facility disruption 
The business model means that operations 
are concentrated in centralised office and 
distribution facilities. The performance of the 
business could be adversely affected if 
activities at one of these facilities were to be 
disrupted, for example, by fire, flood, loss of 
power or telecommunication failure.
• The inability to service customer orders 
over any extended period would result in 
significant revenue loss, deterioration of 
customer acquisition and retention metrics 
and diminished return on marketing 
investment.
• Data is backed up immediately to  
off-site servers.
• Back-up and business continuity 
procedures are in place to ensure that 
customer service disruption is minimised.
• Relationships are maintained with  
third party embroidery contractors to 
provide back-up in the event of facility  
unavailability. 
Disruption to delivery service or the 
product supply chain 
As a consequence of the Group’s drop-ship 
distribution model, trading operations could 
be interrupted if (i) the activities of a key 
supplier were disrupted and it was not 
possible to source an alternative supplier in 
the short term; or (ii) the primary parcel 
delivery partner used by the business suffered 
significantly degraded service levels. 
• Inability to fulfil customer orders would 
lead to lost revenue and a negative impact 
on customer acquisition and retention 
statistics.
• A rigorous selection process is in place  
for key suppliers, with evaluation and 
monitoring of quality, production 
capability and capacity, ethical standards 
and financial stability. 
• Wherever possible, relationships are 
maintained with suitable alternative 
suppliers for each product category.
• Secondary relationships are maintained 
with alternative parcel carriers. 
Disturbance in established  
marketing techniques 
The success of the business relies on its ability 
to attract new and retain existing customers 
through a variety of marketing techniques. 
These methods may become less effective as 
follows: 
Offline: The flow of print catalogues and 
sample packages would be disrupted by the 
incapacity of the US Postal Service to make 
deliveries, for example due to natural disasters 
or labour activism. 
Online: Search engines are an important 
source for channelling customer activity to 
4imprint’s websites. The efficiency of search 
engine marketing would be adversely affected 
if the search engines were to modify their 
algorithms or otherwise make substantial 
changes to their practices or pricing.
• If sustained over anything more than a 
short time period, an externally-driven 
decrease in the effectiveness of key 
marketing techniques would cause 
damage to the customer file as acquisition 
and retention metrics fall. This would 
affect order flow and revenue in the short 
term and the productivity of the customer 
file over a longer period, impacting 
growth prospects. 
• Offline: Developments in the US Postal 
Service are closely monitored through 
industry associations and lobbying 
groups. Alternative parcel carriers are 
continuously evaluated. 
• Online: Management stays very close  
to new developments and emerging 
technologies in the online space. Efforts 
are focused on anticipating changes and 
ensuring compliance with both the 
requirements of providers and applicable 
laws. The marketing team constantly tests 
and evaluates new marketing techniques 
and opportunities.
Reliance on key personnel
Performance depends on the business’s ability 
to continue to attract, motivate and retain key 
staff. These individuals possess sales and 
marketing, merchandising, supply chain, IT 
and financial skills that are key to the 
continued successful operation of the 
business. 
• The loss of key employees or inability to 
attract appropriate talent could adversely 
affect the Group’s ability to meet its 
strategic objectives, with a consequent 
negative impact on future results.
• The business is proactive in aiming to 
deliver a first-class working environment. 
In addition, attractive employment terms 
and incentive plans are designed with a 
view to attracting and retaining key 
personnel. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 18
STRATEGIC REPORT
Principal Risks & Uncertainties continued
Risk Potential impact Mitigating activities
Technological risks
Failure or interruption of information 
technology systems and infrastructure 
The business is highly dependent on the 
efficient functioning of its IT infrastructure. 
An interruption or degradation of services at 
a central office facility would affect critical 
order processing systems and thereby 
compromise the ability of the business to 
deliver on its customer service proposition.  
• In the short-term, orders would be lost 
and delivery deadlines missed for orders 
in-house, decreasing the efficiency of 
marketing investment and impacting 
customer acquisition and retention. 
Depending on the severity of the incident, 
longer-term reputational damage could 
result. 
• Revenue and profitability are directly 
related to order flow and would be 
adversely affected as a consequence of a 
major IT failure.
• There is significant ongoing investment in 
both the IT team supporting the business 
and the hardware and software system 
requirements for a stable and secure 
operating platform. 
• Back-up and recovery processes are in 
place to minimise the impact of 
information technology interruption, 
including real-time replication of data at 
an alternative site.
Failure to adapt to new  
technological innovations 
The operating platforms of the business may 
not be able to respond and adapt to rapid 
changes in technology. If the development of 
websites and customer-facing applications for 
alternative devices and platforms is slow or 
ineffective the business could lose competitive 
edge. In addition, the development of order 
processing, supplier-facing and data analytics 
technologies could fail to deliver the 
improvements in speed, ease and efficiency 
necessary to attract and retain a productive 
customer base.
• If the business fails to adapt to new 
technologies and therefore falls behind in 
the marketplace it may fail to capture the 
significant number of new customers  
and retain existing customers at the rate 
required to deliver the growth rates 
envisaged in the Group’s strategic plan.
• Management has a keen awareness of 
the need to keep pace with the rapidly 
changing and continuously evolving 
technological landscape.
• An appetite for technological innovation 
is encouraged in the business. Sustained 
investment is made in the development of 
both outward-facing and back office 
systems.
Security of customer data 
Unauthorised access to and misappropriation 
of customer data could lead to reputational 
damage and loss of customer confidence.
• A significant security breach could lead to 
litigation and losses, with a costly 
rectification process. In addition, it might 
be damaging to the Group’s reputation 
and brand.
• An event of this nature might result in 
extraordinary expense, impacting the 
Group’s ability to meet its earnings per 
share targets.
• The business employs IT staff who are 
appropriately trained to mitigate IT 
security violations. In particular, emerging 
cyber risks are proactively monitored and 
addressed.
• Technical and physical controls are in 
place to mitigate unauthorised access to 
customer data and there is an ongoing 
investment process in place to maintain 
and enhance the integrity and efficiency 
of the IT infrastructure and its security. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 19

Corporate & Social Responsibility Report
The Board believes that a strong and principled 
approach to corporate and social responsibility is 
fundamentally important to the present and future 
success of 4imprint.
Our culture encourages responsible 
practice at all levels of the organisation and 
presents clear guiding principles that drive 
ethical interactions with, and outcomes for, 
our key stakeholders.
4imprint is run in accordance with  
“The Golden Rule” – treat others as 
you would wish to be treated yourself.  
This mindset is evident across the business: 
in our customer service proposition and 
guarantees; in our product sourcing 
initiatives; in the way that our team 
members interact with our customers, our 
supplier partners and with each other; in 
the way that we engage in our 
communities; and in our respect for the 
environment.
We are pleased to have become a 
constituent company in the FTSE4Good 
Index Series, the global responsible 
investment index designed to identify 
companies that demonstrate strong 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
practices, measured against globally 
recognised standards.
Employment
Our strategy statement identifies 
investment in our people as a key driver of 
competitive advantage. We are committed 
to a culture that encourages the training, 
development, wellbeing and participation 
of every team member.
Business objectives are shared with team 
members via quarterly briefings and 
everyone participates in a quarterly “gain 
share” bonus plan that is based on 
achievement of tangible, clearly 
communicated performance targets. 
Training of new team members covers 
job-specific skills, other soft skills and a 
grounding in the 4imprint philosophy. 
Existing team members are regularly 
offered ongoing training opportunities in a 
variety of subjects, some directly business-
related, and others aimed towards personal 
development, wellness initiatives and 
general education. In addition, the pursuit 
of external educational opportunities and 
professional qualifications is encouraged 
through our popular tuition reimbursement 
programme.
The welfare of our team members is also 
addressed through a competitive benefits 
package, including strong medical, dental 
and pension offerings. In addition, we run an 
employee wellness programme and provide 
multiple workplace perks and fun events. 
A proactive approach to health and safety is 
an important aspect of the 4imprint 
workplace. Desk-based ergonomics and 
best practice protocols in the operation of 
machinery and material handling at our 
distribution centre are key areas of emphasis 
in promoting a safety culture. A Safety 
Committee meets on a regular basis to 
review any incidents or near misses and to 
consider future improvements or changes in 
regulatory requirements. In addition, health 
and safety reports are regularly received and 
reviewed by the Board.
We understand the importance and 
beneficial effect of diversity within our 
team and we aim to foster a culture that 
recruits, develops and promotes team 
members regardless of background. We 
are committed to the principle of equal 
opportunity in employment, and no  4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 20

recognise our responsibility to disabled 
persons and endeavour to assist them to 
make their full contribution at work. Where 
team members become disabled, every 
practical effort is made to allow them to 
continue in their jobs or to provide 
retraining in suitable alternative work.
The Group employs over 860 people,  
75% of whom are female. One third of the 
North American executive team and two 
thirds of the UK senior team are female.  
As at 31 December 2016 the Board had  
no female members, and one of six Board 
members (16%) is a non-UK national.
2016 was the ninth consecutive year that 
the North American operation has been 
included on the prestigious list of the Top 
25 Best Medium Sized Workplaces in the 
USA. The UK-based business maintains its 
Investors in People accreditation. We are 
very proud of these accolades, which are 
emblematic of team members who go 
above and beyond every day to help each 
other, to provide our customers with 
remarkable service and to give back to their 
communities because they know and 
believe that it is the right thing to do.
Product and supply
Our suppliers are based in the US and 
Canada for the North American business, 
and in the UK and EU for the UK and 
Ireland business. Therefore, our supply base 
is essentially domestic, with our suppliers 
taking care of the importing/manufacture, 
inventory management and printing 
capabilities required to ship thousands of 
orders on a daily basis.
We are acutely aware, however, that our 
end-to-end supply chain is a long and 
complex one that extends far beyond our 
domestic supply partners across the globe 
to the manufacturers of the base product. 
As such, our business activities can have a 
significant impact at many levels. Our 
intention is to make that impact positive 
from a social, economic and environmental 
perspective.
To set the tone, the Board has developed, 
approved and issued a social and ethical 
policy, the purpose of which is to set broad 
guidelines that the Group should conduct 
its business operations in accordance with 
best practice and in compliance with 
relevant legislation such as the Modern 
Slavery Act. The policy addresses such 
issues as working hours, wages, 
discrimination, collective bargaining, health 
& safety and child labour. These broad 
principles are reinforced in our “4imprint 
Supply Chain Code of Conduct”. This is 
based on the International Labour 
Organisation’s “Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work” and the Fair Labor Association’s 
“Principles of Fair Labor and Responsible 
Sourcing”. 4imprint team members are 
actively involved in the FLA’s activities.
At the operational level, this means that 
4imprint’s goal is to work with suppliers 
who are diligent in managing their sourcing 
practices and selecting manufacturing 
facilities, who commit to ensuring safe 
working environments where employees 
are adequately compensated and who are 
able to develop the necessary 
manufacturing, design and quality 
capabilities. These ethical sourcing 
expectations are communicated and 
reviewed through our document 
“4imprint’s Expectations of Supply Chain 
Responsibility”, signature of which 
reaffirms the supplier’s commitment to 
these principles within their own 
organisation and supply base.
In support of our supply chain 
expectations, our product sourcing 
professionals schedule regular visits to both 
domestic supplier facilities and to the 
offshore factories where the base product 
is manufactured. In addition, we conduct a 
programme of independent audits of 
offshore manufacturing facilities in 
conjunction with our key suppliers. Our 
preference is to work with suppliers and 
manufacturers on areas of concern and to 
develop a corrective action plan, although 
ultimately business would be re-sourced if 
compliance is not achieved.

involved in the community
Underpinning all of our product supply 
efforts is our aim to match remarkable 
customer service with great products that 
meet functional, environmental and safety 
standards in each market of distribution. 
Our internal supply chain compliance team 
works to stay abreast of current and 
developing standards as set by the 
regulatory bodies and liaises with our 
supplier partners to manage and validate 
product testing and other quality assurance 
procedures.
Community and charitable giving
Team members are given paid time off to 
be used specifically for volunteering for a 
local charity or non-profit organisation of 
their choice. 4imprint is actively involved in 
its local communities in many other ways, 
for example in team sponsorships, student 
scholarships at local colleges, product 
donations for events such as fun runs, 5Ks 
and marathons, and encouragement of 
team members to participate on volunteer 
boards and committees.
Our North American business operates its 
“one by one
®
” charitable giving 
programme which reflects our culture and 
principles. Each business day we donate at 
least three $500 grants to non-profit 
organisations. These grants are to be used 
on promotional products to help spread 
the word, recruit volunteers or thank 
donors. In 2016, there were 3,395 
applicants, with 767 grants awarded. The 
total value of “one by one
®
” grants 
awarded was $385,000, and on top of this 
we made more than 2,000 other donations 
of product to “one by one
®
” applicants, 
businesses, team members and customers 
in support of fundraising or charitable 
causes.
Our UK business has its own charitable 
giving initiative, “Helping Hand”, which 
also aims to use the power of promotional 
products in the support of a good cause.
Environment
The Board recognises its obligations to 
protect the environment and is committed 
both to achieving required environmental 
standards across all the activities of the 
Group and to minimising its environmental 
impact. The management teams in both 
the North American and UK businesses 
assess and monitor the potential impact of 
operations on the environment. Energy 
consumption and waste management are 
key areas of focus. In addition, printed 
marketing materials such as catalogues use 
paper sourced from sustainable forests, 
conforming to Forestry Stewardship 
Council (“FSC”) requirements.

GOVERNANCE
Statement on Corporate Governance
The disclosures required by company law in relation to the Takeover 
Directive in relation to the Group’s capital structure are included in 
the Directors’ Report on page 24.
During 2016, the Group has complied with the provisions of The 
UK Corporate Governance Code (2014) (the “Code”).
The Code is publicly available on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website, www.frc.org.uk.
The Board
The Board is responsible to Shareholders for creating and 
sustaining Shareholder value through the management of the 
Group’s business. It is also responsible for ensuring that 
management maintains a system of control that provides assurance 
of effective and efficient operations, internal financial control and 
compliance with laws and regulations.
The Board is the decision-making body for all matters material to 
the Group’s finances, strategy and reputation. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision and the schedule was reconsidered and approved by the 
Board at its meeting on 13 December 2016. The schedule includes: 
the approval of interim and annual financial statements; the 
acquisition and disposal of businesses; changes to the capital 
structure of the Company; the appointment or removal of 
Directors; and the financing of the Group’s businesses. Otherwise, 
the Board delegates day-to-day management of the Group to the 
Executive Directors. 
Throughout the period, and in accordance with provision C.2.1 of 
the Code, the Board has carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. This is fully described in the risks section on 
pages 16 to 18.
The Board has assessed the future prospects of the Group in 
accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code. Based on the results 
of this analysis, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment. 
Details of the assessment performed by the Board, including an 
assessment of those risks most likely to impact the Group’s future 
prospects and viability, have been set out on page 15.
In any circumstances where a Director has a concern, which cannot 
be resolved, about the running of the Company or a proposed 
action, any such concern is recorded in the minutes of Board 
meetings.
The Companies Act 2006 codifies the duty of the Directors to 
avoid a situation in which they have, or could have, an interest that 
conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the 
Company. A Director will not be in breach of that duty if the 
relevant matter has been authorised in accordance with the 
Articles of Association by the other Directors. Each Director has 
confirmed that they are aware of the need to notify the Company 
of any potential conflict of interest. Mr. A.J. Scull has notified the 
Company that he is a Director and Company Secretary of the 
4imprint Pension Trustee Company Limited and a Director and 
Company Secretary of 4imprint 2016 Pension Trustee Company 
Limited, which administers the legacy defined benefit pension 
scheme.
Specific responsibilities have been delegated to Board Committees 
which have access to independent expert advice at the Group’s 
expense. The details of the Board Committees and their activities 
are set out on pages 28 to 34.
The Non-Executive Directors meet from time to time, without the 
Executive Directors being present.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary.
At the period end the Board consisted of the Non-Executive 
Chairman, the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, the Corporate Services Director and two 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. The role of the Non-
Executive Directors includes assisting in the development of 
strategy, scrutinising the performance of management, monitoring 
the integrity of financial information and systems of risk 
management as well as determining the appointment, removal and 
remuneration of Executive Directors. 
Key activities of the Board in 2016 included: 
• Review and approval of full year and half year results;
• Review and approval of 2017 budget and the three year plan
• Review of dividend policy and rebasing of dividend to be paid in 
respect of 2016; 
• Review principal risks and uncertainties; 
• Receipt and review of reports on regulatory matters, including, 
for example, health, safety and environmental issues;
• Receipt of post-meeting reports from the Chairs of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committee;
• Appointment of an additional Non-Executive Director and 
selection of new Chairman;
• Monitoring progress of the pension scheme buy-out and 
authorising payments into the pension scheme; and
• Site visit to the Manchester operation.
Mr. J.W. Poulter retired from the Board with effect from 
30 November 2016.
During 2015, and following a Board evaluation process, the Board 
considered it would be appropriate to have an additional Non-
Executive Director and Mr. P.S. Moody was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 February 2016 for a 
period of three years. 
The current Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment 
for three years from 28 May 2015 for Mr. J.A. Warren, 11 June 
2015 for Mr. C.J. Brady and 1 February 2016 for Mr. P.S. Moody, 
which are available for inspection by any person at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours and also at the 
AGM. 
The Corporate Services Director also acts as the Company 
Secretary. This situation has been reconsidered by the Board at its 
meeting on 13 December 2016 and approved by the Board. The 
Corporate Services Director took no part in that decision. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter to  4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 27

be decided by the Board as a whole (excluding the Corporate 
Services Director). 
The Board has at least six scheduled meetings per year and 
additional Board meetings are convened as and when required. 
In advance of each meeting, the Board receives minutes of the 
previous meeting, detailed financial information on the 
performance of the business and items for discussion. This enables 
the Directors to make informed decisions on the corporate and 
business issues under consideration. Additionally, the Company 
provides resources as appropriate, to enable Directors to update 
their skills and knowledge. Independent professional advice is 
available to the Directors as required, at the Company’s expense. 
The Board evaluations and those of its Committees, which were 
undertaken in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, were undertaken 
internally through a process conducted by the Non-Executive 
Directors, assisted by the Company Secretary. Given the changes to 
the Board in 2016, no external evaluation was undertaken but an 
evaluation was undertaken internally during 2016, by the Company 
Secretary, at the request of the Chairman. The questions asked 
during the process were based on questions outlined in the Code 
and addressed both the performance of the Board and its 
Committees, as well as the Chairman.

held during the period and attendance by Directors at those 
meetings is set out below:

additional Board Meeting (not noted in column 1 of the table, above) was 
convened under the Chairmanship of the Senior Independent Director and 
comprising the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Corporate Services Director. This Board Meeting considered the applications of the 
potential applicants and decided on the appointment of the Non-Executive 
Chairman. 
Powers of Directors
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of 
Association, the Companies Acts and any directions given by 
special resolution, the business of the Company will be managed 
by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company.
Board Committees
The Board has three permanent Committees being the Audit 
Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration

The Board places a high value on its relations with its investors and 
consults with Shareholders in connection with specific issues where 
it considers it appropriate. The Group, principally through the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has regular dialogue 
and meetings with institutional shareholders, fund managers and 
analysts. Subject always to the constraints regarding sensitive 
information, discussions cover a wide range of issues, including 
strategy, performance, management and governance.
The Board considers it important to understand the views of 
Shareholders, in particular, any issues which concern them. The 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to meet 
major Shareholders, if they so wish.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting in 
respect of any shares held by that member if any call or other sum 
then payable by that member in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid.
Private Shareholders can keep up-to-date through updates 
provided on the 4imprint corporate website, investors.4imprint.
com and through the provision of the Annual and Interim Reports

Nomination Committee
I am pleased to present my report to Shareholders as Chairman of 
the Nomination Committee.
Responsibilities of the Nomination Committee
The responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include: 
(i) reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board 
and making recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
adjustments that are necessary; (ii) identifying and nominating 
candidates for the approval of the Board to fill Board vacancies as 
and when they arise; and (iii) putting in place plans for succession 
at Board level. 
The Company supports the Code provision that Boards should 
consider the benefits of diversity, including gender, when making 
appointments and is committed to ensuring diversity, not just at 
Board level, but also across the Company’s senior management, 
not least because it believes that business benefits from the widest 
range of perspectives and backgrounds. The Company’s aim as 
regards the composition of the Board is that it should have a 
balance of experience, skills and knowledge to enable each 
Director and the Board as a whole to discharge their duties 
effectively. Whilst the Company agrees that it is appropriate that it 
should seek to have diversity on its Board, it does not consider that 
this can be best achieved by establishing specific quotas and 
targets and appointments will continue to be made based wholly 
on merit.
The Nomination Committee has terms of reference which were 
reconsidered and approved by the Board of the Company at its 
Board meeting on 13 December 2016. These terms of reference are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution 
or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds office 
only until the next AGM and is then eligible for election by the 
Shareholders. 
At every AGM of the Company, all Directors put themselves 
forward for re-election. The office of Director shall be vacated if: 
(a) he or she resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolves to 
accept such offer; (b) he or she is, or has been, suffering from 
mental ill health; (c) he or she becomes bankrupt or compounds 
with creditors generally; (d) he or she is prohibited by law from 
being a Director; (e) he or she ceases to be a Director by virtue of 
the provisions of the Companies Act; or (f) he or she is removed 
from office pursuant to the Articles of Association.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
I chair the Nomination Committee and I am an Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The other member of the Committee 
during the period was Mr. J.A. Warren, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. Mr. P.S. Moody became a member of the 
Committee in February 2016, but stepped down upon becoming 
Non-Executive Chairman on 1 December 2016. The Chairman of 
the Company is usually invited to attend formal meetings of the 
Committee. The Company Secretary may be invited to attend 
meetings of the Nomination Committee, in his capacity as 
Company Secretary. 
Meetings of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee meets as frequently as is required to 
fulfil its duties. When there are no specific decisions or 
recommendations to be made, the Chairman of the Committee 
consults the other member of the Committee as necessary. During 
the period ended 31 December 2016 there were no meetings of 
the Nomination Committee.
In relation to the appointment of Mr. P.S. Moody as Non-Executive 
Chairman to replace Mr. J.W. Poulter, the list of potential 
candidates meant that a meeting of the Nomination Committee 
would not have been quorate. Accordingly, an additional Board 
Meeting was convened under the Chairmanship of the Senior 
Independent Director and comprised the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer and the Corporate Services Director.  
This Board Meeting considered the applications of the potential 
applicants and decided on the appointment of the Non-Executive 
Chairman.

Audit Committee
I am pleased to present my report to Shareholders as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee.
Responsibilities of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with the Group’s external auditors and for reviewing 
the Group’s internal financial controls and the audit process. It aids 
the Board in seeking to ensure that the financial and non-financial 
information supplied to Shareholders presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s performance and 
position.
The Committee reviews the effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors and also considers the scope 
of their work and fees paid for audit and non-audit services.
The Audit Committee has terms of reference which were  
reconsidered and approved by the Board at its meeting on 
13 December 2016. These terms of reference are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours. The Board considers that the Audit Committee 
members have an understanding of the following areas:
• the principles of, and developments in, financial reporting 
including the applicable accounting standards and statements 
of recommended practice;
• key aspects of the Group’s operations including corporate 
policies and the Group’s internal control environment; 
• matters which may influence the presentation of the accounts;
• the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector-
specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation;
• the role of internal and external auditing and risk management; 
and
• the regulatory framework for the Group’s businesses.
Composition of the Audit Committee
I chair the Audit Committee and I am the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. I am a chartered accountant and was 
Group Finance Director of United Biscuits (Holdings) Plc and WH 
Smith PLC. The Board is of the view that I have recent and relevant 
financial knowledge and experience derived from current roles as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee at Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 
Welsh Water and Greencore Group plc. The other member of the 
Committee during the period was Mr. C.J. Brady, an Independent 
Non-Executive Director. Mr. P.S. Moody became a member of the 
Committee in February 2016, but stepped down on becoming 
Non-Executive Chairman on 1 December 2016. The Chairman of 
the Company and the Chief Financial Officer are normally invited 
to attend meetings of the Audit Committee as is, from time to 
time, the Group Financial Controller. The Corporate Services 
Director attends meetings of the Audit Committee in his capacity 
as Company Secretary.
How the Audit Committee discharges its responsibilities
The Committee has unrestricted access to Company documents 
and information, as well as to employees of the Company and the 
external auditors. Members of the Committee may, in pursuit of 
their duties, take independent professional advice on any matter, 
at the Company’s expense. The Audit Committee Chairman reports 
the outcome of Audit Committee meetings to the Board.
The Audit Committee meets at least twice each year and has an 
agenda linked to events in the Group’s financial calendar. The 
Audit Committee met twice during 2016.
In order to fulfil its terms of reference, the Audit Committee 
receives and reviews presentations and reports from the Group’s 
senior management and the external auditors.
During the period, the Audit Committee formally reviewed draft 
Interim and Annual Reports and associated interim and year end 
results’ announcements. These reviews considered:
• the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the 
Group’s accounts and proposed changes to them; and
• significant accounting issues and areas of judgement and 
complexity.
The Audit Committee is required to assist the Board to fulfil its 
responsibilities relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
control environment and the Group’s compliance with the 
Corporate Governance Code. To fulfil these duties, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
• the external auditors’ review of internal controls and audit 
highlights memoranda;
• any reports on the systems of internal controls and risk 
management; and
• any reports on identified frauds perpetrated against the Group. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external 
audit. The Group’s policy on external audit prohibits certain types 
of non-audit work from being performed by the auditor, 
particularly in cases where auditor objectivity and independence 
would be put at risk. 
During 2016, the Group’s auditors provided non-audit services in 
respect of advice on the pension buy-out. 
Before any significant non-audit work is commissioned, the nature 
and extent of such work is considered, initially by the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Corporate Services Director, to determine 
if such work would put at risk auditor objectivity and 
independence. This process includes discussion with the audit 
partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. If there is any concern that 
auditors’ objectivity and independence would be put at risk, the 
matter will be referred to the Audit Committee, prior to 
commissioning. For the area referred to above, after following the 
process described in this paragraph, it was considered that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was the most suitable firm to perform 
the work given their long-standing knowledge of the legacy 
defined benefit scheme.
In accordance with new EU regulation, the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide advice in respect of 
pensions ceased on 31 December 2016.  4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 30
Details of fees paid to the auditors in respect of audit and 
non-audit services are shown in note 2 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
external auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
• changes and rotation of external audit team members in the 
audit plan for the current year;
• a report from the external auditors describing their 
arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of 
interest; and
• the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
• the relevant skills and experience of the audit partner and team 
and their knowledge of the business;
• planning and scope of the audit and identification of areas of 
audit risk;
• execution of the audit plan; and
• formal reports presented to the Audit Committee.
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight of the external audit process, 
the Audit Committee reviewed:
• the terms, areas of responsibility, associated duties and scope of 
the audit as set out in the external auditors’ engagement letter 
for the forthcoming year;
• the external auditors’ overall work plan for the forthcoming 
year; 
• the external auditors’ fee proposal;
• the major issues that arose during the course of the audit and 
their resolution;
• key accounting and audit judgements;
• the levels of errors identified during the audit; and
• recommendations made by the external auditors in their 
management letters and the adequacy of management’s 
response.
Main activities of the Committee during the period ended 
31 December 2016
During the period ended 31 December 2016, the Audit 
Committee’s business has included the following items:
• consideration and approval of half year results;
• consideration and approval of full year results;
• principal judgmental accounting matters affecting the Group 
based on reports from both the Group’s management and the 
external auditors;
• review of external audit plans and reports;
• consideration of fraud and loss prevention measures in the 
Group;
• consideration and approval of risk assessments relating to the 
Group’s business; and
• specific investigations as required.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgments
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted and whether management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgments. The Committee reviews accounting 
papers prepared by management which provide details on the 
main financial reporting judgments.
The Committee also reviews reports by the external auditors on the 
half year and full year results which highlight any issues arising 
from the work undertaken in respect of the half year review and 
year end audit.
Specific areas of audit and accounting risk reviewed by the 
Committee were:
Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme
The defined benefit pension scheme is material to the financial 
position of the Group. The amount shown in the balance sheet is 
sensitive to changes in key actuarial assumptions. The Committee 
reviewed the appropriateness and consistency of these 
assumptions and the auditors confirmed that the assumptions used 
were reasonable and within an acceptable range. Full disclosure of 
the pension scheme is provided in note 17 to the financial 
statements, which includes the key period end assumptions on 
page 66 and the sensitivities on page 67.
Supplier rebates
As in previous years, the business accrued rebates from key 
suppliers based on agreed fixed rates relating to the volumes of 
goods purchased in a calendar year. The Committee does not 
consider the Group’s rebates to be highly complex as: they are 
volume-related; agreement periods are coterminous with the 
Group’s accounting period; there are written agreements in place 
with suppliers; and historically rebates have been collected. 
However, FRC guidance has highlighted this as an area of focus, as 
the rebates are material to the results for the period. 
The Committee has discussed any judgements made in accruing 
supplier rebates and the collectability of these amounts with 
management and the external auditors. The Committee is satisfied 
that the amounts of income accrued are appropriate.
Interaction with the Financial Reporting Council 
The Company received, from the Financial Reporting Council 
(“FRC”), a letter dated 14 October 2016 which indicated that the 
FRC had carried out a review of the Company’s Report and 
Accounts for the year ended 2 January 2016.
The letter indicated that there were no questions or queries which 
the FRC wished to raise as at the date of the letter.
The letter also indicated that it provided no assurance that the 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 2 January 2016 
were correct in all material respects and noted that the FRC’s role is 
not to verify the information provided, but to consider compliance 
with reporting requirements.
The letter was written on the basis that the FRC accepted no 
liability for reliance on the letter by the Company or any third party.
Financial statements
The Committee considered, and was satisfied with, management’s 
presentation of the financial statements for the period ended 
31 December 2016 and, in particular, the presentation of certain 
items as exceptional items.

Additional 
Information
The auditors confirmed to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material misstatements during the course of their 
work. The Committee is satisfied that the judgments made by 
management are reasonable and that appropriate disclosures have 
been included in the financial statements.
After reviewing the presentation from management and following 
discussions with the auditors, the Committee is satisfied that:
• the financial statements appropriately address the critical 
judgments and key estimates both in respect of the amounts 
reported and the related disclosures in the financial statements;
• the processes used for determining the value of the assets and 
liabilities have been appropriately reviewed, challenged and are 
sufficiently robust; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy and should be 
recommended to the Board as such.
In arriving at the conclusion that the Annual Report and Accounts 
were fair, balanced and understandable the Committee considered:
• any feedback provided by Shareholders on the Group’s 2015 
Annual Report and Accounts and trading updates, and 
information received by the Board throughout the period;
• the processes underpinning the compilation of the Annual 
Report and the Group’s reporting governance framework; and
• the reviews and findings of the Group’s auditors.
Auditor independence
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or its predecessor firms, has been the 
Company’s auditors since 1992. The Audit Committee considers 
that the relationship with the auditors is working well and remains 
satisfied with their effectiveness.
Accordingly, the Committee has not considered it necessary to date 
to require the firm to retender for the audit. However, the 
Committee has noted the guidance from the Financial Reporting 
Council and changes in the EU to the regulatory framework and, 
accordingly, anticipates a retendering process being undertaken in 
2019. In the meantime, the Committee will continue to keep the 
matter under review.
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every five years. 
The current audit partner was first appointed in respect of the 
2015 financial period ended 2 January 2016.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of external auditor.
Taking into consideration the external auditors’ knowledge  
of the Group and level of experience, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that the external auditors are  
reappointed.
Given the present structure of the Group, the Board does not 
currently consider the establishment of a separate internal audit 
function to be necessary. However, this matter is reviewed by the 
Board at least annually. 
The Group has a “Whistleblowing” policy which contains 
arrangements for the Company Secretary to receive, in confidence, 
complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing 
issues and related matters for reporting to the Audit Committee as 
appropriate. 
As necessary, the Audit Committee holds private meetings with the 
external auditors to review key issues within their spheres of 
interest and responsibility. 
As Chairman of the Committee, I will be present at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer questions on this report, matters 
within the scope of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities and any 
significant matters brought to the Audit Committee’s attention by 
the external auditors.
Internal control
The control system of the Group is intended to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to meet the Group’s objectives and any 
such system can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurances against material misstatement or loss. The effectiveness 
of the control system including financial, operating, compliance 
and risk management is reviewed by the Board at least annually.
Additionally, through the management process outlined in the 
Statement on Corporate Governance on pages 26 and 27 the 
Group operates a continuous process of identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by each business and the 
Group as a whole. This process, which has been in place 
throughout 2016 and up to the date of the approval of this Annual 
Report, complies with the FRC guidance and includes the 
following:
• a defined organisational structure with appropriate delegation 
of authority;
• formal authorisation procedures for all investments;
• clear responsibilities on the part of management for the 
maintenance of good financial controls and the production and 
review of detailed, accurate and timely financial management 
information;
• the control of financial risks through clear authorisation levels;
• identification of operational risks and the development of 
mitigation plans by the senior management;
• regular reviews of both forward looking business plans and 
historic performance; and
• regular reports to the Board from the Executive Directors.
The internal controls extend to the financial reporting process and 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The basis 
of preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out 
on page 51.
The internal control process will continue to be monitored and 
reviewed by the Board which will, where necessary, ensure 
improvements are implemented. During the period the Board has 
undertaken a review of the effectiveness of internal controls and 
systems. No material matters were identified.

GOVERNANCE
Annual Statement by the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee
4imprint’s strategy is to develop its position as the leading direct 
marketer of promotional products in the fragmented markets in 
which it operates.
 
Recent years have seen sustained growth in the Group and in both 
the earnings per share and share price of the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee and the Board aim to ensure that the 
Company has the best possible management to continue that 
growth and the creation of further shareholder value and to 
reward management accordingly.
The Committee’s view regarding remuneration is that it should: 
(i) be competitive when compared to that of organisations of 
similar size, complexity and type; (ii) be structured so that 
remuneration is linked to the long-term growth in earnings per 
share and in the shareholder value of the Company; (iii) be clear, 
easy to understand and motivating; (iv) not promote unacceptable 
behaviour or encourage unacceptable risk taking; and (v) be 
structured to avoid reward for failure.
2015 Incentive Plan
The 2015 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) is designed to support the 
long-term strategy of the Group, in particular its increasing focus 
on the business in North America.
 
The implementation of the Plan reflects the desire of the 
Remuneration Committee to ensure that, given the greater focus 
of the business in North America, key US-based beneficiaries are 
appropriately retained and incentivised.
During 2016, the first awards under the Plan were made to the 
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and seven senior 
managers. The Plan is directly linked to the annual bonus of senior 
employees. The Remuneration Committee will assess senior 
employee performance against the criteria set each year to 
determine the level of achievement of performance and therefore 
the annual bonus to be paid in respect of such year. The 
performance targets for the 2016 period are set out below. 
Under the provisions of the Plan, 50% of the annual bonus will be 
deferred into shares through the award of nil cost options or 
conditional share awards. 
The awards will usually be made during the 42 day period 
following the announcement of the Company’s full year results.
The number of nil cost options or conditional share awards will be 
determined by dividing the amount of the annual bonus being 
deferred by the price of a share on 31 December of the year 
preceding that in which the awards are made. For example, for 
awards made in 2016, the share price used in the determination 
was that on 31 December 2015.
In respect of the period ended 31 December 2016, the 
Remuneration Committee has approved an annual bonus for those 
participating in the Plan equal to 40% of base salary in respect of 
the beneficiaries based in North America and 20% of base salary in 
respect of the beneficiary based in the UK with 50% of annual 
bonus being deferred under the terms of the Plan. Given a share 
price of £17.75 on 31 December 2016, this is expected to result in 
the award of a total of 16,150 nil cost options or conditional share 
awards.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, any deferred awards will 
not vest earlier than three years from the date of the grant of the 
nil cost option or award of conditional shares and such vesting will 
be conditional on the beneficiary being in employment for that 
period. If, before that period has expired, a participant leaves 
employment as a good leaver or, in the event of a takeover or 
change of control, the award will vest in full (or, if the Board should 
so decide, on a time pro-rated basis). 
The Plan contains “malus” provisions such that if, prior to the date 
on which an award vests, the annual bonus from which it was 
determined is found to be incorrect as a result of either a material 
misstatement in the audited accounts of the Group or the conduct 
of a beneficiary amounting to fraud or gross misconduct, then the 
Board may reduce, to nil, the number of shares awarded.
2016 performance targets
In respect of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, the performance targets for the period ended 
31 December 2016 were set using a combination of targets for 
both (i) revenue growth percentage and (ii) return on sales 
(operating margin) percentage. It was considered appropriate by 
the Remuneration Committee that these performance targets 
should be based on the results of the North American Direct 
Marketing business, since this represents 97% of Group revenue, 
and its financial performance is the dominant factor influencing the 
Group’s financial results.
The bonus percentage reward scenarios were based on a 
performance grid with (i) the vertical axis representing return on 
sales results ranging from a base of 7.3% and rising at 0.1% 
intervals to 8.0%, and (ii) the horizontal axis representing revenue 
growth percentages rising at 1% intervals from a base of 13% 
growth to a maximum of 23% growth. Examples of different 
scenarios under the grid are as follows:
• 13% revenue growth, at 7.3% return on sales: nil bonus (floor).
• 23% revenue growth, at 8.0% return on sales: 100% bonus, 
split half cash and half deferred shares (ceiling).
• 16% revenue growth, at 7.6% return on sales: 60% bonus, split 
half cash and half deferred shares (on-target performance). 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 33

Report
Financial

Additional 
Information
The bonus percentages payable at different performance levels 
were chosen specifically in accordance with the Group’s financial 
strategy to maximise organic revenue growth whilst maintaining a 
broadly stable operating margin percentage. The maximum 
percentage of salary that could be awarded as bonus was 100%, 
and in each scenario the cash element of the bonus had to be 
self-financed in the operating result.
The actual performance of the North American Direct Marketing 
business in 2016 was 13% revenue growth at a 7.7% return on 
sales. According to the performance grid this resulted in a bonus 
payable of 40% of base salary, split 20% in cash and 20% in 
deferred shares. 
2017 performance targets 
The performance targets for 2017 have been agreed by the 
Committee based on the principles set out in the Plan. As for 2016, 
these targets consist of both revenue growth percentage and 
operating margin percentage ranges for the performance of the 
North American business. The exact targets are not disclosed for 
commercial reasons.
Board of Directors
Mr. K. Lyons-Tarr was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the 
Group with effect from 31 March 2015. In January 2017 the 
Remuneration Committee awarded him a bonus of 40% of his 
annual salary, half of which will be paid in cash and half of which 
will be used for an award of conditional shares pursuant to the 
Plan. The number of shares to be awarded is 4,121.
Mr. D.J.E. Seekings was appointed Chief Financial Officer with 
effect from 31 March 2015. In January 2017 the Remuneration 
Committee awarded him a bonus of 40% of his annual salary, half 
of which will be paid in cash and half of which is to be used for an 
award of conditional shares pursuant to the Plan. The number of 
shares to be awarded is 2,747.
Given its focus on the Directors and senior managers in North 
America, Mr. A.J. Scull, the remaining UK-based Executive Director, 
does not participate in the Plan. His 2016 salary has remained at its 
previous level of £185,000. In January 2017 the Remuneration 
Committee awarded him a bonus of 8% of annual salary, payable 
in cash, for 2016.
The Committee reserves the right to make payments outside its 
approved policy but only in exceptional circumstances. The 
Committee would only use this right where it believes that this is in 
the best interests of the Company and when it would be 
disproportionate to seek specific approval from a general meeting. 
No such payments have been made during the period.
Remuneration is a topic upon which Shareholders have differing 
views, but I hope that the Group’s principles of clarity, relative 
simplicity and balance will help to explain what the Committee 
does and to enable Shareholders to understand the Remuneration 
Policy. In this context, I am pleased to note that at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting the Remuneration Report was approved by 
81.18% of Shareholders who voted (which excluded 1,350,133 
votes withheld).

Remuneration governance
Remuneration Committee composition
The Remuneration Committee is a committee whose membership 
is comprised solely of Independent Non-Executive Directors, being 
Mr. C.J. Brady (Chairman of the Committee), Mr. J.A. Warren and 
Mr. P.S. Moody (from 1 February 2016 until 1 December 2016). The 
Committee meets at least once a year and may invite other 
attendees as it sees fit.
The Committee remains mindful of the remuneration of employees 
when reviewing changes in executive pay. 
Remuneration Committee responsibilities
The principal duties of the Remuneration Committee are reflected 
in its terms of reference and include the following:
• to determine and recommend to the Board the overall 
remuneration policy of the Company;
• to determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors;
• to monitor and review the level and structure of remuneration 
for senior management;
• to determine the targets for any performance-related bonus 
and share incentive schemes operated for Executive Directors 
and senior management; and
• to review and approve any material termination payments.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration of the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board is 
determined by the Board (excluding the Non-Executive Chairman).
Remuneration Committee activities in the period ended 
31 December 2016
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the period ended 
31 December 2016 and the following matters were considered:
Salaries
Approving the salaries of the Executive Directors for 2016 and 
monitoring and reviewing the level and structure of salaries for 
senior management for 2016.
In the case of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, the increases in basic annual salary in 2016 were 12%.
The Executive Chairman became Non-Executive in September 2015 
and the increase in 2016 basic annual salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer reflected the additional duties and responsibilities which he 
assumed from that date.
The Chief Financial Officer, having been appointed in April 2015, 
progressively assumed additional duties and responsibilities 
thereafter and they were reflected in the increase in 2016 basic 
annual salary.
At its meeting on 17 January 2017, the Remuneration Committee 
awarded a 2017 basic annual salary increase of 3% to each of the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, this being in 
line with the increase in 2017 basic annual salary for all employees.
Bonuses
Approving the bonuses for the Executive Directors for 2015 and 
monitoring and reviewing the level of bonuses for senior 
management for 2015. 
Approving the structure of the bonus criteria for Executive 
Directors and monitoring and reviewing the level and structure of 
bonuses for senior management for 2016.
Future remuneration policy 
The Company has a well-established and clear remuneration policy 
which, in the view of the Committee, has made an important 
contribution to the success of the Company over a sustained period. 
The policy includes providing Executive Directors with remuneration 
packages which are: (i) competitive when compared to that of 
organisations of similar size, complexity and type; (ii) structured so 
that remuneration is linked to the long-term growth in earnings 
per share and in the shareholder value of the Company; (iii) clear, 
easy to understand and motivating; (iv) designed not to promote 
unacceptable behaviour or encourage unacceptable risk taking; 
and (v) structured to avoid reward for failure.
At the 2015 AGM Shareholders approved the remuneration policy, 
which can be found on the corporate website at http://
investors.4imprint.com/investors/shareholder-information/
agm-company-documents.
Elements of remuneration 
Remuneration for Executive Directors comprises both fixed and 
variable elements. The principal component of the fixed element is 
a salary, which is set at an appropriate level for the size and type of 
the Company to retain the quality of management it requires to 
further the Board’s objectives, but which is not excessive. 
The variable element of remuneration is designed to incentivise and 
motivate management to meet annual performance targets and 
reward performance. The principal component of the variable 
element is an annual bonus, half of which is paid in cash and half 
of which is deferred into shares, through the award of nil cost 
options or conditional share awards granted in accordance with the 
terms of the 2015 Incentive Plan.
The targets for the annual bonus, which is capped at a maximum 
of 100% of annual base salary, except in the case of the remaining 
UK-based Executive Director, where the maximum is 50%, are set 
by the Remuneration Committee each year and evolve with the 
growth objectives of the Group.

Base remuneration comprises fixed elements of pay being base salary, benefits in kind and pension contributions or pay in lieu of pension 
contributions. The base salaries are those approved at the Remuneration Committee meeting in January 2017. Pension contributions or pay 
in lieu of pension contributions are a fixed percentage of base salary and benefits in kind are based on 2016 figures.
On target includes base remuneration plus the bonus payable if budget is met. This results in bonus of 50% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, half of which is in the form of conditional share awards with a vesting period of three years 
from the award date, and a bonus of 8% of base salary, payable in cash, for the Corporate Services Director.
Maximum shows the maximum bonus payable if stretch targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met. In the case of the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer this is 100% of base salary, again with half in the form of conditional share awards with a 
vesting period of three years from the award date. The Corporate Services Director’s bonus is payable in cash.

Current service agreements
Mr. A.J. Scull (the “UK-based Executive Director”) has a rolling service contract which continues until terminated by the expiry of twelve 
months’ written notice from the Company to the Director. The service contract provides for participation in a discretionary bonus scheme, 
the provision of a car (or car allowance) and pay in lieu of pension entitlements. The contractual termination payment in such 
circumstances would comprise up to twelve months’ payments, equivalent to the notice period, in respect of salary, car allowance, pay in 
lieu of pension entitlements and contributions to healthcare and income protection schemes. 
Mr. K. Lyons-Tarr and Mr. D.J.E. Seekings (the “US-based Executive Directors”) have rolling employment agreements with 4imprint, Inc. 
which continue until terminated by the expiry of twelve months’ written notice from that Company to the Director. The employment 
agreements for the US-based Executive Directors provide for participation in a discretionary bonus scheme and entitlement to benefits 
generally available to employees of 4imprint, Inc. from time to time including, for example, retirement, disability, group accident, life and 
health insurance programmes. The contractual termination payment in such circumstances would comprise up to twelve months’ 
payments, equivalent to the notice period in respect of salary and other non-discretionary components. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 37

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Board of Directors on pages 22 and 23 confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
• the Strategic Report, Chief Executive’s Review, Financial Review 
and Directors’ Report contained on pages 6 to 25 include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, 4imprint Group plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of its profit and cash flows for the 52 week 
period (the “period”) then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2016;
• the Group income statement and Group statement of comprehensive income for the period then ended;
• the Group cash flow statement for the period then ended;
• the Group statement of changes in Shareholders’ equity for the period then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, and applicable law.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: $1,850,000 which represents 5% of profit before tax and 
exceptional items.
• We conducted audit work over 4imprint Group plc (the Parent Company of the Group), 
4imprint, Inc. and 4imprint Direct Marketing Limited which accounted for 100% of revenue 
and profit before tax and exceptional items. 
• Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
• Accounting for supplier arrangements.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in 
this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Areas of focus 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 42
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme liabilities
Refer to page 30 of the statement on corporate governance, page 
54 of the Statement of Accounting Policies and note 17 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which, 
although closed to future accrual and entrants, had a deficit 
of $19.3m (2015: $23.1m) as at 31 December 2016. The Group 
engage independent actuarial specialists to calculate the valuation 
of scheme liabilities.
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is impacted by the 
actuarial assumptions adopted by the Directors which are 
subjective and require estimation and judgement to be applied in 
their determination. If alternative assumptions had been adopted 
and applied these could have materially impacted the valuation 
of the pension scheme liabilities as at 31 December 2016. We 
focussed our work on the assumptions to which the valuation 
was most sensitive, namely the discount rate, inflation rate and 
mortality assumptions. 
We compared the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality 
assumptions to externally derived data, as well as our own 
independently formed assessments, in relation to these key inputs 
in order to assess whether the assumptions used were reasonable. 
We noted that all assumptions applied were in line with our 
independently formed assessments, within an acceptable range.
We also assessed whether the disclosures reflect the risks inherent 
in the accounting for the pension scheme and determined that 
the disclosures were sufficient and reflected the period end 
position of the pension scheme.
Accounting for supplier arrangements
Refer to page 30 of the statement on corporate governance and 
page 52 of the Statement of Accounting Policies.
The Group, primarily through 4imprint, Inc., receives significant 
rebates from its suppliers. These relate to volume based rebates 
on purchases made from key product suppliers throughout the 
financial period.
The rebates received are determined by formal signed agreements 
with suppliers and depend on the level of spend within the 
financial period, with which all agreements are coterminous. The 
percentage of purchases paid as a rebate from certain suppliers 
increases based on predetermined thresholds within supplier 
agreements.
We have focussed on this area because the quantum of income 
recorded under these arrangements is material in relation to the 
result in the period. Furthermore, given the number of different 
rebate contracts the Group has entered into and the range of 
different rebate rates used, including stepped rebates, in the 
calculations there is an inherent risk of error in the calculation of 
these amounts. 
We obtained a sample of supplier agreements and inspected 
them to assess whether all rebates received, and receivable, by 
the Group have been accounted for in the correct financial period 
and in accordance with specific terms agreed with suppliers. From 
inspection of these agreements we determined that the terms 
and conditions, including the financial periods over which rebate 
income could be earned, had been appropriately reflected in the 
calculations of rebates receivable.
We confirmed directly with a sample of suppliers the rebate 
income which had been earned in the period, and also 
recalculated supplier rebate income and receivables based upon 
spend with suppliers in the period taking account of agreed 
rebate rates per signed agreements. We did not identify any 
material differences between either confirmed rebate income or 
our expectation and the amounts recognised.
We compared actual receipts from suppliers in the period to 
amounts recorded as receivable at the prior period end in order 
to assess the historical accuracy of the estimation process. We 
determined that the level of current year receipts supported 
the assumptions around collectability of prior period rebates 
receivable, and therefore the estimation process was reasonable 
in this regard.
We tested purchase transactions around the period end to 
confirm whether purchases upon which rebate income and 
receivables are based had been recorded in the correct accounting 
period and we noted no material exceptions from this testing.
We tested the carrying value of rebate receivable balances at 
the period end by vouching to subsequent cash receipts from 
suppliers. We determined the proportions of these balances 
collected as at the date of this report and noted no evidence to 
suggest material doubts over collectability.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates. 
The Group comprises the following entities:
• 4imprint, Inc. and 4imprint Direct Marketing Limited, trading entities that form the Direct Marketing operating segment and are based 
in the United States and United Kingdom respectively;
• 4imprint Group plc, parent company of the Group; and
• Four non-trading entities.
The Group audit team in the UK performed an audit of the complete financial information of 4imprint, Inc. (which included visiting the 
business’s operations in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA), 4imprint Direct Marketing Limited and 4imprint Group plc, which we regarded as 
financially significant components of the Group. These components accounted for 100% of the Group’s revenue and profit before tax and 
exceptional items for the period.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality $1,850,000 (2015: $1,600,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax and exceptional items.
Rationale for benchmark applied We note that profit before tax and exceptional items is the key measure used both by the 
Board and, we believe, externally by Shareholders in evaluating the performance of the Group. 
It also represents a consistent measure of the performance year-on-year by removing the 
impact of non-recurring items.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $93,000 (2015: 
$80,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 14, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 44
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to 
report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
• the statement given by the Directors on page 40, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK  
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole  
to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to  
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent  
with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
• the section of the Annual Report on pages 29 to 31, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by 
us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 26 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the 
Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated.
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to.
• the Directors’ explanation on page 15 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so 
and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified

Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not been

of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 40, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of 4imprint Group plc for the 52 week period ended  
31 December 2016 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Financial Statements
General information
4imprint Group plc, registered number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. Its registered office is 7/8 Market Place, London W1W 8AG. These financial statements have been prepared in US dollars.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented. Accounting standards effective for the first time in the period have had no impact on the 
Group’s financial statements.
The Group presents the consolidated financial statements in US dollars and numbers are shown in US dollars thousands. A substantial 
portion of the Group’s revenue and earnings are denominated in US dollars and the Board decided that a US dollar presentation gives a 
more meaningful view of the Group’s financial performance and position.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with IFRS (International Financial 
Reporting Standards) as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The standards used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and endorsed by 
the EU at the time of preparing these financial statements (March 2017). 
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of at least twelve months from the date these financial statements were approved. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period. Subsidiaries are 
all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or 
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the 
activities of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries, as amended to conform to Group accounting policies, are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the consideration paid. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of 
identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. In addition, comparatives are also restated to reclassify disposed 
businesses, or those that meet the criteria of IFRS 5 to be classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations. 
All subsidiaries have the same year end date as the Group.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The key estimates are in respect of the present value of the pension scheme 
obligations. The assumptions used are disclosed in note 17.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgements or estimates and potentially result in materially different results 
under different assumptions or conditions. Management considers the following to be the only critical accounting policy:
Pensions
As disclosed in note 17, the Group sponsors a defined benefit pension scheme closed to new members and future accruals. Period end 
recognition of the liabilities under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant 
actuarial assumptions to be made including inflation rate, discount rate and mortality rates. Small changes in assumptions can have a 
significant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability in the balance sheet. Sensitivities to 
changes in these assumptions are disclosed in note 17. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 52
Other accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue from sales of promotional goods, delivery receipts and other activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of discounts, returns and sales-related taxes. Revenues 
are recognised upon the transfer of risks and rewards to customers.
Supplier rebates
Amounts due under rebate agreements are recognised based upon volumes of products purchased during the period to which the rebates 
relate at the relevant rebate rates, per supplier agreements. Amounts are credited to the cost of purchase of goods for resale and any 
accrued income is included in other receivables. Provision is made against such receivables to the extent it is considered that the amounts 
are not recoverable.
Segmental reporting
The reporting requirements of IFRS 8 require operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the 
Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance. The chief operating decision maker has been identified by the Directors as the Board and accordingly the segmental 
reporting included in the financial statements aligns with those reported monthly to the Board. 
Leases
Where the Group has substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership under a lease, the lease will be classified as a finance lease. All 
other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases
Assets acquired through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment, at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated over the lease term or the estimated useful life, 
whichever is shorter. The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities, net of finance charges. Interest costs on finance leases are 
charged directly to the income statement.
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Share-based payments
All share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant allowing for any non-market and service conditions and the impact of any 
non-vesting conditions (for example requirements for the employee to save). The fair value is charged to the income statement over the 
vesting period of the share option schemes on a straight-line basis. The value of the charge is adjusted each year to reflect the expected 
number of options that will become exercisable. All options cancelled are fully expensed to the income statement upon cancellation.
Exceptional items
Income or costs which are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the financial 
statements, are referred to as exceptional items. The Directors consider that the separate disclosure of these items assists in understanding 
the Group’s financial performance.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the 
countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax 
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts estimated to be paid to tax authorities. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the Group’s financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income 
tax liability is settled.

Report
Financial  
Statements
Additional 
Information
Taxation continued
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Dividends
Final equity dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Shareholders. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Foreign currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is Sterling, however the Group’s financial statements are presented in US 
dollars.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or subsidiary concerned are recorded at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income 
statement.
On consolidation the balance sheets of Sterling enterprises are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet 
date and income statements are translated at average rates for the period under review. One-off material transactions are translated at the 
spot rate on the transaction date. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the cumulative translation differences reserve and are 
reported in the statement of comprehensive income. 
On disposal of an operation any cumulative exchange differences held in Shareholders’ equity are recycled to the income statement.
Derivative instruments
The Group uses derivative forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge highly probable cash flows.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and are remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. The treatment of the gain or loss on 
re-measurement depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities are designated as fair value hedges. Hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of fair value hedging instruments are recognised in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of the 
hedged items are also recognised in the income statement.
The effective portion of changes in cash flow hedges are deferred in a hedging reserve, where material, and then charged to the income 
statement when the forecast sale or purchase occurs or if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur. Any ineffective portion 
of the cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. No depreciation is provided on 
freehold land. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated to write-off their cost less residual value by equal 
annual instalments over the period of their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on a regular basis. Leasehold assets are depreciated 
over the shorter of the term of the lease or their estimated useful lives.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
The principal useful lives currently fall within the following ranges:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Short leasehold buildings Life of lease 
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3–15 years
Computer hardware 3 years
Profits and losses on disposal which have arisen from over or under depreciation are accounted for in arriving at operating profit and are 
separately disclosed when material. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 54
Other accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Acquired software licences and external expenditure on developing websites and other computer systems are capitalised, held at historic 
cost and amortised from the invoice date on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life (currently three to five years). Internal costs 
and non-development costs are expensed to operating expenses as incurred. 
An expense is recognised in operating expenses for catalogues and other related marketing expenses when the business has access to them.
Impairment of assets 
All property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of the asset may have been impaired. Where an impairment review is required, the carrying 
value of the assets is measured against their value in use based on future estimated cash flows, discounted by the appropriate cost of 
capital, resulting from the use of those assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is a separately identifiable cash flow 
(cash generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised for the amount at which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, net of provisions for slow moving and discontinued items, and net realisable value using the 
first in first out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling 
expenses. Items in transit where the Group holds the risks and rewards are included in inventories.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the 
income statement. Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. In the 
cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts. Cash deposits with an original maturity in excess of 
three months are classified as other financial assets.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade and other payables are discounted 
when the time value of money is considered material.
Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution plans for the majority of its UK and US employees. The regular contributions are charged to the 
income statement as they are incurred.
The Group sponsors a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members and future accruals. The Group accounts for the defined 
benefit scheme under IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. The deficit of the defined benefit pension scheme is recognised in full on the balance 
sheet and represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date. A full actuarial valuation is carried out at least every three years and the defined benefit obligation is updated on an 
annual basis, by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
Pension charges recognised in the income statement consists of administration costs of the scheme, exceptional costs of risk reduction 
exercises incurred by the scheme and a finance cost based on the interest on net pension scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with 
IAS 19.
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets, experience gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
included directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
Borrowings
Borrowings are measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently carried at amortised costs using the 
effective interest rate method. Arrangement fees are amortised over the life of the borrowing. Borrowings are discounted when the time 
value of money is considered material.

Provision for future lease costs
Provisions for future lease costs and dilapidations are made when there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it 
is probable that expenditure will be incurred and a reliable estimate can be made of that cost. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Own shares held by employee share trusts
Own shares acquired, to meet future obligations under employee share options, are held in independent trusts. These are funded by the 
Company and purchases of shares by the trusts are charged directly to equity. 
Administration expenses of the trusts are charged to the Company’s income statement as incurred.
IFRS standards effective in future financial statements
The IASB and IFRS IC have issued new or amended standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods as noted 
below. The impact of IFRS 15 on the full year results is very minor. IFRS 16 will result in an increase to both assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet, but no material impact upon operating profit or profit before tax, based upon current lease commitments of the Group.  
If IFRS 16 had been in place at the end of 2016 both the assets and liabilities would have increased by around $5.0m. Management does 
not believe the impact of adopting the other new or amended standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the results  
or net assets of the Group.

The main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced to 20% from 1 April 2015. Further reductions to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 
1 April 2020 have been enacted. The net deferred tax asset at 31 December 2016 has been calculated at a tax rate of 19% in respect of 
UK deferred tax items which are expected to reverse before 2020 and 17% in respect of UK deferred tax items expected to reverse 
thereafter. 
A rate of 35% has been used in respect of US deferred tax items.
The amount of current tax recognised directly in Shareholders’ equity in 2016 was $nil (2015: $nil). 
No current tax was recognised in other comprehensive income (2015: $nil). 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 60

The basic weighted average number of shares excludes shares held in the 4imprint Group plc employee share trusts. The effect of this is to 
reduce the average by 4,900 (2015: 37,998).
The basic earnings per share is calculated based on the profit for the financial period divided by the basic weighted average number of 
shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
potential dilutive ordinary shares. The potential dilutive ordinary shares relate to those share options granted to employees where the 
exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares and are likely to vest at the balance sheet date.
The underlying basic earnings per share is calculated before the after-tax effect of share option charges, exceptional items and defined 
benefit pension charges and is included because the Directors consider this gives a measure of the underlying performance of the 
business.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is considered that there will be sufficient taxable profit available in future against which 
the deductible temporary timing differences can be utilised.
No provision has been made for deferred tax assets relating to losses carried forward in holding companies of $31.0m (2015: $40.0m). 
These losses have no expiry date and may be available for offset against future profits in these companies.

less cost to sell. Provisions held against inventory total $275,000 (2015: $201,000).
During the period a net amount of $74,000 has been charged in the income statement in respect of provisions for slow-moving and 
obsolete stock (2015: $56,000).

17 Employee pension schemes
The Group operates defined contribution plans for the majority of its UK and US employees. The regular contributions are charged to the 
income statement as they are incurred. The charges recognised in the income statement are:
2016 
$’000
2015 
$’000
Defined contribution plans – employers’ contributions (note 3) 1,078 959
The Group also sponsors a UK defined benefit pension scheme which is closed to new members and future accrual.
During the year, the buy-in of the benefits of the majority of pensioner members was converted to a buy-out and liabilities and assets (the 
latter being the insurance policies purchased on buy-in) of $94.79m have been removed from the balance sheet. To facilitate the buy-out it 
was necessary to initiate the process of winding up the existing defined benefit scheme and to create a new defined benefit scheme, with 
equivalent benefits, for pensioner and deferred members not included in the buy-out. These members were transferred to this new 
scheme, except for those with small value pension pots who opted to take winding up lump sum payments of their pension entitlement 
($1.98m of assets and liabilities removed).
The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows:
2016 
$’000
2015 
$’000
Administration costs paid by the scheme 311 394
Pension finance charge 521 836
Exceptional items – buy-out and, in 2015, flexible retirement option costs paid by scheme 1,320 610
Total defined benefit pension charge 2,152 1,840
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet comprise:
2016 
$’000
2015 
$’000
Present value of funded obligations (34,357) (139,248)
Fair value of scheme assets 15,067 116,134
Net liability recognised in the balance sheet (19,290) (23,114)
The funds of the scheme are held in trust and administered by a corporate Trustee to meet pension liabilities for around 420 past 
employees of the Group. The level of retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the best three consecutive tax years in the 
ten years prior to leaving active service and is linked to changes in inflation both pre and post-retirement.
The scheme is subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005. This, 
together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, and Guidance Notes adopted by the Financial Reporting Council, set out the 
framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension plans in the UK.
The Trustee of the scheme is required to act in the best interest of the scheme’s beneficiaries. The appointment of trustees is determined 
by the scheme’s trust documentation. It is policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by the members.
The scheme typically exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and longevity risk. A 
decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to scheme liabilities. This 
would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position, potentially require an increase in future cash contributions from the Company and 
may give rise to increased charges in future income statements. Caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the scheme against 
extreme inflation. Assets are held in a global absolute return fund, which is a multi-asset fund designed to provide positive returns in all 
market conditions and in a liability-driven investment fund designed to provide some hedge against movement in the liabilities due to 
interest rate fluctuation and inflation. The funds use derivatives to reduce risk.
A full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 5 April 2013 in accordance with the scheme funding requirements of the Pensions Act 
2004. This actuarial valuation showed a deficit of £30.6m. The Company agreed a schedule of contributions with the Trustee. The 
recovery plan period was 6.3 years and took into account the material funding improvement between the date of valuation and date of 
the recovery plan (December 2013), as agreed with the scheme actuary. The improvement was principally due to an increase in UK gilt 
rates during that period. In 2014 accelerated contributions of $22.4m (£13.7m) were paid to the scheme to facilitate the buy-in. A further 
$14.5m (£10.0m) was paid to the scheme during the year to convert the policies to a buy-out.
As a result of the buy-out transaction an interim schedule of contributions was agreed during 2016, based on maintaining the recovery 
plan period. Under this interim agreement £2.3m would be payable in 2017. A full actuarial valuation of the new scheme is currently being 
undertaken as at 30 September 2016 and once this is finalised a new schedule of contributions can be agreed. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 66
For the purposes of IAS 19, draft numbers from the actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2016, which is being carried out by a qualified 
independent actuary, have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2016. There have been no changes in the valuation 
methodology adopted for this period’s disclosures compared to the previous period’s disclosures.
The principal assumptions applied by the actuaries, as determined by the Directors, at each period end were:
2016 2015
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.20% 2.66%
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.10% 1.56%
Discount rate 2.68% 3.52%
Inflation assumption – RPI 3.30% 2.76%
 – CPI 2.20% 1.66%
The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 December 2016 have been updated to reflect the most recent version of the tables used in the 
last triennial valuation. The assumptions imply the following life expectancies at age 65:
2016 2015
Male currently age 40 23.6 yrs 24.4 yrs
Female currently age 40 25.8 yrs 26.5 yrs

The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows:

Cash 1,721 11.4 338 0.3
The scheme holds no 4imprint Group plc shares or any property occupied by the Group.
It is the policy of the Trustee and the Company to review the investment strategy from time to time and at the time of each funding 
valuation. The Trustee investment objectives and the processes undertaken to measure and manage the risks inherent in the scheme 
investment strategy are documented in the scheme’s Statement of Investment Principles.
The assets were held in a quoted global absolute returns fund, designed to give positive investment returns in all market conditions, and a 
liability-driven investment fund designed to provide some hedge against movements in the liabilities due to interest rate fluctuation and inflation.
The sensitivities on the key actuarial assumptions at the end of the period were:
Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 4.9%
Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% Increase by 1.8%
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of one year Increase by 2.9%
The sensitivities shown above are approximate. Each sensitivity considers each change in isolation and is calculated using the same 
methodology as used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the period. The inflation sensitivity includes the impact 
of changes to the assumptions for revaluation and pension increases. In practice it is unlikely that the changes would occur in isolation. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2016 is 20 years.

20 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to various currency movements. Risk arises predominantly from the remittance of 
overseas earnings in US dollars. In addition, Group subsidiaries may make both sales and purchases in a currency other than their 
functional currency and have foreign currency trade receivables and trade payables in relation to these transactions. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to partly hedge foreign currency cash flows arising from sales and purchases of goods, as 
well as remittances from its overseas subsidiaries. The Group does not hedge the currency exposure of profits and assets of its overseas 
subsidiaries or other financial transactions.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had no forward currency contracts.
The movement in the exchange rates compared to prior period increased profit after tax by $0.78m and increased net assets by $0.67m. 
Closing rate was US$1.23 (2015: US$1.48) and the average rate used to translate profits was US$1.35 (2015: US$1.53).
A strengthening in the Sterling exchange rate by 15% (the approximate range of movement of the exchange rate during the year) would 
reduce profit in the period by $1.1m and net assets at period end by $1.1m.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to trade receivable balances due from 
customers.
The risk associated with banks and financial institutions is managed on a Group basis and all banking relationships must be approved by 
the Chief Financial Officer or the Board based on the credit rating of the bank. 
The Group holds cash balances on deposit with its principal US and UK banks.

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. If collection of the amounts is expected in 
one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers. 
Credit risk arising from customers is delegated to the senior management of each business to a maximum level per customer, above which 
it is referred to the Chief Financial Officer for approval. External credit agency assessment reports are referred to as part of this process. 
Liquidity risk
Group borrowing requirements are managed centrally and the majority of borrowing arrangements are currently with the Group’s 
principal US bank and terms are agreed which are considered appropriate for the funding requirement of the Group at that time. 
Operating working capital is managed to levels agreed with the Group and cash forecasts are reviewed regularly by management. 
The Group monitors its levels of cash and indebtedness to ensure adequate liquid funds are available to meet the foreseeable requirements 
of the Group. The Group does not actively monitor a gearing ratio, but seeks to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility. Details 
of borrowing facilities are given in note 16.
At 31 December 2016 the net cash position (note 14) of the Group was $21.68m (2015: $18.38m).
Capital risk management
The objective for managing debt and equity capital is to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to 
provide returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
In 2016 the Company has provided returns to Shareholders in the form of dividends, details of which are included in note 8. Shares were 
purchased by an employee benefit trust, to cover the SAYE options maturing within the next three years.

2015 Incentive Plan
Under the 2015 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) 50% of the annual bonus of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and seven 
senior managers will be deferred into shares as awards of nil cost options or conditional shares, based on the share price at 31 December 
of the relevant year. The awards will be made in a 42 day period following the announcement of the Group’s full year results and the 
options will normally not be exercisable until three years from the date of the award, conditional upon the person still being in the 
employment of a Group company. It is expected that 16,150 options or conditional shares, with a total fair value of $353,000, will be 
awarded in respect of the 2016 bonus.
22 Share-based payments
Share options may be granted to senior management and, in addition, SAYE or equivalent schemes exist for all UK and US employees. The 
exercise price for SAYE options is equal to the market rate, less any discount up to the limit imposed by the local tax authority at the pricing 
date.
The fair value of the options is determined using the Black-Scholes model for SAYE and ESPP and is spread over the vesting period of the 
options. The significant inputs into the model are an expected life of between 2.2 and 3 years for the SAYE and ESPP options, the volatility 
measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over the last five 
years and the risk-free rate is based on zero coupon government bond yields.

• the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2016;
• the Company cash flow statement for the period then ended; 
• the Statement of changes in Company Shareholders’ equity for the period then ended; and

Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to 
report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 40, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances  
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 4imprint Group plc for the 52 week period ended 31 December 2016.

Information
General information
4imprint Group plc, registered number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. Its registered office is 7/8 Market Place, London W1W 8AG. The Company’s financial statements are presented in Sterling. 
Numbers are shown in pounds thousands.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are the same as those adopted in the 
consolidated financial statements on pages 51 to 55 except for the investments policy noted below. These policies have been consistently 
applied to all the periods presented.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC 
interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The standards used are those 
published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU at the time of preparing these statements 
(March 2017). 
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations that the Company has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of not less than twelve months from the date these financial statements were approved. Accordingly they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgement or estimates and potentially result in materially different results 
under different assumptions or conditions. Management considers the following to be the only critical accounting policy of the Company.
Pensions
As disclosed in note 17 on pages 65 to 67, the Company sponsors a closed defined benefit scheme. Year end recognition of the liabilities 
under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant actuarial assumptions to be made 
including inflation, discount rate and mortality rates. Small changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the expense recorded 
in the income statement and on the pension liability in the balance sheet. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost. Impairment reviews are carried out if there is some indication that the carrying value of the 
investments may have been impaired. Where, in the opinion of the Directors, an impairment of the investment has arisen, provisions are 
made in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.

Chairman’s statement Novar’ s results in 2002 support the decisive action taken
since the significant downturn of some of our markets last
year . The Group not only undertook a major restructuring
programme over the last 18 months, but also raised
investment in new products and commercial initiatives.
As a result, good operating progress was made across the
Group. Market share increases compensated for lower
markets overall, sustaining turnover , improving operating
profit, and producing a welcome recovery of headline 
pre-tax profits and earnings per share. And another year
of excellent cash generation, underpins our proposal to
maintain Novar’ s dividend.
Group turnover was stable at £1,448m in difficult markets,
while operating profit before restructuring at £117m was
up 2% on a like for like basis. Headline earnings per share
increased to 11.6p. The balance sheet has been further
strengthened with net debt reducing from £273m to £219m,
year end gearing of 46% and interest costs covered 10 times.
The development of the Group has continued in 2002.
Investment in new products and marketing initiatives
reached new highs. In Intelligent Building Systems we
strengthened the technology base in CCTV , and dedicated
resources to take on large projects that span multiple
businesses. We expect this to continue to drive our market
shares in the years ahead.
The acquisition of Alerton, announced separately on
26 February 2003, will further expand our portfolio of
Building Control brands, provide valuable technology , and
expand our routes to market in North America. It is a quality
business that offers excellent returns and future prospects.
In some of the toughest markets seen for many years, Novar
is performing well. That we have delivered the results we
have, owes much to the efforts of our employees, who
remain committed to the Group’ s continued progress.
I thank them on behalf of my colleagues.
The Board is recommending an unchanged final dividend
of 6.6p per Ordinary share, payable on 6 June 2003 to all
shareholders on the register at the close of business on
2 May 2003. 
Sir Graham Hearne

The development of the

Investment in new products and

new highs. We expect this to

shares in the years ahead. 04 Novar annual report 2002
Group Chief Executive‘s review
Our businesses continue to recover in response to the
actions we have been taking. New products and
commercial initiatives are improving our share in markets
that remain generally soft. Costs are coming down, but we
continue to invest to enhance our competitiveness when
market demand returns to more normal levels.
Our Intelligent Building Systems (IBS) businesses have been
able to compensate for the contraction we have seen in all
but one of our markets. Our Security and Controls business
introduced new products and launched new initiatives in
our market channels, building further market share on the
strength of these actions. Electrical Accessories had a strong
year with the introduction of a new range of DIY security
products. Datacoms markets continue to be depressed and
are at their lowest levels for many years. In response, we
have adjusted our cost base to these market demand levels.
Our capability in IBS has been strengthened with the
acquisition of VisiOprime providing state of the art digital
CCTV technology . T ogether with our existing access control
product suite, this CCTV capability allows us to provide
enhanced security solutions to our customers. All IBS
products can now also be offered through Novar Projects,
launched this year in several markets, to enable us to meet
the wider needs of larger projects. This allows us to
leverage the strengths of our existing customer and installer
relationships across the sector . 
Indalex (IAS) began to recover in 2002. Volumes grew 9%
in flat markets. The business continued to invest in safety
across the plant network as well as improving the quality ,
cost and delivery of our products. Indalex has started to
benefit from North American sales of product sourced from
Asia Aluminum, our strategic partner and leader in the
buoyant Chinese extrusions market. In 2002 we received
our first dividend from this investment. We also supported
Asia Aluminum in the acquisition of two plants in China. 
Security Printing Services (SPS) produced another solid
performance. Owing to the now discontinued disposal
process, a number of restructuring actions were delayed.
They are now well under way , but the timing of this action
impacted second half profits, which were also affected by
set up costs for new business wins, along with increased
investment in new plant and call centre capacity . We
continue to invest in improving the SPS cost base, opening
two new high capacity plants, closing two smaller plants in
2002, with a further four plants to close in 2003. SPS has
continued to generate significant cash flows for the Group.
Across the Group, our concentration on cash generation
has again produced free cash flows above £50m. Our
balance sheet remains sound.
Our businesses continue to
recover in response to the 
actions we have been taking.
Costs are coming down, but 
we continue to invest to 
enhance our competitiveness. 05 Novar annual report 2002
Outlook
Novar is, of course, affected by what happens to the
economies in which we trade. Current uncertainties make
forecasting even more difficult than usual. We are also
facing the prospect of continued weakness in the US
dollar impacting reported results and further increases
in pension costs.
Our response will be to drive for increased market shares
in all three sectors and to continue our cost cutting
programme. This, when taken together with the
improvement already achieved should allow us to
compensate for any adverse pension and currency effects.
We will also continue to invest in new product and
commercial initiatives, and position Novar for strong growth
when economic activity returns to more normal levels.

(1) All comments within this operating review refer to the performance of businesses on a
“like for like” basis unless otherwise stated. The term “like for like” means after adjusting
for the impact of the 2001 and 2002 acquisitions, at constant exchange rates.
(2) Group operating profit and EBITDA are before exceptional operating costs of £2m
(2001: £nil), restructuring charges of £18m (2001: £48m) and goodwill amortisation 
of £22m (2001: £21m).
Group Sales from continuing operations of £1,448m were 
1% below last year. They include an incremental £34m from
2001 and 2002 acquisitions and a £40m adverse impact from
currency translation movements. Excluding these items, like
for like sales fell by 1% across the Group with weak volumes in
datacoms markets offsetting stronger volumes elsewhere in
Intelligent Building Systems and by volume growth in Indalex.
Group Operating Profit for continuing operations was £117m,
1% lower than the prior year. This includes a £4m adverse
currency translation movement. The incremental impact of 2001
and 2002 acquisitions was not material. Like for like, profits rose
by 2% principally reflecting the beginnings of solid recovery at
Indalex through volume improvement and a reduced cost base
and second half growth in IBS helping to offset reductions in SPS. 
These results are after a £6m increase in pension charges 
for the year under SSAP 24. T otal pension costs charged in 
the year for both defined benefit and defined contribution
schemes, amounted to £13m (2001: £7m), of which £4m 
(2001: £nil) related to UK defined benefit schemes. T otal cash
contributions for all schemes in the year were £9m (2001: £8m).
Under FRS17 the Group deficit on all defined benefit plans at
the balance sheet date was £188m (2001: £33m) after set off 
of deferred taxation. This deficit is primarily due to the decrease
in asset values over 2002 and has no immediate impact on 
the funding requirements of the Group schemes, which will 
be determined for UK schemes at the next triennial valuation
at March 2003 and for other schemes at their annual valuation.
We anticipate these valuations will increase charges under
SSAP24 by potentially as much as £18m and that further
funding contributions will be likely from the second half of
2003. The Group does not currently intend to adopt FRS17
ahead of mandatory implementation.
The Group continued to invest in its businesses over the period.
£42m (2001: £65m) was invested in capital, plant and equipment
in the year. It is the aim of the Group that capex will be
equivalent to depreciation over the medium term. Restructuring
charge at £18m (2001: £48m) returned to the more normal levels
of 1% to 1.5% of turnover , reflecting the continued commitment
to a reduced cost base and enhanced competitiveness.
Net trading cash flow from continuing operations (before cash
restructuring costs of £24.5m (2001: £26.9m)) was £102m 
(2001: £118m), representing a cash conversion of 87%. 
Net debt reduced by £54m over 2001 to £219m. Interest 
costs were covered by Operating Profits 10.4 times, net debt
to EBITDA was 1.4 times and Group gearing was 46%.

Throughout the year, the markets for Intelligent Building
Systems (IBS) have remained soft. In this environment, IBS
continued to focus on gaining market share, delivering the
anticipated restructuring benefits and generating cash. The
business grew or held share in key markets through continued
investment in new products and commercial capability. 
Across IBS there was intense activity to deliver restructuring
programmes providing an enhanced competitive cost base 
as we move into 2003. T wo UK Datacoms factories were
closed in the year and total net headcount was reduced by
approximately 640 or 9%. This activity has supported the
progressive improvement in sector profitability through the year .

* Indicative analysis
Faced with a downturn in the German construction market
and delays in US national retail store opening programmes,
Security and Controls Systems was able to deliver sales 
growth of 1%. This growth was achieved through gains in
market share and sales of new and enhanced products. 
In Germany volumes in fire grew with the market while
intruder alarm volumes declined less than the market. The UK
fire business was strongly ahead gaining further market share
in relatively flat markets. 
Control Systems revenues declined slightly, but stayed 
ahead of the market, gaining share. They were impacted by 
a number of project deferrals in the UK and delays to US 
retail chains retrofit programmes and new store openings.
Successes in US national accounts, and international markets
together with increased sales of controls peripherals helped
to offset some of the shortfall. 
Operating profit declined as we chose to invest in new product
development and new commercial capability. The setting 
up of Novar Projects in the UK and Germany, the launching 
of new products and the investment in new systems will all
provide a stronger platform for this business going forward.
The expansion of the low cost Romanian manufacturing
operation was largely complete by mid year with benefits
progressively coming through in the second half.

Profit
26 30 40 24 EBITDA 16 -33% -32% -11%
* Indicative analysis
Within this segment, the improving performance of Electrical
Accessories has been overshadowed by declining revenues 
in Datacoms. Full year reported profits have been adversely
impacted by £4.5m of additional pension charges.
In the UK during 2002, Electrical Accessories realigned price
structures for a broadly neutral effect and broadened the
product portfolio, both of which contributed to volume and
market share gains. The business has continued to aggressively
move the sourcing of key products to lower cost regions. 
The combination of these actions has strengthened our
competitive position in key market channels. Strengthened
distribution relationships, secured in 2001, allowed us to grow
sales through the retail and wholesale channels, increasing
access to key customers and markets and providing future
opportunities for profitable growth. In Germany, Electrical
Accessories volumes declined in line with the markets, 
while restructuring actions at Ackermann delivered planned
headcount reductions of nearly one third by the year-end.
Datacoms markets deteriorated further during the year, 
with the UK and German markets hardest hit. Some lack of
product availability during plant restructuring contributed 
to the volume decline. Despite these difficult conditions, 
the business continued to focus on completion of the
restructuring programme progressively delivering a significantly
reduced cost base and headcount. T wo Datacoms factories
have now been closed in the UK. In addition, supply
arrangements have been concluded to assure that current
and future demand can be met from flexible and competitive
sources beyond our own manufacturing base. The business 
is now right sized for the current levels of activity. 
Datacoms and Electrical Accessories have demonstrated
progressive recovery in 2002 with solid operating profit 
growth in the second half of the period compared to the 
prior year and the first half of 2002.  Operating review continued

The soft alloy aluminum market in North America stabilised 
in 2002. After some restocking in the first quarter, there 
was further progress in quarter two after which market
demand flattened.
In these market conditions, Indalex showed a strong 
recovery with volumes up 9% and market share gains across
all segments. On a like-for-like basis, local currency sales
increased by 4% as volume gains were partly offset by reduced
base aluminum prices, down 7% on average.
Reported profits grew from £1m to £17m with increased
volumes and enhanced operational efficiency from our 
early restructuring activity, driving this improvement. We have
made considerable improvement on health and safety and
the environment allowing us to release £2.5m from provisions
in the year. 
Plant rationalisation and investment in new presses completed
in 2001 delivered their anticipated benefits in 2002. The drive
to enhance efficiency continued with further administrative
headcount reductions during the year. Whilst overall
headcount has declined, we have reinvested some of 
the administrative cost savings into sales and marketing
capability, helping to drive an improvement in market share. 
Business sourced from Asia Aluminum Group, in which we
have a 25% associate investment, increased in 2002 and there
are further opportunities to capture. Investment was made in
the management and logistics infrastructure needed to fulfil
the potential of this alliance. During the year we supported
the expansion of Asia Aluminum Group as they made a further
acquisition of two plants in China. This was financed by 
an increase in capital in the operating company, our share 
of which was £3.4m. We received our first dividend from this
investment in quarter four.
The smaller related engineering businesses reported in this
sector saw a small year on year fall in profits as new contract
signings were delayed.

Cheque market volumes in the USA are estimated to have
declined in the year by around 3% primarily due to the 
soft economy. There was a fall in volume in the high value
securities market segment as fewer new brokerage accounts
were opened. Against this background the business grew
market share with net new business wins in a competitive
market, enhanced revenue through the call centre and
Internet channels and further uplift from the release of new
cheque products.
Local currency revenues increased by 3% in the year, but
reported revenue was impacted by the weakness of the US
dollar through the second half of the year.
The business continued to grow the level of orders received
through call centre and Internet channels, providing enhanced
revenue opportunities. Business generated through these
combined channels increased to over 50% of 2002 revenue.
T o support the continued shift to these channels, a new
customer contact centre was opened in San Antonio, T exas
and two further centres saw their capacity increased.
Profits declined by 5% before the currency impact as a result
of additional investment in contact centre and Internet
capabilities, an increase in new business set up costs, lower
average sales prices and less favourable business mix. The
now discontinued divestment of the business also delayed a
number of restructuring actions that are now well under way.
At Clarke American, as the market has become more
competitive, so we have extended our commitment to invest
in reducing our unit cost per transaction. During the year 
two new high capacity plants were opened in Phoenix,
Arizona and Des Moines, Iowa. Late in the year, two older, 
less efficient plants were closed. A further four plant closures
were announced in early 2003. Investment in high capacity,
low labour cost, automated packaging systems continued
with 75% of all production capacity now benefiting from 
this programme. 
The direct-to-consumer businesses contributed to the sector
performance with further revenue growth over prior year driven
by increased volume and positive price movement, combined
with significant improvement in advertising spend yield. 
Profit was ahead slightly as a result of the increased revenue
combined with cost control and productivity improvements. 15 Novar annual report 2002
Financial review
This review gives additional information on significant
financial and accounting matters.
Restructuring
Restructuring charges of £18.4m in 2002 (2001: £48.1m)
comprise £13.6m for Intelligent Building Systems, £2.2m for
Indalex Aluminum Solutions and £2.6m for Security Printing
Services. Of the total charge, £9.2m relates to cash spend 
in 2002, £7.6m to cash spend anticipated for 2003 and the
balance to non-cash items (principally asset write downs).
In the Intelligent Building Systems sector, restructuring
programmes have focused on the integration of recent
acquisitions, reorganisation of our commercial operations
and on providing an enhanced competitive cost base across
the sector.
In the Indalex Aluminum Solutions sector , the drive to enhance
plant efficiency started last year has been supported by 2002
restructuring aimed primarily at administration and overhead
cost reduction.
In the Security Printing Services sector, costs relate both to
overhead reduction and to the closure of two small plants, 
as a part of our strategy of channelling production through
large scale plants supported by investment in high capacity
efficient packaging systems.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items comprised £1.5m exceptional operating
costs incurred in connection with the previously proposed
sale of the Security Printing Services business, profit on
disposal of fixed assets of £5.3m, and loss on the disposal of
minor businesses of £1.6m.
Interest
The net interest expense of £10.0m for the year compares to
£16.5m in 2001. The decrease reflects significantly lower
floating interest rates in the USA. 
Taxation
The tax charge before exceptional items is £34.6m reflecting
an effective tax rate of 37.0% on profits before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items. This rate reflects the mix of
the Group’ s businesses in the various overseas tax jurisdictions
in which it operates. A reconciliation of the tax charge from
the UK rate of 30% is provided in note 6 to the accounts.
Exchange rate impact
During 2002 sterling strengthened against two of the three
main functional currencies of the Group, being the US 
and Canadian dollars. This movement resulted in an 
adverse translation impact, decreasing reported turnover 
for continuing operations by £40m and operating profits
before restructuring by approximately £4m.
Dividends
The Directors recommend that the final dividend be maintained,
leaving the total dividend for the year unchanged at 9.50p
net per Ordinary share. Excluding goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items, the dividend covered is 1.2 times (2001:
0.4 times as restated) by headline earnings per share, and 
1.4 times (2001: 1.4 times) by free cash flow. The final dividend
will be paid in June 2003.

Net trading cash inflow decreased by £13.9m to £77.9m. The
main driver behind this movement was working capital
increases associated with reassessed stock levels and new
business wins. 
Excluding the impact of restructuring (per note 18) net
trading cash inflow decreased by £16.3m to £102.4m.
Capital expenditure was £41.7m (2001: £64.7m). The Group’ s
long term intention is that capital expenditure is broadly in
line with depreciation. 
Free cash flow before equity dividends increased by £1.4m 
to £54.9m. Financial review continued

Movement in net debt
Net debt at 31 December 2002 of £218.5m represented
gearing of 46%, and a reduction of £54.1m over the year. The
principal elements of the movement are set out below:

Net debt at 31 December 2002 (218.5)
Acquisition expenditure comprised £12.6m (including loans
advanced) on joint ventures and associated undertakings,
and £8.4m on subsidiary undertakings (including net debt
acquired). £23.0m was realised from the close out of a number
of cross currency and interest rate swaps. The Group’ s policy
is to hedge its principal overseas assets with local currency
borrowings and financial instruments. During the year
exchange gains as shown above were made on these
borrowings and financial instruments due principally to the
depreciation of the US dollar relative to sterling.
Invested capital
The Group’ s invested capital, defined as net assets excluding
debt, adding back goodwill amortised and goodwill written
off to reserves is £1,153.5m.

New accounting standards
The Group adopted Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred
T ax (“FRS 19”) in these accounts for the first time. Under 
FRS 19, deferred tax is accounted for on a full provision rather
than a partial provision basis. This change in accounting
policy contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate for
the Group to 37.0%.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits (“FRS 17”)
was issued in November 2000. The transitional period 
for implementation was extended during 2002 following 
the decision to put back the date for mandatory full
implementation. In the transitional period certain disclosures
are required in the notes to the accounts, and these are set
out in note 21. Under FRS 17, the difference between the
market value of the assets and liabilities (determined using
actuarial assumptions) of the Group’ s pension schemes at a
particular point in time is recorded as a net surplus or deficit
on the balance sheet. At 31 December 2002 there was a net
deficit of £188.0m after deferred tax set-off, calculated in
accordance with the FRS 17 prescribed method. This
compared to a deficit of £32.8m at 31 December 2001. The
increased deficit is due primarily to the decrease in the asset
values, reflecting the downward trend in markets experienced
in 2002. The FRS 17 deficit has no impact on the funding
requirements of the Group’ s schemes for 2002, which are
determined from regular funding valuations and reviews,
details of which are set out in note 21a. 
Currently the Group accounts for pension costs in accordance
with SSAP 24 under which the charge is calculated from
funding and actuarial valuations carried out from time to time
in accordance with local legal requirements. The total charge
across the Group for the provision of post retirement benefits
in 2002 increased to £13.3m (2001: £7.6m). The Group’ s most
significant defined benefit pension schemes are based in 
the UK, where the next triennial valuation will take place in
March 2003. Given the continued recent decrease in asset
values, it is likely that the Group’ s pension costs charged to
the P&L in accordance with SSAP 24 will increase significantly
in 2003. Cash contributions are also likely to be resumed on
all schemes from the second half of 2003.
Treasury policies and risk management
Treasury operations:
The Group continues to operate a centralised treasury
function, which acts within clearly defined policies approved
by the Board. These policies are designed to reduce the
financial risks faced by the Group relating to funding and
liquidity, interest rate and currency exchange rate exposure.
No speculative transactions are entered into by the treasury
function, which does not operate as a profit centre.
All transactions in financial derivatives principally forward
contracts and swaps are entered into to manage the risk
arising from underlying business activities. Further details 
of derivative financial instruments are provided in note 17 to
the accounts. 17 Novar annual report 2002
Funding:
The Group is financed by a combination of retained earnings
and fixed and floating rate foreign currency and sterling
borrowings.
In 2000, the Group raised $335m from a private placement of
senior loan notes in the US market. These notes are repayable
in three tranches from 2007 to 2010. Initially interest rate
swaps and currency swaps were used to convert this fixed
rate debt into predominantly floating rate debt. During 2002
the Group closed out the majority of these swaps for £23.0m.
Further information is set out in note 17 to these accounts. 
In addition to the private placement, the Group has available
committed bank borrowing facilities of £240m. Of these
borrowing facilities, £195m expire at the end of 2003. The
renewal or replacement of a proportion of these expiring
facilities is expected during 2003. 
The Group is in compliance with the financial covenants
contained within its committed debt agreements.
Interest rate risk:
The Group borrows at either fixed or floating interest rates
and uses interest rate financial instruments to manage its
exposure to interest rate risks. The Group treasury function
actively monitors the Group’ s exposure to interest rate risk.
Commodity risk:
The Group has certain exposures to metal commodity 
prices as a result of its business operations. The Group’ s
policy is to manage the risk associated with these exposures
by using derivative and supply contracts to hedge metal
price fluctuations.
Foreign exchange risk:
Group policy is to use foreign currency borrowings and
financial instruments to manage the impact on the Group
balance sheet of exchange rate movements.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated
into sterling at year end exchange rates. Gains and losses
arising on their retranslation are recorded in reserves where
they are matched with gains and losses on borrowings and
financial instruments taken out in the same currency to hedge
the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
Profits of overseas subsidiaries are translated at average
rates. Group policy is not to hedge foreign currency
denominated profits.
The Group has transactional foreign currency exposures
arising from purchases and sales denominated in currencies
other than the functional currencies of the operating companies.
Significant exposures are managed through a combination 
of currency borrowings and financial instruments.
Liquidity risk:
The Group’ s exposure to liquidity risk is managed by
maintaining a diversity of funding sources and a spread 
of debt maturities. The maturity of the Group’ s borrowings 
as at 31 December 2002 is set out in note 17e. 
Going concern
After having made appropriate enquiries including a review
of the Group’ s budget for 2003 and its medium term plans,
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group and Company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore,
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
these accounts. The Board

Company Nominee Service
A Company Nominee Service is available to private shareholders
which allows them to hold their shares in uncertificated form in
CREST , the London Stock Exchange share settlement system.
Shareholders wishing to join this service should contact the Registrars.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
The Plan offers Ordinary shareholders the opportunity to invest their
cash dividends into Novar shares, which are bought in the market at
the prevailing market price. Once shareholders have decided to
participate in the Plan, their future dividends will continue to be
invested on a regular basis in Novar shares until they decide to
withdraw from the Plan, or the Plan is terminated. At present some
20% of shareholders participate in the Plan. For further details
shareholders should contact the Registrars.
Annual General Meeting
Authority to allot shares and waiver of pre-emption rights
The Companies Act 1985 contains provisions making it necessary
for Directors to obtain authority from the shareholders for, first, the
allotment of unissued shares or convertible securities (except under
employee share schemes) and, secondly, the issue of Ordinary shares
or convertible securities for cash (other than by way of rights to
existing shareholders or under employee share schemes). Although
the Directors have no plans at present to issue new shares apart from
those required for the employee share schemes, allotment to those
converting convertible securities, or any other obligations or
potential obligations to allot, they believe that it is in the interests
of the Company for these authorities to be given to the Board.
Resolution No. 6 will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution to
renew the authority granted to the Board at last year’ s Annual
General Meeting for a further five year period to allot unissued
share capital up to a maximum of £39,862,000 in nominal value,
representing approximately 33% of the number of Ordinary shares
in issue. It is the intention of your Board to continue the practice
of renewing this authority annually.
At last year’ s Annual General Meeting the Directors were
empowered until the conclusion of the 2003 Annual General
Meeting to make issues of Ordinary shares or convertible securities
for cash, other than to existing shareholders pro rata to their
holdings. The Directors believe that, in the interest of flexibility,
the power should be continued. Accordingly, Special Resolution
No. 7 will be proposed to give the Directors authority to waive 
pre-emption rights over up to £5,979,000 representing approximately
5% in nominal value of Ordinary shares for a further period until the
end of the Annual General Meeting in the year 2004. The proposal
conforms with the pre-emption guidelines issued by the investment
protection bodies to ensure that existing shareholders’ interests
are safeguarded. 20 Novar annual report 2002
Report of the Directors continued
Purchase of own shares
Last year, shareholders approved the purchase by the Company of 
its own Ordinary and Preference shares. In the event the Company
did not buy back any shares during the year.
The Directors consider it desirable that the Company should again
seek authority from shareholders to have the flexibility to make
market purchases of its own Ordinary and/or Preference shares up 
to specified limits. Special Resolutions No. 8 and 9 to this effect will
therefore be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The Directors
would plan to use this authority if and when they considered it to be
in the best interests of the Company and the intention is to continue
to seek to renew it each year.
The consent of holders of the 7.25p Preference shares to the passing
of these resolutions will be sought at a separate Class Meeting
following the Annual General Meeting.
Policy on payment of creditors
Operating businesses are responsible for agreeing the terms and
conditions under which business transactions with suppliers are
conducted. Payments to suppliers are made in accordance with
these terms, provided that the supplier is also complying with all the
relevant terms and conditions. At 31 December 2002, the Company’ s
trade creditors represented 62 days (2001: 46 days) of annual purchases.
Corporate Governance
The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority require the
Company to include in its annual report and accounts a statement of
how the Company has applied the Principles of Good Governance
and Code of Best Practice (the Combined Code) and whether the
Company has complied throughout the accounting period. This
report describes how the principles of governance set out in the
Code are applied in relation to Directors, Directors’ Remuneration
(separately on pages 23 to 26), Financial Reporting and Internal
Controls, and the Audit Committee.
The Board considers that the Company has complied with the
Combined Code provisions throughout the year under review.
The Board consists of three executive Directors and five independent
non-executive Directors as described on page 18. The Board meets
at least eight times during the year to deal with matters which are
material to the Group which it has reserved for its own decision.
The Board operates through four main committees. 
The Nomination Committee consists of all the non-executive
Directors with Sir Graham Hearne as the chairman. It deals with
Board appointments and departures.
The Remuneration Committee consists of all the non-executive
Directors with Sir Geoffrey Whalen as the chairman.
The Audit Committee comprises all the non-executive Directors with
Dr Murphy as the chairman. The responsibility of this committee is to
satisfy itself that the Company’ s annual and interim accounts and
other major financial statements issued by the Board follow generally
accepted accounting principles and give a fair and meaningful
account of the Group’ s affairs. The committee also considers and
resolves any matters raised by the external auditors and brought to
the attention of the Board on any aspect of the accounts or the
Group’ s control and audit procedures. 
The Audit Committee is conscious of the need to ensure that the
objectivity and independence of the external auditors is maintained,
and keeps under review the nature, extent and fees paid in respect
of the non-audit services provided by them.
The Group Operating Committee includes the executive Directors
and heads of business sectors as well as several functional heads,
with Mr Hintz as the chairman. It acts as a general management
committee for running all the major business affairs of the Company.
Sir Geoffrey Whalen has been appointed the senior non-executive
Director .
Internal Control Statement
The Directors are responsible for the Group’ s system of internal
control, including financial, operational and compliance controls
and risk management, and for reviewing its effectiveness. It is
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The Board has adopted a Risk Management Policy and Group Risk
Framework which establish a process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by the Group. This process has
been in place for the year under review and up to and including the
date of approval of the annual report and accounts. The process is
reviewed annually by the Board and accords with the guidance set out
in Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
The Board has charged the Group Chief Executive, through the
Group Operating Committee, with responsibility for implementing
policies on internal control.
Sector Chief Executives are responsible for risk management within
their sectors, including embedding the risk process in newly acquired
businesses, and for notifying the Board, via the Group Operating
Committee, where exposure to risks is of a material nature.
Information on these significant risks, together with the relevant
control and monitoring procedures, is reviewed for completeness
and accuracy by the Group Operating Committee. This information
is presented to the Board for the Directors to assess the effectiveness
of the system of internal control. In addition, the Group Operating
Committee monitors the Group’ s significant risks on an ongoing
basis. The Board receives and reviews minutes of the meetings of the
Group Operating Committee, in addition to oral reports from the
respective heads of business sectors and functional heads as required.
Internal and external audit, and other related providers of assurance,
perform reviews of control activities and provide regular written and
oral reports to the Board via the Audit Committee.
The Board has assessed the significant risks and opportunities to the
commercial success of the business from social, environmental and
ethical issues as part of its regular risk management reporting and
review process.
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Group is committed to developing policies and achieving high
standards in all facets of Corporate Social Responsibility. A separate
report on Corporate Social Responsibility appears on page 22, which
among other things includes statements on employment policies,
health and safety, the environment and charitable donations. 21 Novar annual report 2002
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the
financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In
preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose, with reasonable accuracy, at any time the financial
position of the Company and Group and enable them to ensure that
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Research and development
The Group’ s businesses commit resources to research and
development to assist them in securing their competitive positions
in their chosen markets.
Auditors
Deloitte & T ouche have indicated their willingness to continue as
auditors. Resolution No. 5 to reappoint them under the provisions 
of Section 385 of the Companies Act 1985 will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting.
Directors
The names of the present Directors of the Company are shown on
page 18, and all were Directors of the Company throughout the year.
Mr I G Ashby resigned as a Director on 15 October 2002. 
Sir Graham Hearne and Mr M J E McKeon retire by rotation
under Article 95. Each of them, being eligible, offers himself for
reappointment as a Director. Details of the notice period contained
in the contract of service of Mr McKeon are included in the Report
to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration on pages 23 to 26.
Sir Graham Hearne, being a non-executive Director, does not have
a service contract with the Company. A brief biography of each of
the Directors is included on page 18.
During 2002, no Director had a material interest in any contract of
significance with the Company as defined in The Listing Rules
published by the Financial Services Authority.

26 February 2003 Corporate Social Responsibility
22 Novar annual report 2002
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an essential element of
modern business practice. The Board of Novar plc recognises its
responsibilities to develop and promote policies and management
systems to enhance the Group’ s performance in the key impact areas,
and to maintain the highest standards of ethical and social behaviour
in all business dealings. This report, the first we have prepared,
describes the progress we have made in 2002 in establishing a
framework for the Group and outlines how this is applied across
the Group’ s businesses.
During 2002 the Group introduced a Code of Conduct, a copy of
which is available on the Novar website. This outlines our conduct
across a range of social, ethical and environmental areas which
are core to the effective and efficient functioning of our business.
A separate code of conduct has been introduced in North America
and an Integrity policy operates for Indalex Aluminum Solutions.
These include areas such as anti-trust and trade regulation laws, and
employee rights and anti-discrimination legislation.
Accountability for managing CSR issues in the business sectors rests
with the Sector Chief Executives, who report to the Group Operating
Committee and the Board of Directors.
Employees
The Directors recognise that the Group’ s goals and vision can be
achieved only through the efforts of its employees. The Board
remains committed to ensuring that all Group employees are
treated with dignity and respect, and that the working environment
is one where each employee’ s contribution is recognised and
valued. All employment-related issues are judged on the basis of
individual ability and performance without regard to race, colour,
nationality, culture, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
age or disability. Discrimination and harassment are not tolerated,
and basic human rights are upheld wherever the Company operates.
With some 14,000 employees spread across operations in the UK,
Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia, the Group has
a diverse and multi-cultural workforce. Novar has policies on
compensation, benefits and ethics which are designed to reflect
national differences, for example in compensation philosophies and
labour relations. Wage levels are designed to be competitive in the
local market and are tested using a number of independent sources.
The Company believes in taking prime responsibility for
communications with its employees in order to keep them fully
informed on matters which affect them, and to enable them to
identify with the competitiveness and success of their enterprise.
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings-
related share option scheme in the UK, providing employees with
the opportunity to own shares in the Company.
Proper consideration is given to applications for employment made
by disabled people, and for training and personal and career
development as appropriate for disabled employees. In the event
of an employee becoming disabled whilst working for the Company,
efforts would be made to continue their employment and suitable
arrangements made for retraining as necessary .
Health & Safety
The Directors believe that the health, safety and welfare of the Group’ s
employees should be an integral part of the overall business strategy .
The Board’ s commitment is set out in the Group’ s Health & Safety
Policy Statement, a copy of which is available on the Novar website.
Below Board and Chief Executive level, Sector Chief Executives and
business unit managing directors are responsible for developing 
health and safety policies which are specific to their operations, and
the associated organisation and arrangements necessary to secure
the achievement of the Group policy.
Each sector has formal management systems and programmes
in place in relation to health and safety for their businesses, with
designated specialist managers. External audit of these has resulted
in a number of awards being achieved by Group businesses, both in
the UK and in North America.
Environment
The Group is committed to developing and promoting products
and processes that reduce waste and negative environmental impacts.
This includes both the efficient use of materials and energy in
designs and product development, and an awareness of the effect
on the environment of manufacturing processes. The Group’ s
environmental policy, a copy of which is available on the Novar
website, sets out five key principles as a framework for each Novar
business to develop and implement policies and procedures which
are relevant and appropriate to their operations.
Each of the sectors has its own environmental programmes which
are carried through at the local level by managers with specific skills
and training. Most European sites are accredited to the
environmental management standard ISO14001 or EMAS, and
programmes are currently under way to achieve further
accreditations during 2003. Environmental management systems
audits have been carried out in most operations.  All companies
have sought to optimise recycling of packaging and other materials
and waste where financially and economically viable. 
The Supply Chain
The Group is developing policies to take account of socially
responsible practices in the supply chain. Activity so far has focused
on the environmental performance of suppliers and their working
practice standards, supported by appropriate audit processes.
Improved co-ordination of logistics has focused on reducing
transportation, and improving fuel management awareness. 
Community Support and Charitable Donations
The Board receives an annual report on charitable payments across
the Group. The Group focuses on providing support for
organisations which are local to, or linked commercially with, Novar’ s
business units. Community involvement is organised at a local level
within the sectors. The Group has for many years supported CRASH,
the UK construction and property industry charity for the homeless 
(as a founder member). In North America, both Clarke American
and Indalex have well-established programmes to support the
United Way . In 2002, donations to charitable organisations within the
UK amounted to £24,725 (2001: £29,975). 23 Novar annual report 2002
Report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration
The Directors present their report to shareholders on Directors’
remuneration, which has been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
the Combined Code, and the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the “Regulations”). A resolution to approve the
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Regulations require certain information shown in this report to
be subject to audit. Accordingly, the following sections of the
report have been audited, as referred to in the Independent
auditors’ report on page 27: the table of Directors’ emoluments
and compensation, the tables of share options and Performance
Partnership Plan entitlements and the summaries of the
performance criteria upon which the share options and awards are
conditional, and the pension benefits.
The pay and benefits of each executive Director are determined by
the Remuneration Committee. The Group Chief Executive attends
Committee meetings and is consulted on proposals relating to the
remuneration of other executive Directors (but not his own). The
remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the
Board of Directors. No Director is involved in deciding his own
remuneration.
The Committee’ s T erms of Reference and responsibilities are
determined by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the
Company’ s Articles of Association. The Committee is composed
wholly of independent non-executive Directors: Sir Geoffrey
Whalen (Chairman), Sir Graham Hearne, Mr S L Howard, Dr G
Murphy and Mr O H J Stocken.
The Committee consults with the Group Chief Executive, the
Group Director of Human Resources and the Group Company
Secretary (who normally attend Committee meetings) and has
access to independent professional advice and market data which
is provided to the Company by its external consultants. Of these,
Hay Group provided advice and services which materially assisted
the Committee in its deliberations during the year under review.
Hay also provide advice to the Company on the Group’ s executive
grading structure.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors and 
Senior Executives 
The remuneration policy now and for the future is designed to
facilitate the employment, retention and motivation of executive
Directors and other senior executives of suitable calibre and
experience, and to incentivise them to meet the financial and
strategic objectives set by the Company. The packages are
designed to be broadly comparable with those offered by other
similar international businesses; the arrangements relating to North
America reflect local competitive practices.
The remuneration packages combine short and long term rewards,
and an appropriate balance of fixed and performance related
elements. The fixed elements comprise base salary, and pension
and life assurance, company car, and health care benefits. The
performance related elements comprise an annual cash bonus and
related deferred bonus plan, and executive share options. The
Company also operates a UK all-employee savings-related share
option scheme. The Committee considers that the targets set for
the different elements of performance related remuneration, which
are mostly based on growth in the Company’ s earnings per share
as described below, are appropriate and demanding in the context
of the Company’ s trading environment and the business challenges
it faces.
Contracts of Service
The Board has a general policy of one year notice periods for
executive Directors. In the absence of specific provisions for the
payment of liquidated damages on termination of employment by
the Company, legally appropriate mitigation factors will normally be
considered in determining any compensation that may be payable.
Mr B J Hintz, a US citizen, has a service agreement with the
Company’ s US subsidiary, Novar USA Inc. Under a separate
agreement between Novar USA Inc. and the Company, Novar
USA Inc. seconds Mr Hintz to the Company. Both agreements are
effective from 14 November 1997. Mr Hintz’ s service agreement can
be terminated on 12 months’ notice. (On a change of control of the
Company, Mr Hintz would be entitled to 24 months’ notice and
would receive as compensation liquidated damages equivalent to
18 months’ salary and benefits in the event of termination). 
Mr M J E McKeon has a service agreement dated 25 April 2000
which can be terminated by the Company on 12 months’ notice. 
Mr C L Korbell, a US citizen, has a service agreement with Clarke
American Checks, Inc. (“Clarke”) dated 19 September 1995 which is
automatically extended each year on 31 December for an additional
one year period, unless at any time Clarke gives 60 days’ prior notice
of termination. In the event of termination, Mr Korbell would receive
two years’ salary and other benefits payable over the following two
years. (On a change of control of Clarke, Mr Korbell would be entitled
to receive one year’ s salary as a lump sum, and on termination of the
employment by either party (other than for cause) at any time
thereafter, two years’ salary and bonus (less the compensation of one
year’ s salary already paid)).
Mr I G Ashby’ s service agreement (which was effective from 24
September 2001, and which provided for 12 months’ notice from the
Company) terminated on 31 October 2002 when he left the Company .
The unexpired term of the service contracts is therefore 12 months
for Mr Hintz and Mr McKeon, and 60 days for Mr Korbell.
Policy on Remuneration of Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed initially for a three year
period, which is then reviewed and extended for further three year
periods as appropriate. There are no provisions for notice periods
or compensation in the event of termination. The current expiry
dates of the service periods of the non-executive Directors are: 
Sir Graham Hearne 30 July 2005
Mr S L Howard 16 June 2003
Dr G Murphy 3 September 2003
Mr O H J Stocken 16 June 2003
Sir Geoffrey Whalen 9 January 2005
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company’ s
incentive or benefit schemes. The remuneration of non-executive
Directors during the year under review was made up of a basic fee
of £20,000 and an additional fee of £11,500 in recognition of their
membership of certain committees. Committee chairmen each
received an additional fee of £3,500. The non-executive Chairman
of the Company received a fee of £155,000 for the year under review.
Base Salary
The Committee sets base salaries to reflect responsibilities and
experience; these are reviewed annually, having regard to both the
individual’ s and the Company’ s performance, pay and employment
conditions elsewhere in the Group, and competitive market salaries.
Annual Bonus 
The executive Directors participate in an annual bonus plan related
primarily to growth in the Company’ s earnings per share and, in the
case of Sector Chief Executives, to operational performance. In 2002
they were each awarded a bonus amounting to 6% of salary. The
bonuses received by the Directors are included in the table of
Directors’ emoluments. Report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration continued

Share Option Schemes
The Company currently operates the following share option schemes:
(i) Novar plc Executive Share Option Scheme (last options granted
in 1996)
Mr Korbell is the only Director who holds options granted under this
scheme, along with other senior executives. All options were granted
at market value and are normally exercisable only after they have
been held for at least three years. No performance criteria attached to
options granted up to and including 1995, in line with market practice
at that time, but options granted in 1996 are exercisable only if the
percentage growth in the Company’ s annualised headline earnings per
share over any period of three consecutive financial years prior to
exercise exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Prices Index over
the same period by an average of at least 2% per annum.
(ii) Novar plc 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme
All the executive Directors, along with other senior executives,
hold options granted under this scheme. Option grants to executive 
Directors are normally made on an annual basis, up to a maximum
entitlement of one and a third times salary. All options are granted
at not less than market value and are normally exercisable only after
they have been held for at least three years. 
Annual option grants have been made since 1997 and are subject
to performance targets linked to business performance on the same
basis as the 1996 grants described in (i) above.
The calculations relating to the achievement of the performance
targets are reviewed by the Company’ s auditors.
In 1998 and 1999, enhanced grants of options, worth up to three
times individuals’ normal entitlement, were made to the then
executive Directors and certain of the Group’ s most senior
executives. The options are subject to stringent performance
conditions designed to promote superior improvement in the
underlying financial performance of the Group, and are conditional

Notes:
1. Mr Ashby left the Company in October 2002. He received £255,828 as compensation for termination of his employment in accordance with the terms of his service agreement.
His bonus payment was prorated for his service during the year.
2. Mr Korbell received an additional bonus payment of £28,048 related to the performance of the Security Printing Services sector in the first four months of the year. In accordance with
normal US practice, his bonuses were pensionable.
Performance Partnership Plan
Mr Hintz, Mr Korbell and Mr McKeon all participate in the Novar plc
Performance Partnership Plan. Under the Plan, directors and senior
executives are invited to defer a proportion (between 20% and 100%)
of the after-tax amount of any annual bonus they receive by investing
it in the Company’ s shares, and receive a matching award of shares,
based on the pre-tax value of the invested bonus, at the end of a
3 year period commencing on the date the shares were purchased.
This is subject to the achievement of a performance target which
requires that the percentage growth in the Company’ s annualised
earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years
commencing with the year of grant must exceed the percentage
growth in the Retail Prices Index over the same period by an average
of at least 4% per annum. If at the end of the 3 year performance
period the growth target has not been achieved, the matching
awards lapse. 
In addition to the achievement of the performance target,
participants must remain employed by the Group until the date
of vesting of the matching awards, and hold the shares purchased
throughout this period. 
In order to avoid dilution of shareholders’ equity, any awards made
under the Plan will be sourced from existing shares held by the
Novar Performance Partnership Plan Share Trust. 
Set out in the table below are details of the conditional matching
awards of shares made to each Director under the Plan, and the
shares purchased by them. No awards were made to any of the
Directors in 2002 as no bonuses were payable. All the shares
purchased by the Directors under the Plan are also included in
the table of Directors’ interests on page 21. 25 Novar annual report 2002
upon individuals having a minimum personal holding of shares in the
Company until exercise. In addition to the earnings per share target
described above, a second performance target linked to increases
in T otal Shareholder Return must be satisfied before options will be
exercisable. For the 1998 grant, the Company’ s T otal Shareholder
Return is required to increase by at least 33% by the third anniversary
of the grant date, or be at least equal to the median of the
combined indices of the Building and Construction and the Building
Materials and Merchants Sectors in the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index
(which has since been merged into a single index, the FTSE Construction
and Building Materials Index), in which case 50% of the options
become exercisable. This percentage increases proportionately on a
straight line scale up to 100% if the T otal Shareholder Return reaches
110%, or is at or above the upper quartile of the combined indices at
the third anniversary. For the 1999 grant, similar conditions apply
although there is no comparative measure of T otal Shareholder
Return in relation to other sector companies, and the range of
increase in the Company’ s T otal Shareholder Return required for
vesting at the third anniversary starts at 50% (for 50% of the options
to be exercisable), rising to 110% (for 100% to be exercisable).
The options are normally exercisable between the third and seventh
anniversary of the grant date and the increases in T otal Shareholder
Return required for exercise increase proportionately through this
period. The exercise price also increases through this period to reflect
the cost to the Company of providing the option. In 1998, the grant
was in place of the normal annual grant made under the scheme for
the executive Directors and the other recipients. In 1999, the grant
was made following the release of the Company’ s interim results in
August and was in recognition of the substantial improvement in
the financial performance of the Group at the half year. This was in
addition to a normal grant which had been made earlier in the year
under the scheme, with the aggregate value of the two grants
capped at three times salary. 
In order to avoid dilution of shareholders’ equity, any options
exercised under the scheme will be sourced from existing shares
through the Novar Employee Trust. 
(iii) Novar plc 1999 Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Under this scheme, options over shares are offered annually to all
permanent UK employees (both full-time and part-time) with a minimum
of one year’ s service. The most recent offer, in March 2002, was at a
discount of 20% to the market value of the Company’ s shares on the
day before the invitation date to participate. 
Mr Hintz holds an option granted in 2000 under this scheme over
9,765 Ordinary shares at an exercise price of 99.2p. This option is
exercisable during a six month period from its maturity on 30 June 2003.

work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the
Company’ s Directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for the
preparation of the other information contained in the annual report
including the Report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part
of the Report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration described
as having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom
legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration
described as having been audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if,
in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company and
other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’ s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the board’ s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’ s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Report of the Directors and the other information
contained in the annual report for the above year as described 
in the contents section including the unaudited part of the Report 
to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration and consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part
of the Report to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration described
as having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and
the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Report
to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration described as having
been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements and the part of the Report to shareholders
on Directors’ remuneration described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2002
and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the financial statements and part of the Report to shareholders
on Directors’ remuneration described as having been audited
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.

Principal accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as
modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets, and in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of the Company and all of
its subsidiary undertakings at 31 December 2002. The results of subsidiary
undertakings are included in the profit and loss account using the acquisition
method as from the effective date of acquisition or in the case of disposals up 
to the effective date at which the investment is sold.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to
reserves and remains eliminated against reserves. This is charged to the profit
and loss account on the disposal or termination of the related businesses.
Subsequent to that date, and in accordance with FRS 10, where businesses
are acquired, any difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value
of the net assets acquired is capitalised as goodwill and written off on a
straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life of up to 20 years.
Provision is made for any impairments.
Associated undertakings and joint ventures
Associated undertakings and joint ventures are defined as investments in
which the Group has a long-term interest and is in a position to exercise
significant influence over the company in which the investment is made.
The Group’ s share of the profits less losses of associated undertakings and
joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account. Its
interest in the net assets of associated undertakings and joint ventures is
included as an investment in the consolidated balance sheet at the Group’ s
share of net assets at acquisition plus the Group’ s share of retained profits.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange at the
dates of the transactions or, if hedged, at the forward currency rate. Balance
sheet items in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at mid-market
rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Profit and loss accounts of
overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates
of exchange for the relevant accounting period.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation at year end rates of the 
net investment in foreign undertakings, less exchange differences on foreign
currency borrowings and any linked foreign exchange contracts which relate 
to investments in overseas assets and any tax arising on these exchange
differences are dealt with as reserve movements. These exchange differences
are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. All other
exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Derivative financial instruments
The derivative financial instruments used by the Group to manage its
currency risks are principally forward foreign currency contracts and foreign
exchange swaps and interest rate swaps.
The Group does not enter into speculative contracts and all derivative
transactions are entered into to manage the risks arising from underlying
business activities.
Interest payments or receipts arising from derivative financial instruments 
are recognised within interest payable or receivable as appropriate. Any
premiums or discounts arising are amortised over the life of the instrument.
T ermination payments made or received are spread over the life of the
underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues 
to exist. In other cases termination payments are taken to the profit and 
loss account. 
Leases
Assets acquired under finance leases are included under the relevant
category of tangible fixed assets and depreciated accordingly. The capital
element of the future lease rentals payable is included as appropriate under
creditors due within or after one year. The interest element of lease rentals is
charged to the profit and loss account. Rentals under operating leases are
charged to profit, as incurred, over the terms of the lease.
Tangible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets, except freehold land, are written off on a straight line
basis over the estimated useful lives which, for the major categories, are:
Freehold buildings –  10 to 50 years
Fixtures and fittings –  2 to 20 years
Leasehold land and buildings –  50 years or term of lease if less
Plant, machinery and tools –  2 to 33 years
Motor vehicles –  3 to 6 years
Long leaseholds are land and buildings held on leases which expire 50 or
more years after the year end. Short term leaseholds are land and buildings
held on leases which expire within 50 years of the year end. Amounts
receivable under capital grants are treated as deferred income and credited 
to the profit and loss account by instalment over the expected useful life of
the related asset on a basis consistent with the depreciation policy.
Following the implementation of FRS 15 (‘T angible Fixed Assets’) the Group
has adopted a policy of not revaluing fixed assets. The carrying amount of
tangible fixed assets previously revalued has been retained at their book
amount in accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 15.
Research and development
All expenditure on research and development is written off in the period in
which it is incurred.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net
realisable value. The cost of work in progress and finished goods comprises
materials, labour and attributable overheads.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an
obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less
tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based
on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of
items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods
different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation
of fixed assets where there is no binding contract to dispose of these assets
nor on unremitted earnings where there is no binding commitment to remit
these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Retirement benefits
The retirement benefit obligations of the Company and its UK subsidiary
undertakings are financed by contributions to separate funds, which are
subject to actuarial valuations every three years. Pension costs in respect of
employees who are members of these pension schemes are charged to the
profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the average
service lives of employees in the schemes.
Certain foreign subsidiary undertakings operate defined contribution and
defined benefit pension schemes. Pension costs in respect of the defined
contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account 
in accordance with the contributions paid. Pension costs in respect of
employees who are members of overseas defined benefit pension schemes
are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of
pensions over the average service lives of employees in the schemes.
The Group’ s post-retirement benefit schemes other than pensions are
accounted for so as to spread the costs over the average service lives of
employees in the schemes. In accordance with FRS 17, additional disclosures
relating to the Group’ s pension schemes are given in note 21.
Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced value of sales excluding Value Added T ax
and similar sales related taxes.
Investments
Fixed asset investments other than associates and joint ventures are shown at
cost less provisions for impairment. 33 Novar annual report 2002

Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred T ax (“FRS 19”) has been adopted
for the first time in these accounts. FRS 19 requires that deferred tax be
recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed by the balance sheet date. The Group’ s previous policy was to
recognise deferred tax to the extent that a deferred tax liability was expected
to arise in the foreseeable future. This change has been accounted for as a
prior year adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated
accordingly .
The impact of adopting the new policy on the results for the year ended
31 December 2002 is to reduce profit after tax by £3.3m (2001: £8.2m reduction).
The cumulative effect on reserves at 1 January 2001 is a reduction of £7.2m
which has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment (31 December 2001:
£15.5m reduction). 35 Novar annual report 2002

The net book value at historical cost of freehold and long leasehold land and
buildings was £66.7m (2001: £85.9m). On a historic cost basis the accumulated
depreciation thereon would have been £80.0m (2001: £78.9m). The Group’ s
freehold and long leasehold land and buildings held at valuation are on the
basis of a valuation at Open Market Value carried out as at 31 December
1997 by Healey & Baker, International Surveyors. There were no assets held
under finance leases (2001: £nil).
The net credit of £0.2m in respect of impairment of fixed assets is made up of
charges of £1.6m less a £1.8m reversal of charges made in the prior year arising
from changes in the planned use of the fixed assets.
The fixed assets of the Company, which are predominantly fixtures and fittings,
at cost and valuation of £4.4m (2001: £4.4m) and aggregate depreciation of
£3.8m (2001: £3.7m) are included above. During the year additions at cost
totalled £0.2m, depreciation of £0.3m was charged and the net book value of
disposals was £nil.
At 31 December 2002 the Group had outstanding capital commitments
contracted but not provided for of £1.4m (2001: £15.4m). The Company had no
outstanding capital commitments at 31 December 2002 (2001: £nil).

Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be
exchanged in an arm’ s length transaction between informed and willing parties
and is calculated by reference to prevailing market rates. As at 31 December
2002 the only financial instruments where there were significant differences
between the book value and the fair value comprised currency and interest
rate contracts, fixed rate senior notes and non equity shares. The fair value of
these financial instruments compared to their book value is set out below.
17 Financial Instruments continued
The senior notes are not publicly traded. The fair value attributed to them
below is an estimate of their value assuming a private transaction between
willing parties at a date close to 31 December 2002.

Pensions and similar obligations largely represent SSAP 24 accruals in respect
of funded pension schemes in the United Kingdom, unfunded liabilities on
pension schemes in Europe and post retirement benefits in respect of US
based retirement medical schemes. The Group’ s pension arrangements are
fully described in note 21.
Deferred consideration has arisen on acquisitions made in 2001 and 2002,
and represents the estimate of the future consideration payable should
certain performance targets be met. The provision at 31 December 2002 is
expected to be utilised by the end of 2005.
Restructuring provisions relate to committed costs in respect of the Group’ s
restructuring projects, and the provision at 31 December 2002 is expected to
be utilised by the end of 2004.
The elements of the provided deferred tax assets (included within debtors) and
the deferred tax liability shown above, are set out below:

No provision has been made for deferred tax in respect of any future
disposals of upward revalued properties as the Directors do not envisage
a significant crystallisation of any such liability in the foreseeable future. 39 Novar annual report 2002
18 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued
Deferred tax has not been provided in respect of the earnings retained
overseas by subsidiary undertakings because it is not currently intended to
make a distribution which will give rise to a tax charge.
The Group provides for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not they will
reverse in the future.
Some of the Group’ s operations have generated tax losses in 2002 and earlier
periods. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of losses
where their future utilisation in the short term is uncertain. The value of the
deferred tax asset not recognised is £31.3m.
No provision has been made for deferred tax assets of £2.0m in respect
of accelerated capital allowances and £9.3m in respect of other short term
timing differences as recoverability in the short term in the relevant
jurisdiction is uncertain.
Property provisions principally relate to lease rentals in respect of vacant
property .
Other provisions principally relate to warranties, legal claims, environmental
liabilities and other onerous contracts; the expected timing of the use of
these provisions is currently uncertain.
Company
The provision for liabilities and charges is in respect of restructuring. There is
no provided deferred taxation in respect of the Company (2001: £nil).

21 Retirement benefits
a) SSAP 24
In the UK, the Group participates in a number of defined benefit pension
plans. The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. Overseas
subsidiary undertakings participate in a variety of defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans.
21 Retirement benefits continued
The total pension and other post-retirement benefit costs charged in the year
ended 31 December 2002 were £13.3m (2001: £7.6m). The charge in the UK was
£4.1m (2001: £0.3m), and the balance was in respect of overseas arrangements.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group held the following assets and liabilities in
respect of pensions and other post-retirement benefits:

The Group’ s pension cost for 2002 has been based on updated actuarial
advice based on the position as at 31 December 2001. The most significant
actuarial assumptions used for the principal UK and overseas pension plans
were as follows:

United Kingdom
The UK pension costs relating to defined benefit pension plans have been
determined in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified
independent consulting actuaries using the projected unit method. The costs
for 2002 have been calculated based on updated valuations as at 31
December 2001. The results of those valuations showed that the combined
market value of the UK pension plan assets was £451.9m. The market value of
those assets represented approximately 114% of the value of benefits that
had accrued to pensioners, deferred pensioners and active members based
on past service and allowing for future increases in earnings where
appropriate. The market values as at 31 December 2002 of the assets of the
UK pension plans are set out in the FRS 17 disclosures below.
The total charge for the UK defined benefit pension plans for 2002 was £3.7m
(2001: £nil).
The Group has a number of other minor post-retirement benefit obligations
in the UK, and the charge for the year in respect of these obligations was
£0.4m (2001: £0.3m).
Overseas
Overseas, the Group operates pension plans in several countries, with the
most significant being in the USA, Canada and Germany.
The Group has defined benefit and defined contribution plans in the USA
and Canada. Defined benefit pension and other post-retirement obligations
are valued by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial reviews of the USA defined benefit pension plans were
carried out for the purpose of calculating pension costs in 2002. The results
of those valuations showed that the combined market value of the US
defined benefit pension plan assets was approximately £49m at 31 December
2001. This represents approximately 82% of the value of benefits that had
accrued to pensioners, deferred pensioners and active members based on
past service and allowing for future increases in earnings where appropriate.
The total charge for the US defined benefit pension plans for 2002 was £1.5m
(2001: £0.3m). The market values as at 31 December 2002 of the assets of the
US defined benefit plans are set out in the FRS 17 disclosures below. 41 Novar annual report 2002
21 Retirement benefits continued
In Canada, the Group has defined benefit pension plans. The latest actuarial
reviews were carried out for the purpose of calculating pension costs in 2002.
The results of those valuations showed that the combined market value of the
Canadian defined benefit pension plan assets was £19m at 31 December
2001. This represents approximately 126% of the value of benefits that had
accrued to pensioners, deferred pensioners and active members based on
past service and allowing for future increases in earnings where appropriate.
The total credit for the Canadian pension plans for 2002 was £0.1m (2001:
charge of £0.1m). The market values as at 31 December 2002 of the assets of
the Canadian defined benefit plans are set out in the FRS 17 disclosures below.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans in North America.
Members of these plans can make voluntary contributions which are matched
or partially matched by the Group. The Group does not have the ability to
recover the assets held by the plans, nor can it be required to make additional
payments to the plans over and above the contributions referred to above.
Custodial responsibility for the assets rests with independent investment
managers. The charge for these plans for 2002 was £4.7m (2001: £5.2m).
The Group also has exposure to a post-retirement benefit plan in the USA. 
The charge for this arrangement in the year was £0.3m (2001: £0.4m).
The most significant defined benefit pension plan in Europe is in respect of
Ackermann. Ackermann operates a now closed unfunded defined benefit
plan, the pension obligations of which have been valued by independent
actuaries using the projected unit method. The latest actuarial review of the
plan was carried out as at 31 December 2001 for the purpose of
estimating the pension cost in 2002. The results of this valuation showed the
value of benefits accrued to pensioners, deferred pensioners and active
members based on past service and allowing for future increases in earnings
to be approximately £23.9m. The charge in the year was £2.2m (2001: £1.4m).
In addition to those described above the Group operated a number of other
pension schemes. The total net charge for these schemes in the year was
£0.6m (2001: credit of £0.1m). 
Given the recent continued decrease in asset values, it is likely that the
Group’ s pension costs charged to the profit and loss account in accordance
with SSAP 24 will increase in 2003.
b) FRS 17 disclosures
In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17
‘Retirement benefits’. Under FRS 17, certain disclosures in respect of defined
benefit schemes are required in the transition period, before it is fully
effective, and these further disclosures are included below:
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most 
recent actuarial valuations performed by qualified independent actuaries. 
These were carried out as at 31 December 2001 and have been updated to
take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of
the schemes at 31 December 2002.

Of the total consideration and costs of £8.9m, £2.5m is deferred. In addition
to the consideration above, expenditure of £1.0m was made in the year in
respect of acquisitions made in earlier years and for which provision was
made in the prior years’ financial statements.
During the year ended 31 December 2002 the acquisitions contributed
turnover of £7.9m and operating profit of £0.9m, which included goodwill
amortisation of £0.1m, to Intelligent Building Systems. The contribution to cash
flow from operating activities was a £0.1m outflow, and capital expenditure
was £0.3m. The impact on other cash flow headings was not material.
The adjustments to prior year acquisitions represents £0.5m in respect of
additional costs, and a £0.1m decrease in the fair value of net current
assets acquired.
Acquisitions in the year
On 1 April 2002 the Group acquired 51% of the share capital of the German
company Jans Sicherheitssysteme GmbH for a total cash consideration,
including costs, of £1.3m. In addition, overdrafts assumed were £0.2m. The
provisional capitalised goodwill on this acquisition is £1.1m and this is being
amortised in the profit and loss account over 20 years. Subsequent to the
year end, as permitted under the original purchase agreement, the Group
purchased the remaining 49% of the share capital for an initial cash
consideration of £1.9m with up to a further £1.0m of deferred consideration.
On 16 August 2002 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the UK
company visiOprime Limited for a total cash consideration, including costs, of
£4.8m, which included £2.2m of deferred consideration. The provisional
capitalised goodwill on this acquisition is £4.9m and this is being amortised in
the profit and loss account over 20 years.
On 4 December 2002 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the
Eire company Calvari Limited for a total cash consideration, including costs, of
£1.8m. In addition, overdrafts assumed were £0.2m. The provisional
capitalised goodwill on this acquisition is £1.4m and this is being amortised in
the profit and loss account over 20 years.
An acquisition of the remaining minority interest of a prior year acquisition
was made during the year for a total consideration, including costs, of £0.5m,
which included £0.3m of deferred consideration. The provisional capitalised
goodwill on this acquisition is £0.4m and this is being amortised in the profit
and loss account of over 20 years.
The total book value of the net assets of the acquisitions in the year which
included £1.2m of loans, amounted to £1.0m. After downward fair value
adjustments of £0.4m mainly in respect of accounting policy alignments, the
provisional fair value to the Group of the acquired assets was £0.6m.
In addition to the acquisitions in the year above, from the beginning of the
year, a 51% equity interest in Saudi Ega Limited which had previously been
accounted for as an associated undertaking was accounted for as a subsidiary
undertaking as dominant control had been achieved. The net assets brought
into the Group’ s consolidated balance sheet were £0.9m, which comprised
fixed assets of £0.8m, £0.6m of cash in hand, £0.3m of other net current assets
less £0.8m of minority interests.

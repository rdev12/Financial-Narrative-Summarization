This year, the growth
of our business
combined with the skill
base of our employees
has given us positive
differentiation in the
marketplace.
Our core business lies in the tenanted residential market 
and, in particular, in the regulated and life tenancy sectors. 
As owners/managers of over 12,000 tenanted properties, 
we are the UK’s largest quoted residential landlord.

2003
During 2003, Grainger Trust more than doubled the size of its
asset base by completing an acquisition that began in 2001. 
It has enabled us to extend our specialist capabilities in
managing a large-scale tenanted residential portfolio and
opened up opportunities to develop our life tenancy business.
In parallel, we have continued to make progress in our
development and trading activities.

Grainger Trust plc 
Chairman’s statement
Profit before tax and exceptional items has increased by 8% to
£48.5m (2002: pre exceptional item £44.9m). Grainger’s own 
profit before tax and exceptional items rose 20% to £37.7m from
£31.4m, driven by a rise in profits from trading sales in our Tenanted
Residential Division. We did not acquire the outstanding interest in
Bromley until our year end and so have only included a 50% share
of its results. As expected Bromley’s pre tax profits were lower at
£10.8m from £13.5m last year because of the very significant
£330m asset disposal programme in 2002. The post tax
contribution has, however, remained relatively constant because 
the disposal programme produced a disproportionately high tax
charge. The increase in group post tax profitability has produced 
a rise of 24% in earnings per share before exceptional items to
118.5p from 95.3p. Statutory earnings per share increased by 
40% to 118.5p from 84.6p. 
Net asset value per share (‘NAV’) after adjusting for the market 
value of our trading properties and investments has risen by 27% 
to £21.94 from £17.24. NNNAV , which takes account of all deferred
tax liabilities and adjustments for the market value of our long-term
debt and financial instruments, has advanced by 16% to £13.91
from £12.03. Net asset value on a statutory balance sheet basis is
£6.01 (2002: £4.89).
For the first time we are disclosing an alternative measure of NNNAV
to take into account the potential value of the reversionary surplus in
our regulated and life tenancy portfolios. This is the difference
between the vacant possession value of our properties and the
investment or market value, and currently stands at £455m. We
have calculated the anticipated timing of the realisation of that
surplus, discounted it back to present value and then deducted 
tax. This produces a discounted post tax reversionary surplus
amounting to £111.2m or £4.49 per share. When added to NNNAV
we obtain a ‘Grainger NAV’ of £18.40 per share. Full details of the
calculation are given in the operating and financial review. 
Your directors are recommending a final dividend of 12.80p per
share (2002: 11.13p), payable on 5 March 2004 to shareholders on
the register at close of business on 13 February 2004. This together
with the interim dividend of 3.51p per share (2002: 3.05p) amounts
to a total of 16.31p per share (2002: 14.18p), an increase of 15%
for the fifth consecutive year.
During the year we successfully refinanced our Bromley Joint
Venture, comprising the BPT portfolio, lowering borrowing costs 
and enabling a dividend of £52.0m to be paid to each of the Joint
Venture partners. BPT was further rationalised during the year and
now comprises a portfolio principally of core regulated assets.
Towards the year end we acquired Deutsche Bank’s interest, to take
full control of the business. This is the major factor in the doubling 
of the group’s asset base (market value at 30 September 2003
£1,388m, 2002: £691m) and has been achieved without recourse
to shareholder funding.
Our tenanted residential business has prospered during the year
and we continued to buy additional stock. In the year Grainger
purchased a total of 1,736 units for £112.2m, and at the year end
our portfolio, including the BPT assets, stood at 12,030 units with a
market value of £1,164m and vacant possession value of £1,648m.
These acquisitions included 918 life tenancy units bought from NPI
for £40.5m, taking our total life tenancy portfolio to 2,291 units with
a market value of £134.3m.
Robert Dickinson 
Chairman
We will continue to develop our key themes;
focusing on tenanted residential activities,
particularly the regulated sector but with the
new challenge of developing the life tenancy
business, applying our property and asset
management skills to produce additional
returns for the group and maintaining the
momentum in our Development and 
Trading Division.

Chairman’s statement 03
Grainger Trust plc 
Chairman’s statement
Our development and trading business has generated operating
contributions of £13.6m and we have several exciting opportunities
in the pipeline. In particular, we announced in June 2003 that we
had been selected by Islington Council to develop two key mixed-
use sites in the Borough. 
The acquisition of Bromley not only brings us complete ownership
of a high quality portfolio of residential assets but also provides us
with a core of experienced and efficient staff. This, combined with
our longstanding network of external managing agents, enables us
to achieve high quality national coverage, able to supply both asset
and property management services. 
John Ward will be leaving the board at the annual general meeting.
John was appointed as a non-executive director on 24 February
1994 and has been chairman of the audit committee since 18 June
2002. He brought a high level of general commercial and detailed
banking knowledge to the group. We thank him for his very
significant contribution.
We are pleased with the progress made on the business’s
objectives in the year. In particular, the acquisition of Bromley
provides us with both the asset base and core of skilled, experienced
staff that enables us to deliver effective residential asset and
property management services on a national basis, not only for 
our own activities, but also to third parties. 
We will continue to develop our key themes; focusing on tenanted
residential activities, particularly the regulated sector but with the
new challenge of developing the life tenancy business, applying 
our property and asset management skills to produce additional
returns for the group and maintaining the momentum in our

The future looks both exciting and rewarding.

Chief executive’s statement 05
Grainger Trust plc 
Chief executive’s statement
We started the year with four key objectives:
– to maximise the benefits from Bromley, our Joint Venture company 
– to continue to focus on our core tenanted residential business
and, in particular, to develop our life tenancy activities
– to progress our development and trading business, realising profits
where appropriate and creating effective relationships with partners
– to develop our asset and property management capabilities so
that we can offer a high quality, national service 
We are delighted to have made significant progress in all of these
areas, whilst delivering record profitability and net asset value.
Our operating divisions have performed well this year with both
Tenanted Residential and Development and Trading delivering
improved contributions. 
Once again trading profits on residential sales have been very
strong. The housing market has remained robust throughout the
year, particularly for our core properties. Typically these are slightly
below the average UK house price value and may require some
refurbishment by the purchaser. In London, where we have
approximately 43% of our tenanted residential portfolio by value, 
we noticed some weakening of the market in the early part of the
year, particularly at the higher end, but it has strengthened recently.
In the regions we have seen consistent growth. Overall Grainger’s
properties have achieved an average vacant possession sale value
of £110,000, an increase of 26% from 2002. 
We have continued to strengthen our position in the life tenancy
market. We see this sector as being an increasingly important
component of the Grainger business in the future, providing
excellent reversionary opportunities and good synergies with the
existing core regulated activities. Given the appetite shown by home
owners to realise some or all of the equity in their properties, we
believe this market has potential for significant growth.
The Development and Trading Division continues to make a
significant contribution, with good profits being made on sales of
residential land at Kennel Farm and Townsend House in Victoria.
Since the year end we have sold a further 10.9 acres for £12m at
Kennel Farm completing the major residential land sales on that site.
Future revenue is expected to arise from overage payments, the
development of the B1 site and from the sale of some minor
residential areas. Over the last five years, total revenues from Kennel
Farm have amounted to £62m. 
Our key strengths lie in our knowledge and experience of all sectors
of the residential market, including mixed-use developments, and
our ability to trade in those sectors. We will therefore concentrate on
residential or mixed-use opportunities or on projects which have a
residential bias. We are moving away from pure commercial
property investment, although we shall continue to be involved in
commercial property where we perceive residential opportunities. 
Disposals from the commercial portfolio will reduce gearing and free
up resources for our core businesses. Since the year end we have
exchanged contracts on the sale of over £20m of commercial
property. Over the next year we will continue to purchase regulated
assets and to maximise the returns that we can obtain by selling on
vacancy. We will grow our life tenancy portfolio and look for structures
enabling us to do this without putting undue strain on gearing. 
The major event of the year, however, has been the acquisition of
Bromley. This confirms our position as the largest quoted residential
investor in the UK and enables a move from a Joint Venture
business plan focused on cash generation to a platform from which
we can take a long-term view.
Following the acquisition we are restructuring the property
management division which will strengthen our ability to provide high
quality asset and property management services nationally. We
believe that this ability will be of paramount importance in raising
equity funding should a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) structure
for tax transparent investment vehicles be introduced in the UK.
Grainger has a valuable pool of talented and committed staff – with
the enlarged asset base now available to them we are confident of
our ability to continue to deliver excellent returns for our
shareholders.

Performance
Tenanted Residential
During the year 655 properties were sold for a gross consideration
of £64.0m (2002: 785 for £51.0m) and trading profits rose by 25%
to £29.2m from £23.3m. Gross rents fell slightly by 1% to £16.6m
from £16.8m, reflecting the higher proportion of life tenancy
properties, which are non rent producing. This was more than
compensated for by savings in property expenses of £0.4m.

The increase in portfolio size comes from the Bromley acquisition
and from our life tenancy acquisitions – these now represent 19%
by unit number of properties owned (2002: 4%). 
Assuming sale on vacancy, the reversion on our tenanted 
residential portfolio (the difference between the vacant possession
and investment values) now amounts to £484m, or £19.55 per
share, before contingent tax. 
The average vacant possession value of our properties at 
30 September 2003 rose by 40% to £144,000 (2002: £103,000) 
as a result both of house price rises and of consolidating the higher
average value BPT portfolio. 
Bromley Joint Venture
The group acquired the balance of the Bromley Joint Venture at 
the end of its financial year and so the group profit and loss account
includes our 50% share of the Joint Venture’s results. In future years,
all of Bromley’s results will be consolidated with those of the
Grainger group. 
The cash consideration for the acquisition was £24.3m, with up to a
maximum additional amount of £10.0m payable in December 2004
if the Nationwide UK House Price Index rises by more than 10% in
the two year period to August 2004. Since the year end we have
also purchased Deutsche Bank’s outstanding loan stock and
accrued interest amounting to £15.7m.
The rationalisation of the portfolio continued with the sale of 
1,519 units raising gross revenues of £150.9m. The Joint Venture
contributed trading profits of £18.9m (2002: £26.6m) and net rents
of £8.3m (2002: £13.6m). These decreases were anticipated
because of the very significant disposal programme in 2002. 
Our share of administrative expenses fell from £7.3m to £3.9m,
reflecting the controlled scaling down of the business in line with 
the portfolio rationalisation and cost saving measures put in place. 
Development and Trading
Including profits on sales of fixed assets and writebacks of valuation
provisions this division contributed £14.6m (2002: £13.6m). 
We sold a total of 16.4 acres of development land at Kennel Farm
and adjacent sites, generating revenue of £15.5m and profits of
£8.5m. Other major revenue generators in the year have been
Townsend House (19,000 sq.ft. office block in Victoria sold for
£8.2m, profit £2.7m) and Grainger Homes, our housebuilding
division, which sold 68 units for a total of £6.0m, generating profit 
of £0.8m. Contracts have been exchanged on 62 flats out of the
total of 79 at the Pimlico development site. We anticipate these to
complete early in 2004 at a total sales value in excess of £30m. 
Administrative expenses
These have increased by 7% from £4.4m to £4.7m but at less 
than 4% of turnover are lower proportionally than last year. The
movement has arisen because of inflation and an increase in 
staff numbers.

Net interest payable
Net interest payable, including our share of the Joint Venture charge
and after having taken account of last year’s exceptional charge of
£3.8m, has decreased to £28.4m from £37.6m. The group has
carried a lower average level of debt in the year, the cash generated
by the Bromley rationalisation being a major factor, and our average
rate of interest payable has been lower at 5.6% (2002: 6.5%). The
average cost of the debt in Bromley fell to 6.2% from 7.6%. Group
interest cost is covered 2.7 times by profit before exceptional items,
interest and taxation (2002: 2.2 times).
Taxation
As noted in previous years our annual tax charge is significantly
affected by FRS19, the accounting standard that prevents the
provision of deferred tax on revaluation gains when companies are
acquired. This serves to increase our effective tax rate, which this
year stands at 39.4% (2002: 49.2%); the equivalent figure for
Grainger alone is 31.5% (2002: 34.2%). Major items affecting the 
tax charge, most of which relate to Bromley, are:
£m
Group profit before tax 48.5
Tax at 30% 14.5
Adjusted for:
Additional tax on the difference between book value 
and tax value of trading properties sales 4.4
Negative goodwill released (not taxable) (1.5)
Tax on capital gains 1.7
Actual tax charge 19.1
Earnings per share and dividends
Earnings per share before exceptional items have increased by 24%
from 95.3p to 118.5p and we have increased our dividends by
15%. Dividends are covered 7.3 times by profit after taxation and
minority interest (2002: 6.7 times on a like for like basis).
Financial position
General
The group balance sheet has changed significantly since 2002 as
the acquisition of the Bromley Joint Venture has resulted in its
assets and liabilities being consolidated for the first time.
Most of our properties are held as trading stock and are therefore
shown in the balance sheet at cost. This does not reflect the true
worth of Grainger’s assets and we set out below a statement of 
our net assets with the properties restated to market value.

Investments and intangible assets
Investment balances have decreased significantly because of 
the reclassification of the investment in the Bromley Joint Venture 
on consolidation. Other investments, being shares held in 
Grainger Trust plc for employee benefit purposes and our
investment in Schroders ResPUT, have increased in market value 
by £1.1m to £10.9m. Book value of these investments is £9.2m
(2002: £8.9m). 
The negative intangible asset of £97.2m shown in the statutory
balance sheet principally reflects negative goodwill arising on the
acquisition of Bromley. It will be released to the profit and loss
account in line with sales from the Bromley portfolio. 
Trading properties
Our trading properties can be analysed as follows:

Development and Trading 81.1 80.7 106.3 111.1
Total 888.3 305.1 1,185.8 504.7
The cost of our tenanted residential stock as shown in our statutory
balance sheet has increased from £224.4m to £807.2m. We acquired
£112.2m of properties in the year, had sales or write offs of £33.1m,
improvement costs of £3.2m and the balance of the movement,
£500.5m, came from the consolidation of the Bromley assets. 
The market value figures also show a significant increase from
£393.6m to £1,079.5m, of which £572.9m arises from the Bromley
consolidation. The remaining movement is due to valuation
surpluses of £48.3m and the net effect of sales, acquisitions and
transfers of £64.7m. The overall valuation increase in this portfolio
over the course of the year amounts to 9.4%. The total market
value of all our tenanted residential properties, including those
classified as fixed assets, is £1,163.9m (2002: £393.6m).
The overall value of the group’s development and trading assets
remained relatively constant over the year. The decrease in market
value from £111.1m to £106.3m is the result of the net effect of
sales at Kennel Farm and Townsend House and expenditure, 
mostly at Grainger Homes and our development in Slough. 
Other assets and liabilities
Other net liabilities, excluding current instalments due on borrowings
and cash balances, have increased from £26.7m to £68.9m. This is
largely due to the loan stock and accrued interest due to Deutsche
Bank at the year end of £15.7m and increases in sundry creditors
and taxation payable as a result of consolidating our Joint Venture
interest.

We have also calculated a ‘Grainger NAV’. This reflects our estimate
of the present value of the reversionary surplus in our regulated and
life tenancy portfolios, being the difference between vacant
possession value and market value after tax. Using our knowledge
of the age profile of these tenants we have estimated the expected
average timing of future vacancies (based on standard current
mortality rates, which may change in the future) and the subsequent
realisation of the reversionary surpluses. We have calculated the
present value of those surpluses net of tax using 8.9% (our weighted
average cost of capital plus a risk premium of three percentage
points) as a discount rate. This adjustment increases NNNAV by
£4.49 per share to £18.40 per share (2002: £14.43). Our calculation
is based upon current house prices, i.e. no future house price
movement is assumed. 
Cash and debt
Cash balances at the year end amounted to £81.7m (2002: £10.5m),
of which £53.8m (2002: £6.6m) is held by lenders awaiting
substitution of alternative security, represents deposits received 
or acts as security for cash backed loan notes.
Group borrowings have increased from £233.7m to £761.2m, 
as the Bromley debt is now consolidated into the Grainger balance
sheet. This debt, amounting to £493.7m, remains non-recourse 
to the rest of the Grainger group. New borrowings in the year
amounted to £64.0m (2002: £47.1m); these were used to finance
the acquisition of the Joint Venture and the NPI life tenancy portfolio.
Loan repayments were £30.2m (2002: £38.4m).  11
Grainger Trust plc 
Operating and financial review
Capital management
The group finances its operations through a combination of
shareholders’ funds and borrowings and seeks to optimise its
weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’). The estimated WACC 
of the group at 30 September 2003 was 5.89% (2002: 6.34%).
The main source of borrowings are banks and building societies 
but the group also has fixed rate institutional debt of £19.9m 
(2002: £20.5m). The group protects its underlying profitability 
from treasury risk by managing both its level and cost of debt. 
The group does not take trading positions in financial instruments
but holds them to minimise the risk of exposure to fluctuating interest
rates. The majority of our debt is maintained at fixed rates of interest
or is subject to protective caps or collars. At 30 September 2003,
£611.7m (80%) of the group debt was either fixed to termination, 
or for over one year, or was protected by financial instruments
(2002: £185.5m, 79%). 
A combination of interest rate swaps and financial caps is used to
provide a degree of certainty over future interest rate costs whilst
enabling the group to take advantage of any favourable short term
rates. At 30 September 2003 the group held £298.4m of swap
contracts at an average rate of 5.4% maturing between June 2006
and September 2013 (2002: £87.5m at an average rate of 5.3%).
There were also financial caps in place of £235.1m at an average
pre margin rate of 6.1%, expiring between February 2004 and
December 2009 (2002: £102.5m at an average rate of 6.5%).
A summary of our borrowings is:
Principal Interest
£m payable % Repayable
Permanently fixed 78.2 8.1 2004-32
Hedged by swap contracts 298.4 6.6 2006-12
Hedged by financial caps 235.1 5.0 2004-09
Variable/fixed under one year 149.5 4.7 2004-22
Total debt 761.2 5.9
Less: cash (81.7)
Net debt 679.5
The notional effect of the fair value adjustment of marking the
group’s fixed rate debt and derivatives to current market rates
(‘FRS13 adjustments’) would be to produce an additional ‘liability’
after tax of £7.7m or 31p per share (2002: 48p). This adjustment
represents approximately 1% of group gross borrowings at 
30 September 2003 and will not be recognised in the accounts 
until the position matures or is terminated.
The group also maintains a range of borrowing maturities to enable 
it to balance continuity of funding with flexibility. At 30 September
2003 the average duration of the group’s debt was 6.0 years 
(2002: 6.9 years).
Since the year end we have announced the repayment of the
outstanding £2.5m balance of our 2024 quoted debenture stock 
at an early redemption cost of £1.8m. The administrative burden
associated with this relatively small level of debt exceeded the
benefit we obtained from it.

Trading profit in our core business is derived
from the buying and selling of residential
property.
During the year, Grainger bought 1,736
properties with a value of over £112m and
sold 655 with a total value of £64m; in
addition BPT sold 1,519 properties for £151m.
This volume of transactions within the
residential sector demands a high degree 
of commercial, legal and administrative
capability in addition to an in-depth
knowledge of local market forces and trends. 
Our highly experienced acquisition teams
have developed a network of contacts who
provide a steady stream of opportunities, 
from individual properties to sizeable
portfolios. As property specialists in their own
right, the acquisition teams are able to assess
the potential of each opportunity, in the light
of local and national market criteria. 
Similarly, our sales teams are highly skilled 
in assessing values and making measured
judgements as to the level of refurbishment
that may be required to optimise the return 
on our investment. We believe that through
these processes we are able to achieve out-
performance. All refurbishments are carried out to
the highest quality based on a clear
understanding of current market
demands.

In 2003, the size of our tenanted residential
portfolio rose from 4,928 properties to 12,030,
mainly as a result of full acquisition of BPT 
via the Bromley Joint Venture. This high level
of growth has been challenging, but the
experience and knowledge within the
management and administrative teams at
Grainger Trust and the former BPT have
ensured that the integration and rationalisation
process is being achieved efficiently and
effectively. 
Our nationwide business now operates through
six offices, each of which is responsible for
understanding the dynamics of its local
market and maintaining firm control of
management issues. Good communication
between the senior management team and
the regional network ensures rapid feedback
from local markets. 
We have continued to invest in new IT systems
to enhance management control of the
portfolio and provide quick access to the
most relevant information.
Our proven asset management capability is
now being successfully deployed on behalf 
of Schroders Residential Property Unit Trust,
for whom we manage over 1,000 properties,
most of which have recently been constructed
and are let on assured shorthold tenancies. Our property managers undertake
regular inspections of properties and
provide a proactive and entrepreneurial

As pension income becomes less assured,
many homeowners are looking to release
capital tied up in their homes in order to fund
a better lifestyle in retirement.
Through our Bridgewater brand, we offer
homeowners the opportunity to receive a cash
lump sum and rent free occupation for life in
return for ownership or part-ownership of the
customer’s home. On vacancy, the property is
sold and a trading profit is realised.
Bridgewater is one of the main players in this
sector and is a long-standing member of Safe
Home Income Plans (SHIP), a body set up to
promote fair equity release plans and protect
the interests of planholders by ensuring
adherence to a code of practice. 
With the acquisition of BPT in 2003, our

Corporate Social Responsibility 
Corporate Social Responsibility – Policy
Grainger Trust plc is a property trading and development business.
We manage residential and commercial space as well as
undertaking commercial and residential developments. We
understand that our activities can have an impact on the
surrounding environment through the consumption of resources
and generation of waste and pollution. We also have an impact on
society, local communities and our employees. Grainger Trust plc
seeks to address these impacts by:
– identifying areas where we have an impact on the environment
and society, either positive or negative, and ensuring that these
impacts are managed effectively; 
– integrating environmental and social issues into business
strategies and developing objectives and targets to continually
improve our environmental and social performance;
– ensuring that we treat our tenants in a fair and responsible
manner;
– encouraging and supporting our employees in developing 
their careers within Grainger Trust and continuing to share 
our success with them;
– complying with relevant environmental and social legislation
and standards of relevance to the industry sectors in which 
we operate;
– preventing pollution where feasible and minimising the use 
of resources and the generation of waste where practical;
– working with all stakeholders who have an interest in our
business to improve our CSR performance;
– reporting on our CSR strategy and objectives with the aim 
of being transparent and providing relevant factual information
to our stakeholders.
These social and environmental goals will be implemented 
through the formation and achievement of objectives and targets
in the Grainger Trust Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy. 
This policy is fully endorsed and supported by:
Rupert Dickinson
Chief executive
Grainger Trust plc
Three year objectives
1 To identify CSR issues and develop a strategic
response to stakeholder information requests.
2 To formalise Human Resources systems to provide
support and appropriate CSR training for all staff.
3 To structure our approach to charitable giving 
and community support. 
4 To ensure compliance with all applicable social 
and environmental legislation as a minimum.
Highlights
Human Resources – providing employee support
We have an enlightened attitude towards our employees and a
proactive employee reward scheme that encourages participation
and provides staff with a clear path to reward and recognition for
success. Training schemes are being introduced for all staff to
support their continuing professional development. This has led to
excellent retention rates. Staff are also asked to invest in the future
of the company through SIPS and Save as You Earn Schemes.
These schemes ensure that staff are involved and rewarded for the
success of Grainger Trust. Employees are encouraged to put
forward ideas and initiatives to support local community activities
and charitable enterprises. We have a policy of matching any money
raised by staff for local charities and allowing staff to promote these
activities in the workplace.
BALTIC exhibition – sponsoring the Arts
By our stated objective of reinvestment in the community through
the arts, we have recently part-sponsored Antony Gormley’s Domain
Field at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art in Newcastle 
upon Tyne. 
From February to May 2003, BALTIC's largest art space became 
the site of the creation of a new and ambitious work by the
internationally recognised artist. 
As part of the exhibition, volunteers aged from two to eighty-five
years old from Gateshead and Newcastle were moulded in plaster
by teams of specially trained staff. These moulds were then used 
to construct the individual 'Domain' sculptures by a process of
welding steel elements together inside each mould. An individual
Domain is constructed of stainless steel bars of various lengths, 
with the finished installation including a collection of more than 
250 sculptures. 
We also have artists in residence at two of our housing
developments in the region.
Widdrington – regenerating a community
In the late 1990s we took the decision to increase the investment 
of our Land Development Division in the North East. A significant
addition to this investment and our North East landholding in 2001
was the purchase of 600 acres at Widdrington and Hadston. This
made us the first major private investor in the area for many years.
At Widdrington, we were encouraged by the local community forum

to become involved in several projects promoted by the East
Northumberland Regeneration Initiative. Liaison with the local
community and public sector led to the delivery of a new Primary
Health Care Centre and refurbished shopping centre. Following
community concerns about its future on the edge of the proposed
housing development we also bought the semi-natural ancient
woodland known as Grange Wood. The new development at
Widdrington will revitalise local services and be consistent with the
Regional Planning Guidance objective of regenerating the coalfield
area. Following our success at Widdrington, we were chosen by
Castle Morpeth Borough Council to re-develop the Park View
Estate, Hadston.
Eco-homes – sustainable developments
As part of the Northumberland Regeneration Project we agreed to
purchase an area of land designated for 20 Scandinavian timberclad
homes which are built to include a number of sustainable design
features. We are the co-ordinator of this self-build project. Members
of the local community have priority and can opt to complete the
projects themselves under our supervision or pay a fee to the house
production company to have them erected. As a result of this
experience in sustainable building and design, we have developed 
a Method Statement for recycling building materials. We are also
considering building in a requirement to use water-recycling systems
in managed housing estates.
Sponsored visit – Pele
We sponsored a recent visit to the North East by Pele, the
internationally renowned Brazilian footballer. The main reason for
Pele’s trip was to launch a photographic exhibition at Northumbria
University featuring images of him created by some of the world’s
most celebrated artists and photographers. 
Pupils from Brinkburn Comprehensive in South Shields also met 
the footballer. A Brazil football shirt was donated to the school and
signed by Pele, who offered words of encouragement to pupils
involved in the school football teams.
External Commentary
Casella Stanger are pleased to be invited to comment on Grainger
Trust’s publication of their first Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Policy. We undertook CSR Gap Analysis in August 2003 to identify
the environmental, social and community issues associated with
Grainger Trust’s activities, to assess current performance and to
develop a CSR strategy.
The CSR Gap Analysis was carried out through analysis of existing
business systems, document review and a series of interviews with
key Grainger employees against best practice. Best practice
guidance used for reference included the Global Reporting Initiative,
Environmental Management System Standard ISO 14001 and the
Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility Index.
In our opinion, some of the CSR activities undertaken by Grainger
Trust are considered to be extremely innovative and forward
thinking. Grainger Trust has an enlightened attitude towards human
resources and an extremely proactive employee reward scheme.
Staff are also encouraged to put forward ideas and initiatives to
support local community activities and charitable enterprises are
actively supported by Grainger Trust.
Grainger Trust has a high level of interest and enthusiasm in
implementing CSR issues, particularly those related to community
issues. There is however a need to formalise existing systems and
develop systems where these are currently lacking to cover the full
CSR agenda and to report on progress. It is anticipated that the 
CSR Policy and Strategy will achieve this.
We look forward to working with Grainger Trust as it develops its
CSR reporting in future years.

Corporate governance report
Corporate governance report
Grainger Trust plc is fully committed to the principles of good
corporate governance. This report sets out how the group has
applied the principles set out in section 1 of the Combined Code.
The Joint Venture fell outside the scope of the group’s corporate
governance during the year, but will now be included following the
acquisition of the remaining 50% on 26 September 2003.
The board
At the year end the board comprised three executive directors and
seven non-executive directors, including the chairman. The non-
executive directors bring to bear a wide variety of experience and
skills. Robin Herbert is the senior independent non-executive
director.
The board meets four times a year and at such meetings receives 
a full pack of information covering current trading performance,
budgets, forecasts and details of business opportunities and risks.
These packs also contain those matters which require full board
discussion and approval.
Procedures are in place to enable the directors to take independent
external advice when necessary, at the company’s expense, and 
to have direct access to the company secretary if required. Where
necessary, appropriate training is provided to new appointees to 
the board. On 14 October 2002, Stephen Dickinson resigned as
managing director and became non-executive deputy chairman. 
At the annual general meeting on 27 February 2003, Robin Oldfield
resigned as a non-executive director. John Barnsley was appointed
by the board as a non-executive director on the same date. Given
his experience, training was not considered necessary. All directors
are subject to formal re-election every three years at the annual
general meeting and are appointed for one or two years under
specific contracts. Directors appointed during the year are 
subject to formal re-election at the next annual general meeting.
Board committees
The board has established three committees: audit, nomination and
remuneration. Membership of these committees is shown on the list
of directors on page 22 and the remuneration committee report is
set out on pages 28 to 32.
The audit committee meets four times a year, has written terms 
of reference and consists solely of non-executive directors. The
committee monitors the effectiveness of internal controls and
receives external and internal audit reports. The committee is also
responsible for ensuring that the external audit function remains
cost effective, independent and objective.
The nomination committee consists of two non-executive directors
and one executive director. It meets to consider the need for and
suitability of all potential new board members.
Shareholder relations
The company meets regularly with institutional shareholders 
and analysts and uses the annual general meeting to encourage
communication with private investors. The chairmen of the three
board committees attend the annual general meeting and are
available to answer any questions. The notice of the meeting 
and related papers are sent to shareholders at least 20 working
days before the meeting. Shareholders vote separately on each
proposal and a proxy count is available after each resolution. 
A separate resolution to approve the remuneration committee 
report is proposed at the annual general meeting.
Internal control
The group’s systems of internal control are the ultimate responsibility
of the board of directors. Such systems are designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Each year, on
behalf of the board, the audit committee reviews the effectiveness
of these systems, which are aimed at maintaining full and effective
control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and
compliance issues. This is achieved primarily by consideration of 
the risks appertaining to the group and the monitoring of these
risks, together with a review of the half year and annual financial
statements and by discussion with the external auditors. In addition,
the group has an internal audit programme, under which specific
areas of its activities are reviewed and reported upon on a regular
basis. The committee considers any issues or risks arising
therefrom in order that appropriate action can be undertaken 
for their satisfactory resolution.
The group has an appropriate organisational structure which is
designed to allow the board to retain full control of the business. 
The group produces an annual budget together with longer term
projections, which are presented to and approved by the board 
of directors. At each meeting, the board discusses performance
against the budget and, where applicable, any revisions made to
the profit and loss and cash flow budgets.
The board also discusses in detail, the projected financial impact of
major proposed acquisitions and disposals, including their financing.
All such proposed substantial investments are considered by all
directors and decisions are made either by the board of directors 
or, where required between board meetings, by an executive
committee of directors. The board is also responsible for the
discussion and approval of the group’s treasury strategy, including
mitigation against changes in interest rates.
Going concern
After making enquiries, including the review of future anticipated
cash flows and banking covenants, the directors have a reasonable
expectation that the group and company have adequate resources
to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason,
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
accounts. 24
Grainger Trust plc 
Corporate governance report
Compliance statement
With the exception of the provisions listed below, the company has,
throughout the year ended 30 September 2003, been in compliance
with the Code.
Code provision
A3.2, B2.2, D3.1 Independence
The board considers that all non-executive directors are able to
bring independent judgement to bear on key issues. It feels that
longevity of service is an important attribute in a long-term business
as it provides both continuity and understanding. It also feels that
material shareholdings and cross directorships do not represent a
materially conflicting business relationship. Consequently, the board
does not view any of longevity of service, cross directorships or
material shareholdings in isolation as representing an impairment 
to independence.
Given this statement, the board believes that all non-executive
directors with the exception of Robert Dickinson and Stephen
Dickinson, are independent. Under the terms of the Code, 
however, only Nichola Pease is considered independent.
B1.7 to B1.10 Length of contracts
Two of the executive directors have contracts of over one year with
no specific provisions for compensation for loss of office. The board
feels that this is necessary to ensure commitment and long-term
continuity in achieving the group’s objectives, which by virtue of the
group’s activities are also long-term in nature. However, their original
two year contracts are being reduced to one year over a period of
five years from 1 October 2002.

Retirement and rotation of directors
John Ward is retiring from the board of directors at the annual
general meeting being held in February 2004. John Barnsley was
appointed a director on 27 February 2003, and in accordance with
the Articles of Association, will offer himself for re-election at the
annual general meeting. Robert Dickinson and Robin Herbert retire
by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the
annual general meeting.
Directors’ interests in significant contracts
No directors were materially interested in any contract of significance.
Insurance of directors
The group maintains insurance for Grainger Trust plc’s directors in
respect of their duties as directors.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial
statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the
affairs of the company and the group as at the end of the financial
year and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been
used and applied consistently and reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates have been made in the preparation of 
the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2003. 
The directors also confirm that applicable accounting standards
have been followed and that the financial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and the group and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
company and of the group, and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The annual report and accounts will be published on the group’s
website. The maintenance and integrity of the group’s website is the
responsibility of the directors. The work carried out by the auditors
does not include consideration of these matters. Legislation in the
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Special business
Resolution 8, which will be proposed as a special resolution,
supplements the directors’ authority to allot shares in the company
given to them by resolution 7 passed at the annual general meeting
of the company held on 29 February 2000. This authority has been
conferred at successive annual general meetings of the company.
Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 requires a company
proposing to allot equity securities for cash to offer them first to
existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. 
If resolution 8 is passed, the requirement imposed by section 89 will
not apply to allotments by the directors in two cases:
1 in connection with a rights (or similar) issue; and
2 allotments of shares for cash up to a total nominal value of
£310,033 (representing 5% of the company’s issued ordinary
share capital at the date of the notice).
The board also confirms its intention that equity securities equivalent
to no more that 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the
company will be allotted for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during
a rolling three-year period, in line with institutional investor guidelines.
This authority will lapse not later than next year’s annual general
meeting except in so far as commitments to allot shares have been
entered into before that date.
Resolution 9, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks
to give authority for the company to purchase its own shares in the
market. The proposed resolution sets out the maximum number of
shares which may be purchased (15% of the company’s issued
ordinary share capital), the maximum and minimum prices which the
company may pay for its shares and the date of expiry of the
authority conferred by this resolution. This authority gives the
company greater flexibility in managing its capital resources.
Your directors would only intend to exercise the authority sought at
the annual general meeting to ensure that the company maintains an
efficient capital structure. The authority will only be exercised when,
in the light of market conditions, your directors believe that the effect
of such purchases would be to increase shareholder value, having
taken into consideration the impact of such purchases on both
earnings and net asset values per share, and that the purchases
would be in the best interests of the company’s shareholders
generally. Any shares purchased under the authority may be
cancelled (and the number of Grainger Trust shares in issue will be
reduced accordingly) or may be held in treasury so as to be available
to be sold at a later date, subject to the restrictions set out in
resolution 8 or its equivalent in force at the time.

Grainger Trust plc 
Directors’ report 27
Grainger Trust plc 
Directors’ report 
The total number of ordinary shares covered by options or warrants
as at 5 January 2004, the latest practicable date prior to publication
of this document, is 273,325, representing 1.1% of the issued
ordinary share capital of the company (1.3% of the issued ordinary
share capital of the company assuming full exercise of the power to
purchase shares contained in resolution 9).
Acquisitions
On 2 December 2002, the company acquired a 100% interest 
in Upminster Holdings Ltd. On 13 December 2002 the company
acquired 100% interests in BPT Peachey Limited, BPT (Peachey 
No 2) Limited, Hamsard 2492 Limited, BPT Bridgewater (Home
Reversions No 1) Limited, BPT Bridgewater (Home Reversions 
No 2) Limited and Hamsard 2342 Limited from its Bromley Property
Holdings Limited Joint Venture. Finally, on 26 September 2003, 
the company acquired the remaining 50% of Bromley Property
Holdings Limited from its Joint Venture partner. Full details of 
these acquisitions are shown in notes 26 and 27 to the financial
statements. 
Creditor payment policy
It is the group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance with their
normal terms and conditions of trading. Payment in respect of the
purchase of property is subject to and will comply with contractual
terms. Trade creditors existing at 30 September 2003 relating to
purchases of property stock generally complete 28 days after
exchange of contracts. Trade creditor days relating to other trade
creditors of the company and group were calculated as 38 days
(2002: 39 days).
Charitable donations
During the year charitable donations were made by the group to 
a number of charitable organisations for a variety of charitable
purposes, amounting to £4,480 (2002: £3,942).
Health and safety
The company seeks to achieve the highest standards in respect 
of health and safety of employees, and the safety of tenants.
Consultants are employed to ensure that the company complies
with health and safety regulations and each year the gas supply and
appliances within all of the group’s relevant residential properties are
independently inspected under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use)
Amended Regulations 1996 and certificates of compliance issued.
A formal Health and Safety policy for employees was introduced
during the year.
Employment of disabled persons
The company gives full and fair consideration to applications for
employment made by disabled persons, having regard to their
particular aptitudes and abilities. In the event of an employee
becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their
employment within the company continues and that appropriate
training is arranged where necessary. It is the policy of the company
that the training, career development and promotion of disabled
persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other
employees.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have expressed their willingness 
to continue in office as auditors to the company. A resolution to
reappoint them as auditors to the company will be proposed at 
the next annual general meeting. 
Issue of own shares
As disclosed in note 20 to the financial statements, the company
issued 18,151 25p ordinary shares during the year for an aggregate
consideration of £71,754.
Post balance sheet event
On 21 November 2003, the company announced the early
redemption of its 2024 quoted debenture stock, of £2.5m. 
There was an associated early redemption cost of £1.8m.
By order of the board
Marie Glanville
Company secretary
16 January 2004 Remuneration committee report
The remuneration committee is responsible for detailed consideration
of the directors’ remuneration packages and makes its
recommendations to the whole board.
The committee comprises Nichola Pease (chairman), John Ward,
John Barnsley and Robert Hiscox all of whom are non-executive
directors. Meetings are held at least twice a year and advice on
various matters has been received from Stern Stewart & Co. The
remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the
board as a whole. No director participates in setting his/her own
remuneration. 
The committee is directly accountable to shareholders. As chairman
of the committee, Nichola Pease will be available at the annual
general meeting to answer questions on all aspects of directors’
remuneration. This report will be put forward for approval and
adoption at that meeting.
Remuneration policy 
The overall objective of the remuneration policy is to attract, retain
and motivate high calibre individuals. Remuneration packages are
designed to be competitive with respect to comparable organisations
and to reward executives for superior performance. Executives
receive salary, benefits, pension contributions and annual and 
long-term incentive awards.
Salaries and benefits
Executive salaries are reviewed annually by the committee to take
account of the experience, responsibilities and performance of
individual directors as well as competitive market practice. Executive
directors and the deputy chairman, Stephen Dickinson, who has
part time executive responsibility for land development, receive the
benefits of a fully expensed company car or car allowance and life
and health insurances.
Service contracts
Rupert Dickinson and Andrew Cunningham have service contracts
with a 24 months’ notice period. Sean Slade’s contract is for 
12 months. The board feels that such contracts are an important
element of the overall employment packages of the executives and
are appropriate to the nature of the group’s business. They provide
both the group and the individual with the security to commit to the
group’s long-term objectives. However, the 24 months’ contracts are
being reduced to 12 months over a period of five years from 
1 October 2002.
Pensions
Executive directors receive defined contributions to money purchase
schemes. These contributions are based solely on a percentage of
salary; benefits in kind and bonus awards are not pensionable.
Contributions paid in the year were:
Pension contributions
2003 2002
£’000 £’000
Rupert Dickinson 30 25
Andrew Cunningham 33 27
Sean Slade (2002: from 20 June 2002) 13 2
76 54
Performance incentives 
The group operates annual and long-term incentive schemes for
directors and senior executives. These schemes are designed so
that a large percentage of overall remuneration is performance-
based and that the interests of executives and shareholders in
promoting the group’s progress are aligned. 
Annual discretionary bonus
The executive directors receive an annual discretionary bonus which
is at the discretion of the remuneration committee. This bonus is
performance related and takes into account the performance of
Grainger and how Grainger has performed relative to the UK
housing market. 
Deferred bonus
As noted in last year’s annual report and accounts, Rupert Dickinson
and Andrew Cunningham became entitled to a deferred bonus in
recognition of their contributions with respect to the investment in
BPT Limited and to the subsequent performance of the company’s
interest in the Joint Venture. Approval for the deferred bonus
scheme was obtained at the extraordinary general meeting of the
company held on 5 March 2002. 
The deferred bonus represents total monetary payments of
£600,000 and £300,000 to Rupert Dickinson and Andrew
Cunningham respectively. The payments are made in the form of
shares, calculated at the rate of 713.19 pence per share being the
average share price from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2001.
Thus, the total number of shares that may be vested are 84,130 
and 42,064.

Grainger Trust plc 
Remuneration committee report 29
Grainger Trust plc 
Remuneration committee report
The awards are divided into two equal tranches, the first of which
vested on 11 December 2003 at which date the mid-market price
per share was £15.75. The second will vest in December 2005 
after the preliminary results announcement for the year ending 
30 September 2005.
The vesting of the remaining awards is dependent upon the
individuals being in the service of the company and not being 
under notice to leave at the relevant vesting date. 
Long-term incentive scheme
The long-term incentive scheme was originally approved by
shareholders in February 1997 and was subsequently amended 
in February 2000 and March 2002. The main objectives of the 
long-term incentive scheme are to link the rewards of the scheme
participants to overall group performance over a sustained period of
time and to facilitate the acquisition of shareholdings in the company
by executives. 
Under the latest scheme (‘2002 scheme’), executives receive
conditional awards of shares and share options up to a maximum 
of 50% and 125% of salary respectively. The awards may be made
annually and will become unconditional provided certain
performance criteria over a three year period are achieved. For the
full award to be made, the Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) must 
be greater than or equal to the upper quartile TSR of a number of
comparator companies. If the TSR equals the median TSR of the
comparators then 40% of the awards will be made; between
median and upper quartile levels, the level will be pro-rated. 
No awards will be made if the TSR is below the median of the
comparators. The comparator companies are determined by the
remuneration committee and the initial selection consists of 14
property companies, chosen on the basis of their market
capitalisation. The comparator companies are currently Benchmark
Group plc, Brixton plc, Capital and Regional plc, CLS Holdings plc,
Daejan Holdings plc, Derwent Valley Holdings plc, Freeport plc,
Great Portland Estates plc, London Merchant Securities plc, Minerva
plc, Pillar Property plc, Quintain Estates and Development plc,
Shaftesbury plc and The Unite Group plc. The executives are also
entitled to matching awards in respect of previous versions of the
long-term incentive scheme. Under these rules, a 1 for 4 matching
award of shares awarded in 2002 under the 1999 scheme will be
made if those shares are held for a three year period. The directors
therefore have the following maximum potential entitlements under
the long-term incentive schemes.

Remuneration committee report
Other schemes
Executive directors also participate in other schemes which are
open to all members of staff, subject to the rules of each individual
scheme. These are as follows:
Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) scheme. Under this scheme participants
enter into a save as you earn contract with the group’s clearing
bankers to provide them with the finance to exercise SAYE options.
The option price is calculated at 80% of the market value of the
shares at the date of issue of invitations to participate. The scheme
rules have received Inland Revenue clearance. SAYE options held
by executive directors are shown in the share option table on 
page 32.
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). The principal features of the plan are:
– partnership shares. From October 2002, all employees are able
to buy shares from pre-tax monthly earnings up to the lower of
£125 per month and 10% of earnings. 
– matching shares. The company is able to give employees up to
two matching shares for each partnership share the employee
buys. Thus the maximum value of matching shares per employee
will amount to £3,000 per annum. 
– free shares. In addition to the above, the company is able to give
up to £3,000 worth of free shares each year to each employee.
Amounts awarded to the executive directors in respect of the
year ended 30 September 2003 are shown in the directors’
remuneration table.
The plan rules have received Inland Revenue clearance and were
approved by the members at an extraordinary general meeting on 
5 March 2002.
Executive Share Option Scheme
Under this scheme, established in 1987, certain executives were
granted share options, exercise of which is conditional upon a
growth in earnings per share in excess of the retail price index over
a period of three consecutive years during the period of the option.
This scheme is now closed and has been replaced by the long-term
incentive scheme.
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is reviewed on a
biennial basis by the whole board. Non-executive directors are not
eligible for any annual or long-term incentives, are not members of
any group pension arrangements and with the exception of Stephen
Dickinson as previously noted, receive no benefits in kind. Each
non-executive director has specific terms of reference.

Grainger Trust plc 
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Grainger Trust plc
Independent auditors’ report to the
members of Grainger Trust plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the
statement of accounting policies, the consolidated profit and loss
account, balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the
statement of group total recognised gains and losses, note of group
historical cost profits and losses and the related notes. We have
also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to
the Companies Act 1985 contained in the remuneration committee
report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for
preparing the remuneration committee report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
auditable part of the remuneration committee report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the auditable part of the remuneration committee report have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information comprises only the chairman’s
statement, the chief executive’s statement, the operating and
financial review, the corporate governance report, the directors’
report and the unaudited part of the remuneration committee report. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover
all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of
the company’s or group’s corporate governance procedures or its
risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of
the remuneration committee report. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors 
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the
remuneration committee report are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and the group at 30 September 2003 and
of the profit and cash flows of the group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the remuneration committee report required by Part
3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Statement of accounting policies
Statement of accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below. 
The policies have been applied consistently in all material respects
throughout the current and the previous year.
Accounting convention 
The group prepares its annual financial statements on the historical
cost basis of accounting, as modified by the revaluation of investment
properties in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
applicable accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation 
The group financial statements comprise the consolidated financial
statements of the company and its subsidiaries. The financial
statements of subsidiary companies are made up to 30 September.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the
consolidated profit and loss account up to, or from, the date control
passes. Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on
consolidation. On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s
assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded
at their provisional fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the difference between
the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the
identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of
subsidiaries prior to 30 September 1998 was written off or credited
immediately against reserves and would be transferred to the profit
and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which
it relates. Goodwill arising subsequent to that date is shown in the
balance sheet under fixed assets. Positive goodwill is amortised
through the profit and loss account over its estimated useful
economic life. Negative goodwill is amortised through the Profit and
Loss Account over the period in which the non-monetary assets are
realised either through depreciation or sale.
The acquisition of the Bromley Joint Venture has been accounted
for in accordance with FRS2 which, in the circumstances of a joint
venture becoming a subsidiary, is inconsistent with the requirements
of paragraph 9 to Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985. This
requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary 
be calculated at the date the undertaking becomes a subsidiary. 
FRS2 paragraph 89 notes that this may result in accounting that is
inconsistent with the way in which the joint venture was previously
treated in the group consolidated financial statements.
FRS2 requires that fair values should be ascribed to earlier
investments, and that goodwill on the joint venture becoming a
subsidiary should be calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising
from each separate investment. For the purposes of establishing
goodwill on the purchase of the first 50% investment in Bromley, 
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities have been taken
from the financial statements of Bromley Property Holdings Limited
following that company’s acquisition of BPT plc. This reflects the
commercial reality of the fair value of the assets and liabilities
acquired by Grainger Trust plc at the time of this investment. Details
of the fair values ascribed to the identifiable assets and liabilities at
the date of Bromley becoming a subsidiary and the impact of
adopting FRS2 over the Companies Act 1985 are included in 
note 27. 
Turnover
Turnover comprises gross sale proceeds of trading properties and
developments, gross rentals and sundry other income, and is
exclusive of VAT. Sales of land and properties are only accounted 
for when the cash proceeds are received in full or the group has
entered into a legally binding undertaking. Gross rentals are
recognised as they fall due.
Joint Venture 
In compliance with FRS9, the group accounts for joint ventures
under the gross equity method. Under this method, the group’s
share of the Joint Venture’s turnover and profits and losses are
separately disclosed in the group’s profit and loss account. The
group’s share of the gross assets and gross liabilities, together with
goodwill, is shown on the face of the balance sheet. The group’s
statement of total recognised gains and losses includes its share 
of the Joint Venture’s total recognised gains and losses.
Repairs and improvements
Repairs are charged in the year they are incurred. Improvement
costs are capitalised. 
Pensions
The company makes contributions to defined contribution schemes
only for all employees. Pension costs are charged in the year to
which they relate.
The Bromley Property Holdings Limited group currently contributes
to two pension schemes. The first is a defined contribution scheme,
implemented during the year and open to all employees. The
contributions are charged to the profit and loss account during the
year. The second is a defined benefit scheme, which was closed to
new members and employee contributions during the year. The
group will continue to contribute so as to spread the cost over the
expected remaining life of the relevant employees. The transitional
disclosure requirements of FRS17, ‘Retirement Benefits’, are given
in note 28 to the financial statements. 35
Grainger Trust plc 
Statement of accounting policies
Tangible fixed assets
The cost of fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any
incremental costs of acquisition. In accordance with SSAP 19, 
(i) investment properties are revalued annually and the aggregate
surplus or temporary deficit is transferred to a revaluation reserve,
and (ii) no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of
freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties
with over 20 years to run. Permanent diminutions in value below
cost are charged in the profit and loss account. The requirement 
of the Companies Act 1985 is to depreciate all properties, but that
requirement conflicts with the generally accepted accounting
principle set out in SSAP 19. The directors consider that to
depreciate such properties would not give a true and fair view, 
as the properties are not held for consumption but for investment,
and that a true and fair view is given by following SSAP 19 as
described above. The effect of depreciation and amortisation on
value is already reflected annually in the valuation of properties, and
the amount attributed to this factor by the valuers cannot reasonably
be separately identified or quantified. Had the provisions of the Act
been followed, net assets would not have been affected but revenue
and profits would have been reduced for this and earlier years.
Full valuations are made by independent professionally qualified
valuers every year. The basis of valuation is explained in note 10. 
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed
assets (excluding investment properties), less their estimated residual
values, over the expected useful economic lives of the assets
concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
% Method
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20 Straight line
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and other investments are included in the
financial statements at cost less provisions for permanent diminution 
of value.
Stocks
Tenanted residential properties are shown in the financial statements
at the lower of cost to the group and net realisable value. Cost to
the group includes legal and surveying charges incurred during
acquisition together with improvement costs. Net realisable value is
the net sale proceeds which the group expects on sale of a property
with vacant possession. 
Development and trading properties are shown in the financial
statements at the lower of cost to the group and net realisable value.
Cost represents the acquisition price together with subsequent
development costs net of amounts transferred to cost of sales. 
Net realisable value is the current market value as advised by the
group’s professional valuers. 
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure
to interest rate movements. The group does not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument
must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable
commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by
converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa. Interest
differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net
interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example
because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument
is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at
that time.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse,
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognised only when, on the basis of all evidence available, it can
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.
Deferred taxation is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued
unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell
the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on the
sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Share schemes
The group operates a long-term incentive plan and a deferred bonus
scheme. Shares in the company are held for these purposes by 
The Grainger Trust Employee Trustee Limited, the assets, income
and costs of which have been included in these financial statements. 36

Difference between tax and accounting profit on disposals (0.2) (1.7)
Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2.1 –
Total current tax 20.7 19.0
Factors that may affect future tax charges
No provisions for deferred tax have been made on gains which would become payable if the group’s investment properties were sold at their
year end values. The estimate of unprovided deferred tax is £16.5m (2002: £1.5m).
FRS19 prohibits the making of provisions for contingent tax liabilities on the fair value of properties on the acquisition of companies. It had
previously been industry practice to make partial provision for such liabilities as part of our fair value exercise on acquisition. Thus there is a
greater tax charge on property sales where there is no brought forward contingent tax provision available to be utilised in its reduction. 
The total contingent tax to the group on the difference between original cost and carrying value of trading properties not provided at 
30 September 2003 is £91.8m (2002: £42.0m).

Group investment properties were revalued at their market value at 30 September 2003 by Jones Lang LaSalle, Chartered Surveyors,

In addition, the group made full provision of £6.8m for the fair value of the financial instruments of Bromley at the date of acquisition 
(see note 19).
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are only recognised when the position matures or terminates.

These purchases have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
Details of the acquisition of Bromley Property Holdings Limited are shown separately in note 27. 
The contingent deferred consideration of £10.0m has been recognised because the directors believe the relevant criteria will be met. 
The £10.0m is calculated by reference to the percentage increase in the non-seasonally adjusted Nationwide House Price Index which the
figure published in respect of August 2004 represents over the figure representing August 2002. If the increase amounts to 10%, the sum 
of £5.0m will be payable, rising by £0.1m for every 0.1% additional increase to a maximum of £10.0m when the increase amounts to 15% 
or more. This consideration is payable on or before 17 December 2004.

purchased properties valued at £4.5m. 56

The fair value of the properties at the date of acquisition was prepared internally on a market value basis and reviewed by Allsop & Co., as
stated in note 10. The other fair value adjustments reflect provisions for deficits on retirement schemes and the mark to market adjustment
for Bromley’s debt, together with associated provisions for deferred taxation.

A 50% adjustment has been made to the fair value of net assets used in the goodwill analysis above to reflect the proportion of ownership 
of these assets as part of the Joint Venture prior to Bromley becoming a subsidiary.
The post acquisition cash flows and results of Bromley are not considered material by the directors and therefore have not been disclosed
separately in the profit and loss account or cash flow statement.

28 Pension schemes
Grainger Trust plc operates defined contribution pension schemes for its employees. The assets of the schemes are held separately from
those of the group in independently administered funds. Pension arrangements for executive directors are disclosed in the remuneration
committee report. The pension cost charge in these financial statements represents contributions payable by the group (see note 6).
BPT Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bromley, currently contributes to two pension schemes. The first is a defined contribution
scheme, implemented during the year and open to all employees. The contributions are charged to the profit and loss account during the
year. The second is a defined benefit scheme, which was closed to new members and employee contributions during the year. The group
will continue to contribute so as to spread the cost over the expected remaining lives of the relevant employees.
Defined benefit scheme
The assets of the defined benefit scheme are held separately from those of the group in funds administered by trustees and are invested
with an independent investment manager. Costs and funding are assessed with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the
projected unit method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years and the last full actuarial valuation using the projected unit method was undertaken as
at 1 July 2001. Based on actuarial assumptions of an investment return of 7.5% per annum and salary increases of 6% per annum, the
assets were valued at £9.0m. These were held in a relevant insurance contract. These assets represented 85% of the value of the scheme’s
accrued liabilities. The deficiency is being met over the expected working lifetimes of the members. The pension cost in the Joint Venture for
the year ended 30 September 2003 was £0.4m (2002: £0.6m).
The actuary also undertook a Minimum Funding Requirement valuation as at 1 July 2001 in accordance with the Pensions Act 1995. The
value of the assets of the scheme was determined at 95% of the liabilities of the scheme.
FRS17 transitional disclosures
The FRS17 calculations for disclosure purposes have been based on a valuation at 1 August 2003 adjusted to 30 September 2003 by a
qualified independent actuary. The major assumptions used by the actuary were:
Discount rate 5.30% pa
Rate of increase in salaries 3.70% pa
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 5.00% pa
Inflation assumption 2.70% pa
The assets are invested in a with-profits deposit administration insurance policy with AXA Sun Life. The fund value of the assets of the
scheme was £10.5m as at 30 September 2003.
The expected rate of return on the assets was 6.3% as at 30 September 2003.
The following approximate amounts were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS17:
30 September
2003
£m
Total market value of assets 10.5
Present value of scheme liabilities (14.2)
Deficit in the scheme (3.7)
Related deferred tax assets 1.1
Net pension liability (2.6) 58
Grainger Trust plc 
Notes to the financial statements
28 Pension schemes (continued)
If these amounts had been recognised as part of the net assets of Bromley, the adjustment to the pension liability of £2.6m would have been
reflected in the net assets acquired as at 26 September 2003. The adjustment to pensions balances to reflect the adoption of FRS17 would
be to goodwill, with nil net impact on net assets and the profit and loss reserve. Consequently, the disclosure requirements of FRS17 with
respect to the impact of the above net pension liability measured in accordance with FRS17 have not been presented.
The following amounts would have been recognised in the performance statements of the Joint Venture in the year to 30 September 2003
under the requirements of FRS17:
£m

MITIE Entrepreneurs
We have never lost sight of 
our entrepreneurial culture
At MITIE, entrepreneurialism has always been at the heart 
of our organisation. MITIE stands for Management Incentive 
Through Investment Equity. Since we started 25 years ago, 
we’ve been partnering with entrepreneurs to grow businesses and 
we’re as passionate about this today as we were when we started.  MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Overview Business review Governance Accounts
The ‘MITIE Model’ is for entrepreneurial 
management teams who have an idea 
for growing a business as a part of MITIE. 
It’s structured so that the management 
team takes an equity stake of up to 49% 
in a business which they grow over a 
ﬁve to ten year period, and is eventually 
acquired by MITIE in full.
MITIE has supported over 100 start-up 
businesses to grow using the MITIE 
Model, with a 95% success rate. It has 
shaped our entrepreneurial culture, 
supported our excellent track record 
of growth, and provided the basis 
for hundreds of people to develop 
successful careers in outsourcing.
In 201 1 we launched a £10m fund to 
encourage more entrepreneurs to join 
us. We have spent nearly half of that 
fund and have plans to launch another 
one soon. We’re looking to start 
businesses that expand the range of 
services we offer to our existing clients, 
or that will lead us into new markets. 
Our range of services is incredibly broad 
and we’re open to all ideas that ﬁt with 
MITIE’s strategy and have the potential 
to attract a growing client base.
We are always looking to enter rapidly 
growing markets that have huge 
potential for outsourcers to provide 
new and innovative solutions.

Chairman’s statement
Overview
Our strategy to focus on organic growth 
and develop our integrated facilities 
and energy management capabilities 
is progressing exceptionally well. 
This is a reﬂection of the signiﬁcant and 
continuous investments we have made 
in key sectors over the last few years. 
During the year we saw the award of 
a number of transformational contracts 
which have enhanced our business. 
Our energy capability is now a core 
part of our client proposition and we 
are the second largest energy services 
company in the UK. 
This has resulted in strong organic 
revenue and operating proﬁt growth 
during the year. More importantly, 
we are well placed to deliver further 
organic growth in these key areas 
going forward, as is evident in both our 
record order book and large pipeline 
of sales opportunities. 
We have also made a number of 
niche acquisitions which will help us 
to enter new and specialist markets. 
Utilyx provides a specialist energy 
and carbon consultancy and Direct 
Enquiries is the UK’s leading access 
and disability consultancy. True to 
our entrepreneurial roots, we continue 
to use the original MITIE Model to 
start and grow innovative businesses 
and it remains a key differentiator for 
the group. 
These developments leave us in a 
strong position as we enter the new 
ﬁnancial year.
A transformational year… 
and strong organic growth
This has been a transformational 25th year for MITIE, 
with excellent progress on all of our key strategic objectives, 
and sector-leading organic growth.

Results
During the year, revenues grew by 
5.9% to £2,002.5m (201 1 : £1,891.4m). 
Operating proﬁt before other items* 
increased by 7 .2% to £1 1 1.7m (201 1 : 
£104.2m excluding the pension credit 
of £4.1m), reﬂecting a margin* of 5.6% 
(201 1 : 5.5%). Proﬁt before tax increased 
by 8.9% to £94.5m (201 1 : £86.8m). 
Basic earnings per share increased by 
10.2% to 20.5p (201 1 : 18.6p) and earnings 
per share before other items remained 
ﬂat at 22.6p (201 1 : 22.6p). 
We have retained our strong focus 
on cash, reporting cash inﬂows from 
operations of £1 10.2m (201 1 : £102.5m) 
for the year, which represents 
excellent conversion of EBITDA to cash 
of 83.7% (201 1 : 86.7%). The balance 
sheet remains extremely robust with 
net debt at the year end at 0.81x 
EBITDA at £106.9m (201 1 : £7 6.5m).
We have committed bank facilities 
of £250m until September 2015 along 
with £100.2m equivalent of US Private 
Placement debt. Both of these facilities 
leave us in a strong position to take 
advantage of value-creating 
acquisition opportunities as they arise. 
We have seen strong growth in our 
order book, which increased by 26% 
during the year and now stands at 
a record £8.6bn (201 1 : £6.8bn). 
Our sales pipeline currently stands 
at £1 1.2bn (201 1 : £1 1.4bn) and 
our forward revenue visibility is 
excellent, with contracted revenue 
for the year ending 31 March 2013 
at 83% of budgeted revenue 
(prior year: 81%).
Dividend
It is now the Board’s policy to grow 
the dividend broadly in line with the 
underlying earnings of the group. 
The ﬁnal dividend proposed by the 
Board has increased by 6.1% to 5.2p per 
share (201 1 : 4.9p per share). This brings 
the full year dividend to 9 .6p per share 
(201 1 : 9 .0p per share), an increase of 
6.7%. The dividend cover is 2.4 times 
adjusted earnings per share.
Subject to shareholder approval 
at the Annual General Meeting, the 
dividend will be paid on 7 August 2012 
to shareholders on the register at 
22 June 2012.
Board and corporate 
governance
Corporate governance remains an 
important and committed area of 
focus for the Board. The priorities in 2012 
were the continued execution of our 
growth strategy, the ongoing review 
of performance and risk and the 
composition of the Board. We also 
focused on the senior talent pipeline, 
which will ensure we have the skills, 
experience and diversity to deliver our 
ambitious plans. This strong culture of 
governance is explained further in our 
Corporate Governance Statement. 
Ian Stewart retired as a Non-Executive 
Director and Deputy Chairman 
on 21 May 2012. In 1987 , Ian co-founded 
MITIE with David Telling. Throughout 
those 25 years, Ian has been instrumental 
in building and growing the business 
that MITIE is today. We thank him for 
his invaluable contribution to the Board 
and the Company, and wish him well 
for the future.
People
We would like to extend a huge thank 
you to all of our people and welcome 
those who joined us during the year. 
We are one of the UK’s largest private 
sector employers with 63,569 people 
and remain focused on providing 
opportunities for all of our people 
to succeed in their careers.
Outlook
MITIE is very well positioned to 
capitalise on the momentum in 
growth we have seen over the past 
year. There are exciting opportunities 
in our markets as organisations 
look for greater operating and 
energy efficiencies. We have strong 
relationships with our diverse, high-
quality client base in both the public 
and private sectors and we are 
committed to continually providing 
them with better quality services, 
innovation and efficiencies. 
Our focus remains on achieving 
organic growth in our primary 
market of the UK, supplemented 
by selective acquisitions and the 
development of our integrated 
business model overseas. We will 
continue to invest in our people, 
technology and new markets, all of 
which differentiate us as a business. 
Financially robust, we have a 
clear strategy for the development 
of our business, supported by a record 
order book and buoyant sales pipeline. 
We are conﬁdent that we will continue 
to build on what is an exceptional 
track record.

Chief Executive’s strategy overview
What drives MITIE’s success, 
year after year?
I don’t think of MITIE as 25 years old, but 
as a young dynamic company. We are 
still keen on breaking barriers, pushing 
against ‘no can do’ attitudes and are 
as enthused and energised as ever by 
the opportunities around us. We are 
driven by the same thing now as we 
were at the very beginning – a passion 
for the innovative thinking that can help 
clients to get where they want to be, 
quickly and cost-efficiently. 
By taking on those services which are 
not core to our clients’ operations, 
we improve standards and save them 
money, giving our clients more choices 
over how to spend their budgets. 
Getting the speciﬁcation and agreed 
service levels absolutely right are the 
keys to a successful contract. Our skill 
base lies in mobilising teams and 
transferring people from the client’s 
organisation to ours, no matter how 
large or small the contract. We also 
deliver what we say we’ll deliver, 
precisely when we say we’ll deliver it. 
To some extent, we can do this by 
drawing on experience and know-
how developed over the last quarter-
century. However, our success is also 
down to continually investing in 
innovative IT solutions that transform 
the notion of customer service.
Whether we are delivering integrated 
facilities management or any of our 
specialist single services, clients 
appreciate what we do and come 
back for more – which is why we’ve 
grown every year since 1987 .

Each of our clients is at a

as and when they change.

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
Are your markets changing, 
and if so how?
Our markets are changing at the fastest 
rate we have seen in over two decades.
As the graphic on the previous page 
illustrates, there has been a general 
shift in outsourcing, from the time in 
the 1980s when most services were 
carried out by in-house teams to the 
early years of this century which saw 
a rise in bundled services, integrated 
facilities management (FM) and 
strategic outsourcing. 
What is new is the pace of change. 
Our clients’ business models are 
changing, and they are changing fast. 
Clients have always wanted more for 
less, but now they want a lot more for a 
lot less, driven by pressures to transform 
their infrastructure, reduce their energy 
consumption and save money at the 
same time. Many clients do not want 
to be concerned with delivering 
services beyond their core businesses, 
so this is creating increased 
opportunities for us, particularly with 
large organisations. Equally, many of 
our clients still rely on us for our specialist 
single services and we remain 
focused on helping all our clients, 
whatever their needs.
The New contract summary on page 25 
shows how these opportunities have 
translated into contracts during the 
year, a number of which are particularly 
signiﬁcant in terms of the scope and 
scale of services they offer. 
In April this year we signed a £775m, 
ﬁve year contract to deliver integrated 
facilities and energy management for 
Lloyds Banking Group (LBG). The LBG 
estate encompasses over 3,000 
buildings and as part of the contract 
we will welcome an extra 3,000 people 
to the MITIE team. Our relationship with 
LBG began as a single service cleaning 
contract in 1987 when we ﬁrst started, 
so this is a ﬁne example of how a good 
working relationship can blossom into a 
great and much more extensive one.
In addition, the year saw a successful 
rebid with the Cumbrian Collaboration, 
with the new expanded contract to 
provide integrated FM and energy 
services valued at over £200m over 
ﬁve years. Our new contract with 
Diageo is another example of how 
a single service contract can grow into 
an expanded deal that could be worth 
over four times the original amount. 
In the public sector, we were proud 
to secure some similarly signiﬁcant 
contracts in the last 12 months. 
In January, we entered into a new 
partnership agreement with the Prison 
Service to bid for the management 
of nine prisons. It’s an agreement that 
signals a new approach to competition 
for the Prison Service and will harness 
the expertise and experience of both 
organisations to compete for and 
manage 15-year prison contracts. 
During the year, we were appointed 
to the Ministry of Justice’s (MoJ) Total 
Facilities Management Framework 
and subsequently awarded two major 
contracts: for Her Majesty’s Courts and 
Tribunal Service in the South of England; 
and for Brixton and Isis prisons. 
The total value will be £200m-£455m 
over ﬁve to seven years. Furthermore, 
we formed a ten year partnership 
with Essex County Council to service 
over 350 sites, with a total value of up 
to £100m. 
In energy services, which provides some 
34% of our revenues, among several 
other important projects we were 
appointed to deliver a landmark £35m 
energy centre in Scotland. More than 
1,200 homes in Fife will receive all their 
heat and hot water from a new energy 
centre powered by MITIE enterprise 
and 38,000 tonnes of waste wood.
Following our appointment to the NHS 
Carbon and Energy Fund, which will 
enable NHS Trusts to upgrade their 
energy infrastructure and save energy, 
we have been appointed preferred 
bidder to develop a new energy 
centre at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in 
Cambridge. The innovative centre 
will save £4.6m in annual energy costs, 
which is equivalent to hiring 21 7 extra 
nurses each year. It will also save almost 
30,000 tonnes of CO2 each year and 
help the Cambridge NHS Trust to surpass 
their sustainability targets.
However, this doesn’t mean we are 
focused only on new or large clients. 
Every contract is important to us, 
none more so than repeat business 
from existing clients. We value our 
smaller clients enormously, many 
of whom are at an early stage in 
the journey towards large-scale 
outsourcing – and we are the perfect 
partners to help them take the next 
steps in line with their chosen strategies.

Chief Executive’s strategy overview
 
Does this mean you’re 
changing strategy?
Although the size of contracts have 
changed, the fundamentals of our 
strategy remain the same – to provide 
value for all our stakeholders through a 
focus on sustainable, proﬁtable growth. 
As the graphic explains, we continue 
to focus on clients, people, risk, 
responsibility, new markets, operational 
excellence and acquisitions.
However, it’s fair to say that as 
markets and opportunities evolve we 
will ﬁne-tune the strategy to meet new 
challenges as they arise. Energy services 
will be a strong focus for us in the years 
ahead and international opportunities 
will also continue to be central to our 
plans. We go wherever our clients need 
us to go, and in more and more 
instances they are asking us to provide 
the same high quality services overseas 
that they already access in the UK.
In terms of acquisitions, we purchased 
two companies during the year: 
Utilyx, the leading energy and 
carbon specialists; and Direct Enquiries, 
the UK’s leading access and disability 
consultants. Both acquisitions bring 
great expertise into MITIE and we 
were delighted to welcome all the 
people into MITIE.
How can a company as large as 
MITIE still be entrepreneurial?
MITIE stands for Management Incentive 
Through Investment Equity and the spirit 
of entrepreneurialism has always been 
at the heart of our organisation. 
Of course, that’s a lot easier for a 
company with a few dozen employees 
than it is for one the size we are today, 
but we’re still as passionate about 
entrepreneurialism as we were on day 
one. Over the years, we’ve supported 
over 100 start-up businesses to grow 
using the MITIE Model, which helps 
talented management teams turn 
ideas into reality. Start-ups keep you 
young, fresh and innovative, and the 
teams have huge amounts of energy. 
It’s structured so that the management 
team takes an equity stake of up to 49% 
in a business which they grow over a ﬁve 
to ten year period before being 
acquired by MITIE in full. 
In 201 1, we launched a £10m fund 
to encourage more entrepreneurs 
to start-up businesses and during 
201 1 we invested nearly half of that 
money. In order to encourage another 
group of entrepreneurs to come to us 
with ideas, in May 2012 we hosted a 
‘Dragons’ Den’ style event where 
entrepreneurs pitched their ideas to a 
panel of expert judges. The entrepreneur 
with the best pitch on the day secured 
an investment to start a business. 
As always, we look to start businesses 
that expand the range of services we 
offer to our clients, or that will lead us 
into new markets. Our entrepreneurial 
model is one of the best ways to do this, 
as well as being core to our culture.

Our strategy
A strategy to deliver stakeholder

lies at the heart of our business. 
The strategy has worked well and 
is largely unchanged, although 
each year the areas of focus 
can change.

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
How do you motivate over 
63,000 people?
As we grow as a business, we are 
dedicated to creating an environment 
in which each and every individual 
can ﬂourish – recognising and rewarding 
performance, nurturing talent and 
providing career opportunities. 
We understand what makes people 
tick and we know how important it is 
that they feel valued. Equity participation 
has always been at the heart of our 
business and is in place to varying 
degrees across the organisation – 
share schemes certainly promote 
loyalty because they align people 
with the objectives of the business. 
During the year we launched a new 
voluntary all-employee share plan, 
which will run alongside the existing 
Save as You Earn Scheme we currently 
offer. This gives everyone another 
chance to invest in our company and 
save for their future. We also continue 
to grow and enhance MITIE Rewards, 
a fantastic beneﬁts scheme for all our 
people that is a gateway to making 
savings and gaining discounts at over 
2,500 retailers.
We know what capabilities we need 
to grow our business and are very 
focused on spotting and developing 
the potential talent we have within our 
organisation. We have a very clear view 
of our talent pipeline for key roles across 
the business and have put processes in 
place to ensure our key talent is in the 
right place at the right time.
We’ve always prided ourselves on 
being different and one step ahead 
in the way we communicate with our 
people. Social media frightens some 
organisations but we embrace it 
wholeheartedly – Facebook and 
Twitter are how our people choose to 
communicate. So it makes absolute 
sense for us to communicate with them 
via these channels. The use of social 
media is just one of the things that strike 
people when they join MITIE, especially 
if they’ve transferred in from another 
organisation. It is also one of the many 
reasons we are an employer of choice 
for Generation Y. If you tweet, please 
join in at #25mitie!
This year we have continued to grow 
our use of social media to strengthen 
our brand and connect with customers, 
our people and other stakeholders. 
We have introduced a new Facebook 
page aimed at our people and have 
seen our followers triple on Twitter. 
Along with our You Tube channel which 
has featured our MITIE’s Got Talent and 
Stars competitions along with a range 
of corporate videos, our social media 
channels have helped us to break 
down communication barriers allowing 
us to communicate, engage and build 
relationships with people across the 
industries we work in and we can only 
see them becoming more and more 
important. We are also using an 
enterprise social network which is 
allowing our sales teams to work smarter 
and collaborate across the country. 
On the subject of people, one of the 
most important things for any business 
to succeed is to have inspirational 
leaders. For people to develop and 
succeed in their careers, they need 
mentors who will support and believe 
in them. Ian Stewart has stepped 
down from the Board after 25 years 
of dedicated service to MITIE. For me 
personally, the support, encouragement 
and advice I have had from Ian 
throughout my time at MITIE has been 
invaluable. I would like to thank him for 
being an inspiration and mentor to me 
and so many others. His is a shining 
example of leadership. 
Ian Stewart retirement

An environment where 
hard work is rewarded
‘MITIE Rewards’ is open to all 
our people and is one of the 
many ways they are rewarded. 
It’s a gateway to making 
savings and gaining discounts 
at over 2,500 retailers across 
the UK. From chain stores and 
niche retailers, to everyday 
expenses like mobile phone 
and utility bills, the savings 
potential is endless. MITIE Group PLC

Chief Executive’s strategy overview
How do technology and 
innovation play a part at MITIE?
Technology and innovation are real 
points of difference for us. We have 
made signiﬁcant investments in 
innovative IT solutions that transform 
the notion of customer service and 
are fundamental to our ability to 
deliver the most efficient services. 
In particular, MiWorld, our web based 
management information platform, 
gives clients ‘live’ visibility over exactly 
what we’re doing for them, when and 
how well. MiWorld presents an overview 
of the client’s portfolio in one centralised 
location, whether that’s a PC, laptop or 
tablet, it helps them identify asset and 
facility performance issues which can be 
acted upon to improve efficiencies and 
reduce costs. MiWorld helps to support 
our clients’ strategies, by combining 
the FM service costs with their property 
related expenditure such as utility 
expenditure and leases, and presenting 
the total costs of occupancy across their 
entire portfolios, which can be used 
to benchmark performance.
Our use of PDAs (personal digital 
assistants) across the majority of our 
contracts has enabled us to introduce 
vastly different working practices. 
PDAs help us to schedule our mobile 
workforce much more efficiently, 
making sure our people are always 
focusing on doing what they do best – 
delivering great service. 
To date, we’ve invested signiﬁcantly 
in MiWorld, PDAs and other service 
enhancing technologies. During 2012 
that will increase further, and there is 
a lot more to come in future years too. 
We have also recently launched 
Operation Exodus which aims to re-
engineer all of our processes to 
make them electronic over the next 
two years. Delivering an efficient and 
cost effective operation to our clients 
is a top priority . Using the beneﬁts 
of technology , we want to make all of 
our processes simpler and more efficient 
for our people, our customers and our 
supply chain. 
Working more collaboratively with our 
suppliers is also really important when 
it comes to innovation. In many cases 
we work in close consultation with our 
suppliers, involving them in our process 
to create tailored solutions for our clients. 
Our suppliers are also using us to test 
new and pioneering products that they 
are bringing to the market, for example 
through our supplier innovation days. 
In partnership with our supply chain, 
we can offer our clients even more 
forward-thinking solutions.
In what direction do you 
see outsourcing going – 
and how is MITIE placed 
to meet the challenge?
In a business climate like we have 
today, it’s not easy to predict market 
trends. But one thing is crystal clear – 
we’re going to see a lot more about 
‘intelligent’ outsourcing. Of course, 
service delivery remains an absolute 
essential, and self-delivery across a 
broad platform creates advantages 
in terms of integration and added 
value, not only in price but also 
in service quality. But we see the 
future lying in assembling data and 
understanding how the separate 
strands of corporate real estate 
functions interact. 
Until now, this is an area that has not 
been exploited – but there are new 
‘linkages’ emerging on many levels... 
between FM costs and energy 
provision, for example, as well as 
between projects and FM, energy 
and projects, agile working regimes 
and property costs (such as leases, 
rates and valuations), and between 
all these elements of real estate cost 
and the increasing economic and 
legislative demands. 
How can we exploit this situation for our 
clients? By developing new models for 
outsourcing that are based on synergies 
between cost centres and a new, deep 
understanding of the effect that each 
one has on all the others. This approach 
will be built on the intelligent 
aggregation of data and real 
knowledge of Total Operating Costs, 
and will be driven by new technologies.
We’re well placed to assist clients 
with such an exciting development. 
We already have extensive service 
delivery capability – and we’re investing 
in skills and technology to expand this 
even further. As always, the thing that 
will set us apart is our ability to create 
opportunity for our clients in different 
and often ground-breaking ways.
And what about the next 
few years?
The world is a very different place 
today compared to how it was in 1987 . 
Our markets and clients are evolving 
at an unprecedented speed, and this 
is changing both the nature and the 
scale of the opportunities we face.
The last 12 months have seen the 
award of a number of contracts 
that are transforming our business. 
This success is an endorsement of 
our strategy to invest in our integrated 
facilities and energy management 
capabilities, which will underpin the 
continued growth of our business.
Our sales pipeline is strong and our 
order book stands at record levels. 
We are optimistic about the 
opportunities for growth, but recognise 
the wider uncertainties in the global 
economy and in some of our more 
cyclical markets. As governments 
and businesses seek cost and energy 
efficiencies, our track record for service 
delivery, innovation and efficiency 
will continue to differentiate us.
Times change but quality endures. 
Looking ahead, I am conﬁdent 
that the track record of sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth that we have 
maintained for 25 years will continue. 
We are more passionate and excited 
about the future than we have 
ever been.

Non-ﬁnancial key performance indicators
Monitoring  
and managing 
performance
We look at a range of indicators 
to assess our performance 
against our stated strategy. 
These include KPIs that are 
aligned to each of the elements 
of our strategy, as well as the 
ﬁnancial indicators that we as 
a business are focused on. Description:
In order to achieve sustainable, proﬁtable growth, 
we monitor the percentage of existing contracts 
retained in our Facilities Management division on 
a rolling 12-month basis.
Target:
Achieve contract retention rates in excess of 90%.
Comment:
Our contract retention rate in our Facilities 
Management division stands at a record 94.0%
Description:
As a substantial portion of our revenue was historically 
generated through single service contracts, one of 
our opportunities for growth is through expanding 
our relationships with existing clients by providing 
other services. We have seen a trend in the markets 
towards multi-service and FM contracts over the past 
few years and we are well positioned to meet the 
demands of this trend due to our broad range of 
services. We measure the percentage of revenue that 
is generated by these types of contracts in order to 
measure how well we are performing in this arena.
Comment:
59% of revenues are now attributable to multi-service 
and integrated FM contracts

Description:
Reportable accidents are deﬁned as fatalities, major 
injuries and injuries resulting in absence from work of 
over three days. Our people are our greatest asset. 
Providing them with a safe environment in which to 
work is of paramount importance to us, so we use a 
KPI for reportable accidents to assess our performance.
Objective:
Retain focus on reducing the risk of accidents in 
our business.
Comment:
Reportable accidents were 3.4 per 1,000 employees 
during the year.
Description:
Emissions are calculated using the Defra guidance on 
how to measure and report GHG emissions and apply 
the 2010 guidelines for company reporting. Last year’s 
total CO2 emissions have been recalculated using 
CO2e for Scope 1 (direct emissions, gas and transport) 
and Scope 2 (indirect energy, purchased electricity) 
but excludes landlord managed energy and 
expensed business fuel (part of Scope 3). We have 
also restated the 2010 data to allow for changes to the 
property portfolio and acquisitions. The rate of CO2e 
emissions per MITIE employee is calculated using the 
average number of people employed during the year. 
Objective:
Understand and minimise the environmental impact 
of our operations.
Comment:
Emissions per employee are lower than the prior year.
Description: 
Sustainability will be an increasingly competitive 
advantage for us going forward as our clients look 
to us to help them improve their performance and 
reduce their costs.
Target: 
Energy services related revenue in excess of 30% 
each year.
Comment: 
Energy services accounted for 34% of revenues 
during the year.

Description:
We are focused on long-term recurring revenue 
streams. At the start of each ﬁnancial year, 
we calculate the percentage of our budgeted 
revenues that are already contracted.
Comment:
At the start of the ﬁnancial year 2013, 83% of budgeted 
revenues were secured, our highest level ever and a 
reﬂection of the impact of our success in contract bids 
in 2012. 
Description:
Our forward order book shows the total value of 
future revenues secured by contractual agreements 
and it is a key part of our focus on building long-term 
recurring revenues.
Target:
We aim to grow our order book at least in line with 
revenue growth. 
Comment:
Our order book grew by 26% during the year to a 
record level of £8.6bn.
Description:
MITIE is a people business and we pride ourselves 
in creating and nurturing outstanding managers. 
Monitoring how successful we are in retaining our 
people is an important measure for us.
Target:
Enhance focus on the development and retention 
of management to maintain a retention rate of 
over 80%.
Comment:
Our management retention rate was 82.5% for  
the year.
All of our divisions are focused on operating more 
efficiently, and use many different measures to 
assess performance.
From a group perspective, the best way to assess 
our productivity is our group operating proﬁt margin, 
which is also one of our key ﬁnancial performance 
indicators and found on the following page.
This year we invested £16.6m in the acquisitions of 
Utilyx and Direct Enquiries, and £14.6m in minority 
interest acquisitions in ﬁve companies under the 
MITIE Model.
Our strong cash ﬂows, committed ﬁnancing facilities 
and strong balance sheet have ensured that these 
investments can be made against a backdrop of 
limited gearing, with net debt to EBITDA at 31 March 
2012 at 0.81.
Description:
We see increasing opportunities in international 
markets as our clients look to expand procurement 
and we beneﬁt from diversifying our revenue base.
Target:
Increase our proportion of international revenues.
Comment:
Our international revenues were 2.4% of the total 
group revenue.

Comment:
We have maintained our margin within the target 
range, at 5.6%.
* other items are restructuring and acquisition related items

Description:
Our strength lies in the management of people and 
in the provision of suitable assets to support their work, 
but our business is not capital intensive. We continue 
to monitor and control capital expenditure, and target 
growth and acquisitions in areas that do not require 
substantial capital expenditure.
Target range:
Maintain below 2.0% of revenue.
Comment:
Capital expenditure was 1.3% of revenue.
Description:
It is now the Board’s policy to grow the dividend 
broadly in line with the underlying earnings of the 
group. The ﬁnal dividend proposed by the Board has 
increased by 6.1% to 5.2p per share (201 1: 4.9p per 
share). This brings the full year dividend to 9 .6p per 
share (201 1: 9 .0p per share), an increase of 6.7%. 
The dividend cover is 2.4 times adjusted earnings 
per share.
Target range:
Broadly in line with underlying earnings growth.
Comment:
Our dividend growth for the year was 6.7%, broadly 
in line with underlying earnings growth.
Description:
The efficiency with which we manage the generation 
of cash is an important indicator for our business. 
MITIE is built on a sound understanding of the 
importance of cash and working capital management 
and that ethos remains critical to our business. 
The conversion of earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to cash is 
one of the signiﬁcant cash ﬂow indicators for MITIE.
Target range:
Over 80.0% of EBITDA converted to cash.
Comment:
We have achieved our target this year with 83.7% 
of EBITDA being converted to cash.

Overview of services provided
Under the new contract MITIE will 
employ more than 500 people 
to service over 350 sites including 
Essex County Hall, offices, libraries, 
community centres and depots across 
145,000 square metres. MITIE’s 
integrated delivery model will provide 
a wide range of services across the 
Council’s portfolio including: 
maintenance, cleaning, security, 
catering, waste management 
and mail and distribution services. 
A partnership model
Essex County Council awarded MITIE 
the contract because of its strategic, 
efficient and sustainable service 
model that will deliver signiﬁcant 
savings compared to its historic cost 
of service delivery. MITIE’s technology 
platform, MiWorld, will provide the 
Council with a business intelligence 
solution that integrates their 
management information across the 
estate. MITIE’s sustainable solution also 
includes guaranteed reductions in 
energy consumption within three years. 
MITIE is fully committed to investing in 
the development of Essex by employing 
apprentices and ensuring at least 25% 
of sub-contracted work is placed with 
local SMEs.
Essex County Council
In December, MITIE signed a ten year 
contract with Essex County Council, to deliver 
transformational outsourcing services which 
include facilities, property and energy 
management. MITIE will be working in 
partnership with Lambert Smith Hampton to 
provide estate management services to the 
Council including strategic asset management 
and new ways of working that deliver 
sustainable improvements for Essex.

A tailored mix 
of specialist 
services that  
is just the tonic 
for Diageo
Overview of services provided
MITIE’s integrated facilities management 
services will be delivered at over 
70 sites across the UK and Ireland 
including all Diageo’s manufacturing, 
packaging and distillery sites, and its 
global headquarters in London. The FM 
services include: cleaning, catering, 
security, front of house, reception, 
porterage, and mechanical and 
electrical engineering maintenance.
A shift in strategy
MITIE has been providing integrated 
FM to Diageo’s Irish operations since 
it acquired Dalkia FM in Ireland in 
June 2010. Diageo recently conducted 
a strategic review and decided to 
move to a fully integrated, self-delivered 
outsourcing model across the UK 
and Ireland. Following this review, 
Diageo awarded MITIE this 
transformational contract because 
of MITIE’s international coverage, 
technology platform and energy 
services capabilities, all of which have 
been tailored to ﬁt Diageo’s unique 
requirements.
We will continue to work closely 
with Diageo to explore the potential 
opportunities in Europe, in addition 
to these two important territories.
Diageo
In September, we were awarded a contract 
with the world’s leading premium drinks 
business, Diageo. MITIE will work with Diageo 
to provide integrated facilities management 
and hospitality services throughout its entire 
UK and Irish property portfolio.

Marketplace overview
Private sector
As companies continue to seek cost 
reductions in order to compete in tough 
market conditions, they are focusing 
on the further outsourcing of non-core 
services. Increased demand is 
being driven by integrated Facilities 
Management (FM) and energy services.
Our organic growth is based on excellent 
client relationships. We have worked 
alongside many of our clients for a number 
of years, building trust and mutual respect 
that has translated into increased 
business. There are many opportunities 
for us to repeat the growth achieved 
with existing clients such as Rolls-Royce, 
V odafone and Diageo while also exploring 
the potential of new relationships.
We see signiﬁcant integrated FM 
opportunities in the ﬁnancial services 
and retail sectors, and were pleased 
to see potential become reality with 
our appointment to service a £775m 
transformational contract for Lloyds 
Banking Group. 
The majority of ﬁnancial and retail 
sector clients operate with single-service 
contracts and we anticipate that the 
next phase of outsourcing is likely to see 
a shift towards integrated property and 
energy management. 
Public sector
The public sector remains under 
pressure, with central government and 
local authorities in the UK streamlining 
their cost bases in a trend that is 
likely to continue for the foreseeable 
future – and this is creating signiﬁcant 
opportunities for outsourcing. The UK 
Government’s 201 1 Parliamentary 
White Paper on Open Public Services 
made clear that there remains a strong 
political will to introduce greater 
competition and reform into more 
areas of public services. 
We remain predominantly focused 
on the justice, social housing, education 
and health sectors.
The Home Office and Ministry of Justice 
(MoJ) have a ﬁve year strategic plan 
which runs from 2010 to 201 5. As part of 
this, they have savings targets of 25% over 
four years and have initiated a number 
of programmes to meet that goal. 
Our own MoJ pipeline stands at some 
£1bn, with many key contracts due to 
be decided during 2012. Against a 
backdrop of full prisons and the rising 
costs of the justice process, there are 
speciﬁc and extensive outsourcing 
opportunities in areas such as FM, 
prisons management, electronic 
monitoring, community payback and 
probation trusts. Home Office market 
opportunities include police services 
and immigration removal centres.
In the health sector, we are seeing 
a range of opportunities, including 
a growing portfolio of energy services 
work to upgrade ageing infrastructure. 
Increasingly, there is also a strong 
community element to these projects. 
For example, for Camden Council, 
we developed an innovative energy 
scheme to supply up to 1,500 council 
tenants with surplus heat from 
our energy plant at the Royal Free 
Hospital in Hampstead.
To date, we have seen limited 
momentum within local authorities 
to combine more services and 
rationalise their estates. 
However, the pipeline of outsourcing 
opportunities for the delivery of local 
public services remains strong across 
the UK. 
Exciting opportunities 
in changing markets
We work closely with clients in both the private and 
public sectors, primarily in the UK but increasingly in other 
European countries too. The trend towards integrated services 
is a long-term one, and has been clearly identiﬁed in previous 
Annual Reports. What is different now is the speed of change 
and the scale of contracts – more clients are asking more 
and more of us.
In addition to helping them improve efﬁciency while reducing 
costs by outsourcing non-core services to us, we also enable 
clients to reduce the amount of energy they use as well as the 
price they pay for it.

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
In January 2012, the City of Edinburgh 
Council recommended MITIE as the 
preferred bidder for its integrated facilities 
management contract, a proposed 
seven year partnership which would 
have generated signiﬁcant beneﬁts 
to Edinburgh creating 200 new jobs, 
50 apprenticeships and with guaranteed 
savings of between £51m and £1 14m. 
Members of the City of Edinburgh 
Council subsequently voted not to 
approve the proposed contract. 
Whilst a disappointing outcome, our 
proposal offered a model of the future of 
outsourcing and we will continue to invest 
in this area to support its future growth.
Energy services
Our energy services business already 
accounts for 34% of our revenue and 
may rise even further as demand grows 
in both the public and private sectors 
for energy and carbon strategies, driven 
by macroeconomic, environmental 
and legislative factors.
Reduced consumption and diversiﬁed 
energy supply are major objectives for 
all clients. The UK alone must spend 
£450bn on energy efficiency measures 
and supply infrastructure by 2025. 
Across the EU, there are an estimated 
700-1040 active energy service contracts 
with a market value of €6.7bn to €8.5bn. 
This is expected to grow to around 
€25bn by 2020. Energy management is 
now accepted as central to an effective 
FM service – in fact our energy services 
capability is part of every contract we 
operate and is absolutely fundamental 
to our larger bids. 
Already the second largest energy 
services company in the UK, we are well-
positioned for rapid growth. Our strengths 
are based around six core capabilities: 
decentralised energy; renewable 
energy; energy consumption reduction; 
carbon compliance; data management; 
and the introduction of innovative ideas 
and initiatives that raise awareness.
International and new markets
We go where our clients need us 
to go, and as they increasingly take  
a pan-European approach to 
procurement we have expanded 
our services beyond the UK. 
Our work with Rolls-Royce now spans 
the continent and demonstrates our 
ability to provide integrated FM and 
energy services across borders.
The opportunity is clear: 43% of our top 
100 clients have international operations – 
and we are positioned to help them 
access the same efficiencies they enjoy 
in the UK.
Our European capability was initially 
provided via a partnership with Service 
Management International (SMI). During 
201 1 we acquired the remaining 50% of 
SMI’s equity capital. The SMI platform  
self-delivers and supply-chain manages 
FM portfolio services to multinational 
blue-chip clients across 23 countries. 
SMI’s established supply chain of affiliates 
have an annual collective turnover of 
US$8.5bn and employ 280,000 people 
worldwide. In August, SMI was appointed 
as a preferred bidder for a contract with 
Givaudan to provide integrated FM in 
several European countries. 
We currently have direct delivery 
capability in France, Germany, Poland 
and Norway – and are targeting further 
growth in Europe as we see further 
opportunities emerge in this market.
In the UK, we are constantly looking at 
ways to expand our range of services, 
not only by using our entrepreneurial 
model to enter new markets but also 
through value-creating acquisitions 
where appropriate.

Operating review
Good opportunities 
in existing markets 
and beyond
As the outsourcing market evolves, our business has had to 
remain ﬂexible and grow with the market. 
We offer the largest range and broadest coverage of facilities 
and energy management services in the UK. Those services 
are delivered through our four operating divisions. We remain 
focused on being specialists in every service that we provide, 
so that our clients receive the highest quality, whether it is 
one or 100 things we do for them. 
The demand for integrated facilities management is a key driver 
for our business, and these contracts bring together specialist 
services from all of our divisions.

We have continued to win new 
business and have improved our 
client retention rate to a very strong 94%. 
We have performed particularly well 
in the ﬁnancial services, transport 
and retail sectors, where we see 
signiﬁcant opportunities. 
Our investments in customer service 
remain a key differentiator. In our 
cleaning and environmental services 
business, we have a Lean Six Sigma 
team which is helping to make our 
processes more efficient. Our Total 
Security Management business has 
added new service lines such as 
employee screening, electronic 
locking and unlocking and lone worker 
monitoring and protection. Having 
successfully positioned the business as 
a risk-based security provider, we are 
increasingly working with our clients to 
consult on their enterprise wide security 
risk – incorporating technology, remote 
monitoring and manned guarding into  
a holistic solution. 
We are differentiated by our ability to  
self-deliver the majority of FM services, 
and always look at adding new services 
to our portfolio and develop our existing 
businesses. Our size, scale, high street 
and national presence and broad 
range of services enables us to deliver 
substantial cost savings and sustainable, 
innovative solutions to organisations of 
all sizes.
Facilities Management
Our FM division is responsible for 
delivering the following specialist 
single services, either individually or 
in multi-service, bundled contracts:
Security; Cleaning; Catering; Document 
management and reprographics; Reception 
and front of house; Waste management; 
Environmental services; Landscaping;

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
Energy reduction is one of the 
key drivers of MITIE’s growth. 
Our CarbonCare offering forms a 
fundamental part of MITIE’s overall 
energy services capabilities and has 
helped successfully establish MITIE 
as a leading energy services business. 
A signiﬁcant number of CarbonCare 
services are provided by TFM and this 
has been further strengthened by 
the acquisition of Utilyx. The ongoing 
demand in this area is driving continued 
strong performance within TFM.
The market move towards integrated 
FM is also a major driver for TFM as the 
technical maintenance of critical 
infrastructure for our clients is key to their 
operations. Consequently, our technical 
expertise underpins the overall 
integrated FM offering and the delivery 
of these contracts is undertaken 
predominantly through our TFM division. 
We have made further investments in 
our national mobile services offering, 
which delivers a fast and responsive 
mobile technical FM service across 
the UK and is developing well. We have 
also been working with leading lighting 
manufacturers to create a new service 
model that embraces the initial design 
of LED installations, LED retro-ﬁt projects 
capability and ongoing support for 
LED installations. The growth of cloud 
computing and increase in data-
intensive sites is also providing signiﬁcant 
opportunities to monitor and maintain 
this plant and equipment.
Several of the services provided by 
the Property Management division 
are exposed to highly cyclical markets 
and face ongoing challenges as 
a result of the difficult economic 
environment in the UK. 
Our Built Environment business 
provides mechanical and electrical 
engineering contracting services 
along with interior ﬁt-out, combining 
a consult and build solution that gives 
clients assurance of costs and 
operational certainty. 
Our social housing business is 
developing well, with an integrated 
property maintenance solution which 
provides consistency, stability and 
value for money. 
The focus for our niche businesses 
and projects will remain on providing 
core trades for both ﬁxed-term and 
one-off projects as well as working with 
other parts of MITIE on multi-discipline 
project work.
We are now an established investor in 
and developer of decentralised energy 
assets and strategies. In a market which 
still offers signiﬁcant potential for future 
growth, our clients are reaping the 
economic, social and environmental 
beneﬁts of decentralised energy. 
The ability to achieve sustainability 
targets whilst retaining funding for core 
services, and without upfront capital 
investment, is a compelling argument 
in the current economic climate.
We are currently working on major 
decentralised energy projects, 
operating an end-to-end service 
from the design and development of 
energy assets and strategies through 
to the longer term operation of them. 
We continue to see opportunities 
in the data centre market and have 
completed several major data centre 
projects during the year.
We are recognised as one of the few 
providers in the UK that has the track 
record, scale and expertise to deliver 
substantial decentralised energy 
strategies that will guarantee availability 
over a sustained contract term.

Supporting 
the Ministry 
of Justice across 
its estate
Overview of services provided
The contracts are for fully integrated 
facilities management and 
commenced in February. They 
encompass security, cleaning, 
maintenance and project works.
A focus on justice
MITIE has made signiﬁcant investments 
in the justice sector, focusing solely 
on opportunities with the MoJ, the UK 
Border Agency and the police market. 
The contract to provide total facilities 
management for the courts in the South 
of England is MITIE’s most strategically 
important with the Government and 
is also its largest in the public sector. 
We have a long track-record of 
supporting the MoJ and its estate 
and look forward to building on this 
relationship further in the coming years.
Ministry of Justice
MITIE was awarded two contracts with the 
Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in October 201 1, 
following its appointment to the MoJ’s Total 
Facilities Management Framework in 
September 201 1. The total facilities management 
contracts are for Her Majesty’s Courts and 
Tribunal Service (HMCTS) in the South of 
England, and for two prisons, Brixton and Isis. 
This is the most that could have been awarded 
to MITIE through this tender process.

Sustainability overview
Committed to addressing 
the key issues
Everyone expects more of companies now – higher standards of 
business ethics, more attention to social issues like fairness in the 
workforce, and real evidence of a commitment to tackling climate 
change. This is a challenge, there’s no doubt about that, but it’s one 
that MITIE is more than ready to meet. 
FM Skills Centre
The Skills Centres provide students with the 
opportunity to combine class-based learning 
with practical work experience, whilst working 
towards a vocational qualiﬁcation in Facilities 
Services. At the Leeds Co-operative Academy, 
a multi-service MITIE support team has been in 
place since September 201 1 to support and 
mentor students to reach their potential and 
enhance their employability.

Our 
integrated 
sustainability 
approach
O O O Ou ur r 
i integrated d 
s sustainability y 
approach
We’ve always believed that a 
more sustainable business is a better 
business, and we have plenty to 
show for that in terms of what we’ve 
achieved. We’ve helped bring about 
big improvements in the sustainability 
standards of our supply chain, 
reached some of our environmental 
impact targets one year early, 
initiated genuinely valuable and 
multi award-winning community 
projects, and we’ve developed 
the single biggest competitive 
advantage we have – our own  
people – by creating some of the 
best training programmes you’ll ﬁnd 
anywhere in our industry.
Last year, we re-aligned our 
sustainability strategy behind six 
key areas, directly aligned with our 
corporate strategy drivers; because 
everything we do to make MITIE a 
more successful business should also 
help make it a more sustainable one – 
and vice versa. MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Looking after our 
clients properly
Make sure we have the right 
processes and systems in place to 
nurture relationships with clients 
and add the most value possible.
Operating our 
contracts smarter
Make sure all our people, and as 
many of the suppliers we work with as 
possible, understand the commercial 
impact of operating as efficiently as 
possible so that we can maximise 
value for all stakeholders.
Using fewer 
natural resources
Make sure our people understand 
MITIE’s environmental impact in 
terms of natural resource use and 
how important the reduction of 
this is – both from our own internal 
perspective and from that of external 
stakeholders, as well as the role they 
can play in improving it.
What we’ve focused on 
Satisfaction surveys 
Regular key client surveys to measure our 
performance and our Net Promoter score, 
recording responses into our CRM system 
for maximum knowledge sharing.
Industry trend surveys 
Strategic client surveys to monitor key 
industry trends.
Enriching partnerships 
Extend both our own and our clients’ 
community footprints via the Real Apprentice 
and our FM and Construction Skills Centres.
What we achieved 
9.3%
Our Net Promoter score is 9 .3% – and 
we’ve updated our CRM system with the 
survey results.
100%
100% of the clients surveyed told us cost 
certainty and service quality were top of 
their agenda.
4
We ran four Real Apprentice programmes 
and opened the Co-operative Academy 
of Leeds FM Skills Centre.
What we’ve noticed 
We’re building longer term relationships 
with most of our clients – by helping them 
extend their reach in the community 
and making sure we listen to them when 
it comes to their priorities. 
But our Net Promoter score shows there’s still 
work to be done. 
What we’ve focused on
Employee participation 
Raise awareness on fuel consumption across 
the organisation to help achieve 10% fuel 
reduction by 2013. Increase management 
awareness of, and participation in, sustainable 
practices via e-learning programmes and 
interactive workshops.
Supply chain management 
Audit 40 major suppliers a year requiring 
100% to meet or exceed our sustainability 
audit targets within 12 months.
What we achieved 
13%
We’ve achieved 13% fuel reduction through 
proactive ﬂeet management and targeted 
communication campaigns, which means 
we’ve achieved our 2013 target one year early.
8%
8% of our employee population has 
participated in courses and e-learning 
on sustainability topics.
55
We audited 55 suppliers across the group and, 
working with Trucost, analysed 90% of our 
spend to identify hot spots in carbon emissions.
What we’ve noticed 
General awareness of our sustainability 
capabilities is relatively high throughout 
the organisation, but participation could 
be improved. While all our efforts so far have 
produced great results, we know that the 
next part will be the toughest and we will 
look to concentrate on changing people’s 
behaviours and mind sets to improve  
long-term performance. 
What we’ve focused on
Transport optimisation 
Reduce average fuel consumption by 10% 
by 2013.
Utility management 
Reduce our office energy consumption by 
15% by 2013.
Waste management 
Reach 80% recycling rate across our office 
estate by 2013. 
What we achieved 
130g CO2/km
Our average car ﬂeet emission is 130g CO2/km, 
down from 140g CO2/km.
72%
We’ve increased our tracking ability to 72% 
of our ﬂeet.
16%
We’ve achieved 16% reduction in office energy 
consumption, which means we’ve reached 
our 2013 target one year early.
What we’ve noticed 
We’re really proud to have hit two out of 
three targets a full year ahead of our deadline. 
But we still need to carry on challenging 
our ways of doing things – especially 
engaging our people to raise awareness 
of how everyone can make a difference.

What we achieved
1
One new platform – we now use Airsweb to

78
We held eight leadership workshops with 
a total of 78 participants.
4
We introduced four new focus areas – 
electrical work, working at height, driving 
and slips and trips.
What we’ve noticed
We’re pretty proud of our health and safety 
culture – over the last year we’ve improved 
incident rates, employee awareness and 
engagement, as well as health and safety 
leadership; but we realise there is no place 
for complacency and so we want to continue 
our year on year improvement. Going forward 
we’re keen to keep up the good work and 
make our new systems work harder for us.

Strong ﬁnancial 
performance
MITIE has delivered another set of excellent ﬁnancial results, with 
strong revenue growth, a record order book, good cash conversion 
and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet. We are focused 
on both organic and acquisitive growth but our organic growth 
stands out this year and is sector-leading. The award of a number 
of transformational contracts has resulted in a signiﬁcant uplift 
in our order book and a record level of secured revenues for the 
new ﬁnancial year.
We enter the new ﬁnancial year in a strong position with low leverage, 
a strong balance sheet and long-term committed ﬁnancing facilities 
which will support future growth. MITIE Group PLC

Revenue
Revenue for the group increased by 
5.9% in the year ended 31 March 2012 
to £2,002.5m (201 1 : £1,891.4m) largely 
driven by strong organic growth of 5.4%. 
The increase in revenue during the year 
is attributable to organic growth of 
£102.2m, the full year impact of the prior 
year acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland 
of £6.2m, and £2.7m from the in-year 
acquisitions of Utilyx Holdings Limited 
(‘Utilyx’) and Direct Enquiries Holdings 
Limited (‘Direct Enquiries’).
Proforma prior year revenue including 
the full year effect of acquisitions made

improvement in the operating proﬁt

proﬁt before other items in the prior 
year included non-recurring income 
of £4.1m arising from an amendment

Financial review
Finance costs
Net ﬁnance costs for the year were 
£7 .2m (201 1 : £2.7m). During the year, 
MITIE completed the negotiation of its 
reﬁnancing activities and secured new 
committed banking facilities of £250m 
which are available for drawdown 
until September 2015. This completed 
an exercise which had seen the 
introduction of £100.2m equivalent 
of longer term tenure US private 
placement loan notes into the group’s 
funding structures in December 2010. 
The general tightening of credit markets, 
compared to the favourable conditions 
which existed when our previous facility 
was negotiated in January 2007 , 
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase 
in the total ﬁnance costs incurred 
during the year. This increase is a result 
of both higher interest rates and 
an increase in the fees payable 
on the arrangement and utilisation 
of the group’s banking facility.
Proﬁt before tax 
Proﬁt before tax for the year was £94.5m 
(201 1 : £86.8m), an increase of 8.9% on 
the prior year. 
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £22.4m 
(201 1 : £21.4m), an improvement in the 
effective rate of tax to 23.7% (201 1 : 
24.7%). The improvement in the effective 
tax rate is largely attributable to the 
reduction in mainstream UK corporation 
tax rates. 
Proﬁt after tax
Proﬁt after tax for the year was £72.1m 
(201 1 : £65.4m), an increase of 10.2% on 
the prior year. 
Earnings per share
Basic EPS before other items was 
unchanged compared to the prior year 
at 22.6p per share (201 1 : 22.6p per share) 
whilst basic EPS was 20.5p per share 
(201 1 : 18.6p per share), an increase 
of 10.2%. This latter measure showed 
higher growth due to the absence 
of material restructuring or acquisition 
related items during the year. 
The measures of diluted EPS are based 
on a calculation which includes 
unexercised share options. The 
substantial increase in MITIE’s share 
price during the year has led to a rise in 
the number of share options included 
in this calculation (2012: 9 .0m shares; 
201 1 : 6.4m shares). This measure of EPS is 
sensitive to the number of share options 
included within it and has caused 
a marginal decline in reported EPS 
on that basis. 
Dividend
It is now the Board’s policy to grow the 
dividend broadly in line with the 
underlying earnings of the group. The 
ﬁnal dividend proposed by the Board 
has increased by 6.1% to 5.2p per share 
(201 1 : 4.9p per share). This brings the full 
year dividend to 9 .6p per share (201 1 : 
9 .0p per share), an increase of 6.7%. 
The full year dividend reﬂects a cover of 
2.4 times adjusted earnings per share. 
Cash ﬂow, funding and liquidity
MITIE places signiﬁcant emphasis on the 
management of its cash ﬂow and the 
maintenance of strong ﬁnancing 
facilities. The gearing of the group has 
remained low and net debt at 31 March 
2012 was £106.9m (201 1 : £7 6.5m), 
representing a net debt to EBITDA ratio 
of 0.81 (201 1 : 0.65). MITIE has a diverse 
range of secure funding facilities with 
committed banking facilities of £250m 
which are available until September 
2015, and a mix of US private placement 
loan notes. The notes have a total value 
of £100.2m, with £60.2m US dollar 
denominated notes maturing in 
December 201 7 and £40m sterling 
denominated notes maturing in 
December 2019 . The group also has 
further overdraft facilities of £40m. 
Cash inﬂows from operations increased 
by 7 .5% to £1 10.2m during the year and 
we have delivered strong conversion of 
proﬁt (EBITDA) to cash at a rate of 83.7% 
(201 1 : 86.7%), whilst continuing to invest 
in the organic growth of the group. 
Cash conversion measures the success 
of the group in converting operating 
proﬁt measured by EBITDA to cash and 
underpins the quality of MITIE’s earnings 
and reﬂects the effectiveness of our 
cash management activities.

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
MITIE uses a set of ﬁnancial and  
non-ﬁnancial KPIs to measure and 
communicate critical aspects of our 
performance. These KPIs are aligned 
with our strategic objective of 
achieving sustainable proﬁtable growth 
and our ﬁnancial KPIs are speciﬁcally 
focused on the level and quality of our 
earnings and cash ﬂows, the control 
of capital expenditure and the 
sustainability of dividends. 
We have performed strongly against 
these measures again this year and have 
demonstrated a long-term track record 
of strength in each. Details of our ﬁnancial 
KPIs are set out on page 19 of this report. 
Pensions
Our ﬁnancial strength remains 
unaffected by any signiﬁcant deﬁcit 
in respect of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension schemes to which the group 
contributes. The net funding position 
of all the deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
arrangements included on the balance 
sheet is a deﬁcit of £1 7 .3m (201 1 : £3.0m). 
The deﬁcit on the principal group 
deﬁned beneﬁt scheme at 31 March 
2012 was £1 7 .2m (201 1 : £3.0m). The 
increase in the deﬁcit was principally 
driven by the reduction in the discount 
factor applied in the valuation of 
scheme liabilities. This factor, which is set 
by reference to prevailing bond market 
rates at the year end, moved from 5.6% 
to 4.9% over the year reﬂecting the 
deterioration of bond rates over the 
year. The deﬁcit calculation is 
particularly sensitive to changes in the 
discount factor, as illustrated in note 37 
to the accounts. During the year, the 
group completed the triennial review 
and actuarial valuation, as at 31 March 
201 1, of its principal deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension scheme. No lump sum 
contributions to the scheme are 
required as the result of this valuation 
exercise. Further details of this 
valuation can be found in Note 37 
to the accounts.
MITIE contributes to a number of 
deﬁned contribution pension schemes. 
The group also makes contributions 
to customers’ deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes under Admitted Body Local 
Government status as well as to other 
arrangements in respect of certain 
employees who have transferred to 
the group under TUPE. MITIE’s net 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligations in 
respect of schemes in which it is 
committed to funding amounted to 
£0.1m (201 1 : £0.0m).
Acquisitions
On 10 January 2012, MITIE acquired the 
leading energy and carbon specialist 
Utilyx. Utilyx provides a number of 
services relating to its clients’ energy 
demands including strategic planning, 
procurement and risk management, all 
of which are designed to manage the 
business impact of energy consumption 
and rising energy costs. The acquisition 
of Utilyx complements and enhances 
MITIE’s CarbonCare energy services 
capabilities. Utilyx has an annualised 
turnover of £9 .6m. The total 
consideration for the acquisition will 
be up to £16.4m. Initial consideration of 
£15.2m was paid in cash on completion 
and the balance (capped at a 
maximum additional payment of 
£1.2m) will be paid in cash, dependent 
on future business performance. 
On 6 December 201 1, MITIE acquired a 
majority stake in the UK’s leading access 
and disability consultancy company 
Direct Enquiries.
Direct Enquiries has an annualised 
turnover of £1 .4m. The initial consideration 
was £0.2m, paid in cash on completion, 
with further options to buy the remaining 
equity for cash, up to a maximum 
of £8.3m depending on ﬁnancial 
performance over a ﬁve year period.
MITIE also increased its stake from 
50% to 100% in Service Management 
International for £1.5m. SMI uses a 
network of FM service providers in 
34 different territories to tender global 
contracts in which MITIE delivers the 
UK services. Further details of these 
acquisitions can be found within 
Note 33 to the accounts. 
MITIE’s entrepreneurial 
investment model 
In August 201 1, MITIE purchased certain 
minority shareholdings of ﬁve MITIE 
subsidiary companies under their 
respective articles of association 
and shareholder agreements in 
accordance with arrangements 
under our entrepreneurial investment 
programme known as the MITIE Model. 
The total consideration for all ﬁve 
purchases amounted to £14.6m being 
satisﬁed by £2.0m in cash and as to the 
remaining £12.6m by the issue of 5.3m 
new Ordinary shares of 2.5p each in 
MITIE Group PLC valued at 238.7p per 
share, being the closing market price 
per share on 27 July 201 1.

Factors that could affect our business
A summary of the 
principal risks potentially 
affecting our business
Following the establishment of our new Enterprise Risk function in 
2011, a fundamental review of the way risks are identiﬁed, analysed 
and controlled was undertaken during the year. As a result of this 
comprehensive review a more streamlined approach to establishing 
our principal risks has been carried out, resulting in the number 
of identiﬁed risks moving from 19 in the last Annual Report to 
12 currently. This improvement in our risk management approach 
further enhances our ability to develop and grow our business 
with the assurance that key risks are effectively managed through 
robust and embedded processes, with management prioritising 
their resource to address signiﬁcant areas of risk. The principal

Overview Business review Governance Accounts


The Directors submit their report together with the audited consolidated financial statements of the MITIE group of 
companies for the year ended 31 March 2012. The Directors’ Report includes the Chairman’s Statement, the Business 
Review, the Corporate Governance Statement, the Remuneration Report, the Directors’ Responsibility Statement, 
and those documents that are referred to within the Directors’ Report and which are available at www.mitie.com. 
The Company is required to set out a fair review of the business of the group, including an analysis of the development 
and performance of the group during the reporting period, the position of the group at the end of the reporting period 
and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the group. This review is set out in the Business Review on pages 8 to 47 
and the Chairman’s Statement on pages 6 and 7.  
The Directors’ Report has been prepared, and is published, in accordance with, and in reliance upon, applicable 
English company law and the liabilities of the Directors in relation to that report are subject to the limitations and 
restrictions provided by such law. 
Principal group activities 
MITIE Group PLC is the holding company of the group. The principal activity of the Company is to provide management 
services to the group. The group’s activities are focused on the provision of strategic outsourcing and energy services 
in support of the buildings, facilities and infrastructure of its clients. Further details of the subsidiary undertakings of the 
Company principally affecting the profits or net assets of the group in the reporting period are listed in Note 39 to the 
financial statements. The group operates a registered branch office in the Isle of Man.  
Governance overview 
The Corporate Governance Statement, together with the Directors’ Remuneration Report, provides details of key 
aspects of MITIE’s corporate governance environment and the Board has confirmed that the group has complied 
with all the relevant provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (the ‘Code’) throughout the year. 
Our achievements during 2012 are underpinned by a strong culture of governance. In our Corporate Governance 
Statement we explain how the main principles of good governance are applied and the principal changes we have 
made to our systems of assurance, risk management and control during the last financial year. The Board recognises 
that the manner in which the group is governed is critical to its long term success, for which it is accountable to 
shareholders. 
During 2012, the Board, with the help of its committees, has continued to ensure that balanced and sufficient time 
is spent reviewing and discussing strategy, risk, performance, investor engagement and key matters of governance. 
This is facilitated by focused planning to ensure that the right information is provided to support the decision making 
of the Board. Key areas of governance that have been reviewed during the year include:  
− Board composition – the Nomination Committee has reviewed the composition of the Board and its Committees and 
the refreshing of the Board to ensure the rights skills and experience are represented to support the growth of the 
group. The Board continues to operate a formal Board evaluation and is mindful of the requirement under the Code 
to carry out an externally facilitated Board evaluation every three years. All Directors with the exception of Ian 
Stewart will be standing for re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting (AGM).  
− Board diversity – MITIE has welcomed the focus on board diversity and the Board continues to believe the issue of 
diversity should be tackled in a manner that considers all areas of the diversity and inclusion agenda of which gender 
forms a part.  
− External audit tender – the Board took a decision to tender the provision of external audit services to the group and 
carried out a rigorous review process which involved presentations and responses from four potential providers of 
audit services.  
− Risk and business assurance – following a review of MITIE’s risk management systems and internal audit processes, 
we have introduced an Enterprise Risk Management system to enhance the way in which risk is managed, assessed 
and measured throughout the group. 
− Decision making – the Board has completed its review of delegated authorities to ensure that they continue to be 
adequate, appropriate and sufficient to support the business in the context of the growth of the organisation and its 
changing jurisdictional presence.

The role of the Board  
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the Company and accordingly reviews and agrees 
the strategy for the group proposed by the Executive Directors on an annual basis. In setting the strategy, the Board 
takes account of key matters such as market trends, competitive environment, private/public sector approach, 
international aspects, people and talent and the MITIE Model, ensuring at all times that sufficient consideration is given 
to risk and internal controls. Matters that are exclusively dealt with by the Board include: setting group objectives and 
strategies, approving business plans and budgets and monitoring performance against these, approving material 
acquisitions, disposals and business start-ups, including any material transactions outside of the normal course of 
business, approving the group’s Half-yearly and Annual Report and Accounts, appointing and removing the Chairman, 
Directors and Company Secretary, management of the group’s risk profile and monitoring the group’s corporate 
governance arrangements. Decisions and approvals are managed in accordance with the group’s delegated 
authorities and matters are also set out in a schedule of matters reserved for the Board which is available at 
www.mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance. 
Board composition 
The membership of the Board as at 31 March 2012 and biographical details of the Directors (including details of 
committee chairmanships and other positions held) are given on page 48. To comply with relevant provision of the 
Code, all Directors, with the exception of Ian Stewart, will submit themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM 
and details are provided in the Notice of AGM which is available at www.mitie.com/investors. After serving with MITIE 
for 25 years, of which 22 have been on the PLC Board, Ian Stewart resigned as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 21 May 2012.  
During the year, Non-Executive Director independence was considered by the Board. The Board determined that 
all Non-Executive Directors as at 31 March 2012, with the exception of the Deputy Chairman Ian Stewart, were 
independent in mind and judgement, and free from any material relationship that could interfere with their ability 
to discharge their duties effectively. 
The Board is comprised of four independent Non-Executive Directors; a Non-Executive Director deemed non-
independent as a result of his prior role as Chief Executive of the group, the Non-Executive Chairman and three 
Executive Directors. The Board has five formally constituted committees: the Audit Committee, the Nomination 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Investment Committee and the Results Committee for which the duties 
and responsibilities of each are set out in the terms of reference available on the Investor section of MITIE’s website: 
at www.mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance. The work of the Committees is explained on pages 51 and 52. 
The division of responsibilities and leadership 
There is a clear division of responsibility between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive as formally set out in the 
terms of reference for each of these roles.  
The Chairman is a Non-Executive Director and is responsible for the effective running and leadership of the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness. He liaises with the Company Secretary on the annual Board plan and agrees and sets the 
Board agendas. Key matters covered at each Board meeting include: strategy, enterprise risk management, financial 
and management reporting, investor relations and corporate governance, with updates received from each of the 
Committee Chairmen. He ensures that sufficient time is allocated to promote healthy discussion and open debate, 
supported by the right level and quality of information to assist the Board in reaching its decisions. The Chairman 
encourages openness and fluid communication between Executive and Non-Executive Directors, a culture which has 
been facilitated by meetings between the Chairman and individual Directors. The Chairman ensures that the Non-
Executive Directors contribute effectively and that the Executive and Non-Executive Directors are aware of the views 
of major shareholders. He is also responsible for ensuring that the Board addresses major challenges faced by MITIE and 
for the effective performance of the Board and its committees. The Chairman is available to consult with shareholders 
throughout the year and will be available at the AGM.  
The Chief Executive is responsible for all aspects of the operation and management of the group and its business 
within the authorities delegated by the Board. She is responsible for developing and effectively implementing strategy 
following approval of the strategic and financial plan by the Board. The Chief Executive’s remit includes proposing 
investment into new business and geographical areas and ensuring at all times that the group’s risk profile is 
appropriately considered. She ensures the timely and accurate disclosure of information to the Board and to 
shareholders. She leads the Executive Directors and senior management team in the day-to-day running of the group’s 
business under clear delegation of authority from the Board. The Chief Executive maintains regular dialogue with the 
Chairman on all important Company matters and together they provide coherent leadership of the group.   MITIE Group PLC

Overview Business review Governance Accounts

The Non-Executive Directors  
Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising their independent skill and judgement. In reviewing the proposals 
for the strategic direction of the group, the Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and probe the Executive 
Directors, offering a breadth of knowledge, experience and individual skills, and are responsible for contributing to the 
formulation and development of strategy. The Non-Executive Directors monitor high level corporate reporting and 
satisfy themselves as to the integrity of financial information and the operation of key financial controls. The terms of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors’ and the Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection 
at MITIE’s registered office, the head office and at the AGM. The role of the Senior Independent Director is to make 
himself available to shareholders should they have concerns which have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance Director or for which such contact is inappropriate in the 
circumstances. The Senior Independent Director in particular reviews information on major shareholders and financial 
analysis to obtain a balanced understanding of the issues and concerns of shareholders. Explained further below 
is the Senior Independent Director’s role in succession planning and performance evaluation for the Chairman. 
The Committees of the Board 
The Audit Committee 
The Company has a formally constituted Audit Committee comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors who 
are all considered as being appropriately experienced to fulfil their duties, and the chairman, David Jenkins, continues 
to be deemed by the Board as at the date of this report, to have significant, recent and relevant financial experience 
through his qualifications and held appointments. The Committee is generally responsible for: 
− monitoring and reviewing the integrity of the group’s corporate reporting which includes any formal announcements 
relating to the group’s financial performance, and any significant financial reporting judgements therein; 
− monitoring and reviewing the independence and objectivity of the group’s external auditors, the objectivity and 
effectiveness of the audit process and the effectiveness and implementation of the group policy on the provision 
of non-audit services (the Non-Audit Services Policy);  
− monitoring and reviewing the integrity and effectiveness of the group’s internal financial controls environment, 
internal audit function and enterprise risk management structures; and 
− making recommendations to the Board on shareholder resolutions for the appointment of, and remuneration 
for, external auditors.  
The Chairman of the Committee will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the work of the 
Committee. 
During the financial year, the Committee met three times and meetings are attended by the Company’s external 
auditors, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and the Enterprise Risk Director. The matters 
under consideration at these meetings included: 
− generally monitoring the group’s corporate reporting process and the statutory audit of the annual group accounts; 
− the Half-yearly Financial Report and Annual Report and Accounts; 
− critical accounting policies and judgements; 
− the review of the external auditors’ audit plan, nature and scope of work and overall summary of key issues 
and judgements; 
− the tendering of external audit services for the group and the re-appointment of the external auditors; 
− the effectiveness of the external auditors including the appropriateness and skills of the audit team; 
− compliance with the Non-Audit Services Policy and maintenance of auditor independence; 
− the approval of the group risk assurance framework and the internal audit plan; 
− the review of key internal audit reports and findings; and 
− generally monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control, audit and risk management systems and functions. 
The Committee also meets separately with the external auditors and the Enterprise Risk Director without the presence 
of the Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee 
Information about the structure and processes for the Remuneration Committee is included on page 64 within 
the Remuneration Report.  MITIE Group PLC

The Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for identifying and nominating, for the approval of the Board, candidates 
to fill Board vacancies and to consider the need to refresh the skills, experience and diversity represented on the 
Board to support the growth of the business. It leads the process for appointments to the Board. On an appointment, 
Directors are made aware of what is expected from them in terms of time commitment, Committee service and 
involvement outside Board meetings. 
All Directors receive a personally tailored induction to MITIE which includes visits to Company and key client sites and 
they receive an information pack, which includes copies of MITIE’s Memorandum and Articles of Association, latest 
Annual Report and Accounts, Committee terms of reference and copies of recent Board and Committee minutes and 
supporting papers. Directors are given access to the virtual boardroom which, as well as holding all board reports, holds 
the Board Handbook containing essential information about the Company; Board and Committee terms of reference; 
Directors’ statutory duties; governance and regulatory guidelines; the group’s approved delegated authorities, and an 
overview of the group’s insurance arrangements. The Handbook is reviewed and updated regularly as and when 
regulatory developments arise. Training and development for Directors continues to be a key focus and additional 
briefing notes are circulated on matters such as changes in the regulatory and governance environment. 
In respect of changes to the membership on the Board or its Committees, the Nomination Committee makes 
appropriate recommendations following a careful and considered evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and term served. It seeks to ensure that the Directors continue to provide the requisite skills, knowledge 
and experience to support the development and needs of a growing organisation and diversity forms an important 
part in this process. MITIE welcomes general principles underpinning the need to consider diversity at Board level and 
sees this as an opportunity to help organisations shift their behaviour around diversity. The Board believes that setting 
aspirational diversity targets could drive a different behaviour that is not necessarily in the best interests of the 
organisation and the issue of Board diversity should be tackled in a manner that considers all areas of the diversity 
agenda. Diversity at Board level has to be balanced against the required skills and experience and should be a natural 
fit into any recruitment or succession planning and talent management process.  
During the year, the Nomination Committee reviewed the composition and chairmanship of the Board and each 
of its Committees and the Board has determined that all Non-Executive Directors were independent in character and 
judgement. The membership of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees were widened to include all the 
Non-Executive Directors and the Board has confirmed that it is satisfied that its current composition is appropriate 
having regard in particular to the integrity, skills, knowledge and experience of its Directors and the size and nature 
of the business. 
The Investment Committee 
In order to further strengthen the Company’s governance structures and facilitate the internal approvals process 
the Board has approved the terms for the establishment of an Investment Committee which comprises of the Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director. The Investment Committee reviews and approves proposals on matters such 
as acquisitions, disposals, capital expenditure and operational transactions, presented in accordance with the group 
delegated authorities.  
The Results Committee 
In addition, the Board has approved the establishment of a Results Committee which comprises of the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director. This Committee assists the Board in approving matters such as interim and final results 
announcements, other routine, non-material announcements, dividend payments and shareholder communications.   MITIE Group PLC

Board meetings and meeting attendance 
All Directors are expected to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively 
and, where possible, attend all Board meetings and the AGM. Any time commitment matters are addressed by the 
Chairman with the Director concerned.  
During the year ended 31 March 2012, there were six scheduled Board meetings. Additional unscheduled Board 
meetings were held to deal with the review and approval of material contracts, acquisitions and issues relating 
to shares and other administrative matters. Information contained in Board papers is generally well presented and 
over the past 12 months has continued to improve to ensure effective decision making on areas critical to group’s 
development. The Board has introduced an electronic boardroom and all board papers are now distributed 
electronically which assists in the more efficient delivery of reports. Each year, the Board holds a dedicated 
strategy meeting and a budget meeting. Directors’ attendance at scheduled Board and Committee meetings 
(Audit, Remuneration and Nomination) of which they are members is shown in the following table:

Note:

To assist with the business conducted at Board and Committee meetings, all Directors are supplied with an agenda 
and supporting papers for all Board meetings in a timely manner and from time to time, detailed presentations from 
non-Board members on operational matters. In addition, members receive monthly reports from the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director on the operational and financial performance of the group. During the course of the year, 
the structure and content of these reports has been reviewed to help improve the quality of information and ensure 
they continue to provide information that reflects the dynamics of the businesses and the markets within which the 
Company operates; such reports can also include updates on post-acquisition performance, contract wins and losses, 
organic growth, management accounts and results.   MITIE Group PLC

Director commitments 
Executive Directors are permitted to accept appointments outside the group provided permission is sought from the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive and that the additional appointments do not interfere with the Directors’ ability 
to discharge their duties effectively. The commitments outside the group of the Executive Directors are detailed 
in the Remuneration Report on page 64. Executive Directors are entitled to retain any fees earned from these 
external appointments. 
Directors’ interests  
With regards to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association 
and the Code, the Companies Acts and related legislation. The Articles may be amended by special resolution of the 
shareholders.  
Director conflicts 
The Board has a formal policy on the declaration and management of Director conflicts in accordance with the 
Articles of Association of the Company which has operated effectively during the reporting period. Any potential 
situation or transactional conflict must be reported as soon as possible to the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the 
Company Secretary. Where a potential conflict is authorised (under the statutory powers and powers granted under 
the Articles of Association to the Board), such conflict is kept under ongoing review. 
Director indemnities 
The Company maintains Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, providing appropriate cover for any legal action 
brought against its Directors and/or officers. The Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company extend 
the protection provided to Directors in respect of any litigation against Directors relating to their position as a Director 
of the Company, and specifically provide that the Company may indemnify Directors against any liability incurred in 
connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company and that the 
Company may fund defence costs. Individual Directors would still be liable to pay damages awarded to the Company 
in any action against them by the Company and to repay their defence costs (to the extent funded by the Company) 
if their defence was unsuccessful.  
Board evaluation  
The Board is committed to effective and rigorous review of its performance and that of the Committees and individual 
Directors, and accordingly a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees 
and of each Director is performed annually. 
The Chairman, with the Company Secretary, reviews the evaluation process and has considered the extent to which 
such a process should be externally facilitated and has reported to the Nomination Committee on its conclusions. 
This year, it was recommended that the Board continue with an evaluation process that uses a combination of a formal 
appraisal questionnaire and one-to-one meetings. The questionnaire was separately reviewed and refreshed to ensure 
that the questions remain meaningful, objective and support an open and transparent process, and focus on Board 
composition and contributions, meeting processes and the performance of the Chairman (which is reviewed 
separately and led by the Senior Independent Director).  
The conclusions and recommendations flowing from the evaluation are reviewed by the Chairman with the Chief 
Executive and shared with the Board. It is a constructive process used to improve performance and help shape 
the future composition of the Board. The Board has confirmed that whilst there is an overall level of satisfaction with 
the performance of the Board and that of its Committees and Directors, there was a continuing need for the Board 
to focus on the implementation of the growth strategy and ensuring it has the skills, experience and diversity 
to achieve it.  
Director re-election 
As part of the formal Board evaluation, the Board has considered the performance of each Director and is satisfied 
that they continue to be effective and demonstrate clear commitment to their role. All Directors, with the exception 
of Ian Stewart, will submit themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.   MITIE Group PLC

Overview Business review Governance Accounts


Risk management and internal control 
The Board is responsible for determining the level of acceptable risk that is appropriate for the group when establishing 
and operating to achieve the group’s strategic objectives. It regularly reviews the effectiveness of the group’s risk 
management programme and systems of internal control. Both the Board and the Audit Committee receive regular 
updates from the Enterprise Risk Director for the group on potential risks that may impact upon the group and the 
environment in which it operates. The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failing to achieve these objectives and strategies and it will only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement and loss. 
Internal control framework 
The Board and senior management are responsible for maintaining and developing a culture of good governance and 
integrity, competence, fairness and responsibility throughout the group. Essential to this is the recruitment and retention 
of highly skilled individuals who promote the highest standards of integrity, competence, governance and ethical 
behaviour. Group policies and procedures support the business by providing an operational internal control framework 
for the group, each division and operating business to work within. This framework is designed to balance the need for 
group-wide consistency and control with the autonomy that local management require to develop and manage each 
operating business successfully. 
Responsibilities are clearly defined and delegated in accordance with the group’s delegated authorities and 
authorisation registers and ensure compliance with the matters reserved for the Board. The formal delegated authorities 
matrix is issued to all operating subsidiaries that includes both financial and non-financial authorities and matters 
relating to strategy, contract approval, recruitment, capital expenditure, banking transactions and specific group 
policies. Periodically, the Board reviews the delegated authorities to consider the authorities in light of activities within 
the organisation to ensure that they continue to facilitate the way in which the group operates. Each operating 
subsidiary is headed by a managing or regional director who has authority to manage their business within this 
framework of delegated authorities and group policies and procedures. To support the business further, the group 
function has a team of specialist resources with individuals responsible for specific functions including legal, health 
and safety, IT, insurance, human resources, tax, pensions, purchasing, finance and enterprise risk. Regular dialogue 
between these functions and the operating businesses provides additional support and forms a key part of the system 
of internal control. 
Monitoring the system of internal control 
Monitoring is carried out throughout the year via the receipt and review of various reports, presentations and discussions 
with management, as set out above. Specifically, the Audit Committee supports the Board by monitoring and guiding 
the activities of the internal audit function, including approving the internal audit programme and reviewing regular 
internal audit reports from the Enterprise Risk function. The internal audit programme is designed to provide a level 
of assurance over key risks as identified in the group risk register and is developed by the Enterprise Risk Director who 
reports independently to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from the external 
auditors who contribute a further independent perspective on certain aspects of the internal financial control systems 
arising from their work. As necessary, the Audit Committee will have dialogue with the Executive Directors on their 
control responsibilities. To further encourage a culture of risk management within the business, the Executive Board 
regularly reviews the programme of risk management undertaken across the group to demonstrate the importance 
of the management and assessment of risk at a senior level. 
During 2011, MITIE enhanced its approach to risk management, by bringing together existing risk management 
resources into an Enterprise Risk function, led by an Enterprise Risk Director. This restructured approach allows the 
Company to strengthen capability and resource through the sharing of best practice across the group. 
The Board confirms that there is a continuing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced 
by the group which is monitored in accordance with the revised guidance on internal control issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. This work has focused on the assurance framework that exists within the group, the use and 
compilation of risk registers and an increase in the use of computer assisted audit techniques.  
The Board confirms that its risk assessment process has been in place throughout the reporting year and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The Board considers the nature and extent of the significant risks it 
takes in setting strategies which are detailed further in the section regarding risk factors that could affect the business 
on pages 46 and 47. The process for identifying, evaluating and managing risks requires the group and its principal 
businesses to consider strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks and the effectiveness of the mitigating 
controls based on a pre and post-controls risk evaluation. The principal risks identified from this process are recorded 
in the group’s risk register which is maintained by the group’s Enterprise Risk function. This register is reviewed   MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

periodically by the Board and forms the basis of the internal audit programme for each year with risk areas reviewed 
on an annual to triennial basis dependent upon materiality and inherent risk assessment. Reported potential economic 
crimes and whistleblowing activity is communicated to the Audit Committee along with the results of investigations 
carried out. These investigations have not identified any risks that result in a material, unmitigated exposure to  
Reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control 
In line with Turnbull Guidance and C.2.1 of the Code, the Board performs a formal annual assessment of the operation 
and effectiveness of the system of internal control, covering all material controls including financial, operation and 
compliance controls, and updates this assessment prior to the signing of the Annual Report and Accounts. The Board 
also holds discussions with senior management and reviews the results of a formal internal controls review and system 
effectiveness confirmation from each operating subsidiary. The Enterprise Risk Director attends each Audit Committee 
meeting to provide regular updates on the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls. The Board confirms that 
management has taken steps during the year to improve the system of internal control, embed effective controls 
further into the operations of the group and to address improvements as they come to management’s attention. 
These steps are monitored at executive level to ensure they are implemented appropriately and that they are effective. 
Internal control systems: information and communication 
The group maintains a number of systems and processes that report relevant information to group executive 
management and the Board as necessary. This includes financial and non-financial information regarding business 
performance, compliance with policy and procedure, relevant regulations and business critical matters. At an 
operational level each division and business holds regular board and management meetings. To maintain and develop 
relationships between separate divisions and to address specific matters, regional meetings are also held and are 
attended by regional representatives of each division. Senior group management also regularly attend these meetings. 
Consolidated accounts preparation and financial reporting 
The consolidated accounts of the group are prepared by the Group Finance function that is responsible for the review 
and compilation of reports and financial results from each of the operating divisions and subsidiaries within the group, 
in accordance with the group internal control and reporting procedures. Each operating division supports its report and 
results submission with a statement of compliance with the group’s principal internal controls which is subject to review 
and sample audit by the internal audit function. In addition, the representations made by the Board in support of the 
consolidated financial statements, including those in relation to the operating divisions, are supported by detailed 
papers and cascaded reporting requirements throughout the group, which are reviewed by either the Group Finance 
team or internal audit and presented to the Audit Committee and the Board for final approval as appropriate.  
External auditor 
Each year the Audit Committee reviews auditor performance in respect of audit services, audit related services 
and non-audit services and is committed to ensuring the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.  
During the year, MITIE invited tenders for its external audit services. Four audit firms were invited to participate and 
a formal process of interviews and evaluations followed. The tender process included the review of the Company’s 
existing auditor performance in respect of services provided, audit related services, non-audit related services and 
independence and objectivity. The Audit Committee concluded that Deloitte LLP should be appointed given the 
relevant experience of their London team in both the PLC environment and support services sector and their proposal 
with regard to the execution of the audit plan. The Audit Committee recommended to the Board the continued 
engagement of Deloitte LLP as the Company’s external auditor and has recommended their re-appointment at the 
AGM. Deloitte LLP has expressed willingness to continue in office as auditors and accordingly the Board is 
recommending a resolution for re-appointment for approval by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.  
The Audit Committee has approved a Non-Audit Services Policy that ensures that it has visibility over the levels of  
non-audit work performed by the auditors and requires notification to the Chairman of the Audit Committee for any 
non-audit spend with the auditors that, on an annual basis cumulatively exceeds 100% of the annual audit fee and/or 
where any item, regardless of amount, is considered significant. The Audit Committee is satisfied that this policy provides 
sufficient control over the levels of non-audit spend with the auditors whilst providing sufficient flexibility for the Group 
Finance Director to approve expenditure on advice below those levels. Non-audit services provided to the group 
during the year included taxation services and corporate finance services in relation to acquisitions.

Overview Business review Governance Accounts

This policy also restricts the external auditors from performing work which will result in them auditing their own work, 
making management decisions for the group, creating a conflict of interest, finding themselves in the role of advocate 
for MITIE or creating any potential threat to their independence. Additionally, the external auditors will only be 
considered for the provision of non-audit services if they are best suited to perform the work in question. Deloitte LLP 
also maintains its own internal controls designed to safeguard its independence. A summary of the fees paid to the 
external auditors is given in Note 6 to the financial statements. The Audit Committee confirms that the requirements 
of the Non-Audit Services Policy have been met throughout the year. 
Disclosure of information to the auditors 
Each of the Directors in office as of the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts confirms that: 
− so far as he/she is aware, there is no relevant audit information (being information required by the auditors in the 
preparation of their report) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
− he/she has each taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of such information. 
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Going concern 
The Directors acknowledge the Financial Reporting Council’s Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors 
of UK Companies issued in October 2009 and ‘An update for Directors of Listed Companies: Responding to increased 
country and currency risk in financial reports’. The group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out in the business review as referred to on pages 8 to 47. 
The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the financial 
review on pages 42 to 45. In addition, Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements includes details of the group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The group benefits from a large number of long-term contracts with a broad range of public and private customers 
which provide a strong forward order book of £8.6bn and high visibility of secured work (83% of budgeted revenue) 
for the financial year ending 31 March 2013. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully. The group’s financial forecasts, taking into account possible sensitivities in trading 
performance, indicate that the group will be able to operate within the level of its committed borrowing facilities. 
The group’s committed borrowing facilities comprise £100.2m of US Private Placement Loan Notes expiring between 
December 2017 and December 2019 which were issued in December 2010 and its committed banking facilities. 
The group renegotiated its banking facilities in March 2011 and its committed facility of £250m will remain in place 
until September 2015.  
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts.  

The Board is committed to an on-going, proactive dialogue with institutional and private investors and continues to 
support the introduction of the UK Stewardship Code, applicable to institutional shareholders, to further encourage 
engagement between the Company and its shareholders. A full programme of formal and informal events, institutional 
investor meetings and presentations are also held following the Half yearly and Preliminary Results announcements 
which are led by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.  
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director are available for additional meetings with shareholders upon request. 
The Board encourages the on-going dialogue between the Directors and investors and as such all Directors, with the 
exception of David Jenkins were present at the 2011 AGM and made themselves available for direct discussions with 
shareholders. Latest group information, financial reports, corporate governance and sustainability matters, Half-yearly 
and Preliminary Results presentations, major shareholder information and all announcements are made available to 
shareholders via the MITIE website (www.mitie.com) which has a specific area dedicated to investor relations.  
Significant importance is attached to investor feedback on the group’s performance, and as such the Board receives 
an investor relations report at each meeting detailing corporate news, share price activity, investor relations activity 
and major shareholder movements. The Board is also regularly updated and provided with investor feedback, broker 
updates and detailed analyst reports following the Half-year and Preliminary Results presentations. The Chairman 
is responsible for ensuring that the Board is made aware of the issues and concerns of the major shareholders. 
The AGM also allows shareholders to address and discuss any issues surrounding the group directly with the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors.  MITIE Group PLC

Electronic communications 
The Directors remain committed to improving and extending the electronic methods in which the Company 
communicates with its shareholders, not only allowing the latest information on the group to be provided instantly 
but recognising the environmental benefits. The Board encourages each shareholder to join the growing number 
of investors electing to receive their information electronically and further details on how to register are provided 
on the inside back cover of this report. 
AGM  
MITIE’s AGM will be held on 11 July 2012 at 2.30pm at UBS, 1 Finsbury Avenue, London, EC2M 2PP. As is required 
by the Code, all Directors, with the exception of Ian Stewart, will be standing for re-election at the AGM. 

Capital structure 
Share capital and powers of shareholders 
The group is financed through both equity share capital and debt instruments. Details of changes to the Company’s 
share capital are given in Note 31 to the financial statements. The Company has a single class of shares – 2.5p Ordinary 
shares – with no right to any fixed income and with each share carrying the right to one vote at general meetings of the 
Company. Under the Company’s Articles of Association, holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to participate in any 
dividends pro-rata to their holding. The Board may propose and pay interim dividends and recommend a final dividend 
for approval by the shareholders at the AGM. A final dividend may be declared by the shareholders in a general 
meeting by ordinary resolution, but such dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Board.  
Share capital authorisations 
At the 2011 AGM shareholders authorised: 
− the Directors to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £3,401,672.18 shares, representing one third of 
the issued share capital plus 16,804,451 outstanding commitment in respect of options granted under MITIE’s share 
schemes (such total equating to 38.0% of the issued share capital as at 31 March 2011).  
− the dis-application of pre-emption rights over allotted shares up to an aggregate nominal value equal to £447,234 
or a maximum 17,889,365 shares (representing 5% of the issued share capital as at 31 March 2011).  
During the reporting period, the Directors utilised both these authorities (and the preceding authority) to allot 9,507,937 
shares to an aggregate nominal amount of £237,698 to employees participating in MITIE’s share schemes and to 
minority shareholders in consideration for MITIE Model shares. 
− the Company to make market purchases of its own shares up to a total of 35,778,731 shares (representing 10% 
of the issued share capital as at 31 March 2011). 
On 25 May 2011, MITIE commenced a programme to purchase its shares in the market in order to offset shares 
issued on 17 August 2011, to satisfy the consideration payable for the purchase of minority interests under the MITIE 
Model. During the financial year to 31 March 2012 the Company purchased 5,400,000 shares (nominal value £135,000 
and which equates to 1.49% of the issued share capital at year end) in the market for a total consideration of £12.3m 
at an average price of 227.5p per share. The highest price paid was 255.9p per share and the lowest price paid was 
208.6p per share. It is not MITIE’s current intention to operate a formal share purchase programme outside of this 
arrangement, although it may purchase shares to offset share scheme exercise activity at its discretion. 
Further details of these authorisations are available in the notes to the 2011 Notice of AGM and shareholders are 
referred to the 2012 Notice (both are available at www.mitie.com/investors) which contains similar provisions in 
respect of the Company’s share capital.  MITIE Group PLC

Overview Business review Governance Accounts
Restrictions on the trading of shares 
Certain shares that are issued as consideration upon acquisition by the Company of the shares of minority shareholders 
in MITIE Model companies have restrictions placed upon them that both prevent the transfer of such shares and/or 
attach specific claw-back provisions for periods of up to two years following allotment. Otherwise, there are no specific 
restrictions on the size of any shareholding or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the provisions of the 
Articles of Association of the Company (available at www.mitie.com/investors_corporate-governance) and prevailing 
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between Company shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital. Details of employee share schemes are set out below and in Note 36 to the Accounts.  
Recipients of MITIE Group PLC shares received under a MITIE investment model are restricted from selling the shares 
received as consideration for a minimum of two years. The Board believes that this is a unique business model that 
has driven MITIE’s past performance and continues to ensure a close alignment of interest between MITIE shareholders 
and the management and employees of the group.  
The group operates a Share Trading and Insider Dealing Policy which provides a framework to prepare and maintain 
lists of those persons who have access to inside information relating to MITIE and explains to employees the rules 
regarding dealing in MITIE Group PLC Shares by MITIE’s employees who have been identified as insiders. A list of insider 
names is held by the Company Secretary and those identified are informed individually and asked to read, understand 
and follow the procedures detailed in the policy. Lists are maintained electronically and all identified insiders receive 
an email notification advising of the group’s relevant close periods.  
Significant interests in MITIE’s share capital 
As at 18 May 2012 the Company has been notified of the following significant holdings of voting rights in its shares under 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules:

AXA IM SA 18,003,137 4.99%
Details of the Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company are detailed within the Remuneration Report on 
pages 72 and 73.  
Other share matters 
There are a number of other agreements with provisions that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company such as bank facility agreements and employee share plans. None of these are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the normal course of the business for the group. The Directors are not aware 
of any agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss of 
office or employment that occurs solely because of a takeover bid.  

The Board remains committed to fostering and developing a culture of employee involvement in the business through 
communication with employees and equity involvement whereby employees are enabled to build a stake in the 
Company through the Company’s various equity-based incentive schemes.  
Equity-based incentives 
The Board believes that the group’s culture of employee equity involvement is a significant driver in the group’s growth 
performance and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees.  
During the year the group has continued to operate the MITIE Long Term Incentive Plan to incentivise and reward senior 
members of the MITIE management team, the Executive Share Option Scheme for certain other employees and the 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme which is open to all eligible employees of the group. In addition, following 
shareholder approval at the 2011 AGM, MITIE launched a Share Incentive Plan to all eligible employees in January 2012.   MITIE Group PLC

The group has historically grown by giving entrepreneurial managers the opportunity to create wealth by taking the risk 
of starting a new business, taking equity stakes at fair value in those new businesses in conjunction with MITIE and then, 
dependent on a pre-agreed pricing structure, offering to sell that stake to MITIE predominantly in exchange for MITIE 
shares, at the option of the Company. In 2011, the group launched a £10m Entrepreneurial Fund to back management 
teams with innovative ideas for starting mutually owned businesses. The Board remains committed to supporting 
growing businesses through the Fund which builds on a long history of partnering with management teams to start up 
new business ventures. During the year, the Company has invested over £4m from the Entrepreneurial Fund, in the form 
of MITIE Model start-ups, second generation equity schemes and other equity incentive based businesses. 
Under the terms of certain shareholder agreements and articles of association relating to MITIE Model companies, 
certain minority shareholders in such companies may provide an option for the purchase by the Company of their 
minority shares. The mechanism for calculating the price to be paid in respect of such transfer is transparent, on an 
arms-length basis, and in accordance with the pricing structure generally applicable for other transfers under the 
MITIE Model. In consideration for these purchases, the Company generally has the option to settle payment in cash 
or in MITIE shares.  
On 17 August 2011 the Company announced the purchase of certain minority shareholdings in five of its subsidiary 
companies: MITIE Cleaning Services Limited, MITIE Engineering Maintenance (Caledonia) Limited, MITIE Landscapes 
Limited, MITIE Property Services (UK) Limited (MPSUKL) and MITIE Transport Services Limited in accordance with the 
respective articles of association and shareholders’ agreements of those companies. The total maximum consideration 
for all five transactions amounted to £14.6m, being satisfied as to £2.0m in cash and as to the remaining £12.6m by the 
issue of 5,265,964 new ordinary shares of 2.5p each valued at 238.7p per share, being the closing market price per MITIE 
share on 27 July 2011. As a result of these acquisitions, MITIE now owns 100% of the issued share capital of all five 
companies with the exception of MITIE Landscapes Limited of which 89% of the issued share capital will be owned. 
The selling shareholders gave certain warranties and assurances relating to past and future performance of the relevant 
subsidiary companies. The shares issued in consideration are being held in safe custody for a maximum period of two 
years and may be sold to meet any claims that the Company may have in the future in relation to those warranties and 
assurances. Details of these structures are generally available (to the extent incorporated into the articles of association 
for individual MITIE Model companies) from Companies House at www.companieshouse.gov.uk. 
As part of the arrangements to purchase shares in MPSUKL the Company entered into an agreement to purchase 
shares held by Kenneth Robson (a relative of William Robson, an Executive Director of the Company) in MPSUKL. 
Kenneth Robson served notice on MITIE to sell 40,000 B ordinary shares in MPSUKL at the same time as other 
shareholders, for a total consideration of £0.5m. This equated to 1.11% of MPSUKL’s issued share capital. Shareholders 
approved the substantial property transaction at a general meeting held on 10 November 2011 and an application 
was made to the UK Listing Authority and the London Stock Exchange in respect of the consideration shares due to 
Kenneth Robson.  
Recipients of shares under this incentive scheme are generally restricted from selling the MITIE shares received 
as consideration for a minimum of two years. On 10 November 2011 shareholders also approved three new equity 
participation schemes under the MITIE Model which gives entrepreneurial managers the opportunity to create wealth 
by taking the risk of taking equity stakes in new businesses or more mature businesses in conjunction with MITIE and then, 
dependent on a pre-agreed pricing structure, offering to sell that stake to MITIE between the fifth and tenth years from 
the date of establishment of the business. Shareholders approved the introduction of the schemes allowing certain 
employees to share in any additional value which they help to create. At this year’s AGM the Board is seeking a 
general approval from shareholders that allows the Company to enter into such schemes pursuant to the Listing Rules. 
Communication with employees 
Communication with MITIE’s employees remains a high priority. The group communicates with employees through 
the use of group-wide mailings, employee magazines and updates, employee-focused initiatives, media networks 
and the provision of access to broadcasts of periodic financial presentations.  
We are also committed to developing our use of social media tools as an effective way of communicating with 
our people because we recognise that these methods can provide great ways of allowing our people to give 
us feedback, share ideas and engage with the wider MITIE community. 
Our social media tools are supported by a group-wide intranet system which improved communications and 
information sharing across the business and includes blog updates by the Executive Board members and 
functional teams.   MITIE Group PLC

Overview Business review Governance Accounts

Through the use of their own communication processes each of the group’s businesses is encouraged to ensure that 
employees are kept informed on group and individual business developments and social networking sites continue 
to play an important part of engagement and communication with employees.  
The group continues to operate its group-wide MITIE Stars programme to recognise and reward exceptional 
performance by its people. The MITIE’s Got Talent, group-wide talent contest continues to be supported and 
encourages employee engagement and recognition. The group Sustainability Report contains further details 
of these initiatives and is available from www.mitie.com. 
Employees remain actively involved in the group’s activities via an employee forum. This year the forum held two 
meetings and included presentations by senior management or functional heads as requested by the employee 
representatives. The Executive Board will continue to seek increasing involvement and activity of the employee 
representatives. During the year, the group launched an employee engagement survey in certain parts of the 
group to gather feedback on the employee experience.  
Employee diversity and inclusion 
The Board remains committed to developing further a culture that encourages the inclusion and diversity of all 
of the group’s employees through respecting and appreciating their differences and promoting the continuous 
development of employees through skills enhancement and training programmes. The group’s employment policies 
are designed to attract, retain, train and motivate the very best people, recognising that this can be achieved only 
through offering equal opportunities regardless of gender, race, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other 
aspect of diversity. Applications from disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. It is the policy of the group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled 
persons (including those who become disabled whilst employees of the group) should, as far as reasonably possible, 
be identical to that of other employees.  
Further information can be found within the group’s dedicated Sustainability Report which can be found at

the cash dividend to purchase additional shares in MITIE. Further details on the operation of the DRIP are included at the 
back of this report and are available from MITIE’s Registrar. 
During the reporting period, the trustees of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trusts waived dividends on shares held.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors are required to prepare 
the financial statements for the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU (IFRS) and have chosen to prepare Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
In the case of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounts, International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with IFRS 
where applicable. The Directors are also required to: 
− properly select and apply accounting policies; 
− present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
− provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific IFRS requirements is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and, 
− make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
In the parent company accounts, the Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with 
UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
− select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
− make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
− state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and, 
− prepare financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Company, safeguarding the assets, taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities, and the preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration 
report which comply with the relevant requirements of the Companies Acts, Listing Rules and Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (DTRs).  
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Financial statements 
published by the Company on this website are prepared in accordance with UK legislation which may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.  
To the best of each Director’s knowledge the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards and contained within this Annual Report and Accounts, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, and the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with the description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance with s420 of the Companies Act 2006 and in line 
with the Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium–sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
and covers all Directors who served on the Board during the reporting period. The Remuneration Committee believes 
in and promotes good governance through the adoption of the Code, compliance with the Listing Rules and due 
reference to other guidelines which together should provide shareholders with a practical framework and 
reference point.  
Certain elements of this report need to be audited by the Company’s auditors and for them to state that the audited 
information has been duly prepared in accordance with the regulations. The report therefore has been arranged into 
two sections; Section A: not subject to audit and Section B: subject to audit. The report will be presented for shareholder 
approval at the forthcoming AGM on 11 July 2012. 
Section A: The following information is not subject to audit 

Membership 
The Remuneration Committee met five times in the year and is comprised of solely Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company. The members of the Remuneration Committee are Terry Morgan CBE (Committee Chairman), David Jenkins, 
Graeme Potts, Larry Hirst CBE and Roger Matthews. Ruby McGregor-Smith CBE, Chief Executive and the Group HR 
director attended Committee meetings by invitation only, to provide further information on the Company’s 
performance and the performance and remuneration of the Executive Directors. 
Advisers to the Committee 
During the year the Committee requested the attendance of and sought advice from Kepler Associates appointed 
by the Committee in 2007. Kepler Associates provide no other services to the Company.  
Terms of reference  
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website and include: 
− shaping and agreeing with the Board the framework of policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors 
and certain aspects of the remuneration of senior management; 
− determining the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director with due regard to the 
performance of the individual in line with the agreed remuneration policy; 
− agreeing Executive Directors’ contractual terms;  
− acting on behalf of the Board, in connection with the establishment and administration of the group’s current  
and/or future share plans, including the selection of participants, the setting of option prices and the setting of 
performance targets; and, 
− drafting and approving the Directors’ remuneration report and any remuneration related resolutions to be put 
to the shareholders at the group’s AGM.  
General remuneration principles 
The Committee is responsible for formulating remuneration policies and principles that promote the success of the 
Company in creating value for shareholders over the longer term, are aligned to the corporate objectives 
and business strategy and take into full account the associated risks. The Committee understands that it is accountable 
to shareholders for the decisions made on Executive remuneration and seeks to maintain an open and constructive 
dialogue where changes to remuneration policy are being proposed. 
The remuneration policy for the Company’s Executive Directors and other group senior executives is shaped by 
the requirement to align the interests and individual performance of the Senior Executive team with those of MITIE’s 
shareholders. The policy has particular regard to the Company’s and the group’s long-standing culture of encouraging 
equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment. The Committee, and the Board, continues to believe that the 
principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the past success of the group. Consequently, in order 
to maintain and further develop MITIE’s performance culture, the Committee believes that the remuneration packages 
of the Executive Directors should continue to contain significant performance-related equity-based elements.  
The Committee continues to believe that exceptional performance should be matched with appropriate remuneration 
to attract, retain and motivate Directors and management and ensures that packages are linked to and support the 
long-term performance of the Company.

Remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy of the Company promotes and embeds the Company’s remuneration principles. 
The Company’s policy is: 
Performance linked  Company performance determines a significant element of the Executive 
remuneration packages. Only top-end performance can achieve the stretching 
targets that are reflected in the performance-linked pay elements of the packages. 
Shareholder aligned  The discretionary share schemes are based on EPS growth to align the interests of the 
senior executive team with those of shareholders. Bonuses are structured to reward the 
attainment of the strategic target of long-term sustainable, profitable growth. 
Comprehensive and simple  The overall remuneration policy is comprehensive without becoming overcomplicated 
and encourages Executives to concentrate on growth of the group. 
The Committee believes, and is satisfied that, the remuneration policy is appropriate and takes account of the group’s 
performance and strategic objectives and will continue to use this approach and policy as a framework for the setting 
of future packages, whilst having due regard for the remuneration packages offered across the group and the 
external market. 
Share ownership policy 
The Company operates a share ownership policy to encourage the build-up of equity in the Company by both its 
Executive Directors and senior executives. Under this policy, all Executive Directors are required, over time, to build and 
maintain a target shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary (150% of salary for any Executive Director 
who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of base salary). The Committee recognises that the principal 
mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the 
shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares (net of 
taxes) that vest under the LTIP. On the 1 May each year, the Committee reviews the expected target holding for the 
Executive Directors, calculated as a percentage of salary.

Note: 
1 Calculated at a share price of 279.5p being the closing market price on 31 March 2012.  

The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element (salary and certain benefits) and a variable 
performance-related element (annual performance-related bonus and long-term equity-based incentives) and has 
been structured to align the Executive Directors’ packages with the interests of shareholders. The Committee tests the 
remuneration structure regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned 
relative to the market. The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the Executive Directors’ packages is 
set out below. 
Base salary and other benefits 
The Committee’s advisers provide an annual review of total remuneration relative to sector and size comparators and 
including base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives and pension. The Committee considers this review and also 
takes account of a range of other factors when determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions 
and the responsibilities and skills of the individual Directors and in the context of salary increases across the organisation 
as a whole.  
The Executive Directors received salary increases during the year averaging less than 4% and took account of the 
range of factors described above, the continued growth and performance of the group and the performance of the 
individual Executive Directors, with due consideration of the outcomes of the benchmarking exercise. For the current 
year, the Remuneration Committee approved salary increases averaging 3%. 
The other benefits offered to the Executive Directors consist of contributions to a pension scheme, private healthcare 
and the provision of a car allowance. MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Annual bonus 
Performance-related remuneration is designed to drive MITIE’s performance and be aligned to the group strategic 
objective of achieving long-term sustainable, profitable growth. The annual bonus rewards mainly short-term Company 
performance but also has a link to longer-term performance through a link to strategic targets and partial delivery in 
MITIE Group PLC shares. 
For the 2011/2012 performance year, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 125% of salary, 
with any bonus earned above 100% of salary deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for two years and forfeited should 
the Director leave the business during this period. Up to 100% of salary is earned for the achievement of group 
budgeted profit growth and the remaining 25% of salary is assessed on a series of non-financial strategic targets. 
In setting the non-financial strategic targets, the Committee had due consideration of the longer-term success of 
the Company and the aligning of interests with shareholders and continues to believe that the performance targets 
for the annual bonus are sufficiently stretching for the maximum bonus payment. 
During the year under review, MITIE achieved the profit growth target in full and 100% of base salary will be paid in 
cash. The Remuneration Committee decided that significant overall progress had been achieved on the non-financial 
strategic targets and therefore awarded a further 25% of base salary, deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for 
two years. 
For the 2012/13 performance year, the Remuneration Committee has approved two changes to the annual bonus 
scheme structure. A sliding scale has been introduced into the element of the bonus based on financial targets which 
will pay out 90% of salary for threshold performance to 110% of salary at stretch. The upper end of the scale is intended 
to reward the achievement of exceptional financial performance and the sliding scale in general to ensure that bonus 
pay-outs are not unduly sensitive to small changes in performance. Given the extension of the financial performance 
targets, the Committee feels that a modest uplift in the bonus opportunity for financial performance from 100% to 110% 
of salary is appropriate. In addition, the bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive on the strategic objectives element 
has been increased by 25% to 50% of salary. This increase recognises her significant influence on the achievement of 
these objectives. Overall the maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive will therefore increase to 160% of base 
salary while the maximum opportunity for the other Executive Directors will increase to 135% of base salary. Any bonus 
amount over 100% of base salary will be deferred in shares for a two year period. 
Share-based incentives 
The remuneration package reinforces long-term decision making and sustainable profitable growth through the use 
of share-based incentives. For Executive Directors and certain senior executives, the principal tools designed to support 
this ethos are the Company’s LTIP (as described on page 68) and the Share Ownership Policy (as described on page 
65). Vesting of share awards under the LTIP is based on performance measured over three years which is considered 
appropriate to align rewards to Executive Directors with the strategic objectives of the Company. Certain Executive 
Directors still retain options granted under the ESOS (details of the holdings are set out in Table 5 of Section B below). 
It is the intention of the Committee not to issue further ESOS options to Executive Directors, although ESOS continues 
to be used to reward and incentivise certain other members of the senior group executive and management teams.  
Details of Executive Directors participation in the Group’s share schemes are set out below. 

All Directors are appointed for an indeterminate period of office but are subject to annual re-election at the AGM in 
accordance with the Code. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the head office 
and at the AGM. All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which provide for a maximum of 12 months’ 
notice from either party. There are no provisions for compensation on termination of employment set out within the 
contracts of the Executive Directors. The dates of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are set out below:

The Board recognises that the appointment of Executive Directors to Non-Executive positions at other companies 
can be beneficial both for the individual Director and the group through the broadening of their experience and 
knowledge. Ruby McGregor-Smith CBE receives fees of £51,000 per annum in respect of her role as a Non-Executive 
Director of Michael Page International plc and is entitled to retain any fees earned. 

Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
The fee level is designed to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the 
experience and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the group. The Non-Executive 
Directors are paid a basic fee with an additional fee for chairing a Committee, together with expenses incurred in 
carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any 
of the Company’s share schemes or the annual bonus scheme, nor do they receive pension or ancillary benefits.  
Following an external benchmarking exercise, the fees for Non-Executive Directors were increased from £40,000 to 
£46,000 effective from the 1 April 2011. An increase from £5,000 to £7,000 per annum was also approved and paid to 
Non-Executive Directors who also chair one of the Committees of the Board. This was the first increase to Non-Executive 
Director fees since 2006. No increases were made in respect of the Chairman.  
Further details of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are provided in Table 1 of Section B below. 
Non-Executive Directors’ engagement terms 
The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at MITIE’s registered office, the 
head office and at the AGM. The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for an initial term of three years which is 
terminable on either three or six months’ notice and thereafter on a rolling term.

MITIE remains committed to fostering a culture of employee involvement in the business through equity participation 
whereby employees are enabled to build a stake in the Company through the Company’s various equity-based 
incentive schemes. The Board believes that the group’s culture of employee equity involvement is a significant driver 
in the group’s growth performance and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees.  
Equity-based incentive schemes 
The group currently operates six equity-based incentive schemes as set out below and the interests of the Executive 
Directors in each of these schemes are set out in Tables 4 to 8 of Section B below.  
2001 SAYE Scheme (2001 SAYE) and 2011 SAYE Scheme (2011 Scheme) 
The 2001 and the 2011 SAYE Schemes are the Company’s non-discretionary option schemes open to all eligible 
employees and approved for HMRC purposes. Salary deductions are made and savings are used to purchase the 
options at the end of the three-year period. No options have been issued to any Directors under the 2001 SAYE Scheme. 
The 2001 SAYE Scheme expired in September 2011 and future awards may only be granted under the 2011 
SAYE Scheme rules following the adoption of new plan rules at the Company’s 2011 AGM. 
2011 Share Incentive Plan (2011 SIP) 
At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the adoption of the 2011 SIP which allows employees to use their salary 
to purchase shares in the Company. Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company shares from  
pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase plan. Shares are currently purchased monthly using employees’ 
deductions and are placed in trust. All the Executive Directors participate in this scheme with each Director 
contributing the maximum permitted under the plan rules for which details are set out in Table 4 of Section B.   MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

2001 Executive Share Option Scheme (2001 ESOS) and 2011 Executive Share Option Scheme (2011 ESOS) 
New 2011 ESOS Plan rules were adopted by shareholders at the 2011 AGM. The 2001 and 2011 ESOS are discretionary 
schemes and therefore not open to all employees of the group. The award of options under the 2011 ESOS is focused 
on employees who are below main Board level and who do not participate in the LTIP.  
Currently, 2011 ESOS is used to retain, reward and motivate employees with continuous service of six months who are 
part of the leadership team of the group (includes senior managers, managers and team leaders). The scheme has 
been approved by HMRC and options over shares to an individual limit of £30,000 can be awarded in the approved 
element of the scheme. Above £30,000, options are awarded under the unapproved (for HMRC purposes) section of 
the scheme. Overall, awards in any single year are limited to 100% of an individual’s base salary. Awards made prior 
to 2011 were granted with a single performance threshold for vesting of average growth in earnings per share over the 
three-year vesting period in excess of inflation (measured as RPI) plus 4% per annum. In order to ensure a consistent 
and aligned approach to performance criteria across other MITIE schemes, for awards granted in 2011, the Committee 
approved a performance threshold based on a nominal EPS measure and accordingly, 2011 awards were granted 
with a performance measure of 6% per annum compound growth over a three-year performance period. The scheme 
permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement of outstanding unapproved options with share 
appreciation rights. No price is payable upon award in respect of 2011 ESOS. The Board continues to believe that ESOS 
offers incentive and motivation to those employees nominated for awards and proposes to continue with awards on 
the basis explained above. 
The share options detailed in Table 5 of Section B were granted to Executive Directors prior to 2007 under the 2001 
ESOS and the performance conditions that applied at the date of grant required a percentage growth in the 
Company’s earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over the period from the date of 
grant of the option to the date on which the option first became exercisable. The performance conditions relating to 
the awards to Directors detailed below are the same as for any other member of the schemes who received awards 
at the same time. Since these grants to Ruby McGregor-Smith CBE and Suzanne Baxter there have been no grants to 
Directors under the 2001 or 2011 ESOS (both under the unapproved part and the HMRC-approved part), and it is the 
Committee’s current policy that equity-based incentives for Directors will be based solely upon LTIP awards.  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP is a discretionary scheme rather than being open to all employees of the group, and is focused on incentivising 
Executive Directors and senior management. Awards under the LTIP may be made, either through a joint-ownership 
structure or through direct grants in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares. The Committee 
may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based 
awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so. An award may not be granted under the current LTIP 
after 26 July 2017, when the current scheme expires. No payment (other than in respect of any individual recipient 
electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where appropriate) is required for the grant of an award.  
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable. The scheme rules, in line with standard 
industry practice, contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability and/or death. 
In the event of a change of control of the group, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject 
to the discretion of the Committee. 
The upper limit on the market value (as at grant) of awards that an individual Executive Director may receive in any 
financial year is 200% of annual base salary. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, the rules allow for 
awards of up to 250% of an employee’s annual base salary. 
The performance criteria for the LTIP is based on growth in the EPS of MITIE. The Committee continues to believe that 
EPS is a key long-term performance measure for MITIE as it is aligned with the group’s strategy and KPIs but recognises 
that measures need to be reviewed regularly to ensure that they continue to align with the group’s strategy and 
are effective as an incentive. The Committee is currently reviewing the performance criteria for 2012 LTIP awards. 
Any significant changes will be discussed with major shareholders in advance and disclosed in next year’s report.  
Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met. All awards 
are subject to performance conditions that require adjusted EPS to exceed certain performance thresholds over 
a three-year period. Where EPS growth is less than a ‘lower performance threshold’ no awards will vest. Awards vest 
in full when EPS growth is equal to, or more than, an ‘upper performance threshold’. Vesting is on a straight-line basis 
for performance between these levels.  
At the time when the LTIP scheme was introduced, RPI growth was considered a broad proxy for underlying 
economic growth in the UK. For this reason, the EPS performance measure was linked to RPI. However, the Committee 
believes this is no longer a valid assumption and the correlation between the Company’s earnings growth and UK RPI 
growth is increasingly limited, since RPI-linked year-on-year uplifts to contract values are not a big feature of the  MITIE Group PLC

MITIE business model. During the year the Committee consulted with its shareholders on this issue, and following this has 
replaced the real EPS growth targets with nominal EPS growth targets for 2011 (and future) LTIP awards.  
Accordingly, for LTIPs granted in 2011, the lower performance threshold (at which 25% of an award vests) is 7% per 
annum and the upper performance threshold is 13% per annum. Awards to all Executive Directors during the year were 
200% of salary.  
During the year the Committee assessed the outcome of the 2008 LTIP awards. The vesting of these awards was 
conditional on achieving performance within the following performance scale – the lower performance threshold 
(at which 25% of an award vests) was RPI + 5% per annum and the upper performance threshold was RPI + 14% per 
annum. The upper performance threshold applicable to the 2008 LTIP award was assessed to have been achieved 
and consequently the awards granted in 2008 vested in full on 30 June 2011.  
Table 6 in Section B provides details of the LTIP awards granted to, and exercised by, the Executive Directors, as well 
as the performance targets governing the vesting of LTIP awards granted in prior years.  
Share dilution 
The Company manages dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of  
all employee schemes (ESOS and SAYE) and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes (ESOS). In calculating compliance 
with these guidelines the Company allocates available ‘headroom’ on a ten-year flat-line basis, making adjustments 
for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital.  
LTIP awards are satisfied through the market purchase of shares held by the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 
2007 and the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2008. The potential dilution of the Company’s issued share capital 
is set out below in respect of all outstanding awards granted under the Company’s equity-based incentive schemes 
which are to be satisfied through the allotment of new shares.

The graph below shows the total shareholder return performance of MITIE shares compared with the FTSE 250 and 
FTSE 350 Support Services indices over a five-year period to 31 March 2012. The Committee is of the opinion that these 
comparators provide a clear picture of the performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable 
size as well as a specific group of companies within the same sector. Total shareholder return is calculated according 
to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and assumes that 
all dividends are reinvested. 
The market price of the Company’s shares as at 31 March 2012 was 279.5p. The highest and lowest prices during the 
year were 288.3p and 196.1p respectively.

The pension benefits of Directors who are members of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme are set 
out in Table 2 below. The transfer values of the Directors’ accrued benefits under the defined benefit pension scheme 
calculated in a manner consistent with retirement benefit schemes (which do not represent a sum paid or payable 
to the individual Director) are set out in Table 3.

The benefits of the Executive Directors who are members of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
are based on a pensionable salary capped at £123,600. The Company made contributions to the group’s defined 
benefit scheme on behalf of the two Directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 10% (2011: 10%) of the 
value of the benefit cap of £123,600. In addition, the two Directors received a salary supplement of 20% of salary 
(2011: 20%). 
Suzanne Baxter is not a member of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme. The value of the pension 
benefits provided to Suzanne Baxter mirror the value of the pension benefits provided to the other Executive Directors 
under the capped defined benefit arrangements, albeit that her benefits are currently provided through a separate 
defined contribution arrangement. Following an assessment of the value of her defined contribution pension scheme 
assets as at 31 March 2011, no pension contributions were required for Suzanne Baxter for the year ended 31 March 
2012 (2011: Nil). Suzanne Baxter received a salary supplement of 20% of base salary (2011: 20%).  
Given the complexity and on-going annual cost around determining comparable values of pension benefits, the 
Remuneration Committee approved the decision to allow Suzanne Baxter entrance into the MITIE Group PLC Defined 
Benefit Pension Scheme, ceasing all further contributions into the defined contribution scheme. Suzanne Baxter entered 
the scheme in April 2012. There is no change to the value of Suzanne Baxter's total remuneration as the result of this 
change.

For the year ended 31 March 2012 
We have audited the group financial statements of MITIE 
Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2012 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows and the related notes 1 to 39. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2012 and of its profit for the year 
then ended; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the group 
financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
− certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
− the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ 
report in relation to going concern; 
− the part of the Corporate governance statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review; and 
− certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board on Directors’ remuneration. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year 
ended 31 March 2012 and on the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

For the year ended 31 March 2012 

Basis of preparation 
The group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 are prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted for use in the European Union and therefore the group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
As more fully detailed in the Directors’ report: Corporate Governance statement, the group’s financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The group’s financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments which are required to be measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011. 
The following amendments and interpretations are also effective for the first time in the current year but have had no 
impact on the results or financial position of the group: 
− IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’; 
− Amendment to IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement’; 
− IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’; and 
− Amendments resulting from May 2010 Annual Improvements to IFRSs. 
The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective (and in some cases have not yet 
been adopted by the EU): 
− Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ – transfers of financial assets; 
− IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’; 
− Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ – recovery of underlying assets; 
− IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’; 
− IAS 28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’; 
− IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’;  
− IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’; 
− IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’; 
− IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; 
− Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’; 
− Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ – presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income;  
− Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ – offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities; and 
− Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ – offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. 
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material financial 
impact on the group’s financial statements in the period of initial application except as follows: 
− Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ will impact the measurement of various components representing 
movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the group’s total obligation. 
It is likely that following the replacement of expected returns on plan assets with a net finance cost in the income 
statement, the profit for the period will be reduced and accordingly other comprehensive income increased. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards 
and interpretations at this stage.  MITIE Group PLC

Overview Governance Accounts Business review

Significant accounting policies under IFRS 
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the group’s IFRS financial information are set 
out below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of MITIE Group PLC and all its subsidiaries. 
The financial statements of the parent company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (with the exception of the acquired Dalkia companies). Adjustments are made in the 
consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist between UK GAAP and IFRS. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from inter-group transactions, 
have been eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred out of the group. The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and 
associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the group.  
Interests of non-controlling interest shareholders are measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets and liabilities recognised. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result 
in a loss of control are accounted for within shareholders’ equity. No gain or loss is recognised on such transactions and 
goodwill is not re-measured. Any difference between the change in the non-controlling interest and the fair value 
of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are 
classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, 
which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost 
of the business combination over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Where applicable, the consideration for an acquisition includes any assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in such fair values are 
adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they result from additional information, obtained within one year from 
the acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. All other subsequent changes 
in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are recognised in accordance with IAS 39, 
either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as equity are not recognised. 
Any business combinations prior to 1 April 2010 were accounted for using the standards in place prior to the adoption 
of IFRS 3 (revised 2008) which differ in the following respects; transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition 
formed part of the acquisition costs; contingent consideration was recognised if, and only if, the group had a present 
obligation, the economic outflow was more likely than not and a reliable estimate was determinable; and subsequent 
adjustments to the contingent consideration were recognised as part of goodwill. MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
84


Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.  
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. It is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is 
not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are 
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill 
is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior 
to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Joint Ventures and associates 
The group has an interest in joint ventures which are entities in which the group has joint control of financial and 
operating policies. The group also has an interest in associates which are entities in which the group has significant 
influence. 
The group accounts for its interest in joint ventures and associates using the equity method. Under the equity method 
the group’s share of the post-tax result of joint ventures and associates is reported as a single line item in the 
consolidated income statement. The group’s interest in joint ventures and associates is carried in the consolidated 
balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of net assets. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Software and development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, 
if it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset 
can be measured reliably. 
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that they may be impaired. Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses 
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over its useful life. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue represents income recognised in respect of services provided during 
the period (stated net of value added tax) and is earned predominantly within the United Kingdom. 
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at 
the balance sheet date. Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at the contractual rates as labour 
hours and tasks are delivered and direct expenses incurred. In other cases, where services provided reflect a 
contractual arrangement to deliver an indeterminate number of acts over the contract term, revenue is recognised 
on a straight-line basis unless this is not an accurate reflection of the work performed. Where a straight-line basis is 
not appropriate, for example if specific works on contracts represent a significant element of the whole, revenue is 
recognised based on the percentage of completion method, based on the proportion of costs incurred at the balance 
sheet date relative to the total estimated cost of completing the contracted work.   MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
85
Overview Governance Accounts Business review

Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and 
estimates in respect of amounts to be invoiced after the year end. Profits are recognised on long-term contracts 
where the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. In calculating this, the percentage of completion 
method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated cost. Cost includes direct staff costs 
and outlays. Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each contract immediately such losses 
are forecast. 
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less 
amounts billed on account. To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are 
included in creditors as gross amounts due to customers. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Leasing 
Finance leases, which transfer to the group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the 
lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
charged directly against income. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. Any lease incentives are amortised on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable period for which the 
group has contracted to lease the asset, together with any further terms for which the group has the option to continue 
to lease the asset if, at the inception of the lease, it is judged to be reasonably certain that the group will exercise 
the option. 
Foreign currency 
The financial statements of each of the group’s businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that 
business. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the 
date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, 
are included in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items 
carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of  
non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary 
items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments arising on their acquisition, are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Income and expenses are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising are recognised directly in equity in the group’s hedging and translation reserve. On disposal of a 
foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation 
shall be recognised in the income statement.   MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Retirement benefit costs 
The group operates and participates in a number of defined benefit schemes. In respect of the schemes in which the 
group participates, the group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of its participation 
which is for a fixed period only. 
In addition, the group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees. 
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented 
in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise 
is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset 
resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in 
future contributions to the plan.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are 
not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised, based upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less expected residual value of the assets over their estimated useful 
lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property – over 50 years 
Leasehold improvements    – period of the lease 
Plant and vehicles    – 3–10 years  MITIE Group PLC

Overview Governance Accounts Business review

Annually the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 
the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition 
and location. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion and estimated selling costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the 
contractual rights and obligations are discharged or expire. 
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the group’s past experience of collecting 
payments, the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable 
changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade 
receivable is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits 
and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities comprise certain trade and other payables and financing liabilities including bank and other 
borrowings and are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost with the exception 
of derivative financial instruments which are either classified as fair value through profit and loss or may be accounted 
for using hedge accounting. Bank and other borrowings are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction 
of transaction costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  MITIE Group PLC

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The group uses derivative financial instruments including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign 
exchange contracts to manage the group’s exposure to financial risks associated with interest rates and foreign 
exchange. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value, determined by reference to market rates, at each 
balance sheet date and included as financial assets or liabilities as appropriate. The resulting gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event 
the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.  
The group may designate certain hedging instruments including derivatives as either fair value hedges, cash flow 
hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the 
group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. 
Fair value hedges 
Hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are 
recorded in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement relating to the hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. 
Cash flow hedges 
Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in cash flows that are 
attributable to a particular risk associated with either a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction. The 
effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity within the group’s translation and hedging 
reserve. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.  
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or 
loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the 
recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-
financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from 
equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. Hedge 
accounting is discontinued when the group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised 
in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
Hedges are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the foreign currency exposure to changes in the 
group’s share in the net assets of a foreign operation. Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the 
hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the group’s translation and hedging reserve. 
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Gains or losses on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit 
or loss in the same way as exchange differences relating to the foreign operation as described above.   MITIE Group PLC

Overview Governance Accounts Business review

Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the group expects some or all of a 
provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the 
income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost. 
Bid, mobilisation and pre-contract costs 
Rendering of services 
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award or full recovery of the 
costs is virtually certain. 
The confirmation of the preferred bidder for a contract by a client is the point at which the award of a contract is 
considered to be virtually certain. Costs incurred after that point, but before the commencement of services under the 
contract, are defined as mobilisation costs. These costs are capitalised and included within trade and other receivables 
on the balance sheet provided that the costs relate directly to the contract, are separately identifiable, can be 
measured reliably and that the future net cash inflows from the contract are estimated to be no less than the amounts 
capitalised.  
The capitalised mobilisation costs are amortised over the life of the contract, generally on a straight-line basis, or on a 
basis to reflect the profile of work to be performed over the life of the contract if the straight-line basis is not considered 
to be appropriate for the specific contract to which the costs relate. If the contract becomes loss making, any 
unamortised costs are written off immediately. 
Construction contracts 
In the case of construction contracts, pre-contract costs that are direct costs associated with securing a contract and 
which can be separately identified and measured reliably are included in the cost of the contract when the realisation 
of income from the contract is virtually certain. Their treatment is as for mobilisation costs above.  
Share-based payments 
The group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options and 
awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest. Save As You Earn (SAYE) options are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute 
to the scheme, resulting in an acceleration of the remainder of the related expense. 
The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has 
applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 April 2005.  MITIE Group PLC

Critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management 
has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity. 
This is measured by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are discussed below. 
Measurement and impairment of intangible assets 
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future 
cash flows and the selection of suitable discount rates. Determining whether goodwill and other intangible assets 
are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of cash-generating units and also 
the selection of appropriate discount rates to use in order to calculate present values. The carrying value of goodwill 
and other intangible assets is £413.5m (2011: £397.7m) at the balance sheet date; see Notes 13 and 14. Management 
do not consider that any reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment. 
Measurement of provisions and defined benefit pension obligations  
The group’s provisions (per Note 30) comprise deferred contingent consideration and insurance reserve. 
The measurement of provisions and defined benefit obligations requires judgement. In particular, the calculation 
of defined benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, 
future returns on assets and future contribution rates. The present value of defined benefit obligations at the balance 
sheet date is £148.5m (2011: £126.8m); see Note 37.  
The sensitivity of defined benefit pension obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown below:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that 
are expected to benefit from that business combination. Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs, which align with 
the business segments, as this is how goodwill is monitored by the group internally.

The group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value 
in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and 
direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry 
growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future 
changes in the market. 
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent one year financial budgets approved by the 
Board, extrapolated for four future years by a growth rate applicable to each unit with a terminal value using a 2% 
inflationary growth rate assumption.  
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs range from 8.5% to 9.0% (2011: 9.5% to 10.0%) and 
are derived from the Company’s post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which was 7.0% (2011: 8.0%) at 31 March 
2012, and adjusted for the risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates. All CGUs have the same access to 
the group’s treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations. 
No reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment of the goodwill of any 
of the CGUs.

Before accepting new customers, the group uses external credit scoring systems to assess the potential customer’s 
credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring are updated as appropriate. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the group considers any change in the credit quality of the 
trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is 
limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further 
credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debt. The average credit period taken on sales of 
services was 35 days (2011: 40 days). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.  MITIE Group PLC

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. The carrying amount of the assets approximates their fair value.  
At 31 March 2012 £6.5m (2011: £7.0m) of cash and cash equivalents were held in foreign currencies. 
Included in cash and cash equivalents are deposits totalling £7.6m (2011: £9.1m) held by the group’s insurance 
subsidiary, which are not readily available for the general purposes of the group. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high  
credit-ratings assigned by recognised international credit-rating agencies and are managed through regular review.

In addition the group has £0.4m (2011: £0.4m) of capital losses.  
The UK Government announced a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012, which 
was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012. The reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets 
and liabilities to reflect the rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse has resulted in a deferred tax credit 
of £0.6m to the income statement. The UK Government has indicated that it intends to enact further reductions in the 
main tax rate of 1% each year down to 22% by 1 April 2014. Future rate reductions would further reduce the UK deferred 
tax assets and liabilities recognised but the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at the time.   MITIE Group PLC

at amortised cost. The Directors estimate that their carrying value approximates their fair value. Derivative financial 
instruments, which are included in financing liabilities, are initially recognised at fair value at the date the contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as 
hedges for which hedge accounting can be applied (see Note 27). The carrying value of the private placement notes 
at 31 March 2012 includes a fair value adjustment for interest rate and currency risk of £0.8m (2011: £2.1m). The fair 
value of the private placement notes is not significantly different from their carrying value.

of derivative financial instruments (see Note 27) and £1.6m (2011: £nil) of loan notes. 
Included in bank loans are £16.6m (2011: £11.8m) of loans denominated in foreign currency. 
Private placement notes 
On 16 December 2010, the group issued US$96.0m and £40.0m of private placement (‘PP’) notes in the United States 
Private Placement market. The PP notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with other senior unsecured indebtedness 
of the group. In order to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations and to manage the group’s finance costs 
through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, the group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps. The swap 
contracts have the same duration and other critical terms as the borrowings and are considered to be highly effective. 
The amount, maturity and interest terms of the PP notes are as shown below: 
Tranche Maturity date Amount Interest terms Swap interest
7 year 18 December 2017 US$48m US$ fixed at 3.39% £ fixed at 3.88%

interest rates which are currently determined at 1.3% over LIBOR. Details of the group’s contingent liabilities are

Overview Governance Accounts Business review

The group’s Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the group. 
These risks include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The group seeks to minimise 
the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The use of financial 
derivatives is governed by group policies and reviewed regularly. Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments. 
Hedging activities 
Cash flow hedges 
The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. Bi-annual fixed interest 
cash flows arising over the periods to December 2017 and denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market 
are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in sterling. The group also holds a number of forward 
exchange currency contracts designated as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions. All cash flow hedges 
were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2012. 
Fair value hedges 
The group holds a number of cross currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. Fixed interest 
cash flows denominated in US$ from the US Private Placement market are exchanged for floating interest cash 
flows denominated in sterling. All fair value hedges were assessed as being highly effective as at 31 March 2012. 
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations 
Included in bank loans at 31 March 2012 was a borrowing of €9.5m (2011: €9.5m) which has been designated as 
a hedge of the net investment in the Republic of Ireland business of Dalkia FM in Ireland and is being used to hedge 
the group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment. Gains or losses on the translation of the borrowing 
are transferred to equity to offset gains or losses on the translation of the net investment. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The carrying values of derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date were as follows: 
 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated 
based on a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments. 
Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability; and  
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based 
on observable market data.  
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into level 2. 
The cross currency interest rate swaps are net settled and other contracts are gross settled.

Foreign currency risk 
The group has limited exposure to transactional foreign currency risk from trading transactions in currencies other than 
the functional currency of individual group entities. The group considers the need to hedge its exposures appropriately 
and will enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate any significant risks. 
The group has some exposure to translational foreign currency risk from the translation of its operations in the Republic 
of Ireland and other European territories. The group considers the need to hedge its exposures appropriately.  
In addition, on 16 December 2010, the group issued US$96.0m and £40.0m of private placement (‘PP’) notes in the 
United States Private Placement market and this has been fully hedged into sterling using cross currency interest rate 
swaps (see Note 26). 
Interest rate risk  
The group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates. The group’s Treasury function reviews its risk 
management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order to 
manage interest rate risk. Having issued US$96.0m and £40.0m of private placement (‘PP’) notes in the United States 
Private Placement fixed rate market on 16 December 2010, the group has swapped US$48m into floating rate debt 
(see Note 26). 
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit after tax 
for the year ended 31 March 2012 and reserves would decrease/increase by £0.5m (2011: £0.6m).  
Credit risk  
The group’s credit risk to all of its banks and financial counterparties is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally 
reported quarterly. The value of business placed with financial institutions is reviewed on a daily basis. 
The group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. 
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are 
net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event 
which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. In addition, 
where appropriate, certain debts are subject to credit insurance. 
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties 
and customers. 
Liquidity risk 
The group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the 
group’s assets and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations. Bank facilities which allow for appropriate 
headroom in the group’s daily cash movements are then arranged. Details of our bank facilities can be found in 
Note 26.

All financial liabilities, other than financing liabilities, are interest free. Details of financing liabilities are given in Note 26. 
All financial assets are recoverable within one year, except for those disclosed as non-current in Note 18. 
Market risk  
The group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates. The group’s Treasury function reviews its risk 
management strategy on a regular basis and will appropriately enter into derivative financial instruments in order 
to manage interest rate risk. Group policy is not to trade in financial instruments. 
Capital risk management  
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity. The capital structure of the group 
consists of net debt per Note 29 and equity per the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The group’s capital structure is reviewed regularly. The group is not subject to externally imposed regulatory capital 
requirements with the exception of those applicable to the group’s captive insurance subsidiary, which is monitored 
on a regular basis.

The average remaining lease term is 31 months (2011: 38 months). For the year ended 31 March 2012, the average 
effective borrowing rate was 3.1% (2011: 2.9%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed 
repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. All lease obligations 
are denominated in sterling. 
The fair value of the group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. The group’s obligations under 
finance leases are protected by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

During the year deferred contingent consideration of £2.9m in respect of the acquisition in 2008 of MITIE Tilley Roofing 
Limited (formerly D W Tilley Limited) was settled in cash due to attainment of profit targets. This was £0.2m higher than 
the amount provided for at 31 March 2011 due to better than expected performance. 
During the year deferred contingent consideration of £0.9m in respect of the acquisition in 2010 of Dalkia FM in Ireland 
was settled in cash due to attainment of certain targets. The remaining £0.9m of deferred contingent consideration 
was not payable and was recognised in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised 2008). 
The provision for insurance claims represents amounts payable by MITIE Reinsurance Company Limited in respect of 
outstanding claims incurred at the balance sheet dates. These amounts will become payable as each year’s claims 
are settled.  MITIE Group PLC

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Utilyx Holdings Limited is attributable to the underlying profitability of the 
companies in the acquired group, expected profitability arising from new business and the anticipated future operating 
synergies arising from assimilation into MITIE. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income 
tax purposes. 
Provision is made for deferred contingent consideration at the Directors’ best estimate of the likely future obligation. 
Deferred contingent consideration of up to £1.2m, which may become payable before January 2013 subject to certain 
profit and other targets being attained, is included above.

* As disclosed in the Half-yearly report for the six months to 30 September 2011, the purchase of 40,000 B Ordinary shares in the capital of MITIE Property Services (UK) 
Limited from Kenneth Robson (a relative of Bill Robson, a Director of MITIE) was approved for the purposes of section 190 of the Companies Act 2006 by MITIE 
shareholders at a General Meeting on 10 November 2011. The acquisition was not reflected in the results to 30 September 2011 as approval was not obtained until 
after the period end, but it has been included in the results to 31 March 2012 and is therefore included in the above disclosure. 
The adoption of IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (revised 2008) in the year ended 31 March 
2011 has resulted in the difference between the change in non-controlling interests and the consideration paid being 
recognised in retained earnings. Prior to adoption of the revised standard this amount was recognised in goodwill. 
Acquisition related costs included within other items (Note 5) amounted to £1.8m. 
Entities acquired during the year contributed £2.7m to revenue and £0.1m to the group’s operating profit before other 
items for the period. If the acquisitions had taken place at the start of the period, the group’s revenue and operating 
profit before other items would have been approximately £2,011m and £112m respectively.

Purchase of FM business of Dalkia in Ireland 
On 25 June 2010, MITIE acquired 100% of DFM Providers Limited (subsequently renamed MITIE Facilities Management 
Limited) and Dalkia Energy and Facilities Limited (subsequently renamed MITIE Limited), together Dalkia FM in Ireland, 
for total consideration of up to €12.5m. The transaction has been accounted for by the acquisition method of 
accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (2008). Below we provide final information on the acquisition. The fair value of net

During the year deferred contingent consideration of £0.9m in respect of the acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland was 
settled in cash due to attainment of certain targets. The remaining £0.9m of deferred contingent consideration was not 
payable and was recognised in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised 2008). 

The Company is party with other group companies to cross guarantees of each other’s bank and other borrowings, 
commitments and overdrafts of £390.8m (2011: £368.0m). 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims that are 
in the ordinary course of business. The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, 
either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the group’s financial position. 
Deferred contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been accrued at the Directors’ best estimate of the likely 
future obligation of £1.2m (2011: £4.5m) per Note 30. The actual amounts payable may vary up to a maximum of £1.2m 
(2011: £6.9m) dependent upon the results of the acquired businesses. 
In addition, the group and its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance, issued 
by financial institutions on its behalf, amounting to £33.2m (2011: £34.9m) in the ordinary course of business. These are 
not expected to result in any material financial loss.

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the group for certain of its office properties and hire of vehicles 
and other equipment. These leases have average durations ranging from three to ten years. No arrangements have 
been entered into for contingent rental payments. 

Equity-settled share option schemes 
The Company has four share option schemes: 
The MITIE Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP was introduced in 2007. The awards of shares or rights to acquire shares (the awards) are offered to a small 
number of key senior management. Where offered as options the exercise price is nil. The vesting period is three years. 
If the awards remain unexercised after a period of four years from the date of grant, the awards expire. The awards 
may be forfeited if the employee leaves the group. Before the awards can be exercised, a performance condition 
must be satisfied; the number of awards that vest is determined by a sliding scale based on growth in earnings per 
share over a three-year period. 
The group also awards performance-related bonuses for Executive Directors which are deferred in shares and are 
accounted for as a share-based payment charge. 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme exercise price is equal to the average market value of the shares over the five day 
period immediately preceding the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised 
after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves 
the group. Before options can be exercised, a performance condition must be satisfied; the performance condition is 
linked to the percentage growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 SAYE scheme 
The SAYE scheme is open to all employees. The exercise price is not less than 80.0% of the market value of the shares 
on the day preceding the date on which invitations to participate in the scheme are issued. For options granted prior 
to September 2008, the vesting period is five years. For options granted in September 2008 and thereafter, the vesting 
period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of six months from the date of vesting, the options 
expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the group. 
The Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
The SIP was introduced in 2011 and is a non-discretionary scheme open to all eligible UK resident employees. Under the 
scheme, eligible employees are invited to invest in Partnership Shares which are purchased in the market on their behalf 
and held in a UK employee benefit trust. One Matching Share is awarded for every ten Partnership Shares purchased 
and have a holding period of three years. Matching Shares are funded by way of market purchases.   MITIE Group PLC

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 243p 
(2011: 206p). The options outstanding at 31 March 2012 had exercise prices (other than nil in the case of the LTIP) 
ranging from 117p – 254p (2011: 117p – 254p) and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.6 years 
(2011: 4.4 years). In the year ended 31 March 2012, options were granted in August 2011 in respect of the LTIP and 
Executive share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates 
was £6.1m. In the year ended 31 March 2011, options were granted in June, July and August 2010 in respect of the LTIP, 
Executive and SAYE share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on 
those dates was £4.4m. 
The fair value of options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are 
as follows: 
 2012 2011
Share price (p) 191–243 191–230
Exercise price (p) 0–254 0–254
Expected volatility (%) 28–36 28–36

Risk-free rate (%) 1.48–5.25 1.49–5.25
Expected dividends (%) 2.22–4.10 2.22–3.93
Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes. The expected life 
is based upon historical data and has been adjusted based on management’s best estimates for the effects of  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Defined contribution schemes 
The group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees. The assets 
of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in funds controlled by the scheme providers. The group 
paid employer contributions of £7.9m (2011: £8.1m) during the year. As at 31 March 2012, contributions of £0.6m 
(2011: £0.5m) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. 
Defined benefit schemes 
Group defined benefit scheme 
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme where 
MITIE Group PLC is the principal employer.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from the group. Contributions to the scheme are charged to the 
income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees’ working lives with the group.  
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0% and 66% of final 
salary on attainment of a retirement age of 65. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The scheme 
is a funded scheme. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the group scheme’s assets and the present value of their defined benefit 
obligations was carried out as at 1 April 2011 by Chris Vaughan-Williams, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, from 
Aon Hewitt Limited. The next triennial valuation is due as at 1 April 2014. 
Other defined benefit schemes 
Grouped together under ‘Other schemes’ is one (2011: one) scheme in which the group is a participating employer 
and a number of schemes to which the group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers’ 
defined benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees. These valuations are updated by the actuaries 
at each balance sheet date. The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost 
and past service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
For the Admitted Body Schemes, which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme, the group will only 
participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts. The group is required to pay regular contributions as 
decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes’ Schedule of Contributions. In a number 
of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess is recovered from the body that the 
employees transferred from. In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the group will be required to 
pay any deficit (as determined by the Scheme Actuary) that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme. 
Assumptions 
In the prior year, the UK government has announced that it will use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation 
rather than the Retail Price Index (RPI) to determine the level of future statutory pension increases. This was treated as a 
change in defined pension benefits and recognised as a negative past service cost. A credit of £4.1m was recognised 
in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2011.

Future pensioners at 65 – female  91.0 92.0
Mortality for the other schemes is that used by the relevant scheme actuary. 
The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return of each asset 
class. The expected return on equities is the sum of dividend growth and capital growth net of investment expenses. 
The return on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term bonds. The expected return on property has 
been set equal to that expected on equities less a margin. The expected return on other assets is the rate earned 
by the scheme on cash and alternate assets. 
The sensitivity of defined benefit obligations to changes in principal actuarial assumptions is shown in Note 2.

The estimated contributions expected to be paid to the group scheme during the current financial year are £4.6m 
(2011: £4.0m) and to other schemes £0.4m (2011: £0.3m). 
As at 31 March 2012, contributions of £0.7m (2011: £0.8m) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been 
paid over to the schemes. 

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on 
consolidation and are not disclosed in this Note. 
During the year, the group derived £9.1m (2011: £5.6m) of construction revenue from contracts with joint ventures 
and associated undertakings. At 31 March 2012 £1.5m (2011: £nil) of invoices were outstanding.  
The Company purchased 40,000 B Ordinary shares in the capital of MITIE Property Services (UK) Limited from Kenneth 
Robson (a relative of Bill Robson, a Director of MITIE), for a total consideration of £553,600 by the allotment of 227,482 
Ordinary shares in MITIE, and £10,600 in cash. This transaction was approved for the purposes of section 190 of the 
Companies Act 2006 by MITIE shareholders at a General Meeting on 10 November 2011.  
No other material contract or arrangement has been entered into during the year, nor existed at the end of the year, 
in which a Director had a material interest.  
The group’s key management personnel are the Directors and Non-Executive Directors whose remuneration is disclosed 
in the audited section of the Directors’ remuneration report. The share-based payment charge for key management 
personnel was £1.0m (2011: £0.8m).

Overview Governance Accounts Business review

 
We have audited the parent company financial 
statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2012 which comprise the Company Balance 
Sheet and the related notes 40 to 53. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 March 2012; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
− the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and 
− the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
− adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
− the parent company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
− certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2012.

Overview Governance Accounts Business review

For the year ended 31 March 2012 

Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by company law. They have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and law.  
As more fully detailed in the Directors’ report: Corporate governance statement, the Company’s financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.  
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is 
charged so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis 
as follows: 
Plant and vehicles  3–10 years 
Software and development costs 5–10 years 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed 
the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of 
those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is charged to the profit and loss 
account, net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost. 
Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more 
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based upon tax rates 
and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Timing differences arise 
from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they 
are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation 
of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates 
where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.  MITIE Group PLC  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
124


Financial instruments  
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts are recognised in the profit and loss account where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in the profit and loss account and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.  
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options 
and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding 
expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Save As You Earn (SAYE) options are treated as 
cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme, resulting in an acceleration of the remainder of the 
related expense. Options over the Company’s shares awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are 
accounted for as a capital contribution within the carrying value of Investments in subsidiary undertakings. 
Pensions  
Pension costs represent amounts paid to one of the group’s pension schemes. For the purposes of FRS 17 ‘Retirement 
Benefits’ the Company has been unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the group defined 
benefit pension scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore the Company is accounting for contributions 
to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the 
details of the IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ net pension liability of £17.2m (2011: £3.0m).  

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and 
loss account for the year. MITIE Group PLC reported a profit after taxation for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 
of £32.8m (2011: £32.9m). 
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services to the Company was £33,000 (2011: £50,000).  
Detailed disclosures of Directors’ remuneration and share options are given in the audited section of the Directors’ 
remuneration report contained in the consolidated financial statements.

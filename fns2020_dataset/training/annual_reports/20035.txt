04 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Jean-Paul Luksic
We continued to concentrate 
on what we know best – 
producing copper, reducing 
costs and building a platform 
for long-term growth.
Dear shareholders,
This year was one of consolidation. 
In 2013 we achieved a record year 
of production while focusing on cost 
control and productivity in a challenging 
macroeconomic environment with declining 
commodity prices. Those macroeconomic 
challenges continued through 2014 and 
were further complicated by heightened 
geopolitical tensions around the world that 
has created an atmosphere of uncertainty 
for investors. As a Group, we continued 
to concentrate on what we know best – 
producing copper, reducing costs and building 
a platform for long-term growth.
Our three-pillar strategy remains unchanged. 
We focus first on optimising our existing 
operations, where investment is generally 
most effective and generates the fastest 
and highest returns. Secondly, we look 
for sustainable, organic growth in the 
areas around our operations, particularly in 
the Los Pelambres and Centinela mining 
districts, where we benefit from our existing 
developed infrastructure and the ability to 
share common services. Finally, we look for 
growth further afield where considerable and 
more diverse opportunities exist, but where 
we do not have the benefit of any organic 
synergies. We have been active in all three 
areas during the course of this year.
The completion of the concentrator expansion 
at Centinela in 2015 will increase production 
there, and in our two mining districts we are 
advancing our Encuentro Oxides, Pelambres 
Incremental Expansion, and Centinela Second 
Concentrator projects. As part of the second 
pillar, we will bring our new Antucoya mine 
into production during the second quarter of 
2015, while further afield we consolidated 
the ownership of the Twin Metals Minnesota 
project in the United States. Together, these 
projects provide the Group with a strong 
pipeline for growth over the coming years. 
I am especially pleased that when Antucoya 
is commissioned it will be the first major 
copper mine in Chile to be brought into 
production on budget and on time for five 
years. This will be a major achievement and 
reflects all of the hard work that our team 
and our contractors have put into making 
the project a success. Construction has 
taken place in a more benign cost and 
working environment than we have seen 
for many years. This has also contributed 
to the success of the project and is one of 
the reasons we decided to proceed with it 
at a time when others were curtailing their 
own investment programmes. Antucoya is 
expected to come on-stream following a 
period when copper prices have declined to 
five-year lows and are expected to recover 
into the next upturn.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Total revenue for the year was 
$5,290.4 million, 11.4% lower than last 
year, primarily reflecting the decline in metal 
prices, but also slightly lower sales volumes. 
This decline was reflected in EBITDA, which 
coupled with increased cash costs, fell by 
17.8% to $2,221.6 million, generating an 
EBITDA margin of 42.0%.
Earnings per share for the year were 61.0 
cents, excluding the $142.2 million deferred 
tax provision (and 46.6 cents per share 
including the provision) resulting from the 
changes in the Chilean tax law during 2014. 
This was 5.9 cents lower than in 2013, 
reflecting lower revenue and the $76.3 million 
increase in depreciation at Centinela. 
Cash flow from operations remained healthy 
at $2.5 billion, $151 million lower than last 
year with the Group’s attributable net cash 
reducing to $315.4 million by the end of 
the year.
Antofagasta plc | 05
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OVERVIEW LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Total dividend for 2014, representing 
a 35% pay-out ratio.
21.5cents
The Company’s dividend policy is to 
determine the appropriate dividend each 
year based on consideration of the Group’s 
cash balance, the level of free cash 
flow and earnings generated during the 
year, and significant known or expected 
funding commitments and to pay a total 
annual dividend equal to at least 35% of 
net earnings.
In view of the continued uncertainty in the 
copper market at the start this year, as well 
as uncertainties at Los Pelambres arising 
from an adverse court decision and actions by 
some protestors in February and March 2015, 
the Board decided to recommend a final 
dividend of 9.8 cents per share, bringing the 
total dividend for the year to 21.5 cents per 
ordinary share. This represents a total amount 
of $212.0 million and a pay-out ratio of 35% 
(based on earnings excluding the deferred tax 
provision resulting from the changes in the 
Chilean tax law during 2014).
This is in line with the Company’s policy to 
determine the appropriate dividend each 
year based on consideration of the Group’s 
cash balance, the level of free cash flow and 
earnings generated during the year and to 
pay a total annual dividend equal to at least 
35% of net earnings. However, given the 
uncertainties at Los Pelambres, the Company 
will keep its dividend policy, and the amount 
of future dividends, under close review until 
it has greater clarity as to the resolution of 
these matters. 
BOARD CHANGES
During the year there were a number of 
changes to the Board and I was pleased 
to welcome two new members, Vivianne 
Blanlot who joined in March and Jorge Bande, 
who joined in December. Both Vivianne and 
Jorge have extensive experience across 
the energy, mining, and water sectors and 
Vivianne has also held several senior positions 
in the public sector, including as Executive 
Director of the Chilean Environmental Agency. 
Both Directors are regarded by the Board as 
independent and will bring new ideas and 
perspectives to our discussions.
In September I decided to step back from the 
position of Executive Chairman to become 
Non-Executive Chairman. At the same time 
Diego Hernández took on the role of Group 
CEO, having previously been responsible 
for the mining division. These changes 
reflect the development of the Group and 
my role is now less focused on the day-to-
day operations and more concerned with 
the strategic development of the Group and 
leading the Board. 
At the end of August Nelson Pizarro stepped 
down as a Director to take up the position 
of CEO of Codelco. Nelson had been on the 
Board for two years and I thank him for the 
valuable contributions he made while he was 
with us. 
In addition, certain changes were made to 
the composition of the Board Committees. 
The responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee were extended to include 
corporate governance matters and the 
name of the Committee has been changed 
to reflect this. All of the Committees have 
performed well and I thank the members 
of the Board serving on the Committees for 
their efforts during the year.
When Antucoya is 
commissioned it will be 
the first major copper mine 
in Chile to be brought into 
production on budget and 
on time for five years.
06 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 As part of a series of actions taken by UK 
regulators to strengthen minority shareholder 
protection in controlled companies such as 
ours, new Listing Rules came into force this 
year that require the Company to enter into 
a relationship agreement with its controlling 
shareholders. The Company has therefore 
replaced the existing relationship agreement 
it had with its controlling shareholders, 
the Luksic family, with a new agreement. 
This reflects the requirements of the new 
Listing Rules through the inclusion of certain 
mandatory independence provisions in 
the agreement. The Company and I, as a 
representative of the controlling shareholders, 
believe that this further level of transparency 
will clarify the relationship and provide 
comfort to all shareholders on how the 
Company conducts its business. The new 
agreement was signed in November.
AN EVOLVING MINING ENVIRONMENT 
IN CHILE
The election of President Michelle Bachelet 
in 2014 has resulted in a period of legislative 
change in Chile. The President, who with 
her coalition partners enjoys a majority in 
both houses of Congress, has placed reform 
at the centre of her legislative programme. 
This programme has seen Congress approve 
a tax reform law in September and an 
education reform bill in January 2015 with 
other reforms in labour and constitutional 
affairs expected in the coming months. 
Antofagasta, and the private sector as a 
whole, will continue to monitor and adapt 
to these changes in the years ahead and to 
participate fully in the consultative processes. 
The Chile Mining and Development 
Commission was established in 2014, 
reflecting not only the critical importance of 
mining to the Chilean economy but the need 
to balance demands for faster socioeconomic 
development and redistribution with a period 
of prolonged uncertainty for the global 
mining industry. I was honoured to accept an 
invitation to serve on this panel of private and 
public sector industry leaders, co-ordinated 
by the National Innovation Council, tasked 
with identifying strategic priorities for Chile’s 
mining sector over the next 20 years.
At Antofagasta we are proud to be part of a 
group of people and companies committed 
to the future of mining in Chile. In December 
last year the Commission presented the 
President with a series of proposals to 
promote the development of sustainable 
mining, putting three principles at the heart 
of future development; that mining should be 
sustainable, inclusive and mutually beneficial 
for both operators and communities. 
As the listed mining company with the 
largest operations in Chile, Antofagasta holds 
these principles at the heart of our business 
and as a sustainable mining company we 
look beyond just the short term and invest 
in renewable energy and water, and in 
improving our environmental standards. 
As an inclusive company we also work with 
the local authorities, our peers, employees, 
and the communities in which we operate 
to create shared value for all stakeholders. 
SAFETY
Despite our continued efforts to avoid any 
fatalities at our operations, five people died 
during the course of the year. This is terrible, 
and the Board and I offer our heartfelt 
sympathy to the families of the deceased. 
We owe it to their memory, and the memory 
of the others lost over the years, to redouble 
our efforts to achieve our target of zero 
fatalities. I know that this is much easier to 
say than do, but I want to make sure that 
each and every employee knows that it is our 
top priority.
OUTLOOK
Sustainability and the health and safety of our 
employees are key to our success. We are 
proud to be in the mining business in Chile, 
creating shared value for all our stakeholders. 
We will continue to invest in our business 
and in the country to ensure a steady, stable, 
secure and profitable future for all.
2015 will be an important year for Antofagasta 
as we complete our current projects, prepare 
for our next phase of growth and face the 
challenges that the current macroeconomic 
environment brings. 
I would like to thank the senior management 
team and all of our employees for their valuable 
contribution over the year and look forward to 
another productive year ahead. 
We look beyond just the 
short term and invest in 
renewable energy and 
water, and in improving our 
environmental standards. 
Antofagasta plc | 07
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW OVERVIEW While this prolonged 
downturn has certainly 
created a more difficult 
environment, it is not 
exceptional; this situation 
has arisen several times 
during my career.
When I joined Antofagasta in August 2012 
the mining industry was already starting to 
move into a cyclical downturn and it was 
clear that 2013 was going to be a difficult 
year as we adjusted to the changing 
business environment. 
The copper market continued to weaken 
throughout 2014, much as expected, with 
a surprisingly sharp drop at the beginning 
of 2015. However, while this prolonged 
downturn has certainly created a more 
difficult environment, it is not exceptional; this 
situation has arisen several times during my 
career. The secret is to use the opportunity 
to make changes that will benefit the Group 
once the market recovers – changes that are 
difficult to achieve in periods of high growth 
and high prices. We have therefore spent 
this year bedding down the improvements 
made in 2013 and implementing further 
initiatives. In our 2013 Annual Report I noted 
that the process of resetting the Group’s 
cost base would take at least until the end of 
2014 and this has been the case. The work 
continues and we are making good progress 
in reorganising our supply structures, cutting 
inventories and reducing operating and 
capital costs.
2014 HIGHLIGHTS
Copper production declined by 2.3% to 
704,800 tonnes in 2014, slightly lower than 
the record production levels achieved in 2013. 
Gold and molybdenum production were also 
lower at 270,900 ounces and 7,900 tonnes, 
respectively. This decline reflected expected 
lower grades for all metals, particularly 
copper grade at Los Pelambres and Centinela 
Cathodes and the gold grade at Centinela. 
Overall production of metals was, however, 
slightly better than we forecast at the 
beginning of the year.
Cash costs before by-product credits were 
$1.83/lb, 2.2% higher than in 2013, impacted 
by the lower grades and the one-off signing 
bonuses paid during the year, partly offset by 
the weakening of the Chilean peso. Net cash 
costs, at $1.43/lb, were 5.1% higher than last 
year as by-product credits were lower due to 
lower production and a weaker gold price. 
The single most significant pressure on 
costs came from the payment of bonuses 
to employees on the signing of new labour 
contracts at each of our mining operations. 
In Chile, we enter into labour agreements 
with employees for periods of up to four 
years, which included agreed pay increases 
and cash bonuses, typically paid up-front in 
line with local industry practice. During 2014 
the payment of the one-off bonuses and the 
provision of loans totalled some $0.04/lb. 
The bonus payments were offset by 
movements in the Chilean peso, which 
weakened by 15.2% during the year, reducing 
costs by $0.10/lb. As copper makes up over 
50% of Chile’s exports, when copper prices 
have fallen historically the peso has fallen 
as well, acting as a natural hedge for copper 
producers. In addition the Group made 
some $80 million of savings during the year, 
equivalent to $0.05/lb. These were achieved 
mainly through the merger of the Esperanza 
and El Tesoro mines into Minera Centinela, 
but also from other savings initiatives. 
Further savings will be made in both areas 
during 2015 and are expected to total 
$130 million.
STATEMENT FROM THE CEO 
Diego Hernández
08 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Although the expected surplus in the 
copper market in 2014 did not materialise, 
the average copper price fell from $3.32/lb 
in 2013 to $3.11/lb and closed the year at 
$2.88/lb. This resulted in the average realised 
price of copper being 8.5% lower in 2014 
at $3.00/lb. The average realised gold price 
declined by 7.1% to $1,261/oz, while the 
realised molybdenum price increased by 
10% to $11.0/lb.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
I am sorry to report that during 2014 
we had five fatalities in three separate 
incidents at the Group’s mining operations. 
This is unacceptable and I, and everyone 
at Antofagasta, extend our deepest 
condolences to the families of the 
deceased. The circumstances have been 
fully investigated and have led us to make 
changes to our procedures and practices. 
The health and safety of our employees and 
our contractors is of paramount importance to 
us and we are constantly striving to improve 
our performance. In 2013, we introduced a 
new safety and occupational health model 
and during 2014 several new measures were 
implemented as part of a process seeking to 
achieve continuous improvement. Our most 
important target remains zero fatalities and 
we will continue to endeavour to achieve this.
POSITIONED FOR GROWTH
During 2014, we made good progress 
advancing the projects under construction 
at Antucoya and Centinela, and early works 
started at Encuentro Oxides shortly before 
the completion of its feasibility study in 
November. The feasibility study on the 
Pelambres Incremental Expansion continued 
through the year and the pre-feasibility study 
on Centinela’s Second Concentrator will be 
completed in mid-2015. A pre-feasibility study 
was also completed in 2014 on the Twin 
Metals Minnesota project. These projects 
provide a healthy growth pipeline for the 
Group over the coming five to ten years.
At Antucoya, construction has continued 
throughout the year with all major milestones 
being achieved on schedule. The operation 
is scheduled for start-up during the second 
quarter of 2015 and will be operating at full 
production of 85,000 tonnes per year of 
cathodes in 2016. The project is expected to 
be completed at the budgeted construction 
cost of $1.9 billion.
At the Encuentro Oxides project we are 
trialling the use of our own project team to 
manage construction. Normally a project of 
this size would be managed by an EPCM 
contractor, but, following a review of 
management processes, we established 
that this project management model 
increased costs and reduced our control over 
project construction, potentially resulting 
in lost opportunities. We also undertook to 
reduce the original $756 million capital cost 
estimated in the pre-feasibility study and we 
have succeeded in this, with the feasibility 
study estimate showing capital costs reduced 
by $156 million.
Completion of the feasibility study for 
the Pelambres Incremental Expansion 
project was expected by the end of 2014. 
The technical aspects of the feasibility study 
have been completed, but the necessary 
permitting required before construction has 
not. The Environmental Impact Assessment 
(“EIA”) requires a baseline study of at least 
12 months which is currently under way. 
The formal completion of the feasibility 
study will be after the EIA is submitted as it 
may indicate that additional work should be 
included in the feasibility study. At this stage 
the pre-feasibility study capital expenditure 
estimate of $1.2 billion is unchanged.
Constrained sources 
of potential supply from 
greenfield projects will 
ensure that the longer-
term copper fundamentals 
remain strong.

OVERVIEW STATEMENT FROM THE CEO
The pre-feasibility study for the construction 
of a second concentrator at Centinela will be 
completed in mid-2015. The 90,000 tonnes 
per day concentrator will be located about 
7 km south of the existing concentrator and 
will be fed by ore from Esperanza Sur to the 
north and Encuentro Sulphides to the south. 
The scoping study estimate of the capital cost 
of the project is $2.7 billion and will increase 
Centinela’s annual production by an average 
of 140,000 tonnes of copper, 150,000 ounces 
of gold.
The EIA for the project will be submitted 
to the appropriate regulatory authorities in 
mid-2015. If it proceeds smoothly through 
the approval process the EIA should be 
ready approximately as the feasibility study 
is completed in mid-2016. Production is then 
expected to start in 2019.
At Centinela the feasibility study on the 
molybdenum plant has been completed 
and the necessary permits required before 
construction can commence are expected in 
mid-2015. The plant has now been designed 
to be easily expanded to accept feed from 
the Centinela Second Concentrator project. 
Capital costs are estimated to be $125 million 
with average production of some 2,400 
tonnes per annum of molybdenum in the first 
five years starting in late 2016.
Early in 2015, we completed the acquisition 
of Duluth Metals Limited to gain 100% 
ownership of the Twin Metals Minnesota 
project for a cash consideration of C$53m. 
The Duluth Complex is an attractive 
geological deposit and the Group will focus 
on further optimisations of the project while 
advancing the permitting process.
During the year the Group announced that 
the Michilla mine would run out of ore and 
close in December 2015 on completion of 
its current mine plan. The mine originally 
opened in 1959 and was acquired by the 
Group in 1980. Many of the workers from 
Michilla are being redeployed at other 
operations, but inevitably there will be some 
redundancies. Severance terms were agreed 
with the mine’s unions at the end of 2014 for 
employees who work through this year, to 
help minimise the uncertainty and allow for 
planning in this difficult time. However, as 
an alternative a sale process has also been 
initiated to determine if there is a purchaser 
that wishes to acquire the operation on 
acceptable terms, and if there is, the mine 
may continue in operation for some time 
to come. 
SUSTAINABILITY
In July 2014 we introduced a new clean 
source of energy at Los Pelambres when 
the El Arrayán wind farm came online. 
It now supplies the operation with about 
20% of its energy needs. Pelambres also 
agreed to purchase energy from two solar 
plants that will begin producing in 2015 
and 2016 respectively. By mid-2016, nearly 
50% of Pelambres’ energy will come from 
renewable sources. 
The Group continues to work with the 
communities where it operates; promoting 
initiatives where communities, local 
governments and private companies 
formulate a joint vision for both public 
and private investments. These initiatives 
increase local involvement, strengthen social 
investment and contribute to improving 
the sustainable development of the 
surrounding communities. 
OUTLOOK
The Group’s forecast for 2015 production is 
710,000 tonnes of copper, 250,000 ounces 
of gold and 8,000 tonnes of molybdenum. 
The copper production forecast comprises 
385,000 tonnes at Los Pelambres, 255,000 
tonnes at Centinela, 30,000 tonnes at 
Michilla and 40,000 tonnes at Antucoya. 
Local protests reduced expected copper 
production at Los Pelambres by some 8,000 
tonnes of copper. These protests, along with 
the adverse court ruling mean that there is 
some inherent uncertainty as to the potential 
impact on Los Pelambres’ 2015 production 
levels and the Group’s cost forecasts of cash 
costs before by-product credits of $1.75/lb 
and net cash costs of $1.40/lb. 
The new year started with a rapid drop in the 
copper price to below $2.50/lb and although 
there has been some recovery since then, 
the outlook for 2015 is for price volatility to 
continue. However, if the Chinese economy 
grows at the expected rate of 7.0% it now 
appears more likely that the copper market 
will be largely in balance rather than in surplus 
as was expected a few months ago. In the 
medium to long term the copper market 
continues to look positive. When the world 
economy picks up again and demand growth 
accelerates, constrained sources of potential 
supply, in particular from greenfield projects, 
will ensure that the longer-term copper 
fundamentals remain strong.

INPUTS
Mining is a long-term business. Timescales can run into decades. The period 
from initial exploration to the start of production often exceeds ten years. 
Then, depending on the nature of the project and market conditions, it may take 
more than five years of operation to recoup the initial investment. Mines usually plan 
to exploit higher-grade areas towards the start of the mine life, in order to maximise 
returns from the operation. As a result, average ore grades may decline over time, 
with production volumes decreasing along with revenues. 
Innovative sustainable development is an integral component of Antofagasta’s 
decision-making process, firmly embedded in the business model and strategy 
of the Group. Antofagasta is committed to operational excellence, safety, 
talent management, environmental management and working with employees 
and local communities.

OUTPUTS
This fall in revenues, however, depends on commodity prices. These tend to be cyclical, so even 
as production volumes decline revenues can increase, and vice versa. Long-life and low-cost operations 
increase the likelihood of a mine being able to benefit from the peaks in the commodity price cycle 
while withstanding the troughs. Also, during the life of a mine there will often be expansions that help 
it to keep down its unit costs of production – the most important financial KPI on a mine.

efficiently...
The Group is focused on developing two world-class mining 
districts in Chile: Los Pelambres and Centinela. A much smaller 
mine, Michilla, completed its last full year of production in 2014.
The Los Pelambres and Centinela districts have long-life operations 
with significant mineral resources and produce significant by-
products: gold, silver and molybdenum. Within these operations are 
five open pit mines and one underground mine. At Michilla, the Group 
also purchases ore from underground operations run by third parties.
Key elements of operational efficiency are health and safety. 
These remain a top priority for the Board and management team.

The Group mines both copper oxide and copper sulphide ores, 
which require different processing routes:
 – Centinela Cathodes and Michilla:  
Mined oxide ore is crushed, piled into heaps and then leached 
with sulphuric acid, producing a copper sulphate solution. 
This solution is then put through a solvent-extraction and 
electrowinning (“SX-EW”) plant to produce copper cathodes, 
which are sold to fabricators around the world.
 – Los Pelambres and Centinela Concentrates:  
Mined sulphide ore is milled to reduce its size before passing 
to flotation cells where it is upgraded to a concentrate 
containing some 25-35% copper. This concentrate is then 
shipped to a smelter operated by a third party and converted 
to copper metal.

MARKETING
The Group’s marketing team is responsible for building long-
term relationships with smelters and fabricators who purchase 
the Group’s products, with approximately 75% of output going 
to Asian markets.
As well as copper, a number of the Group’s mines produce significant 
volumes of metal by-products: gold, silver and molybdenum.
Gold is sold to customers for use in various industrial and electronic 
applications. It can also be used by customers in the making of 
jewellery or as an investment. Molybdenum goes to industrial 
sectors, where its main use is in steel alloys.
Most copper and molybdenum sales are made under annual 
contracts or longer-term framework agreements, with sales volumes 
agreed each year. This guarantees offtake and helps mitigate the risk 
of fluctuations in market prices.

RESTORATION OUTPUTS
During the operation of a mine, impact on the environment 
and the neighbouring communities is carefully managed. 
At the end of its life a mine must be closed and the 
surrounding habitats restored to their original state. 
A plan for the closure of each mine is maintained and updated 
throughout its life to ensure compliance with the latest regulations 
and to ensure closure on a sustainable basis.
The Group’s mining operations create significant economic 
and social value for a wide range of stakeholders – local 
communities benefit from job creation and improved 
infrastructure, while the Chilean government and local 
municipalities receive tax payments and royalties. There are 
benefits to wider society – the copper the Group produces is 
used in a wide range of sectors, from industrial to medical.

PRODUCTS
The Group’s mining operations 
produce copper with by-products of 
gold, molybdenum and silver. Los 
Pelambres and Centinela produce copper 
concentrate containing gold and silver, 
which is sold to smelters for further 
processing and refining into copper 
cathodes as well as the production of 
gold and silver. Centinela also produces 
copper cathodes, as does Michilla, which 
are sold to fabricators. The Group’s 
cathodes production will increase with 
the start-up of Antucoya during 2015. 
In addition, Los Pelambres produces 
molybdenum concentrate, which is 
sold to roasters for further processing 
and refining.
For more information on the structure of the Group’s sales 
contracts, please see page 25
COPPER
The principal end markets for refined copper 
are construction and consumer products, 
which account for approximately 58% of 
global copper demand. These are followed 
by electrical and electronic products, transport 
and industrial machinery. The price of copper 
is typically determined by the major metals 
exchanges – the London Metal Exchange 
(“LME”), the Commodity Exchange, Inc. 
(“COMEX”) and the Shanghai Futures 
Exchange (“SHFE”). The price of copper is 
affected by supply-demand fundamentals as 
well as by financial investors. This can lead to 
volatile and cyclical movements, as has been 
seen at the start of 2015.
GOLD
Gold is used as an investment asset and 
for jewellery and various industrial and 
electronic applications. It can be readily sold 
on numerous markets throughout the world 
and benchmark prices are generally based on 
London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”) 
quotations.
MOLYBDENUM
The main use of molybdenum is as a key 
alloying element in steel, although it is also 
used in other products such as catalysts. 
Contract prices are typically based on price 
benchmarks such as those reported by Platts.

Outlook – December 2014
20 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 REFINED COPPER
2014 market performance
The average LME copper price during 2014 
was $3.11/lb, representing a 6.3% decrease 
compared with the 2013 average. Over the 
course of the year there was a substantial 
destocking of material stored in Chinese 
bonded warehouses. The copper cathode 
market was tight during the year due to the 
combined effect of a sustained increase in 
demand, especially in China and the rest of 
Asia, and lower-than-expected production 
due to mine disruptions and some tightness 
in scrap availability. This resulted in a market 
deficit, reflected in the reduction of material 
stored in Chinese bonded warehouses and 
in stocks on the LME, COMEX and SHFE. 
These reached a combined level of only 
250,000 tonnes, the lowest seen since 2008.
Global mine production is estimated to have 
grown by approximately 3.3%% in 2014, 
a slight drop-off against expectations due 
to more-than-expected mine disruptions, 
start-up delays and the slow ramp-up of 
new mines. The Indonesian government 
passed legislation to ban the export of copper 
concentrate, which lasted for nearly seven 
months and significantly affected copper 
concentrate availability, supporting the copper 
price. The surplus expected in the cathodes 
market did not materialise; this was as a result 
of the lower-than-expected supply growth 
explained above.
Overall, prices were supported by increased 
demand and restricted supply for the year, 
plus buying from China’s State Reserve 
Bureau. The Group’s average realised price 
in 2014 was below the average LME price, 
which reflected a net negative provisional 
pricing adjustment of $184.4 million for 
the year. 
Market outlook
The general consensus is that the market 
will remain in balance or with a small surplus 
during 2015 and 2016, moving into a deficit 
from 2017 onwards. This has been further 
supported by the delays announced in 
greenfield and brownfield projects throughout 
the world. Demand growth will continue to 
be focused around Chinese consumption, 
which now accounts for approximately 45% 
of global copper demand. Outside China, 
Europe and North America remain the key 
consumers (16% and 11% respectively). 
Demand in these economies is dependent 
on, among other factors, continued global 
economic recovery.
The consensus price forecast for 2015 is 
lower than in 2014 at $2.92/lb due to the 
expectation that the market might move 
to a surplus and the strength of the US 
dollar. However, with the market’s volatile 
start to 2015, revisions are expected during 
the year and the expectation of a surplus 
is already diminishing. 
COPPER CONCENTRATE
2014 market performance
The concentrate market was impacted by 
the Indonesian concentrate export ban as 
well as the emergence of higher arsenic-
content concentrates that caused material 
marketing challenges and increased costs 
for the affected producers. Spot treatment 
and refining charges (“TC/RCs”) were tighter 
during the first half of the year as the result 
of production disruption and increases in 
smelting capacity, but rose during the latter 
part of 2014 after the ban in Indonesia was 
lifted and more production hit the market.
Market outlook
Benchmark TC/RCs, with respect to 2015, 
have been set at $107 per dry metric tonne 
of concentrate for smelting and 10.7 cents 
per pound of copper for refining. This reflects 
a softer market in favour of smelters, with an 
approximate increase of 16% on 2014 levels. 
The concentrate market for 2015 is expected 
to be in a balanced-to-deficit position as new 
smelter capacity in China ramps up and the 
new smelters start to operate. The outcome 
will mostly depend on how this new capacity 
performs, mine production disruptions over 
the year and scrap availability in a lower-
price environment.
GOLD
The gold price declined during 2014 due to 
the acceleration of the global recovery and 
increased confidence in the equity markets. 
Since the financial crisis started, gold has 
provided a natural hedge against the weaker 
dollar, however, as the US Federal Reserve 
and other governments and central banks 
changed their monetary policies, gold no 
longer provided this security.
These factors led to significant outflows from 
gold Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) back 
into the equity and other markets, which 
resulted in a large volume of sales and a fall 
in the price. Gold averaged $1,266/oz in 2014 
compared with $1,410/oz in 2013 and closed 
the year at $1,206/oz.
The consensus price forecast for 2015 
is $1,230/oz.
MOLYBDENUM
Molybdenum prices recovered during the 
first half of the year, supported by good 
demand, a slight decrease in availability 
and delays in start-up of new production, 
hitting a 21-month high in April 2014. 
Following that, prices fell and the average 
price was $11.4/lb during the year, compared 
with $10.3/lb in 2013. The consensus price 
forecast for 2015 is $10.0/lb.
During 2015, new mines are expected to 
come on-stream, such as Sierra Gorda, 
which will have an impact on the supply 
of molybdenum in the global markets. 
Oversupply may lead to a weaker price 
environment, but demand is expected 
to remain strong.

KEY INPUTS  
AND COST BASE
The Group’s mining operations are dependent on a range of 
key inputs, such as energy, water, labour and fuel. For cathode 
producers such as Centinela, Michilla and from next year 
Antucoya, which use the SX-EW process, sulphuric acid is 
a key input. The availability and cost of such inputs lie at the 
heart of the Group’s cost management strategy, which focuses 
on cost control and security of supply.
The Group’s two largest operations, Los 
Pelambres and Centinela, are competitively 
positioned on the copper industry cost curve. 
This reflects a combination of low operating 
costs and significant by-product credits. 
The Group’s net cash costs sit at the lower 
end of the second quartile of the cost curve 
and are well placed among its competitors. 
The cash cost guidance for 2015, before 
by-product credits, is $1.75/lb, lower than 
in 2014. The initiatives implemented by the 
Group’s procurement department, explained 
below, contribute to achieving the cost 
reductions required to keep unit costs steady 
despite the decline in grade.
ENERGY
There are two electricity grids in Chile from 
which the Group sources its energy: the 
northern grid (“SING”) supplies the Centinela 
and Michilla mines, and the central grid 
(“SIC”) supplies Los Pelambres. In the SIC, 
approximately 40% of the energy is provided 
by hydroelectric plants, with the remainder 
coming from coal and diesel-fuelled plants. 
In the SING, approximately 80% of the 
energy comes from coal-fired power stations, 
with the remainder provided by LNG and 
diesel-powered plants. Due to its reliance 
on hydroelectric power, the costs of energy 
on the SIC fluctuate depending on the level 
of precipitation, whereas on the SING costs 
are more stable.
The Group endeavours to procure electricity 
through medium and long-term contracts at 
each mine. The cost, in most cases, is linked 
to either the current cost of electricity on the 
Chilean grids or the generation costs of a 
particular supplier, with the latter subject to 
adjustments for inflation and each generator’s 
fuel input prices.

22 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014  8 0%
of power at Los Pelambres coming 
from renewable sources by the end 
of 2018
With the ending of a favourable fixed-price 
contract in 2012, Los Pelambres has been 
exposed to the spot price, facing an energy 
market with scarce availability of long-term 
power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) 
indexed to more stable commodity prices 
such as coal or LNG. To improve security 
of supply, the mine has invested in the 
largest wind-power plant in Chile, El Arrayán. 
This started providing some 20% of Los 
Pelambres’ energy requirements from 
the middle of 2014. Later in the year Los 
Pelambres signed long-term PPAs with two 
solar power providers for a total of 50MW 
of power commencing in 2015 and 2016. 
These PPAs, together with those signed 
in 2013 as part of the Group’s investment 
in Alto Maipo, come on-stream in 2015 
and 2018 and will provide the remaining 
energy requirements for Los Pelambres 
at competitive and stable prices.
Currently, all of the Group’s operations located 
on the SING benefit from long-term contracts 
indexed to the price of coal. The Group has 
also secured a competitive long-term PPA 
that will secure the energy provision for 
the Antucoya project, which commences 
operation in 2015.
WATER
Water for each of the operations is sourced 
either from the sea or from surface and 
underground sources. Each operation has 
secured the necessary permits for long-term 
supply of water at current production levels. 
Water is a precious commodity in the 
regions where the Group’s mines operate, 
so considerable effort is made to maximise 
the recycling of water. Water reuse rates 
depend on a range of factors and vary 
between 71% and 85% depending on 
the characteristics of each operation.
The Group has pioneered the use of 
untreated sea water for mining operations 
in Chile, with both its Centinela and Michilla 
mines using this process. In 2014, sea water 
accounted for 44% of total Group water use 
and from 2015, Antucoya will also use sea 
water, pumping supplies from Centinela’s 
existing pipeline.
The Group believes that the use of surface 
and well water will generally no longer be 
feasible for new greenfield projects in Chile, 
and therefore greater use of sea water is 
expected across the industry.
LABOUR
Security of labour supply is key to 
the success of the Group’s operations. 
Labour agreements with unions are in place 
at all of the Group’s mining operations, 
generally covering periods of four years. 
New labour agreements were negotiated 
at all operations during 2014, securing 
terms of employment for all employees 
for up to four years. The Group has liaised 
with its workers and their labour unions 
to foster a good working relationship over 
the years and to date there has been no 
industrial action. 
Contractors form a significant part of 
the Group’s workforce at all operations 
making up approximately 75% of the total 
workforce. Labour negotiations for the 
contractors’ workforce are the responsibility 
of contractors. The Group maintains strong 
relations with all contractors to ensure 
operational continuity.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT SULPHURIC ACID
The sulphuric acid market strengthened 
during 2014, triggered by higher sulphur 
prices and higher acid consumption in Asia 
due to new nickel leaching mines. By the end 
of the year this raised acid prices in Chile.
The Group contracts the majority of its 
sulphuric acid requirements for a year or 
longer at specified rates, normally agreed 
in the latter part of the previous year. 
The increases in the spot acid price seen 
during the year have therefore had a limited 
impact on 2014 costs.
SERVICE CONTRACTS  
AND KEY SUPPLIES
The new corporate supply department 
focuses on standardising Group-wide 
procurement policies and procedures. 
Since this department was set up in 2013, 
its centralised supply approach has achieved 
a 22% reduction in inventories, equivalent to 
$47 million, as well as reductions in operating 
and capital expenditure of up to $150 million 
between 2014 and 2019. The Group 
continually reviews its procurement 
processes and expects additional savings 
to be captured in the coming years.
In total, the Group has over 1,000 contracts 
for services and supplies. Key supplies and 
services such as tyres, grinding media, 
equipment, chemicals, explosives, camp 
administration and maintenance services 
are covered by long-term agreements. 
Although contracts are normally between 
the operation and the supplier, tender 
and negotiation processes are mostly 
co-ordinated or even led centrally by the 
Group’s corporate procurement department 
to maximise the leverage and benefits.
Price inflation of key mining supplies, 
particularly labour costs, has been a challenge 
to the Chilean mining sector in recent years. 
However, with the slowdown in growth, 
the Group is focusing on reducing operating 
costs through a more integrated and 
centralised supply chain that will allow the 
Group to negotiate collectively, increasing 
buying power and benefiting the operations. 
The Group’s corporate procurement 
programme started as a Group-wide cost-
reduction exercise, covering overall spend 
on goods and services, divided by product 
category, with specific approaches for key 
and non-key suppliers. The programme 
considers a variety of strategies, from full 
price competition, including sourcing in 
China, to working jointly with some strategic 
suppliers to reduce the costs of each party to 
achieve a sustainable, longer-term lower cost 
base for growth in the future. To foster this 
co-operative approach the Group is working 
with recognised best-in-class productivity 
experts. The costs for redesigning and 
running optimised contract operations are 
shared with the contractors.
The procurement review programme will 
increase productivity, optimise major service 
contracts, reduce relevant supply costs and 
lead to better management of inventory 
levels, as well as significantly consolidating 
minor suppliers for non-critical goods 
and services.
One significant achievement in contractor 
productivity is the Group-wide standardisation 
of a number of contractor requirements, 
agreed with the Chilean Mining Supplier 
Association and shared with major local 
mining groups.
OIL PRICE
Oil represents a small proportion of the 
Group’s total costs, primarily as an input for 
transporting ore and waste at the mine sites. 
Improving fuel efficiency is a priority for 
the Group, with the litres of fuel consumed 
per tonne of material extracted being an 
efficiency measure. Fuel is supplied by Chile’s 
two largest suppliers to avoid sole supplier 
risk. The oil price also affects the spot price 
of energy, the shipping rates of supplies and 
products and the cost of items such as tyres 
and conveyor belts that contain oil-based 
products. The oil price fell by approximately 
50% during 2014 and this weakness has 
continued into 2015. This will have an impact 
on the Group’s costs, but given the small 
proportion of costs that are affected by the oil 
price, this impact will not be significant.
EXCHANGE RATE
Costs are affected by the Chilean peso to US 
dollar exchange rate because approximately 
35% of the mining division’s operating costs 
are in Chilean pesos. However, the exchange 
rate often acts as a natural hedge: over half 
of Chile’s foreign exchange is generated 
from copper sales and movements in the 
copper price tend to affect the Chilean peso. 
During 2014 the peso weakened, averaging 
Ch$570/$1, compared to an average rate 
of Ch$495/$1 in 2013. During the first 
two months of 2015, the peso averaged 
Ch$620/$1.
KEY INPUTS 
AND COST BASE
The procurement review 
programme will increase 
productivity, optimise major 
service contracts, reduce 
relevant supply costs and 
lead to better management 
of inventory levels.
24 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 KEY RELATIONSHIPS
CUSTOMERS
Most copper and molybdenum sales are 
made under annual contracts or longer-term 
framework agreements, with sales volumes 
agreed for the coming year.
The majority of sales are to industrial 
customers who refine or further process 
the copper – smelters in the case of 
copper concentrate production and copper 
fabricators in the case of cathode production. 
The Group’s in-house marketing team 
seeks to build long-term relationships with 
these core customers, while maintaining 
relationships with trading companies that 
participate in shorter-term sales.
Approximately 75% of Group sales go to 
customers located in Asia. Metals sales 
pricing is generally based on prevailing 
market prices.
STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP’S 
SALES CONTRACTS 
The Group’s sales contracts typically set 
out the annual volumes to be supplied and 
the main terms for the sale of each payable 
metal, with the pricing of the contained 
copper in line with LME prices. In the case 
of concentrate, a deduction is made from 
LME prices to reflect TC/RCs – the smelting 
and refining costs necessary to process 
the concentrate into copper cathodes. 
These TC/RCs are typically determined 
annually and in line with terms negotiated 
across the concentrate market.
A significant proportion of the Group’s 
copper cathode sales are made under annual 
contracts, priced in line with LME prices. 
In copper cathode transactions, a premium 
(or in some cases a discount) on the LME 
price is negotiated to reflect differences in 
quality, logistics and financing compared 
with the metal exchanges’ standard copper 
contract specifications.
Similarly, the Group’s molybdenum contracts 
are made under long-term framework 
agreements, with pricing usually based 
on Platts’ average prices.
Across the industry neither copper producers 
nor consumers tend to make annual 
commitments for 100% of their respective 
production or needs. Therefore producers 
normally retain a portion to be sold on the 
spot market throughout the year.
The prices realised by the Group during 
a specific period will differ from the 
average market price for that period. This is 
because, in line with industry practice, sales 
agreements generally provide for provisional 
pricing at the time of shipment, with final 
pricing based on the average market price for 
the month in which settlement takes place.
For copper concentrate, sales remain 
open until settlement occurs, on average 
three to four months from the shipment 
date. Settlement for the gold and silver 
content in copper concentrate sales occurs 
approximately one month from shipment. 
Copper cathode sales remain open for 
an average of one month from shipment. 
Settlement for copper in concentrate sales 
is later than for copper cathode sales since 
further refinement of copper in concentrate 
is needed before sale. Molybdenum sales 
generally remain open for two or three 
months from shipment. 
The Group recognises that it cannot run its business in 
isolation. The business model is underpinned by a series 
of relationships with stakeholders at local, national and 
international level, which contribute to its long-term success.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT SUPPLIERS
Suppliers play a critical role in the Group’s 
ability to operate, supplying a large range of 
products and services from sulphuric acid to 
haulage truck fleet maintenance. 
More information on key inputs is included 
on pages 22 to 24
The Group currently conducts business 
with over 4,400 suppliers. This number 
will be notably reduced by the corporate 
supply department’s strategy, covering all 
product and service categories. The Group 
has identified 300 categories across all 
mining operations and is negotiating with 
its suppliers on each of these. This strategic 
approach will allow the Group to extract 
greater benefits from its suppliers over a 
long period of time. For example, the Group 
may develop long-term partnerships with 
some suppliers, while others are managed 
with a more short-term focus based on 
market competition. The Group has an 
open-door policy that encourages suppliers 
to raise any issues or concerns. Suppliers are 
audited regularly to ensure compliance 
with the law and company standards, 
particularly concerning health and safety 
and the environment. 
EMPLOYEES
The Group employs approximately 6,500 
people, who work alongside approximately 
20,000 contractors at its corporate offices, 
operations and projects. Mining is inherently 
risky. Ensuring the health and safety of every 
worker is an absolute priority: it is an ethical 
obligation and forms the core of the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
Skilled workers remain in short supply 
throughout the mining sector in Chile, and the 
Group’s efforts and initiatives over the last 
few years to secure and develop talent and 
bring young professionals into the industry 
have been notably successful.
Relationships with trade unions are based on 
mutual respect and transparency. This helps 
the Group retain workers and avoid labour 
disputes, contributing to the productivity and 
efficiency of its business. During the year 
the Group renewed the labour agreements 
at all of its mining operations for periods of 
up to four years, ensuring a further period 
of stability.
The Group undertakes an annual survey 
to assess employee satisfaction. 
Based on the results, action is taken 
to improve the work environment. 
CONTRACTORS
The number of contractors working for 
Antofagasta varies according to business 
needs and the level of construction activity.
As at 31 December 2014, there were 
approximately 20,000 contractors working 
at the Group’s operations and projects. 
This was some 5,000 higher than the same 
time last year, principally due to the Antucoya 
construction. Contractors are vitally important 
to mining operations and the Group aims to 
build long-term relationships with contractor 
companies based on the highest standards. 
Health and safety targets are included in 
performance contracts and compliance with 
safety, human rights and labour regulations 
is assessed by internal and external audits.
The minimum wage paid by Antofagasta 
Minerals to contractor employees is 70% 
higher than that required by Chilean law, and 
contractor staff have access to the same 
facilities as the Group’s own employees at 
the mine camps.

26 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 LOCAL COMMUNITIES
It is crucial to have strong relationships built 
on trust with local communities in the areas 
where the Group operates: it is not possible 
to run a mine successfully without their 
co-operation and agreement.
Having clear social policies and regular 
contact with community members helps 
to manage potential conflicts and maintains 
the Group’s social licence to operate. 
During 2014, Los Pelambres adopted a new 
approach to engagement with communities. 
The initiative is called “Somos Choapas” 
(“We are from Choapa”, the region in which 
Los Pelambres is located).

OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS
Positive relationships with all local 
stakeholders near the Group’s operations 
and projects are fundamental to the 
smooth operation of the business and its 
future growth.

AUTHORITIES
Political developments and changes 
to legislation or regulations can affect 
business, whether in Chile, the UK, or other 
countries where the Group has operations, 
development projects or exploration activities.
New and proposed legislation is monitored 
to enable the Group to anticipate, mitigate 
or reduce possible impacts, and to ensure 
it complies with all legal and regulatory

bodies to engage with governments on public 
policy, laws, regulations and procedures that 
may affect its business, including such issues 
as climate change and energy security.
The Group assesses political risk as part of 
its evaluation of potential projects, including 
the nature of foreign investment agreements

element of the Group’s operations 
and strategy. The accurate and timely 
identification, assessment and management 
of risks are key to the operational and 
financial success of the Group.
The Group’s risk management framework 
can be divided into three tiers:
32 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 GOVERNANCE
The Board has responsibility for determining 
the nature and extent of the significant 
risks that the Group is willing to accept 
in order to achieve its strategic objectives, 
and for maintaining sound risk management 
and internal control systems. The Board 
receives detailed analysis of key matters 
for consideration in advance of Board 
meetings. This includes reports on the 
Group’s operational performance, including 
health and safety, financial, environmental, 
legal and social matters, key developments 
in the Group’s exploration and business 
development activities, information on the 
commodity markets, updates on talent 
management and analysis of financial 
investments. The regular provision of this 
information allows the timely identification 
of potential issues and the assessment 
of any necessary mitigating actions.
The Audit and Risk Committee assists the 
Board with its review of the effectiveness 
of the risk management process and the 
monitoring of key risks and mitigation 
procedures. The Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee reports to the Board 
following each Committee meeting, allowing 
the Board to understand, and if necessary, 
further discuss the matters considered 
in detail by the Committee. 
These processes allow the Board to monitor 
the Group’s major risks and related mitigation 
procedures, and assess the acceptable 
level of risk that arises from the Group’s 
operations and development activities. 
Risk management reports are sent quarterly 
to the Board.
The Code of Ethics sets out the Group’s 
commitment to undertake business in 
a responsible and transparent manner. 
The Code requires honesty, integrity and 
responsibility from all employees and 
contractors, and includes guidelines for 
identifying and managing potential conflicts 
of interest. An Ethics Committee comprising 
members of senior management is 
responsible for implementing, developing 
and updating the code and monitoring 
compliance. The Code of Ethics and other 
compliance matters form an integral part of 
the induction programme for new employees.
  Further information on the Board and Committees is given 
in the Governance section on pages 67 to 102
RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND COMPLIANCE
The Group’s risk management department 
has responsibility for risk management 
systems across the Group. The department 
maintains the Group’s risk register, which 
includes the strategic risks that represent 
the most significant threats to the Group’s 
performance and achievement of its strategy, 
along with mitigation activities. The risk 
register is updated on a continuous basis 
and annual strategic risk workshops are 
held at which senior management from 
across the business comprehensively review 
the Group’s key strategic risks and related 
mitigation activities. The risk management 
department reports quarterly to the Audit 
and Risk Committee on the overall risk 
management process, including a detailed 
update of the Group’s key risks, mitigations 
and the key actions being taken.
The General Managers of each of the 
operations have overall responsibility for 
leading and supporting risk management. 
Risk Champions within each operation have 
direct responsibility for risk management 
processes in their operations and for the 
continuous update of individual business risk 
registers, including any relevant mitigation 
activities. Finally, the owners of the risks and 
controls at each business unit are identified, 
providing an effective and direct management 
of risk. As part of this process, risk workshops 
for each operation are held annually, in which 
the business unit’s risks and mitigation 
activities are reviewed in detail to allow 
a thorough updating of these business risks. 
These workshops are used to assess and 
monitor key risks that may affect the business 
unit’s relationships with its stakeholders, limit 
its resources, interrupt its operations and/or 
negatively affect its potential future growth. 
Mitigation techniques for the significant 
strategic and business unit risks are reviewed 
by the risk management department annually.
The Board regularly reviews the compliance 
of the Group with all relevant laws and 
regulations, internal policies, procedures 
and control activities.
The Vice President of Finance and 
Administration is responsible for setting, 
operating and monitoring the Crime 
Prevention Model, developed to ensure 
compliance with the anti-bribery and anti-
corruption laws in the United Kingdom 
and in Chile.

of financial risks relevant to the Group are set out in Note 23 to the financial statements.
34 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 RISK MITIGATION
SET OUT BELOW ARE THE GROUP’S PRINCIPAL RISKS AND RELATED MITIGATION TECHNIQUES
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Failure to identify and manage local concerns 
and expectations can have a negative impact on 
the Group. Relations with local communities and 
stakeholders affect the Group’s reputation and social 
licence to operate and grow.
The Group engages with local communities to establish and maintain relations based on trust and mutual 
benefit throughout the mining lifecycle, from exploration to final remediation. The Group seeks to identify any 
potentially negative operational impacts and minimise these through responsible behaviour. This means acting 
transparently and ethically, prioritising the health and safety of its workers and contractors, promoting dialogue 
and complying with commitments to stakeholders and establishing mechanisms to prevent or address a 
crisis. These steps are undertaken in the early stages of each project and continue throughout the life of each 
operation. The Group also contributes to the development of communities in the areas of influence in which 
it operates, particularly through human capital development – the education, training and employment of the 
local population. The Group endeavours to communicate clearly and transparently with local communities, 
in line with the established Community Relations Plan, including the use of a grievance management process, 
local perception surveys, local media and community engagement.
  Details of the Group’s community relations activities are included in the Sustainability section on page 57
STRATEGIC RESOURCES
Disruption to the supply of any of the Group’s 
key strategic inputs such as electricity, water, fuel, 
sulphuric acid and mining equipment could have 
a negative impact on production. Longer term, 
any restrictions on the availability of key strategic 
resources such as water and electricity could affect 
the Group’s opportunities for growth.
A significant portion of the Group’s input costs 
are influenced by external market factors.
Contingency plans are in place to address potential short-term disruptions to strategic resources. The Group 
commences early negotiations in supply contracts for key inputs to ensure supply continuity. Certain key 
supplies are purchased from several sources to mitigate potential disruption arising from exposure 
to a single supplier.
Technological and innovative solutions, such as using sea water in the Group’s mining operations, can help 
mitigate exposure to the potential lack of availability of scarce resources.
Access to energy is a priority for the Group and during 2014 the Group secured several sources 
of non-traditional energy such as wind and solar power.
  Information on the Group’s arrangements for the supply of key inputs are included within the Key inputs section on pages 
22 to 24, and details of significant operational or cost factors related to key inputs are included within the Operational review 
on pages 38 to 49
OPERATIONAL
Mining operations are subject to a number of 
circumstances not wholly within the Group’s 
control. These include damage to or breakdown of 
equipment or infrastructure, unexpected geological 
variations or technical issues, extreme weather 
conditions and natural disasters, any of which could 
adversely affect production and/or costs.
The key risks relating to each operation are identified as part of the regular risk review process undertaken 
by the individual operations. This process also identifies appropriate mitigation techniques for such risks. 
Monthly reports to the Board provide a variance analysis of operational and financial performance, allowing 
potential key issues to be identified in a timely manner and any necessary actions, such as monitoring 
or control activities, to take place.
During 2014, the Group implemented a Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan for all key 
processes within its operations in case of crisis or natural disaster. The Group has insurance to provide 
protection from some, but not all, of the costs that may arise from such events.
Additionally, the Group has reinforced the corporate supply strategy, productivity innovation plan 
and geometallurgical standards and guidelines.
  Details of the operational performance of each of the Group’s operations are included within the Operational review on pages 
38 to 49
PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Failure to effectively manage the Group’s 
development projects could result in delays 
in the start of production and cost overruns. 
Demand for supplies, equipment and skilled 
personnel could affect capital and operating 
costs. Increasing regulatory and environmental 
requirements could result in delays in construction 
or increases in project costs.
The Group has a project management system consisting of standards, manuals and procedures containing 
the best practices applicable and enforceable in all phases of project development. The project management 
system supports the decision-making process by balancing risk versus benefit, increasing the likelihood of 
success and providing a common defining language and standards. All geometallurgical models are reviewed 
by independent experts.
Additionally, during the project lifecycle, quality checks for each of the standards applied are carried out by a 
panel of experts from within the Group. This panel reviews the feasibility study in order to assess the technical 
and commercial viability of the project. Detailed progress reports on ongoing projects are regularly reviewed, 
including assessments of progress against the key project milestones and performance against budget.
  Details of the progress of the Group’s projects are included within the Operational review on pages 44 to 47
POLITICAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
The Group may be affected by political instability 
and regulatory developments in the countries 
in which it is operating, pursuing projects or 
conducting exploration activities. Issues regarding 
the granting of permits or amendments to 
permits already granted, and changes to the legal 
environment or regulations, could adversely affect 
the Group’s operations and development projects.
The Group assesses political risk as part of its evaluation of potential projects, including the nature of any 
foreign investment agreements. Political, legal and regulatory developments affecting the Group’s operations 
and projects are monitored closely on a continuous basis. The Group operates in full compliance with the 
existing laws, regulations, licences, permits and rights in each country in which it operates.
The Group monitors proposed changes in government policies and regulations and participates in several 
associations that consult with the government on these changes.
  Details of any significant political, legal or regulatory issues that impact the Group’s operations are included within 
the Operational review on pages 38 to 49

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Antofagasta plc | 35
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT RISK MITIGATION
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Health and safety incidents could result in harm 
to the Group’s employees, contractors or to local 
communities. Ensuring their safety and wellbeing is 
first and foremost an ethical obligation for the Group 
and is stated in the Charter of Values.
Poor safety records or serious accidents could 
have a long-term impact on the Group’s morale, 
reputation and production.
Health and safety risk management procedures are being strengthened, with particular focus on preventing 
fatalities and the early identification of risks.
The corporate Health and Safety department provides a common strategy to the Group’s operations and co-
ordinates all health and safety matters. The Group is currently introducing a Significant Incident Report system 
as an important part of the Group’s overall approach to safety.
The Group’s goal is for zero fatalities and to minimise the number of accidents. This goal requires all contractors 
to comply with the Group’s Occupational Health and Safety Plan, which is monitored through monthly audits 
and supported by regular training and awareness campaigns for employees and contractors. The Plan is also 
being extended to employees’ families and local communities, particularly with regard to road safety.
  Further information about the Group’s activities in respect of health and safety is set out in the Sustainability section 
on pages 53 to 54
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
An operational incident which impacts the 
environment could affect the Group’s relationship 
with local stakeholders, its reputation and ultimately 
undermine its social licence to operate and to grow. 
The Group operates in challenging environments, 
including the Atacama desert where water scarcity 
is a key issue.
The Group has a comprehensive approach to incident prevention. Relevant risks have been assessed and are 
monitored and controlled. The Group’s approach includes raising awareness among employees and providing 
training to promote operational excellence. Potential environmental impacts are key considerations when 
assessing project viability, including the integration of innovative technology in the project designed to mitigate 
these effects. The Group has pioneered the use of sea water for mining operations in Chile and strives to 
ensure maximum efficiency in water use, achieving high rates of reuse and recovery.
  Further information in respect of the Group’s environmental activities is set out in the Sustainability section on pages 50 to 60
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
The Group may fail to identify attractive acquisition 
opportunities or may select inappropriate targets.
The long-term commodity price forecast and 
other assumptions used when assessing potential 
projects and other investment opportunities have 
a significant influence on the forecast return on 
investment and if incorrectly estimated could result 
in the wrong decisions being made.
The Group assesses a wide range of potential growth opportunities, both internal projects and external 
opportunities. A rigorous assessment process is followed to evaluate all potential business acquisitions, which 
are subjected to different stress test scenarios for sensitivity analysis and to determine the risks associated 
with the project or opportunity under assessment.
The Group’s Business Development Committee reviews potential growth opportunities and potential 
transactions, and approves or recommends them within authority levels set by the Board.
  The sensitivity of Group earnings to movements in commodity prices is set out in Note 23 to the financial statements. 
Details of the Group’s growth opportunities are set out in the Operational review on pages 44 to 47
COMMODITY PRICES
The Group’s results are heavily dependent on 
commodity prices – principally copper and, to a 
lesser extent, gold and molybdenum. The prices 
of these commodities are strongly influenced by a 
variety of external factors, including world economic 
growth, inventory balances, industry demand and 
supply, possible substitution, etc. 
The Group considers exposure to commodity price fluctuations to be an integral part of the Group’s business 
and its usual policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices. The Group monitors the commodity 
markets closely to determine the effect of price fluctuations on earnings, capital expenditure and cash 
flows. Very occasionally the Group uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price 
fluctuations when it feels it to be appropriate. The Group runs its business plans through various different 
commodity price scenarios and develops contingency plans as required.
  Details of hedging arrangements put in place by the Group are included in Note 23 to the financial statements
FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE
The Group’s sales are mainly denominated in US 
dollars and some of the Group’s operating costs are 
in Chilean pesos.
The strengthening of the Chilean peso may 
negatively affect the Group’s financial results.
As copper exports account for over 50% of Chile’s exports, there is a correlation between the copper price 
and the US dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate. This natural hedge partly mitigates the Group’s foreign exchange 
exposure. However, the Group closely monitors the foreign exchange markets and the macroeconomic 
variables that affect it and on occasion maintains a focused currency hedging programme to reduce short-term 
exposure to fluctuations in the US dollar against the Chilean peso. 
  Details of the Group’s currency hedging arrangements are shown in Note 23 to the financial statements
RISK MANAGEMENT
36 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 IDENTIFICATION OF NEW 
MINERAL RESOURCES
The Group needs to identify new mineral resources 
to ensure continued future growth. The Group 
seeks to identify new mineral resources through 
exploration and acquisition. There is a risk that 
exploration activities may not identify sufficient 
viable mineral resources.
The Group conducts exploration programmes both in Chile and other countries. The Group has entered into 
early-stage exploration agreements and strategic alliances with third parties in a number of countries and has 
also acquired equity interests in companies with known geological potential. The Group focuses its exploration 
activities on stable and secure countries to reduce country risk exposure. 
  A review of the Group’s exploration activities is set out in the Operational review on page 47
ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL 
RESOURCES ESTIMATES
The Group’s ore reserves and mineral resources 
estimates are subject to a number of assumptions 
and estimates, including geological, metallurgical 
and technical factors, future commodity prices and 
production costs. Fluctuations in these variables 
may result in some reserves or resources being 
deemed uneconomic, which could lead to a 
reduction in reserves and/or resources.
The Group’s reserves and resources estimates are updated annually to reflect material extracted during 
the year, the results of drilling programmes and any revised assumptions. The Group follows the Joint Ore 
Reserves Committee (“ JORC”) Code in reporting its ore reserves and mineral resources, which requires that 
the reserves and resources estimates are based on work undertaken by a Competent Person, as defined 
by the Code. In addition, the Group’s reserves and resources estimates are subject to a comprehensive 
programme of internal and external audits.
  The ore reserves and mineral resources estimates, along with supporting explanations, are set out on pages 162 to 169
TALENT MANAGEMENT  
AND LABOUR RELATIONS
The Group’s highly skilled workforce and 
experienced management team are critical to 
maintaining current operations, implementing 
development projects, achieving long-term growth 
and preserving current operations without major 
disruption. Managing talent and maintaining a 
high quality labour force is a key priority for the 
Group and any failures in this respect could have a 
negative impact on the performance of the existing 
operations and future growth.
There are long-term labour agreements in place with employees at each of the Group’s mining operations, 
which help to ensure labour stability. These agreements were renegotiated for a period of up to four years 
for all of the Group’s operations in 2014.
The Group seeks to identify and address labour issues that may arise throughout the period covered by 
existing labour agreements, to anticipate any potential issues in good time. Contractors are also an important 
part of the Group’s workforce and under Chilean law are subject to the same duties and responsibilities as the 
Group’s own employees. The Group’s approach is to treat contractors as strategic associates and its goal is 
to build long-term mutually beneficial contractor relationships. The Group maintains constructive relationships 
with its employees and the unions that represent them through regular communication and consultation. 
Union representatives are regularly involved in discussions about the future of the workforce.
The Group develops the talents of its employees through training and development, invests in initiatives to 
widen the talent pool and focuses on maintaining good relationships with employees, unions and contractors.
The Group’s performance management system is designed to provide reward and remuneration structures 
and personal development opportunities to attract and retain key employees. The Group has in place a talent 
management system to identify and develop internal candidates for critical management positions, as well as 
processes to identify suitable external candidates where appropriate.
  Details of the Group’s relations with its employees and contractors are set out within the Sustainability section on page 55 
and within the Operational review on pages 38 to 49

2014 PERFORMANCE
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit at Los Pelambres was 
$1,337.8 million in 2014, compared with 
$1,635.3 million in 2013, reflecting lower 
realised prices. Realised copper prices fell to 
$2.95/lb from $3.25/lb, significantly impacting 
operating profits, and cash costs increased 
slightly, as detailed below.
PRODUCTION
Copper production was 391,300 tonnes 
in 2014, which slightly exceeded the 
original forecast for the year, but was 
below 2013 production of 405,300 tonnes. 
The decrease in production was due to lower 
ore grades (2.8% lower than in 2013) and 
lower recoveries. 
Molybdenum production decreased by 
12.2% to 7,900 tonnes in 2014 compared 
with production of 9,000 tonnes in 2013. 
This was mainly due to mining a lower grade 
molybdenum phase of the pit, partially offset 
by improved recoveries. Gold production 
was 17.3% higher in 2014 at 66,500 ounces, 
compared with 56,700 ounces in 2013. 
CASH COSTS
Cash costs before by-product credits in 2014 
were slightly higher than 2013 at $1.56/lb. 
In 2014, the Group signed a new four-year 
employment contract with the unions at 
Los Pelambres. These contracts typically 
involve a one-off signing bonus, a loan 
and agreed real salary increases for the 
duration of the contract. The signing bonus 
and loan impacted cash costs by $0.03/lb. 
Offsetting this were lower cash costs as 
energy costs as spot prices averaged lower 
than in 2013 and Pelambres benefited from 
the start of the provision of lower cost power 
from the El Arrayán wind farm. Net cash 
costs increased 1.7% to $1.18/lb. 
Total capital expenditure in 2014 was 
$229.6 million, which included continued 
works on new mine infrastructure, including 
the workshop, and the El Mauro tailings dam 
facilities. Capital expenditure is expected 
to be approximately $210 million in 2015, 
reflecting sustaining investments in line with 
2014 and feasibility study costs relating to 
the incremental expansion. 
More details on this project can be found on page 45

STRATEGIC REPORT LEGAL UPDATE –  
EL MAURO TAILINGS DAM
The El Mauro tailings dam began operating 
in 2008. Since then there have been a series 
of civil claims filed by some members of 
the Caimanes community seeking to stop 
the operation of the dam. Two of these 
claims are ongoing and allege that the dam 
interferes with the rights of the Caimanes 
community on the grounds that it affects the 
flow and quality of the Pupio stream and that 
the tailings dam wall would not withstand 
extreme seismic events. These claims have 
been through various courts and stages 
of appeal, but Los Pelambres has always 
complied with all applicable laws, regulations 
and controls and successfully defended its 
right to continue operating the dam.
In October 2014, the Supreme Court, by 
split decision, upheld an appeal filed by a 
section of the Caimanes community, and 
ordered Los Pelambres to submit a plan of 
works to ensure the operation of the tailings 
dam does not affect the normal flow and 
quality of the Pupio stream. In November 
2014, Los Pelambres submitted this plan 
to the Civil Court in Los Vilos. On 9 March 
2015 that Court found that the plan was not 
sufficient to address the requirements of the 
Supreme Court order, and as a consequence 
Los Pelambres must demolish part, or all, 
of the tailings dam wall. Los Pelambres 
considers the ruling of the Civil Court of Los 
Vilos to be flawed, has appealed the Court’s 
decision and is considering the exercise of all 
available legal measures that may be required 
to overturn this decision and address its 
potential consequences.
Additional details of these claims are set out in Note 35 to 
the financial statements
POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS 
(“PPAs”)
In July the El Arrayán wind farm, in which the 
Group has a 30% interest, started supplying 
Los Pelambres with power under a 20-year 
PPA at an average of 40MW, approximately 
20% of the mine’s total energy requirement. 
During 2014, Los Pelambres also signed long-
term PPAs with two solar power providers 
for a total of 50MW of power that will start 
in 2015 and 2016. 
These PPAs will provide power at significantly 
lower cost than Los Pelambres has been 
paying in the spot market over the last 
two years and, together with other PPAs, 
will reduce the variability and cost of Los 
Pelambres’ power requirement over the 
coming years.
For more information on these PPAs, please see page 47
OUTLOOK
PRODUCTION
The forecast production for 2015 is 
approximately 385,000 tonnes of payable 
copper, compared with 391,300 tonnes 
in 2014. This decrease is mainly due 
to lower plant throughput as a result of 
increased hardness of the ore. The forecast 
for 2015 molybdenum production is 
approximately 8,000 tonnes, similar to 2014 
volumes. Gold production is forecast to 
be 55,000 ounces, a decrease of 11,500 
ounces as a result of lower grades and 
recoveries. Local protests in March 2015 have 
reduced expected copper production at Los 
Pelambres by some 8,000 tonnes of copper. 
These protests, along with the adverse ruling 
from the Civil Court of Los Vilos, mean that 
there is some inherent uncertainty as to the 
potential impact on Los Pelambres’ 2015 
production levels.
CASH COSTS
Cash costs before by-products for 2015 
are forecast to be approximately $1.50/lb, 
lower than 2014 levels, and net cash costs are 
forecast at approximately $1.15/lb, assuming 
a molybdenum price of $9.50/lb and a 
gold price of $1,300/oz. As noted above, 
local protests have disrupted production. 
These protests, along with the adverse ruling 
from the Civil Court of Los Vilos, mean that 
there is some inherent uncertainty as to the 
potential impact on Los Pelambres’ 2015 cash 
costs. Energy prices remain a key input cost 
for Los Pelambres and are dependent, in part, 
on the level of precipitation in the region, 
where much of the power is generated by 
hydroelectric schemes. However, following 
the commissioning of the El Arrayán wind 
farm in 2014 and one of the solar plants in

STRATEGIC REPORT CENTINELA MERGER
In June 2014, the Group announced the 
merger of the Esperanza and El Tesoro mines 
into a single operating company, Minera 
Centinela. This merger was completed in 
November 2014 and the Group is now in 
the process of integrating activities at the 
two operations.
The merger provides a greater focus for the 
Group’s activities in the Centinela Mining 
District and creates value through operational 
and other synergies. These synergies come 
from the sharing of operational overheads, 
integration of mine plans, operating a single 
mining fleet, sharing of mining properties 
and facilities such as waste ore dumps, 
economies of scale from tendering larger 
contracts, and combining the management 
teams. The merger opens up potential 
opportunities and synergies through future 
development of other deposits in the 
Centinela Mining District, most immediately 
the Encuentro Oxides project. 
For more information on these projects, 
please see pages 44 to 46
2014 PERFORMANCE
OPERATING PROFIT
The operating profit at Centinela in 2014 was 
$464.4 million, compared with $845.0 million 
in 2013, reflecting higher net cash costs and 
lower realised copper prices, partly offset by 
increased sales volumes of concentrates. 
The realised copper price fell from $3.28/lb 
in 2013 to $3.00/lb in 2014, as did the realised 
gold price, which fell from $1,358/oz in 2013 
to $1,261/oz in 2014.
PRODUCTION
Copper production decreased by 3.9% to 
266,600 tonnes in 2014 compared with 2013, 
due mainly to lower cathode production.
Copper in concentrate production in 2014 
was 172,800 tonnes, a 1.2% decrease 
compared with 2013, reflecting a decrease 
in throughput, partially offset by higher grades 
and recoveries. Gold production in 2014 was 
204,400 ounces compared with 237,100 
ounces in 2013, due to lower grades and 
recoveries and slightly decreased throughput.
Copper cathode production was 93,800 
tonnes compared with the 102,600 tonnes 
produced in 2013. This was primarily due to 
lower copper grades and recoveries following 
the completion of mining activities at the 
higher-grade Mirador pit in 2013, partially 
offset by higher throughput. The average 
ore grade decreased to 1.31% in 2014 from 
1.52% in 2013. Throughput at the plant from 
the heap-leach operation averaged 25,200 
tonnes per day in 2014, compared with 
21,300 tonnes per day in 2013.
CASH COSTS
Cash costs before by-product credits 
for copper in concentrate in 2014 fell to 
$2.29/lb compared with $2.36/lb in 2013. 
This decrease was due to the weakening 
of the peso and lower input costs, partially 
offset by the one-off signing bonus paid 
during the year following the successful 
completion of a new four-year agreement 
with the union in the second quarter of 2014. 
Net cash costs rose to $1.54/lb in 2014, 
compared with $1.43/lb in 2013, primarily 
due to a $0.18/lb drop in by-product credits 
due to lower gold production and the 7.1% 
fall in realised gold prices.
Copper cathode cash costs increased from 
$1.36/lb in 2013 to $1.79/lb in 2014, primarily 
reflecting the increase in costs following the 
closure of the higher-grade Mirador ore in 
2013, and the one-off bonus payment. 
Capital expenditure in 2014 was $535.6 
million, including approximately $330 million 
in respect of optimisation and development 
projects. Total capital expenditure in 
2015 is expected to be approximately 
$680 million, including $380 million related 
to the construction of the Encuentro Oxides 
and Molybdenum Plant projects.
More information on these projects can be found 
on pages 44 to 46
OUTLOOK
PRODUCTION
The forecast for 2015 is for production of 
approximately 255,000 tonnes of payable 
copper and 195,000 ounces of gold. 
This forecast is based on an increase in 
throughput at the concentrator plant, as the 
benefits of the optimisation and expansion 
will be seen progressively from mid-2015. 
This will be offset by a decrease in cathode 
production compared with 2014, as grades 
decline at the pits being mined, and this 
decline will continue until the Encuentro 
Oxides project starts production in 2016.
CASH COSTS
Cash costs before by-products for 2015 are 
forecast to be approximately $2. 10/lb compared 
with $2. 12/lb in 2014. Net cash costs are 
forecast at approximately $1.60/lb, assuming 
a gold price of $1,300/oz. Net cash costs are 
sensitive to the gold price, with each $100/oz 
movement in the realised gold price having 
a $0.03/lb impact on net cash costs in 2015.
A feasibility study was approved in the first 
quarter of 2015 for the construction of a 
separate molybdenum plant that would 
produce approximately 3,500 tonnes per year 
of molybdenum over the remaining life of the 
mine. Production should commence in 2016.

OPERATING PROFIT
Michilla had an operating loss of $29.0 million 
in 2014, compared to an operating loss of 
$43.1 million in 2013. 2014 was the last full 
year of production at Michilla with the mine 
closing at the end of 2015. Michilla’s realised 
copper price of $3.30/lb was significantly 
higher than that of the other operations 
due to hedging instruments covering 
approximately 80% of production in 2014. 
Further details of the effects of commodity hedging are 
given in Note 23 to the financial statements
PRODUCTION
Total production in 2014 was 47,000 tonnes 
of copper cathodes, an increase of 22.7% 
on the 2013 production of 38,300 tonnes 
as a result of mining higher-grade areas 
of the Lince pit. 
CASH COSTS
Cash costs decreased significantly to $2.38/lb 
in 2014 compared with $3.22/lb in 2013. 
This decrease is due to the completion of 
the stripping programme in 2013 and higher 
than expected grades at the Lince open 
pit, together with the weaker peso, which 
reduced costs in US dollar terms. 
Capital expenditure for the year was $11.1 
million in 2014 compared with $17.2 million 
in 2013.
OUTLOOK
Cathode production in 2015 is forecast 
to be approximately 30,000 tonnes. 
The forecast cash costs for 2015 are 
approximately $2.30/lb, slightly higher than 
in 2014 reflecting the ramp-down of the 
mine in anticipation of its closure at the end 
of the year.
The decision has been made to close 
the mine at the end of 2015, but the Group 
is conducting a sale process during the 
year to ascertain whether any parties are 
interested in acquiring the operation to try 
to extend its life beyond the closure date. 
Michilla has been in operation since 1959 and 
the Group acquired its original interest in the 
company in 1983.

GROWTH PROJECTS  
AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Group seeks growth in Chile and abroad through the 
development of projects and other potential opportunities. 
Brownfield development within the Group’s Los Pelambres 
and Centinela mining districts in Chile remain the primary 
focus to maximise value, with new opportunities 
further afield also being considered.
The Group has a portfolio of longer-term 
growth options. These are currently being 
evaluated in pre-feasibility and feasibility 
studies. Given the early-stage nature of some 
of these projects, their potential and timing 
is inherently uncertain and so the following 
outline is only intended to provide a high-level 
indication of potential opportunities.
The Group’s exploration and evaluation 
expenditure decreased by 39.1% to 
$167.5 million in 2014 compared with 
$274.9 million in 2013. The 2015 full-year 
forecast expenditure in relation to exploration 
and evaluation activities is approximately 
$115 million. The decrease in the exploration 
and evaluation expense reflects a tighter 
focus on high-potential activities in a period 
of lower copper prices and lower expenditure 
on pre-feasibility studies, especially at 
Twin Metals.
PROJECTS UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION
2 ANTUCOYA
Antucoya is an oxide deposit approximately 
45 km east of Michilla, in Chile’s Antofagasta 
Region. The Group has a 70% economic 
interest in the project.
Construction of the project was resumed 
in early 2013 and currently the project is on 
schedule and on budget with 99.1% total 
project progress (design, procurement and 
physical progress) and 98.3% construction 
progress as of 31 December 2014. 
Construction is expected to finish in the first 
half of 2015, with ramp-up to full production 
capacity of 85,000 tonnes per year of copper 
cathodes by 2016. Cash costs are expected 
to be approximately $1.80/lb for the first five 
years of full production and $2.10/lb in 2015. 
The mine plan includes proved and probable 
ore reserves of 681.6 million tonnes of 0.34% 
copper (using a cut-off grade of 0.20%) over 
the 20-year mine life.
Total construction costs for the project 
are expected to be $1.9 billion, of which 
$1.6 billion has been incurred up to 
31 December 2014. 
BROWNFIELD GROWTH 
PROJECTS
The Group has always recognised the 
importance of capital cost control and 
optimising production from existing 
operations. The Group manages this by 
constantly monitoring the efficiency of 
mines, plants and transport infrastructure. 
Where possible, it conducts debottlenecking 
and incremental plant expansions 
to improve efficiency.
2 CENTINELA
During 2014, work continued on optimising 
Centinela’s concentrator plant to bring the 
level of throughput to the original design 
capacity of 97,000 tonnes per day and later 
to 105,000 tonnes per day. The first stage 
includes the installation of two tailings 
thickeners, crushing equipment and flotation 
cells, and is due to be completed in the first 
half of 2015. The second stage, carried out 
simultaneously, involves the installation of 
a sixth tailings thickener at the plant as well 
as further mining equipment to support 
additional activities. Throughput of 105,000 
tonnes per day should be achieved 
in late 2015.
44 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 2 LOS PELAMBRES INCREMENTAL 
EXPANSION
The feasibility study examining the options for 
an incremental expansion of Los Pelambres 
continued during 2014. As part of the project 
development, an EIA must be produced 
before the necessary permits are issued 
by the various authorities and construction 
can commence. As part of the EIA, an 
environmental baseline study first needs 
to be completed, which requires at least 
12 months of data. This is under way and 
the EIA will be submitted in 2016. The study 
focuses on the project’s environmental 
and social enablers and a dedicated team 
has been engaged to carry out this work. 
The completion of the feasibility study has 
been postponed until the EIA has been 
approved as the outcome of the EIA may 
impact the content of the feasibility study.
Capital expenditure for the expansion 
project, which will increase throughput to 
205,000 tonnes per day, was estimated in 
the pre-feasibility study as approximately 
$1.2 billion and the feasibility study work to 
date confirms this amount. This estimate 
includes the purchase of additional mining 
equipment and the construction of a 
new grinding circuit and flotation plant. 
The capacity of the expansion is constrained 
by the increased proportion of harder ore 
in the mill feed, which reduces the rate of 
throughput, and the maximum capacity of 
the conveyor that transports ore from the pit 
to the concentrator plant. Average copper 
production will increase by 90-95,000 tonnes, 
with a net increase in average production of 
approximately 40-45,000 tonnes of copper 
per year, over the production that would have 
been achieved if there had been no increase 
in the hardness of the ore.
2 ENCUENTRO OXIDES
The Encuentro Oxides deposit is located 
within the Centinela Mining District. 
It is expected to produce an average of 
approximately 40,000 tonnes of copper 
cathode per year, averaged over an eight-
year period, utilising the existing capacity 
at Centinela’s SX-EW plant. This will enable 
the plant to continue to produce at full 
capacity of 100,000 tonnes per annum for 
a number of years from 2016, thereby helping 
to offset a decline in production that would 
otherwise occur due to falling mined grades 
at the existing oxide pits at Centinela.
The project entails the installation of new 
crushing and heap-leach facilities at the 
Encuentro Oxides deposit, a pipeline to take 
the leach solution to the existing SX-EW 
plant for processing some 15 km away, and 
the extension of the sea water pipeline from 
Centinela to Encuentro. The higher-grade ore 
will be crushed and sent to the new heap-
leach facilities, while lower-grade ore will be 
processed later on a Run-of-Mine (“ROM”) 
leach pad. 
This deposit is geologically important for 
the Group’s long-term development plan, 
as Encuentro Oxides sits on top of the large 
Encuentro Sulphide deposit. The Encuentro 
Oxides project will therefore act as a funded 
pre-strip for the sulphides below, opening it 
up for development as part of the Centinela 
Second Concentrator project (see below).
During 2014, the Board approved early 
works relating to pre-stripping and camp 
construction. The feasibility study was 
completed in November 2014 and full-
scale construction started in early 2015. 
First production is expected in the second 
half of 2016. 
The pre-feasibility study capital cost estimate 
of $756 million assumed that Centinela would 
build a spur from its sea water pipeline to 
Encuentro Oxides and sell the water to the 
project. This assumption was changed during 
the feasibility study and the spur will now be 
funded as part of the project, increasing the 
capital cost by $36 million to $792 million. 
Other changes in the feasibility study, 
including new foreign exchange assumptions, 
a lower mining cost for pre-stripping, lower 
contingencies, various optimisations of the 
project and the inclusion of several items that 
were omitted from the original study, resulted 
in a final estimate for capital expenditure 
of $636 million, some $156 million less than 
the adjusted pre-feasibility study estimate.

2 CENTINELA SECOND 
CONCENTRATOR
The Group continues to evaluate the options 
for the development of the Centinela Mining 
District, a key area for the Group’s longer-
term growth opportunities. Following the 
merger of Esperanza and El Tesoro, the 
Group’s development of the district, which 
includes the construction of a second 
concentrator, will now be carried out as part 
of the integrated Minera Centinela. 
The second concentrator plant will be 
built some 7 km from Centinela’s current 
concentrator. It is expected to have a daily 
ore throughput of approximately 90,000 
tonnes per day, with annual copper and 
gold production of approximately 140,000 
tonnes and 150,000 ounces respectively. 
It is currently planned that ore will first be 
sourced from the Esperanza Sur deposit 
and, once mining at Encuentro Oxides is 
completed, then ore will be sourced from 
Encuentro Sulphides.
The pre-feasibility study will be completed in 
mid-2015 and work will commence in parallel 
on the Environmental Impact Assessment 
and the feasibility study, with both scheduled 
for completion by the end of 2016. 
First production could start in 2019 and capital 
expenditure is estimated at $2.7 billion. 
The project team is continuing to review 
options for reducing the capital cost of 
the project, including the use of existing 
infrastructure (power lines, pipelines, 
concentrate shipping and other facilities) 
as well as using a larger owner’s team, as 
opposed to an EPCM contractor, together 
with other capital cost-saving initiatives.
The Group continues to evaluate other 
opportunities in the Centinela Mining District. 
Currently work is being carried out on the 
Polo Sur deposit, which has a resource of 
1.3 billion tonnes at 0.35% copper (including 
122.8 million tonnes of copper oxides at 
0.40% copper, as well as some additional 
leachable supergene sulphides) with gold 
and molybdenum by-products. This oxide 
deposit is situated approximately 35 km from 
Centinela and may act as an additional source 
of feed for its SX-EW plant in the future. 
Following the completion of the second 
concentrator in 2019, there is further scope 
to increase the plant capacity and the Group 
is evaluating the possibility of a further 
expansion. This could bring throughput 
capacity to approximately 150,000 tonnes per 
day and could increase annual production to 
approximately 200,000 tonnes of copper and 
170,000 ounces of gold. No date has been 
set for when to commence a feasibility study 
on this expansion.
2 LOS PELAMBRES
Given the size of the resource, which at 
6.2 billion tonnes is more than three times 
the quantity of processed ore expected under 
the existing mine plan, there is significant 
scope to increase the plant capacity beyond 
the 205,000 tonnes per day planned for 
the incremental expansion project. Such an 
expansion will require extensive permitting 
and the support of the local communities 
and currently no significant evaluation work 
is planned.

3 OTHER EXPLORATION AND 
EVALUATION ACTIVITIES
The Group has an active early-stage 
exploration programme beyond the existing 
core locations of the Centinela and Los 
Pelambres mining districts. Exploration is 
conducted through its in-house exploration 
team and through partnerships with third 
parties to build a portfolio of longer-term 
opportunities across Chile and the rest 
of the world.
CHILE
The Group continues exploration activities 
to identify prospective targets on the main 
porphyry copper belts in Chile, focusing 
on the northern and central regions.
During the year, 1.3 billion tonnes of mineral 
inventory relating to the Los Volcanes 
project was upgraded to mineral resource, 
demonstrating the Group’s ability to 
continually expand and develop its resource 
base. Exploration work continues at the 
Conchi, Brujulina Sur and Cerro Las Papas Sur 
deposits as well as in areas nearby. 
The Group has land holdings throughout Chile 
and in some instances conducts exploration 
under agreements with the landowners 
or the state. 
INTERNATIONAL
The Group has a portfolio of early-stage 
exploration interests held through a number 
of strategic alliances, joint ventures and 
earn-in agreements with companies focused 
on exploration in their respective regions. 
During 2014 the Group entered into new 
agreements with companies in Canada, 
Australia, Zambia, Mauritania, Finland 
and Argentina and terminated agreements 
in Australia, Canada, Mexico and the US. 
The Group’s strategy is to partner with 
experienced junior exploration companies, 
funding their exploration programmes 
and benefiting from their local knowledge 
and expertise.
3 ENERGY OPPORTUNITIES
Over the last few years the Group has 
acquired a series of interests in energy 
generators and projects as part of its strategy 
to support the power supply requirements 
of the mining operations. The strategy 
has a particular focus on renewable 
energy generation, supporting the Group’s 
broader aim of increasing the sustainability 
of its operations. 
Further information regarding the Chilean energy market is 
included in the Key inputs section on pages 22 to 24
ENERGÍA ANDINA
Energía Andina S.A. (“Energía Andina“) is a 
geothermal energy joint venture with Origin 
Energy Limited of Australia. During 2014 
Energía Andina took an option to invest in 
the Javiera solar project that will supply Los 
Pelambres with power and as part of this 
transaction the Group reduced its interest in 
Energía Andina to 50%. To date, exploration 
has demonstrated the existence of an active 
geothermal system at the Tinguiririca project 
near Santiago, but no further exploration is 
planned for the foreseeable future.

farm in Chile, about 400 km north of Santiago. 
The plant now supplies 40MW of power to 
Los Pelambres, accounting for approximately 
20% of its total power requirement, under a 
20-year supply contract. Prices are favourable 
compared with the current spot price.
INVERSIONES HORNITOS
Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia (“FCAB”) 
owns a 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos 
S.A. (“Inversiones Hornitos”), which operates 
the 165MW Hornitos thermoelectric power 
plant in Mejillones, in Chile’s Antofagasta 
Region. Inversiones Hornitos continues 
to supply Centinela under long-term PPAs.
ALTO MAIPO
The Group holds a 40% interest in the 
531MW Alto Maipo run-of-river hydroelectric 
project located in the upper section of the 
Maipo river, approximately 50 km south-
east of Santiago. Construction started in 
December 2013 and the total capital cost is 
expected to be $2.1 billion, with $1.2 billion 
funded by project financing secured in 
December 2013. The Group has signed two 
20-year PPAs that will secure the provision of 
energy to Los Pelambres for up to 160MW, 
with the first PPA starting in 2015 and 
the second on completion of the project 
at the end of 2018.
SOLAR ENERGY
During 2014, Los Pelambres signed long-
term PPAs with two solar power providers 
for a total of 50MW of power, approximately 
25% of its total energy requirement. The first 
of these PPAs will provide Los Pelambres 
with solar energy from the first half of 2015 
and the second from the beginning of 2016. 
These PPAs provide secure renewable 
energy supply to Los Pelambres for a 20-year 
period at favourable prices compared with 
the current spot price.

STRATEGIC REPORT OPERATIONAL REVIEW
TRANSPORT
The transport division provides rail cargo services in 
Chile and Bolivia, and road cargo and other ancillary 
services in Chile. In Chile, the main business during 
2014 was the transport of copper cathodes from, and 
sulphuric acid to, mines in the Antofagasta Region. 
In Bolivia, the Group has a 50% controlling interest 
in the Ferrocarril Andino, which transports zinc and 
lead concentrates from Bolivia via the border town 
of Ollagüe.
7.3m tonnes
transported in 2014
TRANSPORT
The transport division typically provides 
services to customers under long-term 
contracts, often with agreed pricing levels. 
These are subject to adjustments for inflation 
and movements in fuel prices. The division 
offers cargo transfer, shipment and storage 
services both domestically and internationally.
The transport division’s total volumes 
transported were lower in 2014, falling to 
7.3 million tonnes, compared with 7.4 million 
tonnes in 2013. This was primarily due to 
a decrease in road transportation volumes 
during the year.
Turnover at the transport division was 
$180.8 million, a 8.0% decrease compared 
to turnover of $196.6 million in 2013, 
reflecting lower tonnage and a decrease in 
tariffs due to lower oil prices and the weaker 
peso (tariffs are set in pesos). 
Operating profit fell to $45.6 million in 2014, 
mainly reflecting the decrease in tonnage. 
Capital expenditure in 2014 was $21.2 million 
compared to $28.7 million in 2013.
The Antofagasta port is managed by the 
Group’s 30% associate ATI. ATI is a strategic 
investment for the Group and complements 
the transport division’s principal business as 
the main transporter of cargo within Chile’s 
Antofagasta Region.
The transport division also owns Forestal 
S.A., which manages the Group’s forestry 
assets. Forestal’s two properties, Releco-
Puñir and Huilo-Huilo, comprise 26,295 
hectares of native forest near the Panguipulli 
and Neltume lakes, in Chile’s Region de 
Los Lagos. During 2014, Forestal continued 
its forestation, fertilisation and thinning 
programme to maintain these assets.

INNOVATIVE SUSTAINABILITY
The transport division focuses its 
sustainability efforts on preventing accidents 
and the safe management of cargoes, as the 
business involves working with heavy moving 
machinery and hazardous materials.
All employees and contractors undergo 
rigorous health and safety training when 
they join, with regular refresher courses 
throughout their careers. In addition, the 
division has a number of public safety 
measures in place to prevent traffic and 
pedestrian accidents around its tracks, 
including traffic lights, clear signalling at 
railway crossings, regular track maintenance 
and public education campaigns. 
The public is informed about the safety issues 
relating to division’s activities, as well as 
the dangers of rubbish collecting on tracks 
running through inhabited areas. This is a risk 
to the safe operation of the trains, as well as 
a public health and landscape issue.
The division also transports hazardous 
substances, such as sulphuric acid, so 
preventing spills and ensuring the safe 
disposal of any waste associated with 
its cargo are management priorities.

WATER
Aguas de Antofagasta (“ADASA”) operates a 30-year 
concession for the distribution of water in Chile’s 
Antofagasta Region, acquired from the state-owned 
Empresa Concesionaria de Servicios Sanitarios S.A. 
(“ECONSSA CHILE SA”) in 2003. The division provides 
potable desalinated water to domestic and commercial 
customers in the Antofagasta Region, obtaining water 
from mountain catchment areas and the sea, and 
distributing it through its 1,140 km pipe network.
50.9m m

WATER
The water division consists of two main 
businesses: a regulated water business 
supplying domestic customers and an 
unregulated business serving mines and 
other industrial users. Sales to domestic 
customers are priced in accordance with 
regulated tariff structures, while sales 
to industrial customers are generally 
contractually agreed. The division’s activities 
in Chile are regulated by the Superintendencia 
de Servicios Sanitarios (“SISS”).
In 2014, the water division sold 50.9 million 
cubic metres of water to domestic and 
commercial customers, compared with 
volumes of 51.3 million cubic metres in 2013.
Turnover in 2014 decreased by 8.1% to 
$124.9 million from $135.9 million in 2013, 
due to lower slightly lower volumes and 
tariffs. Operating profit rose in the year due to 
lower maintenance costs. Capital expenditure 
in 2014 was $25.0 million compared 
to $13.4 million in 2013.

INNOVATIVE SUSTAINABILITY
ADASA embodies the Group’s commitment 
to providing innovative solutions to Chile’s 
water scarcity by extracting water from the 
sea and treating it for human consumption. 
The company provides drinking water to 
the public and also operates waste water 
treatment facilities. Both utilities are tightly 
regulated by the national sanitary services.
Quality is a challenge because continental 
water in the region contains naturally high 
levels of arsenic. ADASA uses advanced water 
purification systems to produce drinking water 
with arsenic levels at less than 0.01 parts per 
million, supplying safe potable water in line with 
World Health Organisation quality requirements 
for over 160,000 people with 40% of this 
supply coming from treated sea water.
Consistency of supply is a major concern and 
ADASA’s emergency response committee 
creates and supervises management 
protocols and contingency plans for potential 
disruptions in collaboration with local 
emergency response teams. The company 
communicates directly with customers, 
via text or online, about any planned or 
unplanned disruptions to supply. In addition, 
local organisations are regularly invited to tour 
the company’s desalination plants to increase 
public understanding of how desalinated 
drinking water is produced. 
Controlling odours from the sewerage 
networks and the safe disposal of treated 
sludge are also key priorities for the company.

ICMM Membership
In May 2014 Antofagasta became a 
member of the International Council 
on Mining and Metals (“ICMM”), the 
CEO-led industry organisation dedicated 
to promoting the highest principles 
and standards for sustainable mining. 
Acceptance by the ICMM required 
the Group to conduct an extensive 
review of its performance against the 
organisations’s standards. The Group 
initiated an independent audit, which was 
submitted to an independent expert panel 
selected by the ICMM. On the panel’s 
recommendation, Antofagasta was invited 
to become an ICMM member in May 
2014 and is now formally committed to 
complying with the highest sustainability 
standards and industry best practices. 
Sustainable development is an essential component 
of Antofagasta’s decision-making process and 
business strategy. 
To achieve sustainable development, the Group  
is committed to operational excellence, safety,  
talent management, environmental management 
and working with employees and local communities.

52 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 MANAGEMENT FOCUS
Antofagasta remains dedicated to achieving 
its zero fatalities goal and improving overall 
safety at its operations. A corporate safety 
management team was formed in 2013 to 
strengthen existing teams at each operation. 
Together they have introduced a new safety 
and occupational health model based on 
international best practices that focuses 
on preventing high-potential fatal accidents. 
This approach is based on three pillars: 
1 Early identification of high-potential risks 
and the definition of controls
2 Reporting high-potential near misses
3 Safety leadership
PERFORMANCE
Despite the Group’s safety efforts, there 
were five fatalities in 2014. In January, a male 
contractor was killed while working on a 
pipeline section in Centinela. In September, 
a female truck driver was involved in a 
fatal accident at Los Pelambres and in 
October three male contractors lost their 
lives in a vehicle accident at Centinela. 
As a result, the Group has adopted higher 
driving standards with tighter enforcement, 
including mandatory fatigue control and 
the wider use of speed control devices. 
Antofagasta remains committed to the safety 
model introduced in 2013 and to achieving 
zero fatalities across all of its operations. 
Overall safety performance is measured 
by the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(“LTIFR”) and the All Injury Frequency 
Rate (“AIFR”). In 2014, the Group’s 
LTIFR remained stable at 1.9, despite 
an approximate 30% increase in the total 
workforce. The AIFR increased from 3.9 
in 2013 to 4.9 in 2014, but it must be 
noted that only 12% were high-potential 
accidents, that could have caused death 
or permanent incapacity.

SAFETY
Despite all the efforts made to focus on safety, in 
2014 the Group failed to achieve its zero fatalities 
goal. There were five fatalities during the year in three 
separate incidents. Antofagasta is well aware that 
achieving zero fatalities is a long journey and setbacks 
must not derail that process. The Group has redoubled 
its efforts and is striving to achieve its target in 2015.
Why it matters
Ensuring its employees’ and contractors’ 
health and safety is of paramount 
importance to the Group, as reflected 
in the corporate Charter of Values 
and the Group’s strategic objectives. 
Major incidents impact people’s 
health, company morale, reputation 
and production.

NEW SAFETY MEASURES
During 2014 a number of new measures 
were introduced, including:
 – Identification of the top five high-potential 
risks in each operating unit, definition of 
specific controls for these and assigning 
individual responsibility for implementing 
these controls
 – Focus on high-potential near-miss reporting
 – Sustained efforts to raise standards and share 
lessons between operations
 – Development of specific corporate 
safety standards and collaboration with 
contractor companies
 – An intensive safety awareness-raising 
campaign with highly-visible leadership from 
senior management, including dedicated site 
visits by the Group CEO

All operations have a management system 
aligned with the OHSAS 18001 standard. 
Safety managers report to the Corporate 
Health and Safety Unit and to their operation’s 
General Manager, who in turn reports 
weekly to the Vice-President of Operations. 
Performance is also reported to the Board 
of Directors monthly. Safety performance 
is tied to individual remuneration for senior 
management and employees. 
Towards the end of 2014, 700 contractor 
companies were assessed to identify those 
with high exposure to any of the identified 
high-risk potential activities. Over 200 
companies were prioritised to receive 
additional technical support, ensuring full 
implementation of Antofagasta’s safety 
model. Contractors are regularly audited to 
ensure compliance with the Group’s strategic 
model for managing safety and health risks.
PREVENTING HEALTH RISKS
In 2014 the Company undertook an exercise 
to determine an acceptable health baseline 
for its employees and contractors. This study 
identified six factors at the workplace that had 
potential to cause illness resulting in death 
or partial incapacity - silica dust, sulphuric 
acid haze, ionic radiation, solar radiation, 
height and noise. Once these factors were 
identified, critical controls were established 
for each one and a campaign was launched 
to raise awareness of these risks.
Occupational health plans seek to keep 
workers healthy and free from common 
and work-related injuries or illnesses. 
Work stations and equipment are designed 
to take into account employees’ health and 
wellbeing. Employees and contractors are 
encouraged to report immediately unsafe 
or unhealthy working conditions. On site, 
the Group promotes a healthy and balanced 
diet and provides sporting facilities and 
equipment. Each employee is entitled to 
a thorough annual medical check-up paid 
for by the Company.

A COMMON GROUP IDENTITY
In 2014, the Group worked to create a 
stronger sense of common identity and 
to standardise best practice across its 
operations, using a common Charter of 
Values defined after an intensive internal 
consultation process. These values help 
guide key processes such as business 
alignment, performance management and 
leadership development. As part of the 
effort to embed these values, a recognition 
programme has been implemented across 
the Group.

TALENT MANAGEMENT  
AND LABOUR RELATIONS
In a world of volatile markets and talent shortages, recruitment 
and retention are a constant challenge. Antofagasta seeks to 
be a preferred employer and to achieve this the Group’s human 
resources strategy is to develop, promote and maintain a strong 
value proposition for employees.
A NEW MANAGEMENT APPROACH 
The Group has an ambitious long-term 
vision for operational excellence, world-class 
performance in health and safety, talent 
management, stakeholder management, 
labour relations and capitalising on 
growth opportunities. Human resources 
management supports this business 
strategy through:
 – process standardisation and best 
practice sharing;
 – ensuring the necessary talent is available 
when required; 
 – promotion of shared corporate values; and 
 – corporate management of critical human 
resources processes with a high positive 
impact in terms of competitiveness, 
employee value proposition, talent 
development and capturing synergies.
The human resources management model 
seeks to develop organisational capabilities 
to address the challenges in each of the 
Group’s strategic pillars. This goal translates 
into, for example, succession plans for key 
positions and leadership development. 
For more information on the Group’s strategy,  
please see page 28
DEVELOPMENT
A new staff performance appraisal 
system was implemented across the 
Group. This aimed to emphasise individual 
performance, foster meritocracy and 
develop leadership competencies, while 
aligning employees’ targets with the 
Group’s objectives. 
Why it matters
The Group’s management strongly 
believes that internal mobility, training and 
professional development opportunities 
foster engaged employees. This increases 
employee retention and promotes 
sustained productivity and growth.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT The corporate trainee programme recruits 
young professionals with the potential to 
become future leaders, giving them exposure 
in the organisation and offering internships 
across the Group. Since this initiative was 
launched in 2010, 114 young professionals 
have joined the programme, of whom 28 
are women. 
Gender diversity remains a challenge in 
many sectors of the Chilean economy, 
including mining. Women account for 
7.4%
1
 of the Chilean mining industry’s 
labour force. At Antofagasta, 10% of its 
employees are women and of this 10%, 
33% are supervisors.
During 2014, there were 655 women and 
5,954 men employed by the Group. There is 
one woman in senior management out of a 
total of 25 people at that level and she is a 
member of the Executive Committee.
In March 2014, the Company welcomed its 
first woman Director to the Board, which has 
a total of 11 Directors. The Group continues 
to make efforts to increase the number of 
women it employs, while maintaining its 
policy of recruiting the best candidate for 
the job.
STRONG LABOUR RELATIONS
Labour relations grounded in trust, constant 
dialogue and good working conditions reflect 
our Charter of Values and are conducive to 
achieving the Group’s strategic objectives.
In 2014 the Group had a total workforce of 
26,151 including employees and contractors, 
compared to 20,660 people in 2013, of which 
6,609 were employees. The increase in the 
total workforce is mainly due to the significant 
number of contractors working on the 
construction of the Antucoya mine.
At the operations the Group has eight unions: 
two at Los Pelambres, four at Centinela, one 
at Michilla and one at Antucoya.
2
 On average 
some 55% of the Group’s employees 
belong to a union. The labour contracts 
at Los Pelambres, Centinela, Michilla and 
Antucoya were all renewed during 2014 after 
successful collective bargaining processes. 
Michilla’s labour contract included severance 
agreements for its workers in anticipation of 
the mine’s closure in 2015. The new labour 
contracts at Los Pelambres, Centinela and 
Antucoya have fixed the pay increase for 
employees until 2018 when contracts will 
be renegotiated.
Good labour relations are evident from the 
fact that none of the Group’s operations has 
experienced a strike since its activities began. 
More information on the social and environmental 
provisions for Michilla’s closure can be found in the 
Antofagasta Minerals 2014 Sustainability Report.

COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Over the last few years Chile has faced growing opposition to 
industrial projects, often including legal action. The Group has 
recently adopted a new approach to stakeholder engagement 
and community relations, declaring a long-term commitment to 
enhancing local development in conjunction with public sector 
and other private stakeholders.
MANAGEMENT AND STANDARDS
Responsiveness and consistency of approach 
in dealing with the impact of the Group’s 
operations and managing community 
expectations are vital in demonstrating 
respect for local people, building trust and 
preventing conflict. Antofagasta’s approach is 
guided by its social strategy, social relations 
policy, Code of Ethics and specific standards 
for community investment and grievance 
management, which are aligned with ICMM  
best practice. The Group has a team of 
professionals dedicated to stakeholder 
relations at each operation. 
Antofagasta continues to promote a 
grievance management procedure that allows 
stakeholders to raise concerns and receive 
formal responses. The Group identifies 
local concerns and expectations through 
ongoing dialogue. 
Social and environmental considerations 
are an integral part of all project design 
standards. When applying for environmental 
permits, the Group must commit to 
specific impact prevention, mitigation and 
compensation measures that become legally 
enforceable. The project construction stage 
is labour intensive and provides a window 
of opportunity for employing local people. 
This effort was particularly successful during 
the construction of Esperanza (now Centinela) 
when the Group’s apprenticeship programme 
recruited and trained 400 local workers, 10% 
of whom were women, who later joined its 
permanent workforce. 
Why it matters
Both operational continuity and future 
growth both depend on the Group’s 
capacity to become a preferred partner 
for all stakeholders, particularly its 
neighbouring communities. Due to the 
location of Los Pelambres in a narrow, 
populated valley, the challenge is 
particularly acute at this operation.
Performance
$31.3m
 
was invested by Antofagasta during 
2014 on community projects near to

In focus
A NEW APPROACH 
Los Pelambres, the Group’s largest 
operation, sits at the head of the Choapa 
Valley and interacts with 42 different 
communities. Under the new model 
adopted by the Group, Los Pelambres, 
together with regional and municipal 
authorities, is heavily involved in a wide, 
multi-stakeholder dialogue process among 
all these communities and other local 
stakeholders. The aim is to articulate 
a common vision for the sustainable 
development of the region, addressing 
structural challenges and bottlenecks 
(both related and unrelated to the mining 
operation) and defining a portfolio of 
projects to realise this vision funded 
through a public-private alliance.

Centinela pioneered the use of raw sea 
water, thus reducing the pressure on 
scarce continental water resources and 
the energy required to desalinate water. 
New projects such as Antucoya and 
Encuentro Oxides are also designed to use 
raw sea water. 
Centinela took on another unprecedented 
challenge for a project of its size when it 
replaced its traditional tailings dam with a 
higher pulp density deposit. Among the 
advantages of thickened tailings is more 
efficient water management, less land use 
and better control of dust emissions from 
the surface of the tailings dam. 
Continental water is scarce in the central and northern 
parts of Chile where the Group operates. The situation 
is aggravated by rising demand, non-sustainable practices 
and climate change. The mining industry is a significant 
consumer of water and its activities can affect not only 
the availability of water but its quality due to the leaching 
of heavy metals and sulphates from waste dumps and 
tailings dams.

WATER
Why it matters
Prolonged drought in central Chile is a 
growing concern for all stakeholders 
and makes water an increasingly costly 
key input.
LEADING WATER SOLUTIONS
All of the Group’s operations have water 
management plans. Water accounting 
records are based on the Water Accounting 
Framework methodology developed by the 
Sustainable Minerals Institute of Queensland 
University and the Minerals Council of 
Australia. The Group participates in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project Water Program, 
publishing its information on water sources 
and consumption. In 2014, Group-wide 
water consumption was 47,444 million cubic 
metres, of which 44% was sea water and the 
remaining 56% was continental water.
The Group monitors the quantity and quality 
of water in its area of influence and uses 
as little high-quality continental water as 
possible. Water reuse rates as high as 85% 
are achieved at some operations and the 
Group has zero discharges to water courses. 
All water is reused unless it is trapped within 
the tailings or evaporates.
Precipitation has been below average 
for some years in the region where Los 
Pelambres is located. The mine continues 
to take actions to mitigate the impact of 
this on current and future water availability. 
Initiatives include the improvement of water 
capture and transport infrastructure, and 
research on reducing evaporation from 
tailings dams and recovering more water 
from tailings. Los Pelambres is conducting 
a detailed review of its water balance and 
data collection methods and the identification 
of where water loss occurs and potential 
solutions. The Company works with local 
communities to help them use water more 
efficiently, helping to finance schemes such 
as the lining of irrigation channels and the 
installation of drip irrigation. It also regularly 
monitors water quality and availability 
together with the affected communities 
and relevant authorities.
Over the years, Antofagasta has 
implemented several innovative solutions to 
address the issue of water scarcity, including 
pioneering the use of sea water and being 
the first mining company to use the more 
water-efficient large-scale thickened tailings 
deposit technology.
Performance
44%
of the water used at the Group’s 
operations is sea water.

ENERGY  
AND CLIMATE CHANGE
High energy prices are affecting the competitiveness of the 
Chilean mining industry, while new power generation projects 
often face strong opposition from local communities and NGOs. 
The Group has focused on seeking sources of renewable 
energy for its operations and its projects.
RESPONDING TO THE ENERGY 
CHALLENGE
It is key to the Group’s economic 
sustainability to ensure a continuous and 
dependable energy supply at competitive 
prices. Despite its efforts to increase energy 
efficiency, energy consumption will increase 
as output expands and ore grades fall. 
Ore grades fall as mines age, so more ore 
must be processed to maintain production 
and haulage distances are longer to access 
the minerals and reach the waste dumps, 
leading to increased fuel consumption. 
The use of sea water by the Group in its new 
projects, Antucoya and Encuentro Oxides, will 
increase energy consumption as water needs 
to be pumped from the coast to the mine 
sites over 1,000 metres above sea level. 
The Group constantly seeks innovative 
ways to increase the efficiency of electricity 
and fuel use, focusing on identifying and 
diversifying sources of energy supply and 
increasing the proportion of renewable 
energy used.
Since June 2014, 20% of Los Pelambres’ 
energy has been supplied under a long-term 
PPA by El Arrayán, the largest wind farm in 
Chile, in which the Group has a 30% stake.
The company signed new PPAs with two 
photovoltaic solar plants currently under 
construction. One will come onstream in the 
first quarter of 2015 and the other in early 
2016. The company has a 40% interest in 
the Alto Maipo run-of-river hydroelectric 
project that will supply 110MW (about 55%) 
of its current energy needs under a 20-year 
contract from the end of 2018.
For more information on the Group’s energy opportunities, 
please see page 47
The Group recognises the risks and 
opportunities of climate change and the 
importance of measuring, mitigating and 
reducing its greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 
emissions. In 2014, Antofagasta Minerals 
emitted 2,099,912 tonnes of CO 2 and the CO 2 
emission intensity was 2.98 tonnes of CO 2 
emitted per tonne of copper produced, which 
represents a 3.6% decrease compared to 2013.
Why it matters
Energy accounts for approximately 
15% of the mining division’s operating 
costs and consumption will increase as 
production grows.

20%
of the energy used at Los Pelambres 
is from wind power.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT Mining operations generate significant quantities of waste 
rock, spent ore, leached minerals and tailings. As a result, 
natural habitats, local vegetation and animal species can 
be affected. Antofagasta has a strong track record in 
preventing and managing this impact while striving to 
add environmental value wherever possible.
APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT
The Group’s environmental strategy focuses 
on using resources efficiently, controlling 
impact and, wherever possible, adding 
environmental value. To do this, the Group 
must proactively identify risks and monitor its 
control mechanisms. The Group measures 
its performance in this area using indicators 
included in its Assessment of Environmental 
Performance (“AEP”) tool. These measure 
water, air quality, waste, biodiversity, 
greenhouse gas emissions and impact  
on cultural heritage. For each of these,  
the Group has defined guidelines, which  
are constantly monitored.
MANAGING MINING WASTE 
In mining, it is necessary to ensure the 
physical and chemical stability of mining 
waste and to avoid contamination of both 
surface water courses and groundwater. 
Two of the Group’s operations use an acid 
heap-leach process to produce copper 
cathodes and dispose of their mining waste  
in authorised dumps.
Los Pelambres and Centinela, which produce 
copper concentrate through flotation, store 
their tailings in dams. Los Pelambres has 
two tailings dams designed to withstand 
earthquakes and other natural disasters and 
have in place all the safety features required 
to prevent contamination of water courses.
Centinela has pioneered a thickened tailings 
deposit technology whereby virtually dry 
tailings are deposited in restricted areas. 
SAFETY OF INSTALLATIONS
The installations at the Group’s companies, 
including tailings dams, are built to withstand 
extreme weather and earthquakes. 
The physical and chemical stability of the 
Company’s installations must comply 
with the strict requirements established 
in their environmental permits, which are 
audited regularly. The Group has operational 
procedures in case of emergencies that 
require both internal practice drills and drills 
co-ordinated with the relevant public services 
and local organisations. 
PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY
Antofagasta recognises the importance of 
protecting local ecosystems. Efforts to foster 
biodiversity focus on the Choapa Valley – 
where Los Pelambres is located – due to its 
great natural richness. In Centinela the focus 
is on ensuring that coastal species are not 
affected at its port facilities.
In Conchalí, near Los Vilos, the Group 
transformed an unauthorised rubbish dump 
into the Conchalí Lagoon wetland, protected 
by Ramsar (the Convention on Wetlands 
of International Importance), which is now 
a sanctuary for marine birds and other 
species. The Group also protects one of 
the few remaining Chilean palm woods, the 
746-hectare Santa Inés forest, known for its 
great biodiversity and located near the Los 
Vilos port. Los Pelambres acquired it in 2014, 
partly for conservation purposes and partly to 
provide opportunities for scientific research 
and environmental education. 
MAINTAINING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS

MANAGING  
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Why it matters
The Group’s legal permits, social licence 
to operate and reputation depend on its 
ability to prevent and manage any negative 
impact of its operations. Even when 
an operational incident has a limited 
environmental impact, it can damage 
community relations and trust between 
the Group and its stakeholders.
In focus
CLOSURE PLANNING
Antofagasta plans the closure of its 
operations well in advance so they can 
be decommissioned in a socially and 
environmentally acceptable manner. 
Chilean legislation requires that mining 
operations have closure plans approved by 
the Chilean Geology and Mining Service 
(“Sernageomin”), and that the plans are 
updated every five years. In 2012, the law 
on mine closures was modified to include 
additional requirements for the physical 
and chemical stability of the infrastructure, 
tailings dams and the financial provision for 
the closure process. As a result, in 2014, 
all of the Group’s operations presented 
updated closure plans.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014
TURNOVER 
Group turnover in 2014 was $5,290.4 million, 
11.4% below the $5,971.6 million achieved in 
2013. The decrease of $681.2 million mainly 
reflected a decrease in the realised copper 
price as well as lower copper sales volumes 
and reduced gold by-product revenues.
TURNOVER FROM THE MINING 
DIVISION 
Turnover from copper 
Turnover from copper sales decreased by 
$608.3 million, or 12.2%, to $4,389.7 million, 
compared with $4,998.0 million in 2014. 
The decrease reflected the impact of lower 
realised prices, and also lower sales volumes 
and increased tolling charges.
(i) Realised copper prices
The Group’s average realised copper price 
decreased by 8.4% to $3.00 per pound in 
2014 (2013 – $3.27). The decrease in the 
realised price was greater than the reduction 
in the average LME copper price, which 
decreased by 6.3% to $3.11 per pound (2013 
– $3.32), due to a higher level of negative 
provisional pricing adjustments in the 
current period compared with the prior year. 
The decrease in the average realised price led 
to a $438.7 million reduction in turnover from 
copper sales.
Realised copper prices are determined by 
comparing turnover (gross of tolling charges 
for concentrate sales) with sales volumes in 
the period. Realised copper prices differ from 
market prices mainly because, in line with 
industry practice, concentrate and cathode 
sales agreements generally provide for 
provisional pricing at the time of shipment. 
Final pricing is based on the average market 
price for future periods (normally about 30 
days after delivery to the customer in the 
case of cathode sales and up to 150 days 
after delivery to the customer in the case 
of concentrate sales). Realised copper prices 
also reflect the impact of realised gain or 
losses of commodity derivative instruments 
hedge accounted for in accordance with 
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurements”.
Provisional pricing adjustments decreased 
initially invoiced sales by $201.7 million 
in 2014, compared with a decrease of 
$127.2 million in 2013. The negative 
adjustments in 2014 reflected the general 
decrease in the copper price during most 
of the year. Further details of provisional 
pricing adjustments are given in Note 5 
to the financial statements.
In 2014 turnover also includes a gain of 
$18.4 million (2013 – gain of $25.4 million) 
relating to commodity derivatives which 
matured during the year, predominantly in 
respect of Michilla. Further details of hedging 
activity in the period are given in Note 23(d)  
to the financial report.
(ii) Copper volumes
Copper sales volumes decrease by 2.7% 
from 722,200 tonnes in 2013 to 703,000 
tonnes in this year. The decrease in sales 
volumes accounted for a decrease 
of $127.0 million in turnover. 
(iii) Tolling charges
Tolling charges for copper concentrate 
increased by $42.6 million to $258.9 million in 
2014 (2013 – $216.3 million) mainly due to an 
increase in average tolling charges, as well as 
a smaller impact of increased sales volumes.
Tolling charges are deducted from 
concentrate sales in reporting turnover and 
hence the increase in these charges has had 
a negative impact on turnover.
Turnover from molybdenum, gold and 
other by-products
Turnover from by-products at Los Pelambres 
and Centinela relate mainly to molybdenum 
and gold, and a lesser extent silver. 
Turnover from by-products decreased by 
$46.1 million or 7.2% to $595.0 million in 
2014, compared with $641.1 million in 2013.
Turnover from gold in concentrate (net of 
tolling charges) was $336.8 million (2013 – 
$382.5 million), a decrease of $45.7 million 
or 11.9%, which mainly reflected a decrease 
in the realised gold price, as well as lower 
volumes. The realised gold price was $1,262 
per ounce in 2014 compared with $1,358 
per ounce in 2013, with this 7.1% decrease 
largely reflecting the general reduction in 
average market prices. Gold sales volumes 
decreased by 5.4% from 282,700 ounces in 
2013 to 267,400 ounces in 2014, mainly due 
to the lower gold grades and recoveries at 
Centinela Concentrates. 
Turnover from molybdenum (net of roasting 
charges) was $182.8 million (2013 – 
$180.3 million), an increase of $2.5 million. 
The increase was mainly due to higher 
realised price of $11.0 per pound (2013 – 
$10.0 per pound) partly offset by decreased 
sales volumes of 8,200 tonnes (2013 – 
8,800 tonnes).
Turnover from silver decreased by $2.9 million 
to $75.4 million in 2014 (2013 – $78.3 million). 
The decrease was mainly due to a decrease 
in the realised silver price from $22.7 per 
ounce in 2013 to $18.7 per ounce in 2014, 
partially offset by increased sales volumes of 
4.1 million ounces (2013 – 3.5 million ounces).
TURNOVER FROM THE TRANSPORT 
AND WATER DIVISIONS
Turnover from the transport division 
(“FCAB”) decreased by $15.8 million or 
8.0% to $180.8 million. This mainly reflected 
a decrease in tonnages transported and 
the impact of the weaker Chilean peso. 
Turnover at Aguas de Antofagasta, which 
operates the Group’s water business, 
decreased by $11.0 million or 8.1% to 
$124.9 million in 2014, mainly reflecting  
the impact of the weaker Chilean peso.
Operating costs (excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and disposals)
Operating costs (excluding depreciation and 
amortisation) amounted to $3,068.8 million 
(2013 – $3,269.4 million), a decrease of 
$200.6 million. This was mainly due to 
lower sales volumes, reduced exploration 
and evaluation expenses and a decrease 
in closure provision costs.
Operating costs (excluding depreciation 
and amortisation) at the mining division
Operating costs at the mining division 
decreased by $184.5 million to 
$2,906.9 million in 2014, a decrease of 6.0%.
Of this decrease, $70.2 million is attributable 
to the lower copper sales volumes described 
above. As explained in more detail above, 
the reduction in turnover associated with 
the decreased copper sales volumes was 
$127.0 million, resulting in a net reduction 
in EBITDA of $56.8 million.
Excluding by-product credits (which are 
reported as part of turnover) and tolling 
charges for concentrates (which are deducted 
from turnover), weighted average cash costs 
for the Group (representing on-site and 
shipping costs in the case of Los Pelambres 
and Centinela Concentrates and total cash 
costs in the case of Centinela Cathodes and 
Michilla) remained stable at $1.65/lb. 
Exploration and evaluation costs decreased 
by $107.4 million to $167.5 million (2013 
– $274.9 million), mainly reflecting the 
completion of pre-feasibility studies at Twin 
Metals and Los Pelambres, which had been 
ongoing throughout 2013. 
62 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 In 2014 there was a $7.4 million credit in 
respect of updates to mine closure provisions, 
compared with a charge of $69.6 million in 
2013, with the relatively high charge in the 
prior year reflecting increases to the Los 
Pelambres provision in that year.
Operating costs (excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and disposals) at the 
transport and water divisions
Operating costs at the transport 
division decreased by $7.7 million to 
$112.1 million. This was mainly due to 
lower fuel, maintenance and labour costs. 
Operating costs at the water division 
decreased by $8.4 million to $49.8 million, 
mainly reflecting the weaker Chilean peso. 
EBITDA AND OPERATING PROFIT FROM 
SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES
EBITDA
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) from 
subsidiaries and joint ventures decreased by 
$480.6 million or 17.8% to $2,221.6 million 
in 2014 (2013 – $2,702.2 million), with the 
$681.2 million decrease in turnover partially 
offset by the $200.6 million reduction in 
operating expenses (excluding depreciation 
and amortisation) as described above.
EBITDA at the mining division decreased 
by 18.4% from $2,547.7 million in 2013 
to $2,077.8 million in 2014. As explained 
above, this was mainly due to the decrease 
in the realised copper price, partly offset by 
lower exploration and evaluation expenses 
and a decrease in the cost relating to mine 
closure provisions.
EBITDA at the transport division decreased by 
$8.1 million to $68.7 million in 2014, reflecting 
the decreased revenue as explained above. 
The water division contributed $75.1 million 
in 2014 compared with $77.7 million in 2013, 
reflecting the decreased revenue as well as 
operating costs, as explained above.
Depreciation, amortisation and disposals
The depreciation, amortisation and disposals 
charge was higher at $581.9 million (2013 
– $530.1 million). Increased depreciation at 
Centinela and Michilla was partly offset by 
a $28.6 million disposal gain related to the 
temporary loss of control of the Twin Metals 
project. This gain on disposal is largely offset 
by the related $26.3 million impairment 
charge in respect of the available-for-sale 
investment to Duluth Metals Limited, 
included within Other finance items as 
explained below.
Operating profit from subsidiaries
As a result of the above factors, operating 
profit from subsidiaries decreased by 24.5% 
to $1,639.7 million (2013 – $2,172.1 million), 
with the $532.4 million reduction mainly 
driven by the decreased revenue as a result  
of the lower realised copper price. 
SHARE OF RESULTS FROM ASSOCIATES 
AND JOINT VENTURES
The Group’s share of results from its 
associates and joint ventures was a loss of 
$4.1 million (2013 – loss of $14.4 million). 
This mainly reflects lower expenditures 
in respect of the Energía Andina joint 
venture, partly offset by lower profits at 
Inversiones Hornitos.
NET FINANCE EXPENSE
Net finance expense in 2014 was 
$62.1 million, a $12.1 million reduction 
compared with the net expense of 
$74.2 million in 2013.

Investment income increased from 
$12.6 million in 2013 to $18.4 million in 2014, 
mainly reflecting additional interest income in 
respect of a loan from Los Pelambres to the 
Alto Maipo associate.
Interest expense decreased from 
$62.0 million in 2013 to $44.6 million in 2014, 
mainly due to a decrease of interest payable 
at Centinela as a result of a refinancing 
during the year.
Other finance items comprised a net expense 
of $35.9 million (2013 – net expense of 
$24.8 million). A loss of $5.1 million (2013 – 
loss of $13.5 million) has been recognised 
in respect of the time value element of 
changes in the fair value of commodity 
derivative options, which is excluded from 
the designated hedging relationship, and 
is therefore recognised directly in profit or 
loss. Foreign exchange losses included in 
finance items were $4.6 million in 2014, 
compared with a loss of $2.9 million in 
2013. An expense of $9.1 million (2013 
– $14.2 million) has been recognised in 
relation to the unwinding of the discount 
on provisions.
Also included within other finance items 
is an impairment charge of $26.3 million, 
recognised in respect of the available-for-sale 
investment relating to Duluth Metals Limited 
(“Duluth”). As explained in Note 8 to the 
financial statements, as at 31 December 
2014 the Group held a 17.2% stake in Duluth. 
In November 2014 Antofagasta entered into 
a binding letter of agreement to acquire 100% 
of Duluth, with the acquisition completing 
subsequent to the year end following 
approval from Duluth’s shareholders in 
January 2015. Movements in the fair value 
of the available-for-sale investment in Duluth 
had previously been recorded within the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. The agreed acquisition terms 
indicated a final fixed value for the Duluth 
shares, and that there had therefore been an 
impairment in the value of the Duluth shares 
to this amount. Fair value losses previously 
recorded within the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income have therefore 
been transferred to the income statement 
and recognised within this impairment loss. 
This impairment charge has been largely 
offset by the related $28.6 million disposal 
gain in respect of the temporary loss of 
control of the Twin Metals project included 
within Depreciation, amortisation and 
disposals as described above.
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
As a result of the factors set out above, profit 
before tax decreased by $510.0 million or 
24.5% to $1,573.5 million, compared with 
$2,083.5 million in 2013.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW
Antofagasta plc | 63
STRATEGIC REPORT The tax charge for 2014 was $722.8 million 
and the effective tax rate was 45.9%. 
This rate varied from the standard rate 
(comprising first category tax) of 21% 
principally due to the deferred tax charge 
of $220.6 million reflecting the increase in 
tax rates as a result of the Chilean tax reform 
($142.2 million impact on net earnings; 
14.4 cents impact on earnings per share), 
the effect of items not deductible from 
first category tax (mainly corporate items 
which principally comprise exploration and 
evaluation costs), a withholding tax charge 
of $56.8 million and the effect of the mining 
tax which resulted in a charge of $79.1 million. 
In 2013 the total charge was $843.7 million, 
with an overall effective tax rate of 40.5% 
compared with the statutory rate of corporate 
tax of 20%. The main variance compared 
with the statutory rate in 2013 reflected 
a withholding tax charge of $289.1 million. 
Further details are given in Note 9 to the 
financial statements.
NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Profit attributable to non-controlling 
interests was $390.9 million, compared with 
$580.2 million in 2013, reflecting the lower 
profit attributable to the non-controlling 
interests as a consequence of the decrease 
in the earnings of the mining operations 
analysed above. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share 46.6 66.9
Earnings per share calculations are based 
on 985,856,695 ordinary shares. As a result 
of the factors set out above, profit in 2014 
attributable to equity shareholders of the 
Company was $459.8 million compared with 
$659.6 million in 2013. Accordingly, earnings 
per share were 46.6 cents in 2014 compared 
with 66.9 cents in 2013, a decrease of 
30.3%. Excluding the deferred tax provision 
resulting from the changes in the Chilean 
tax law during 2014 (14.4 cents impact on 
earnings per share), earnings per share were 
61.0 cents, a 7.5% decrease compared 
with 2013.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends per share proposed in relation to 
the year are as follows:

US cents

31.12.13
US cents
Interim 11.7 8.9
Final 9.8 86.1
Total dividends 
to ordinary 
shareholders 21.5 95.0
The Board determines the appropriate 
dividend each year based on consideration 
of the Group’s cash balance, the level of free 
cash flow and earnings generated during 
the year and significant known or expected 
funding commitments. It is expected that 
the total annual dividend for each year would 
represent a pay-out ratio based on net 
earnings for that year of at least 35%. 
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend for 2014 of 9.8 cents per ordinary 
share, which amounts to $96.6 million and 
if approved at the Annual General Meeting, 
will be paid on 22 May 2015 to shareholders 
on the Register at the close of business on 
24 April 2015. This gives total dividends for 
the year of 21.5 cents, including the interim 
dividend of 21.5 cents. In 2013 total dividends 
were 95.0 cents.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capital expenditure increased by 
$122.3 million from $1,458.7 million in 
2013 to $1,581.0 million in 2014. This was 
mainly due to the ongoing construction 
at the Antucoya project and the expansion 
of the Centinela concentrator to a capacity 
of 105,000 tonnes per day.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group generally sells its commodity 
production at prevailing market prices. 
It may periodically use derivative financial 
instruments to reduce exposure to 
commodity price movements in certain 
specific circumstances. At 31 December 
2014 the Group did not have any significant 
level of commodity derivatives which fixed  
or limited its exposure to market prices.
The Group periodically uses interest rate 
swaps to swap floating rate interest for fixed 
rate interest. At 31 December 2014 the Group 
had entered into contracts in relation to the 
Centinela project financing for a maximum 
notional amount of $140 million at a weighted 
average fixed rate of 3.372% fully maturing in 
August 2018. The Group had also entered into 
contracts in relation to a financing loan at the 
Railway for a maximum notional amount of 
$150 million at a weighted average fixed rate 
of 1.634%, fully maturing in August 2019.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
The tax charge in 2014 was $714.8 million (2013 – $843.7 million) and the effective tax rate was 45.4% (2013 – 40.5%).

FINANCIAL REVIEW
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014
64 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 The Group also periodically uses foreign 
exchange derivatives to cover expected 
operational cash flow needs. At 31 December 
2014 Antucoya had cross-currency swaps 
with a principal value of $45 million to swap 
Chilean pesos for US dollars at an average 
rate of Ch$564.6/$1, covering a total 
period up to 15 May 2015. The weighted 
average remaining period covered by 
these hedges calculated with effect from 
1 January 2015 is 2.4 months. Additionally, 
at 31 December 2014 Antucoya had zero 
cost collar instruments with a principal value 
of $27 million covering a total period up 
to 15 March 2015. The weighted average 
remaining period covered by the zero cost 
collars calculated with effect from 1 January 
2015 was 1.4 months. The instruments had a 
weighted average floor of Ch$589.6/$1 and a 
weighted average cap of Ch$550.0/$1.

Net cash at the beginning of the year 1,311.2 2,402.7 
Net (debt)/cash at the end of the year (1.6) 1,311.2
Cash flows from operations were 
$2,507.8 million in 2014 compared with 
$2,659.2 million in 2013. This reflected 
EBITDA for the period of $2,221.6 million 
(2013 – $ 2,702.2 million) adjusted for a net 
working capital increase of $286.2 million 
(2013 – decrease of $43.0 million). 
Cash tax payments in 2014 year were 
$641.5 million (2013 – $896.5 million), 
comprising corporation tax of $264.0 million 
(2013 – $528.0 million), mining tax of 
$98.2 million (2013 – $160.0 million) and 
withholding tax of $279.3 million (2013 – 
$208.5 million). These amounts differ from 
the current tax charge in the consolidated 
income statement of $714.8 million (2013 
– $843.7 million) mainly because cash 
tax payments for corporation tax and the 
mining tax partly comprise the settlement 
of outstanding balances in respect of the 
previous year’s tax charge and payments 
on account for the current year based 
on the prior year profit levels. 
Contributions and loans to associates and 
joint ventures of $125.2 million mainly 
relate to the Group’s share of the funding 
of the development of the Alto Maipo 
project, in which the Group acquired a 40% 
interest in 2013.
Cash disbursements relating to capital 
expenditure in 2014 were $1,646.3 million 
compared with $1,344.8 million in 2013. 
This included expenditure of $734.6 million 
at Antucoya (2013 – $596.5 million), 
$566.9 million relating to Centinela (2013 – 
$463.5 million) and $230.0 million relating to 
Los Pelambres (2013 – $194.6 million).
Dividends (including special dividends) paid to 
ordinary shareholders of the Company in 2014 
were $964.2 million (2013 – $975.0 million), 
which related to the final dividend declared in 
respect of the previous year.
Dividends paid by subsidiaries to non-
controlling shareholders were $412.2 million 
(2013 – $452.1 million), consisting of 
distributions by Los Pelambres, Centinela 
and Michilla.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW
Antofagasta plc | 71
GOVERNANCE Maintaining a high standard of corporate 
governance is fundamental to the Board’s 
ability to discharge its duties to shareholders. 
The Board and I remain committed to 
ensuring that the structures and procedures 
in place across the Group reflect the best 
principles of good governance and take into 
account the expectations of our stakeholders. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
As I have highlighted in my Chairman’s letter on pages five to seven, 
we were delighted to welcome Vivianne Blanlot and Jorge Bande to 
the Board as independent Non-Executive Directors in 2014. Both Mrs. 
Blanlot and Mr. Bande have extensive experience across the energy, 
mining and water sectors and Mrs. Blanlot has also held several 
senior positions in the public sector, including Executive Director of 
the Chilean Environmental Agency. The formal, rigorous process by 
which Mrs. Blanlot and Mr. Bande were appointed is described in the 
Nomination and Governance Committee report on page 82.
In September, I decided to step back from the position of Executive 
Chairman to become Non-Executive Chairman. At the same time, 
Diego Hernández took on the role of Group CEO, having previously 
been responsible for the mining division. These changes reflect the 
development of the Group; my role is now less focused on day-to-day 
operations and more concerned with the strategic development of the 
Group and leading the Board. 
As part of the process for implementing these changes, all the Board’s 
governance documents were reviewed and updated during the year, 
including the schedule of matters reserved for the Board and each 
Committee’s terms of reference. As part of the review of its own 
terms of reference, the Nomination and Governance Committee 
(formerly, the “Nomination Committee”) is now responsible for 
monitoring the Board’s corporate governance arrangements, 
reviewing the Company’s corporate governance framework at 
least annually and recommending any improvements or changes 
to the Board. 
During the year, as part of a series of actions taken by UK regulators 
to strengthen minority shareholder protection in companies with 
a controlling shareholder, such as ours, new Listing Rules came 
into force that require such companies to enter into relationship 
agreements with their controlling shareholders. As set out on page 
73, the Company has complied with these provisions. The Company 
and each controlling shareholder welcome the opportunity to clarify 
their relationship.
At this year’s Annual General Meeting in May, all Directors will 
stand for election or re-election and, as is required by the new Listing 
Rules, our independent Non-Executive Directors will be subject to a 
dual vote by shareholders. As set out in my letter accompanying the 
Notice of Meeting, this means that each resolution to elect or re-elect 
an independent Non-Executive Director must be approved by both a 
majority vote of all shareholders and a majority vote of the Company’s 
independent shareholders. Details regarding how the Company has 
determined that these Directors are independent, the process by 
which they were selected and any other relationships, transactions or 
arrangements to be disclosed are set out in the Notice of Meeting.
In the following pages, we outline our approach to corporate 
governance and demonstrate how our governance practices support 
this approach and how these practices are applied. We will continue 
to keep our corporate governance practices under review, particularly 
in light of the revised version of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published in September 2014, which first applies to the Company for 
the 2015 financial year. 
JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC
Chairman
72 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE CODE
The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012 (“the Code”) (available on the 
Financial Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk) sets out the 
governance principles and provisions that applied to the Company 
during the 2014 financial year. The Company is committed to a culture 
of good governance, as embodied in the Code, and reports here 
on how it has applied the principles and complied with the provisions 
of the Code and explains the reasons for any non-compliance.
The Company complied with the detailed provisions contained in 
the Code throughout 2014, with the following exceptions before 
1 September 2014: 
 – the Board did not have a separately identified Group CEO, and 
as Mr. Jean-Paul Luksic was Executive Chairman, there was 
no formal separation of the functions of Chairman and CEO 
(provision A.2.1) at Board level. Prior to 1 September 2014, Diego 
Hernández was the Chief Executive of Antofagasta Minerals 
(the Group’s mining division, which represents nearly 95% of 
earnings). As such, he was invited to attend all Board meetings 
and was responsible for the activities of the Antofagasta Minerals 
Executive Committee. The Board considers that its predominantly 
non-executive composition, combined with the delegation of 
significant responsibility for operational management to Diego 
Hernández and the Executive Committee within the mining division, 
and to the divisional General Managers within the transport and 
water divisions, achieved an appropriate balance and prevented 
a concentration of power in its Executive Chairman; and
 – performance-related pay measures did not apply to the Executive 
Chairman (principle D1 and provision D.1.1). The Board considers 
this appropriate given its predominantly non-executive composition 
at that time and the role of the Chairman (then the only Executive 
Director), who is a member of the controlling family. Performance-
related remuneration applies to all of the executives within the 
Antofagasta Minerals Group, including the Executive Committee, 
as described in the Remuneration Report on page 86.
On 1 September 2014, Mr. Diego Hernández was appointed to 
the new role of Group CEO – he is not a member of the Board. 
On the same date, Mr. Jean-Paul Luksic became Non-Executive 
Chairman. The Board has adopted a charter setting out the division 
of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Group CEO. 
Following these changes, the Company complied with all the detailed 
provisions contained in the Code.
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
In November 2014 the Company entered into relationship agreements 
with each controlling shareholder, which contain the mandatory 
independence provisions required by the Listing Rules. The Company 
has complied and, so far as the Directors are aware, each controlling 
shareholder and its associates have complied with the mandatory 
independence provisions at all times from the date of signing the 
Relationship Agreements until the end of the financial year.
As a practical matter, any transaction between the Company and any 
controlling shareholder is approved by the independent Directors, 
without the non-independent Directors voting. During 2014, a 
committee of independent Directors was convened to consider 
and approve the following on behalf of the Company: the Group’s 
acquisition of Minera Cerro Centinela S.A.’s 8% interest in Michilla; 
the Company’s position in relation to the Antomin joint venture 
that the Company has with the controlling shareholders in relation 
to undeveloped mining properties in Chile; and the Relationship 
Agreements signed with each controlling shareholder.

BOARD COMPOSITION
BOARD BALANCE
As at the date of this report the Board has 11 Directors, comprising 
a Non-Executive Chairman and ten Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board considers five of these Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent. The Board considers that a board comprising Non-
Executive Directors is valuable both in terms of providing a range of 
outside perspectives to the Group and in encouraging robust debate 
with, and challenge of, the Group’s executive management.
The Board is satisfied that the balance of the Board, in terms 
of background, gender and independence, limits the scope for 
an individual or small group of individuals to dominate the Board’s 
decision-making.
During 2014, Vivianne Blanlot and Jorge Bande were appointed to the 
Board. Mrs. Blanlot brings extensive experience across the energy, 
mining, water and environmental sectors and Mr. Bande brings 
extensive Chilean and international experience across the mining, 
energy and water sectors.
Of the 11 Directors, seven are based in Chile, three are based in North 
America and one is based in the United Kingdom. Biographies of 
each of the Directors as at the date of this report are shown on 
pages 68 to 69 and demonstrate a detailed knowledge of the mining 
industry, as well as significant international business experience. 
Their biographies provide details of their Committee memberships 
as well as other principal directorships and external roles.
CHAIRMAN
Jean-Paul Luksic is Chairman of the Board. His role is that of Non- 
Executive Chairman and his other commitments do not prevent 
him from devoting sufficient time to this role. He is responsible for 
the leadership of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness in 
all aspects of its role, and for promoting the highest standards of 
integrity, probity and corporate governance. He sets the agenda for 
Board meetings in consultation with the Secretary to the Board, other 
Directors and members of senior management. He also chairs the 
meetings, ensuring that there is adequate time available for discussion 
of all agenda items and that there is a focus on strategic, rather than 
routine, issues. He promotes a culture of openness and debate within 
the Board by facilitating the effective contribution of all Directors and 
is responsible for Director development, induction, performance 
evaluation and relations with shareholders. 
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW
Antofagasta plc | 75
GOVERNANCE SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
William Hayes is the Senior Independent Director. He provides 
a sounding board for the Chairman and supports the Chairman 
in the delivery of his objectives as required. Where necessary, 
the Senior Independent Director can act as an intermediary between 
the Chairman and the other members of the Board or the Group 
CEO. He is an additional point of contact for shareholders, providing 
a particular focus for shareholders on the Group’s governance and 
strategy, and also gives shareholders a means of raising concerns 
other than with the Chairman or senior executives. Since his 
appointment, William Hayes has met with a number of the Group’s 
largest shareholders and proxy voting agencies, allowing him to 
provide his perspective on the Group’s governance and strategy 
and to obtain their direct feedback on the Group. During 2014 William 
Hayes met with major shareholders and proxy voting agencies 
to focus on the issues that were most relevant to investors during 
the course of the year.
INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Of the ten Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman), 
five are considered by the Board to be independent – William 
Hayes, Tim Baker, Ollie Oliveira, Vivianne Blanlot and Jorge Bande. 
These Directors meet the independence criteria set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the Board is satisfied as 
to their independence.
The Board does not consider Ramón Jara, Hugo Dryland, Andrónico 
Luksic, Gonzalo Menéndez or Juan Claro to be independent. 
Ramón Jara provides advisory services to the Group. Hugo Dryland 
provides advisory services to the Group in his capacity as a Vice-
Chairman at Rothschild, which is a financial advisor to the Group. 
Andrónico Luksic is the brother of Jean-Paul Luksic, the Chairman 
of Antofagasta plc and is Chairman of Quiñenco S.A. and Chairman 
or a Director of Quiñenco’s other listed subsidiaries. Jean-Paul Luksic 
and Gonzalo Menéndez are also Non-Executive Directors of Quiñenco 
and some of its listed subsidiaries. Like Antofagasta plc, Quiñenco 
is controlled by the Luksic family. Juan Claro served on the Board for 
more than nine years concurrently with the Chairman when he was 
performing the role of Executive Chairman.
INFORMATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
All new Directors receive a thorough induction on joining the Board. 
This typically includes briefings on the Group’s operations and 
projects, meetings with the Chairman, other Directors and senior 
executives, briefings on the legal, regulatory and other duties and 
requirements of the director of a UK listed company and visits to 
the Group’s key operations.
The Company provides Directors with the necessary resources to 
develop and update their knowledge and capabilities. In particular, 
the Directors are regularly updated on the Group’s business, the 
competitive and regulatory environment in which it operates and other 
changes affecting the Group as a whole.
The Directors based outside Chile visit the country regularly to attend 
Board meetings and for other meetings with management and site 
visits to the Group’s operations. The Directors based outside the UK 
also regularly visit this country, normally at least once a year to attend 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting, which is held in London. 
During the year the Board receives briefings from external advisors 
on key changes to the regulatory and legal environment impacting 
the Group and any other briefings that are determined by the Board 
to be relevant.
The Board and its Committees receive an analysis of the matters 
for consideration in advance of each Board or Committee meeting. 
They also receive regular reports including analysis of key metrics 
in respect of operational, financial, environmental and social 
performance, as well as key developments in the Group’s exploration 
and business development activities, information on the commodity 
markets, the Group’s talent management activities and analysis of 
the Group’s financial investments.
All Directors have access to management and to such further 
information as is needed to carry out their duties and responsibilities 
fully and effectively. Relevant management will present to the Board 
and its Committees on the operational or development matters under 
consideration, allowing close interaction between the Board members 
and a wide range of executive management.
All Directors are entitled to seek independent professional advice 
concerning the affairs of the Group at the Company’s expense. 
The Company has appropriate insurance in place to cover the Directors 
against any legal action against them.

management team in the day-to-day running of the Group’s 
businesses, proposing, developing and implementing the Group’s 
strategy and commercial objectives, and maintaining communication 
with the Board and shareholders. This includes reporting to the Board 
on matters affecting the Group and overseeing and maintaining 
the Group’s risk profile in line with the nature and extent of the 
principal risks identified as acceptable by the Board and Audit 
and Risk Committee.
ANTOFAGASTA MINERALS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The mining division is managed by the Antofagasta Minerals Executive 
Committee under the leadership of Iván Arriagada, the CEO of 
Antofagasta Minerals. Details of the members of the Committee are 
set out on pages 70 to 71.
The Executive Committee reviews significant matters in respect 
of the mining division and approves capital expenditures by the mining 
operations and the corporate centre within designated authority levels, 
leads the annual budgeting and planning processes, monitors the 
performance of the mining operations and promotes the sharing of 
best practices and implementation of policies across the operations.
The Executive Committee is assisted in the performance of its 
responsibilities by the Operational Performance Review Committee, 
the Business Development Committee and certain steering 
committees set up to oversee important projects. 
The Operational Performance Review Committee (“OPRC”) 
provides a regular and formal process for the monitoring and control 
of the operations and is led by the Vice President of Operations. 
Members of the OPRC include the General Managers of each of the 
operating mines and the Antucoya project, as well as the managers 
responsible for finance, technical matters and the members of the 
Boards of the operating companies who represent Antofagasta 
Minerals. The OPRC monitors the performance of the operating 
companies and the Antucoya project, with a focus on budgets, 
operational risks and investments. The OPRC also supports and 
validates the technical and operational decisions made at the individual 
companies and is responsible for approving certain operational 
expenditures within approved budgets and small capital expenditures 
up to a set amount.
The Business Development Committee (“BDC”) focuses on the 
mining division’s growth opportunities, both in relation to internal 
projects and potential transactions. Members of the BDC include the 
Vice-President of Mineral Resources, the Vice-President of Corporate 
Development and the Vice-President of Finance and Administration, 
as well as the managers responsible for activities within these areas. 
The BDC oversees the implementation of the strategic business 
development guidelines and reviews and approves decisions 
regarding the portfolios of Business Development and Exploration 
in light of those strategic guidelines and within the approved budget 
and designated authority levels.
The Executive Committee sets up steering committees to monitor 
the implementation of important projects undertaken by the Group, 
both in the execution and study phases. These steering committees 
are led by the Vice-President of Projects, and their members include 
the manager of the project, the Vice-President of Operations and the 
relevant managers and technical experts. The steering committees 
are generally responsible for approving technical and strategic project 
decisions, as well as approving certain expenditures within approved 
budgets and up to a set amount.
ETHICS COMMITTEE
The Group Ethics Committee is responsible for establishing and 
developing the necessary procedures to encourage ethical conduct 
across the Group, for implementing, developing and updating the 
Code of Ethics and for monitoring compliance.
The Code of Ethics sets out the responsibilities of all employees and 
contractors in relation to potential conflicts of interest, corruption and 
bribery, the protection of confidential information, the safeguarding 
of working conditions, discrimination and harassment, human rights, 
respect for neighbouring communities and mechanisms for reporting 
infringements. All employees receive a copy on joining the Group and 
are required to sign an acknowledgement that they will comply with 
it. The Code of Ethics is available to employees on the Group intranet 
and from the human resources department and line managers. 
Employees and contractors are encouraged to anonymously 
report any unethical conduct through the Group’s dedicated 
“whistleblowing” channels. The Group regularly undertakes training 
on the Code of Ethics, which includes the mandatory completion of

GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During 2014, the Secretary to the Board facilitated implementation 
of the recommendations made by Independent Audit Limited in their 
evaluation of the Board in 2013. Substantial progress has been made 
in addressing these recommendations. In particular, the Board:
 – approved updates to the schedule of matters reserved for the Board 
and the terms of reference of Board Committees, as well as new 
documents spelling out the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman of the Board and the Group CEO and the role of the Senior 
Independent Director;
 – strengthened its focus on strategic issues by co-ordinating 
a strategy “away day” and rearranging the structure and content 
of the Board information packs to help Directors identify and focus 
on the main issues and risks;
 – agreed with management expectations as to the content and depth 
of project reviews;
 – reviewed the principal risks and risk mitigation strategies for 
the Group, including at each of the Company’s operations;
 – reviewed the development of the Group’s talent management 
initiatives and staff engagement survey results;
 – enhanced the Board’s support team, with the appointment of 
a Secretary to the Board and an in-house Company Secretary; 
 – improved the quality of minutes and matters arising lists in order to 
enhance the effectiveness of communication between the Board 
and management; and
 – included a standing provision in the Board’s agenda for discussions 
with operating company managers.
During the year, the Secretary to the Board also performed a 
separate internal evaluation of the performance of the Board and 
its Committees, which was facilitated through structured, individual 
interviews with Directors.
The Chairman is using these results to further develop the effective 
operation of the Board, and the Nomination and Governance 
Committee will use these results when considering the overall 
composition of, and appointments to, the Board. 
During the year, led by the Senior Independent Director, the Non-
Executive Directors met without the Chairman present and evaluated 
the Chairman’s performance. 
The Board recognises that improving performance is a continuous 
process and has committed to an action plan for the coming year to 
address some of the areas identified as needing further development. 
These include:
 – further focus on the strategic aspects of the Group’s businesses;
 – focused attention on project reviews, approval and stewardship 
of committed results; and
 – increased focus on succession planning for Board and senior 
executive positions.

ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
The purpose of the Audit and Risk Committee is to assist the Board 
in meeting its responsibilities relating to financial reporting and control. 
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s relationship 
with the external auditor and monitoring the effectiveness of the 
Group’s Internal Audit and risk management functions.
The Committee meets at least three times a year, with the external 
auditors in attendance. There is a rolling agenda that covers regular 
matters such as the review of the year-end financial statements and 
half-yearly financial report, planning for the year end reporting and 
external audit processes, monitoring the Group’s tax strategy and 
processes, reviewing the Internal Audit work plan and reports from 
the risk management function, as well as providing time for ad-hoc 
matters requiring the Committee’s consideration. The Committee held 
four meetings during 2014.
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board following 
each Committee meeting, allowing the Board to understand and, 
if necessary, discuss matters considered in detail by the Committee.
The terms of reference of the Committee were reviewed and updated 
during 2014 to reflect changes introduced by the revised 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code and were adopted by the Board. A copy 
of the updated terms of reference is available on the Company’s 
website at www.antofagasta.co.uk.
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings 
of the Committee during the year are shown in the table above. 
Biographical details of the members of the Committee, including 
relevant qualifications and experience, are set out on pages 70 to 71. 
All of the Committee members are considered by the Board to be 
independent Non-Executive Directors. William Hayes and Ollie Oliveira 
are considered to have recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee received briefings during the year on developments in 
financial reporting requirements and other relevant regulatory changes.
COMMITTEE REVIEW
During 2013 the Committee commissioned an independent evaluation 
of its effectiveness, which was undertaken by Independent Audit 
Limited. The review process and key recommendations were 
detailed in the 2013 Annual Report. The implementation of the key 
recommendations began in 2013, and was completed during 2014.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Committee monitors the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting. It reviews whether the Group’s accounting policies are 
appropriate, and whether management’s estimates and judgements 
applied in the financial statements are reasonable. The Committee 
assesses risks that could impact the quality and effectiveness of the 
Group’s financial reporting process.
The Committee reviews the year end financial statements and 
half-yearly financial report, as well as other relevant external financial 
reports. The Committee also reviews the going concern basis adopted 
in the year end financial statements and half-yearly financial report, 
prior to its endorsement by the Board.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW
Antofagasta plc | 79
GOVERNANCE At the request of the Board, the Committee considered the 2014 
Annual Report and Financial Statements and concluded that, taken as 
a whole, this was fair, balanced and understandable, and provided the 
necessary information to allow shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Significant issues in relation to the financial statements considered 
by the Committee during the year were:
 – the carrying value of the Antucoya project’s assets – following 
the $500 million impairment charge recorded in 2012, an updated 
review of the carrying value of the project’s assets was performed, 
which indicated that no further impairment or reversal of the earlier 
impairment was appropriate. The Group’s process for performing 
impairment reviews is detailed in Note 2(m) and Note 3(c) to the 
financial statements;
 – mine closure provisions – review of the updated provision 
calculations in respect of future mine closure costs, reflecting the 
mine closure plans submitted to Sernageomin, the government 
agency that regulates the mining industry in Chile, in accordance 
with the new Chilean mine closure regulations published during 
the year. The Group’s closure provisions are detailed in Note 27 
to the financial statements;
 – the impact of the Chilean tax reform bill – including the recalculation 
of the Group’s deferred tax balances using the appropriate future tax 
rates following the enactment of the new tax reform bill;
 – the accounting for the Twin Metals project – in particular the 
recognition of the initial investment in associate balance at its 
fair value in July 2014, following the change in the nature of 
the investment from a subsidiary to an associate at that point. 
Further details in respect of the investment in Twin Metals are 
set out in Note 16 to the financial statements; and
 – capitalisation of property, plant and equipment, and of project 
costs – consideration of the appropriateness of the capitalisation 
of significant project expenditure, in particular in respect of the 
commercial viability of particular projects. Details of additions 
to property, plant and equipment are set out in Note 13 to 
the financial statements.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s relationship 
with the external auditor. The Committee reviews and approves 
the scope of the external audit and the external auditor’s terms of 
engagement and fees. The Committee monitors the effectiveness 
of the external audit process and is responsible for ensuring the 
independence of the external auditor. The Committee is also 
responsible for making recommendations to the Board for the 
appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external auditor. 
The Committee meets with the external auditor without management 
present at least once during the course of the year.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT PROCESS
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
audit process during the year, including consideration of the 
following factors:
 – the appropriateness of the proposed audit plan, the significant risk 
areas and areas of focus, and the effective performance of the audit 
in line with the agreed plan;
 – the technical skills and industry experience of the audit engagement 
partner and the wider audit team;
 – the quality of the external auditor’s reporting to the Committee;
 – the effectiveness of the co-ordination between the UK and Chilean 
audit teams;
 – the effectiveness of the interaction and relationship between 
the Group’s management and the external auditor;
 – feedback from management, including questionnaires completed by 
the operational finance teams, in respect of the effectiveness of the 
audit processes for each business unit;
 – consideration of the auditor’s management letter and, in particular, 
the view this provides of the auditor’s level of understanding and 
insight into the Group’s operations; and
 – review of reports from the external auditor detailing their firm’s 
internal quality control procedures, as well as the auditor’s annual 
transparency report.
INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY  
OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee monitors the external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity.
The Company has a policy in place that aims to safeguard the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor. This includes 
measures in respect of the potential employment of former auditors, 
the types of non-audit services that the external auditor may and 
may not provide to the Group, and the approval process in respect 
of permitted non-audit services. Non-audit services that the external 
auditor is not permitted to provide under the policy include Internal 
Audit outsourcing, valuation services that would be used for financial 
accounting purposes, preparation of the Group’s accounting records 
or financial statements, and financial information systems’ design and 
implementation. Certain permitted non-audit services always require 
prior approval by the Committee, whereas certain other services 
require prior approval by the Committee when the related fees are 
above specified levels (currently $50,000 for a single engagement or 
a cumulative annual amount of $400,000). In addition to this approval 
process for specific non-audit services, the Audit and Risk Committee 
monitors the total level of non-audit services to ensure that neither the 
objectivity nor the independence of the external auditor is put at risk.
A breakdown of the audit and non-audit fees is disclosed in Note 6 to 
the financial statements. The Company’s external auditor for the 2014 
financial year, Deloitte LLP , has provided non-audit services (excluding 
audit-related services) which amounted to $122 million or 9.0% of 
the fee for audit services. This mainly related to the completion of 
an evaluation of the risk management process implemented in 2013. 
The Committee has reviewed the level of these services in the course 
of the year and is confident that the objectivity and independence 
of the auditor is not impaired by reason of such non-audit work.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
80 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 The external auditor also provides a report to the Committee at 
least once a year, setting out their firm’s policies and procedures 
for maintaining their independence.
The Committee considers that Deloitte LLP remained independent 
and objective throughout 2014.
AUDIT TENDER
As explained in the 2013 Annual Report, the Committee decided to 
conduct a tender process in respect of the appointment of the Group’s 
external auditor for the 2015 financial year onwards. Deloitte LLP 
has been auditor of the Group since 2000, following a competitive 
tender process in that year, and the current Deloitte lead audit partner 
will rotate off the engagement following the completion of the audit 
of the 2014 financial year, after five years in the role. 
A tender process was conducted during 2014 and resulted 
in the Committee recommending to the Board that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) be recommended 
to shareholders for appointment as the Group’s external auditor 
for the 2015 financial year onwards. The Board has approved the 
appointment of PwC, and shareholders will be invited to appoint 
them formally at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
In line with relevant regulatory guidance, the Committee expects to 
generally undertake a tender process in respect of the external audit 
every ten years. 
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s Internal Audit function. The Head of Internal Audit reports 
directly to the Committee and meets with the Committee without 
management present during the course of the year.
The Head of Internal Audit presents to the Committee several 
times during the year. The Committee reviews and approves Internal 
Audit’s plan of work for the coming year, including the department’s 
budget, headcount and other resources. Internal Audit then reports 
to the Committee on the department’s performance of its work 
in comparison with the approved plan. Summaries of the audits 
undertaken during the year are presented to the Committee, as 
well as follow-up on management’s response to Internal Audit’s 
recommendations. All individual Internal Audit reports are distributed 
to the Committee members once they have been finalised.
During the year, the Committee commissioned an independent review 
of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function, undertaken by 
Independent Audit Limited. This process included reviews of Internal 
Audit work papers and reports and interviews with management. 
The review found that in general the Internal Audit function and 
its work has improved significantly over recent years, through the 
incorporation of additional team members with specific, relevant 
experience and skills, that the function has good communication 
and rapport with the wider organisation, and that the audit approach 
effectively addresses key operational and business risks. The key 
recommendations mainly related to the use of audit software, 
additional specialist IT audit resources, improvements to the Internal 
Audit quality assurance process and enhancements to the executive 
summaries of the audit reports. The implementation of the 
recommendations should be completed during 2015. 
RISK AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT 
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing the Group’s 
key risks, as well as for maintaining sound risk management and 
internal control systems. The Group’s system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in order 
to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Committee plays a key role in assisting the Board with its 
responsibilities in respect of risk and related controls. As discussed 
in the Risk management section on page 32, the Committee assists 
the Board with its review of the effectiveness of the risk management 
process and monitoring of key risks and mitigations. The Chairman 
of the Committee reports to the Board following each Committee 
meeting, allowing the Board to understand and, if necessary, discuss 
the matters considered in detail by the Committee. These processes 
allow the Board to monitor the Group’s principal risks and related 
mitigations, and to assess the acceptability of the level of risks that 
arise from the Group’s operations and development activities.
Each year the Board, with the support of the Committee, reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems in accordance with the revised Turnbull Guidance on Internal 
Control published by the Financial Reporting Council. The review 
covers all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. During 2014, a review of the risk management 
and internal control systems was performed by the Committee, 
with the Chairman of the Committee reporting back to the Board 
on its findings.
The risk management function presents to the Committee 
several times during the year, and presentations include details of 
developments in the Group’s overall risk management processes and 
key Group-level strategic risks. The General Managers of the Group’s 
operations, including the transport and water divisions, also present 
to the Committee, with each operation typically presenting at least 
once a year. The presentations include details of the operation’s most 
significant risks and related mitigating controls, and any significant 
control issues that have arisen.
The Committee ensures that appropriate compliance policies and 
procedures are observed throughout the Group. The Committee 
is responsible for making recommendations to the Board in respect 
of the appointment of the Group’s Crime Prevention Officer, and 
generally monitors and oversees the performance of the Crime 
Prevention Officer’s role. The Crime Prevention Officer is currently 
the Vice-President of Finance and Administration. The Committee 
receives reports from the risk management function in respect of 
the Group’s Crime Prevention Model, in accordance with Chilean 
anti-corruption legislation.
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements, which enable staff and contractors 
to raise concerns in confidence about possible improprieties or non-
compliance with the Group’s Code of Ethics. The Committee receives 
quarterly reports on whistleblowing incidents. It remains satisfied that 
the procedures in place allow for the proportionate and independent 
investigation of matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action.
Further information relating to the Group’s risk and management 
systems is given in the Risk management section of the Strategic 
report on pages 32 to 37.

NOMINATION AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
The purpose of the Nomination and Governance Committee 
is to enhance the quality of nominees to the Board and senior 
management, ensure the integrity of the nomination process 
and to oversee matters of corporate governance for the Board.
The Committee is responsible for leading the process of identifying 
suitable candidates to fill vacancies on the Board and in senior 
management, for nominating such candidates for the approval 
of the Board and for ensuring that appointments are made on merit 
and against objective criteria. The Committee is also responsible 
for evaluating and overseeing the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board and its Committees, reviewing 
the independence of Directors from time to time and overseeing 
the Board’s succession planning. 
Following amendments to the Committee’s terms of reference in

governance arrangements, monitoring trends, initiatives and proposals 
in relation to governance matters, and reviewing the Company’s 
corporate governance framework at least annually and recommending

During 2014, the Committee met on eight occasions. 
NOMINATION AND GOVERNANCE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings 
of the Committee during the year are shown in the table above. 
Biographical details of the members of the Committee, including 
relevant qualifications and experience, are set out on pages 68 to 
69. Except for the Chairman, all of the Committee members are 
considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive Directors. 
APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
In making appointments to the Board, the Nomination and Governance 
Committee considers the skills, experience and knowledge of the 
existing Directors and identifies the potential candidates who would 
most benefit the Board. The Committee assesses the candidates 
based on the following criteria: independence; experience in executive 
roles; mining, power, transport and water experience; corporate 
governance knowledge; financial and legal acumen; executive 
compensation knowledge; experience in Chile and Latin America; 
project construction experience; sustainability, government relations 
and communications skills; and whether they have sufficient time to 
devote to the role. The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that any 
new Directors are provided with a full induction on joining the Board 
and the Secretary to the Board and the Company Secretary both assist 
the Chairman with this process. During the recruitment process, the 
Committee also advises potential candidates of the Company’s values, 
business culture and challenges, as well as expectations of time 
commitment to meet both Board and Committee objectives.
The Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board 
and its Committees, conducting a succession planning exercise 
to determine appropriate strategies to fill potential vacancies while 
preserving an adequate balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and independence. The Board recruitment process is proactive 
and the Committee regularly reviews and evaluates the Board’s 
composition in order to identify potential departures and the skills, 
knowledge, experience and independence that may be required 
to match the Board’s needs with the Group’s strategic objectives, 
and an appropriate selection of candidates to ensure that the Board 
remains balanced. 
At the beginning of 2014, the Committee commissioned Egon 
Zehnder to conduct a search for an independent Non-Executive 
Director, taking into account the criteria listed above. The Committee 
subsequently recommended that Vivianne Blanlot be appointed to 
the Board in March. 
Also on 1 September, Nelson Pizarro’s resignation to the Board 
became effective as he joined Codelco as CEO. 
During the second half of 2014 the Committee engaged Spencer 
Stuart to conduct a search for an independent Non-Executive 
Director, which concluded with the appointment on 17 December 
2014 of Mr. Jorge Bande to the Board following the recommendation 
of the Nomination and Governance Committee. 
Neither Egon Zehnder nor Spencer Stuart has any connection with 
the Company. 
APPOINTMENTS TO BOARD COMMITTEES

of the Board Committees and reviews and implements succession 
plans to ensure that vacancies can be easily filled while preserving an 
adequate balance of skills, knowledge, experience and independence.

GOVERNANCE BOARDROOM DIVERSITY
The Board is composed of highly capable and committed individuals 
with a diverse range of technical skills, backgrounds, expertise, 
nationalities and perspectives. The Board is committed to continuing 
to improve its gender balance. In preparing for the searches for new 
independent Non-Executive Directors in 2014 as described above, 
the Committee agreed that special consideration should be given  
to female candidates. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
During 2014, the Nomination and Governance Committee assumed 
responsibility for monitoring the Board’s corporate governance 
arrangements, reviewing the Company’s corporate governance 
framework at least annually and recommending any necessary 
approvals or changes to the Board. As part of the 2014 review, the 
Committee recommended a revised corporate governance framework 
for the Group that involved the re-designation of Jean-Paul Luksic 
as Non-Executive Chairman, the appointment of Diego Hernández 
as the Group’s CEO and the appointment of Iván Arriagada as CEO 
of Antofagasta Minerals. This structure is intended to ensure that 
the roles of Chairman and CEO are clearly separated and that there 
is a single, clear line of executive reporting into the Board. 
As part of this process, the Nomination and Governance Committee 
also reviewed and presented to the Board updated terms of 
reference for all of the Board Committees, a revised schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board, and documents outlining the 
specific responsibilities of the Chairman, the Group CEO and the 
Senior Independent Director. The name of the Committee was also 
changed from the “Nomination Committee” to the Nomination 
and Governance Committee.
RE-ELECTION
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors 
will stand for re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting on 
20 May 2015. As is required under the revised Listing Rules, which 
apply to the Company for the first time this year, our independent Non-
Executive Directors will also be subject to a dual vote by shareholders, 
which means that each resolution to elect or re-elect an independent 
Non-Executive Director must be approved by both a majority vote of 
all shareholders and a majority vote of the Company’s independent 
shareholders. Further details are set out in the Notice of Meeting. 
Having taken into account the results of the performance evaluation 
of the Board (see page 78), the Board is satisfied that each of the 
Directors continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment 
to his or her role, and is therefore recommended for re-election.

SUSTAINABILITY AND STAKEHOLDER 
MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
The Board has ultimate responsibility for sustainability. The Board has 
strengthened the current procedures and management structures at 
Group and divisional level in order to ensure the implementation of the 
Group’s sustainable development principles and Antofagasta Minerals’ 
social and environmental strategy. These arrangements are part of the 
overall Group governance arrangements described in the Corporate 
governance report.
The Committee assists the Board in the stewardship of the Group’s 
social responsibility programmes and the Board takes into account the 
ethical, community, social and environmental impact of its decisions.
The Committee provides guidance to the Group in relation to 
sustainability matters generally, reviewing and updating the Group’s 
framework of sustainability policies and strategies, including safety, 
health, environmental, social and stakeholder issues, and monitoring 
and reviewing the Group’s performance in respect of sustainability 
matters, indicators and targets. When necessary, the Committee 
escalates matters of concern to the Board. The Committee also 
reviews and approves the annual Antofagasta Minerals Sustainability 
Report, which is published separately.
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board following 
each Committee meeting, allowing the Board to understand and, 
if necessary, discuss matters considered in detail by the Committee. 
The Committee reviewed and updated its terms of reference 
during 2014. These were then reviewed by the Nomination and 
Governance Committee before subsequent approval by the Board. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website at www.antofagasta.co.uk.

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings 
of the Committee during the year are shown in the table above. 
Biographical details of the members of the Committee, including 
qualifications and experience, are set out on pages 68 to 69. 
The Antofagasta Minerals Sustainability Report provides further 
information on its social and environmental performance. 
More information on Antofagasta Minerals’ sustainability activities 
is set out in the Sustainability section of the Strategic report 
on pages 50 to 60. 
Here is a short summary of the Committee’s involvement in some 
of the Group’s main sustainability achievements in 2014. 
INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON MINING AND METALS (ICMM)
Antofagasta Minerals was accepted as a member of the ICMM in 
June 2014. The ICMM was founded in 2001 to improve sustainable 
development in the mining and metals industry. It brings together 
mining and metals companies as well as national and regional 
mining associations and global commodity associations to address 
core sustainable development challenges. Member companies 
are required to make a public commitment to improve their 
sustainability performance based on ten principles and report 
on their progress annually.
As part of the application process for admission to the ICMM, a panel 
of external experts visited Antofagasta Minerals in March 2014 and 
issued a set of recommendations, identifying gaps in the division’s 
sustainability practices that should be closed by February 2016. 
The Committee oversaw the application process and continues 
to oversee the work performed by Antofagasta Minerals to meet 
its commitments as an ICMM member.
ANTOFAGASTA MINERALS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
The Committee reviewed and approved the 2014 Antofagasta 
Minerals Sustainability Report. This report was the seventh prepared 
by the Group and the first prepared by Antofagasta Minerals, 
as opposed to the Group. It complies with ICMM standards and 
follows the Global Reporting Initiative G4 sustainability reporting 
guidelines. It is planned that the 2015 report will be completed in time 
for the Annual General Meeting and the 2016 report will be published 
together with the Annual Report. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MINING DIVISION’S SAFETY 
AND HEALTH MODEL
The Committee oversees the implementation of the Group Safety 
and Health model, which aims to eliminate fatalities by focusing on 
critical activities, increasing organisational learning and emphasising 
responsibility, accountability and proactive risk control. It also works 
to standardise the reporting and investigation of incidents and the 
implementation of improvements. 
NEW COMMUNITY RELATIONS PROGRAMME 
AND A COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PLAN
The Committee reviewed progress on the implementation of a new 
community relations programme at Los Pelambres, working with 
community groups in the region to create a shared vision of social 
and environmental projects to be developed over the coming years. 
The Committee also reviewed progress on the Los Pelambres plan to 
address communities’ expectations of the number of suitable jobs that 
Los Pelambres will create in the region.

GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT
Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration  
and Talent Management Committee
During 2014, the Group’s Chairman stepped back from his position of 
Executive Chairman to become Non-Executive Chairman and Diego 
Hernández took up the role of Group CEO, having previously been 
responsible for the mining division. As a result of these changes, the 
Committee reviewed the Chairman’s remuneration with regard to the 
non-executive nature of the role, the value to the Group of the role and 
the international mining market for talent. The result of this review was 
to reduce the Chairman’s total annual remuneration by almost 70%. 
As was the case in 2012 and 2013, no changes were made to Non-
Executive Director fees (excluding the Chairman) in 2014.
Although Mr. Hernández is not a member of the Antofagasta plc 
Board and we are therefore not required to report his remuneration 
under the UK regulations, we have nevertheless elected to report on 
his remuneration since becoming Group CEO to provide shareholders 
with further information on our pay structure for senior executives. 
A significant portion of Mr. Hernández’s total remuneration is in 
the form of variable remuneration based on Group and individual 
performance, according to metrics fixed at the beginning of each 
relevant performance period. These are designed to align his 
performance with the performance and strategy of the Group.
We continue to provide information on the structure of pay for 
executive management, including the variable short and long-term 
pay of the Executive Committee. These variable remuneration 
arrangements are structured to align the Executive Committee 
to our short and long-term business goals. 
At the 2014 AGM, I promised shareholders that the Committee would 
continue to monitor and review the Company’s Remuneration Policy, 
ensuring that it remains appropriate and relevant. The Remuneration 
Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and the policy 
table is included unchanged in this report for information purposes only.
Following the 2014 AGM, we engaged with a number of major 
shareholders and proxy voting agencies to discuss the Remuneration 
Policy and the Group’s remuneration arrangements more generally. 
While the feedback we received was positive, as demonstrated by 
91.8% of votes supporting it at the 2014 AGM, we received some 
queries in relation to the elements that apply to the recruitment of 
Executive Directors and the level of discretion that may be applied 
by the Committee if an Executive Director is appointed to the Board. 
We have therefore clarified within the report the way in which the 
recruitment policy would be applied in these circumstances. 
Shareholders are invited to vote on the Company’s Remuneration 
Report and I hope that you will continue to support the Company’s 
pay arrangements in 2015. 
TIM BAKER
Chairman of the Remuneration  
and Talent Management Committee
86 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 ANTOFAGASTA’S APPROVED 
REMUNERATION POLICY
(APPROVAL RECEIVED AT THE 2014 AGM)
The following policy table was approved by shareholders at the AGM 
in 2014. This policy table has not been amended and is provided 
below for reference, in the same format as approved last year. It does 
not formally form part of the Remuneration Report. It should be noted 
that the Executive Chairman became the Non-Executive Chairman on 
1 September 2014 and that revised terms apply to his role since the 
Remuneration Policy was adopted, which are in accordance with the 
Non-Executive Directors’ section of the Remuneration Policy below. 
The full Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM can be found in the 2013 Annual Report 
at www.antofagasta.co.uk.
The Company’s policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded 
with regard to the responsibilities undertaken, and to consider 
comparable pay levels and structures in the United Kingdom, Chile, 
and in the international mining industry. Corporate and individual 
performance is taken into account in setting the pay level for the 
Chairman as an Executive Director, and this is reviewed annually in 
comparison with companies of a similar nature, size and complexity. 
Remuneration levels for Non-Executive Directors are also reviewed 
in this way, and take into account the specific responsibilities 
undertaken and structure of the Board.
PURPOSE OPERATION MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN (NOT CURRENTLY RELEVANT FOLLOWING THE RE-DESIGNATION  
OF JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC AS NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN ON 1 SEPTEMBER 2014)
Fees To provide appropriate 
compensation to reflect the 
responsibilities of this role and 
to execute the Group’s strategic 
objectives at an appropriate 
level of cost. 
To act as the sole element of 
compensation. The Committee 
feels that this is appropriate 
given the Executive Chairman’s 
interest in the Company’s 
shares (both via a company 
controlled by him and as a 
member of the Luksic family), 
which provides alignment with 
other shareholders.
Fees are the only element of compensation that the Executive Chairman is 
eligible to receive. 
Fees are reviewed annually, with increases, if any, typically taking effect 
from 1 January each year.
The Committee considers the following factors when reviewing fee levels:
 – corporate and individual performance; and
 –  the competitiveness of total remuneration assessed against appropriate 
peers in terms of nature, size and complexity. 
The Executive Chairman receives a base fee for services to Antofagasta 
plc’s Board as well as additional fees for chairing  
or serving as a member of any of the Board’s Committees. 
Separate base fees are paid for chairing the Antofagasta Minerals 
Board and for being a Director or for chairing certain strategic subsidiary 
companies within the Group. 
The Executive Chairman is currently Chairman of Antofagasta Railway 
Company plc and Aguas de Antofagasta. The Executive Chairman also 
receives a base fee for services provided to Antofagasta Railway Company 
plc and Antofagasta Minerals (pursuant to separate service contracts). 
Fees are determined and paid in a combination of US dollars and Chilean 
pesos. The Committee may determine fee levels and/or pay fees in 
any other currency if deemed necessary. For comparison purposes, all 
compensation is in US dollars in this report.
In normal circumstances, the maximum annual 
fee increase will be 7%. However, the Committee 
has discretion to exceed this in exceptional 
circumstances, for example: 
– if there is a sustained period of high inflation; 
–  if the Executive Chairman’s fees are out of line with 
the market; and/or 
–  if fees for chairing or serving as a member of any 
of the Board’s Committees is out of line with 
the market. 
Any increases will take into account the factors 
described under “operation” and will not 
be excessive. 
Fee levels for additional roles within the Antofagasta 
Group are set based on the needs and time 
commitment expected and may be determined and/
or paid in a combination of currencies including US 
dollars and Chilean pesos. 
Fees will also be increased to take account of Chilean 
inflation and may be reported as an increase or 
decrease as a result of the exchange rate impact of 
Chilean peso denominated fees, given all amounts in 
this report are reported in US dollars. 
Variable 
remuneration
The Committee does not consider it appropriate to make performance-related pay awards, such as bonuses, to the Executive Chairman, given his role as 
Chairman of the Board and his interest in the Company’s shares (both via a company controlled by him and as a member of the Luksic family).
Benefits To provide appropriate 
benefits and reimburse 
expenses incurred in the 
performance of duties of the 
Executive Chairman.
Benefits include the provision of life, accident and health insurance.
The Committee retains the discretion to provide additional insurance 
benefits in accordance with Company policy, should this be 
deemed necessary.
In normal circumstances, the maximum value of 
benefits will be $22,000. However, the Committee 
has discretion to exceed this should the underlying 
cost of providing the pre-existing benefits increase, 
or if additional benefits are provided and are 
deemed appropriate.
Pension The Executive Chairman does not receive pension contributions nor is he entitled to receive pension contributions under this policy.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Fees To attract and retain high-
calibre, experienced Non-
Executive Directors by offering 
globally competitive fee levels.
Fees are reviewed annually and the competitiveness of total fees is 
assessed against companies of a similar nature, size and complexity. 
Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee for services to Antofagasta 
plc’s Board, as well as additional fees for chairing  
or serving as a member of any of the Board’s Committees. 
Separate base fees are paid for services to the Antofagasta Minerals Board 
(all Non-Executive Directors are members of both Boards), and for being 
directors of subsidiary companies and joint venture companies within 
the Group. 
Ramón Jara also receives a base fee for services provided to Antofagasta 
Railway Company plc and Antofagasta Minerals (pursuant to a separate 
service contract). 
Fee levels are denominated in US dollars. The Committee may determine 
fee levels and/or pay fees in any other currency if deemed necessary.
Non-Executive Directors’ fee levels follow the same 
policy for increases as the Executive Chairman’s fees 
(see above). 
Variable 
remuneration
Given the predominantly non-executive composition of the Board, there are no arrangements for Directors to acquire benefits through the acquisition of shares in the 
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit through performance-related pay or to participate in long-term incentive schemes.  
The Code states that remuneration for Non-Executive Directors should not include share options or other performance-related elements.
Benefits To provide appropriate benefits 
required in the performance 
of duties of the Non-
Executive Directors. 
Benefits may be provided to Non-Executive Directors following the same policy as for the Executive Chairman (see above).
Pension No Director receives pension contributions. The Code considers that the participation by a Non-Executive Director in a company’s pension scheme could potentially 
affect the independence of that Non-Executive Director.
As Directors do not receive variable remuneration, there are no provisions in place to recover sums paid or withhold payments to either the Executive Chairman or the Non-Executive Directors.

Antofagasta plc | 87
GOVERNANCE CLARIFICATION OF RECRUITMENT POLICY 
As explained in the Committee Chairman’s Annual Statement, the 
Committee would like to clarify the level of discretion that it may apply 
if an Executive Director is appointed to the Board:
 – Under the Remuneration Policy, a new Executive Director’s annual 
variable remuneration is capped at 500% of base salary, unless 
the level of variable remuneration is not sufficient to secure an 
appointment, in which case variable remuneration may be paid 
outside this cap provided that it is in line with that provided by 
companies of a similar size, nature and complexity. To clarify, 
the Committee has decided that it will not provide any variable 
remuneration above the 500% cap during the Remuneration 
Policy period.
 – Under the Remuneration Policy, the Committee also retains 
discretion to make awards on a one-off basis to new Executive 
Directors on appointment, taking into account the specific 
circumstances of the new Executive Director, such as whether 
the Executive Director has had to forfeit existing incentive 
awards when accepting the appointment. To clarify, in practice 
any compensation provided to a new Executive Director as 
compensation for the forfeiture of any award will be reviewed, 
on a like-for-like fair value basis, taking into account the value of 
such forfeited awards, any performance conditions and the time 
basis of any vesting. The Committee’s intention is that buy-out 
compensation should reflect the nature of the award foregone 
and include, where appropriate, performance-tested awards over 
an appropriate time period reflecting the fair value of any award 
forgone. Such compensation for the forfeiture of an award would 
not exceed 500% of base salary.
There is no intention to offer any other awards, such as a sign-
on awards, outside the annual cap on variable remuneration 
described above.

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THIS REPORT 
AND COMPLIANCE
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). It describes 
how the Board has applied the principles of good governance as 
set out in the Code. During the year under review, the Company 
complied with the detailed provisions set out in section D of the 
Code, except that as explained on page 73, Jean-Paul Luksic was 
Executive Chairman until 1 September 2014 and did not receive any 
reward structured to vary with individual or corporate performance. 
Diego Hernández was appointed Group Chief Executive Officer of 
Antofagasta plc on 1 September 2014, having previously been the 
CEO of Antofagasta Minerals, and receives variable remuneration that 
depends on both his individual and corporate performance, explained 
in more detail in the Remuneration Report.

ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE
The purpose of the Remuneration and Talent Management 
Committee is to ensure that remuneration arrangements support the 
Group’s strategic objectives and enable the recruitment, motivation, 
retention and development of talent within the expectations 
of shareholders.
The Committee is responsible for preparing and reviewing the 
appropriateness and relevance of the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy and for reviewing the remuneration of any Executive Directors 
(although there are currently none). The Committee also reviews and 
approves the remuneration of the Chairman and reviews and approves 
the remuneration of the Group CEO, determining the performance-
related elements of his compensation. The remuneration for the other 
members of the Executive Committee, including awards granted 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and Annual Bonus Plan, and the 
performance targets for each plan, are reviewed by the Group CEO 
and recommended to the Committee for approval. 
The Committee is also responsible for monitoring the level and 
structure of remuneration of the Executive Committee, reviewing and 
approving performance-related compensation, reviewing succession 
planning for the Executive Committee, reviewing any major changes 
in compensation policies applied across the Group’s companies that 
have a significant long-term impact on labour costs, and reviewing 
compensation and talent management strategies. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board following 
each Committee meeting, allowing the Board to understand and, 
if necessary, discuss matters considered in detail by the Committee.
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference during the course 
of 2014 and proposed amendments that were approved by the Board 
on 25 November 2014. The Committee’s revised terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website at www.antofagasta.co.uk.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Board as a whole and no Director participates in the determination  
of his own remuneration.

The members of the Committee and their attendance at meetings 
of the Committee during the year are shown in the table above. 
Biographical details of the members of the Committee, including 
relevant qualifications and experience, are set out on pages 68

to be independent Non-Executive Directors. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF FINDINGS OF THE EXTERNAL 
REVIEW OF THE COMMITTEE
A review of the effectiveness of the Committee was undertaken 
by Independent Audit Limited in 2013. 
The Committee has continued to work with the Vice-President of 
Human Resources to introduce a number of changes to enhance 
its effectiveness based on the findings of the effectiveness review. 
These include enhanced liaison with the Committee’s external 
advisors, an increased focus on talent development and succession 
planning, and improved information flow to the Board on the 
Committee’s deliberations. Some of the initiatives implemented 
in relation to talent management are explained on page 99.
ADVISORS TO THE COMMITTEE
During the year, the Committee received advice on matters 
under its consideration from Towers Watson, the remuneration 
consultant appointed by the Committee. This included updates on 
legislative requirements and market practice. Towers Watson also 
performed a benchmarking review of the Chairman’s and the Group 
CEO’s remuneration. 
Towers Watson is a widely recognised independent global 
professional services firm and the Committee is satisfied that the 
advice provided was objective and independent, that no conflict of 
interest arose as a result of these services and that Towers Watson 
has no other connection with the Company. Towers Watson’s fees 
for this work were charged in accordance with normal billing practices 
and amounted to $109,000.
The Company’s legal advisors, Clifford Chance LLP , also provided 
advice on the operation of the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan, 
the new remuneration reporting requirements and other legal 
issues during 2014.
The Committee also received assistance from the Chairman, 
the Group CEO and the Vice-President of Human Resources, 
none of whom participate in discussions relating to setting their 
own remuneration.

discretion available to the Company in choosing whether or not to 
grant sign-on or replacement awards if the Company was to appoint 
a new Executive Director during the policy period. The Company’s 
position on these matters has been clarified, as set out on page 88.

GOVERNANCE 2014 REMUNERATION
CHAIRMAN
Mr. Jean-Paul Luksic was appointed Executive Chairman in 2004 
and was re-designated as Non-Executive Chairman on 1 September 
2014. As a consequence of this, the contracts for services that 
Mr. Luksic had with the Antofagasta Railway Company plc and 
Antofagasta Minerals were terminated with effect from that date 
and the fee payable for the role of Chairman of the Board was 
also reduced.
The single figure calculations in this report include payments made 
to the Chairman in his capacity as Executive Chairman prior to 
1 September 2014 under his service contracts, which included an 
annual adjustment for Chilean inflation as is typical for employment 
contracts or contracts for services in Chile. The single figure 
calculation also includes payments for services as Chairman of the 
Board, Chairman of the Nomination and Governance Committee and 
subsidiary board services, including as Chairman of the Antofagasta 
Minerals board and a member of the divisional boards of the transport 
division (Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia, the Chilean branch of 
Antofagasta Railway Company plc) and the water division (Aguas de 
Antofagasta S.A.). As some of the Chairman’s fees for the Antofagasta 
Railway Company plc and Aguas de Antofagasta S.A. are paid in 
Chilean pesos, they are subject to annual exchange rate movements 
when reported in US dollars.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
As was the case in 2012 and 2013, there was no change to the level 
of Antofagasta plc Board fees in 2014. The base Non-Executive 
Director’s annual fee in respect of the Antofagasta plc Board remained 
at $130,000. Given the core role which Antofagasta Minerals plays 
in the management of the mining operations and projects, and that 
Antofagasta Minerals represents the large majority of the Group’s 
business, all Antofagasta plc Directors also served as Directors of 
the Antofagasta Minerals Board. The annual fee payable to Directors 
of Antofagasta Minerals remained at $130,000 for members of the 
Board. Therefore, the combined base fees payable to Non-Executive 
Directors of both Antofagasta plc and Antofagasta Minerals amounted 
to $260,000 per annum.
In 2013, the Committee commissioned Towers Watson to perform  
an independent review and benchmarking of Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees. In light of the 2013 review, the Board remains satisfied that 
the current fee levels and structure are aligned with the Group’s 
international peers. The Board is not recommending any change 
this year, but will continue to review fee levels from time to time, 
in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
In addition to Board fees, Directors also receive fees for their 
contributions to Board sub-committees during the year. The table 
below summarises Antofagasta plc Board Committee fees payable 
in 2014, which were unchanged from 2012 and 2013. It is expected 
that these fee levels will be reviewed in 2015.

5  All Directors are covered by the Directors’ and Officers’ Life and Travel insurance policies generally maintained by the Group. Diego Hernández is covered by Life and Health insurance policies 
generally maintained by the Group.
6  The amounts payable to Diego Hernández under the Long-Term Incentive Plan relate to restricted awards and performance awards granted in 2012 and to restricted awards granted in 2013.

awards granted in 2012 concluded on 31 December 2014 and will vest on 25 March 2015. Because the performance awards granted in 2012 have not yet vested, the amounts attributable to these 
awards have been estimated using the closing share price as at 31 December 2014 of 752.5p and an exchange rate of $1.5577/£1.

REMUNERATION REPORT
92 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 ANNUAL BONUS 
An explanation of the Group’s Annual Bonus Plan is set out on page 
95. Under the Annual Bonus Plan, the bonus payable to the Group 
CEO is attributable 70% to the performance of the Group and 30% 
to the Group CEO’s personal performance according to metrics that 
are fixed at the beginning of each year. 
 – The annual bonus payable to the Group CEO for achieving the Group 
and personal performance targets in 2014 was 50% of annual base 
salary (six months’ base salary). 
 – The maximum bonus payable to the Group CEO for achieving 
stretch performance targets in 2014 was 100% of base salary 
(12 months’ base salary). 
Based on performance achieved against targets during the 2014 
financial year, the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee 
determined, based on the performance metrics, that the Group CEO 
would receive a bonus payment of $220,000 since the date of his 
appointment as Group CEO.
The determination of the bonus for the Group CEO for 2014 
attributable to Group performance took account of the performance 
metrics set out on page 96. The determination of the bonus for 
the Group CEO for 2014 attributable to personal performance 
is commercially sensitive.
PARTICIPATION IN THE GROUP’S LONG-TERM 
INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Mr. Hernández participates in the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”) described on page 96 and was also granted an exceptional 
one-off award following his appointment as CEO of the mining division 
in 2012 (the “One-off Award”). 
As set out in more detail on page 96, the LTIP comprises 
two elements:
 – Performance Share Awards (“PSAs”) rewarding performance over 
three years.
 – Restricted Share Awards (“RSAs”) which vest one third in each year 
over a three-year period following grant of the award.
The same performance criteria apply to all participants in the LTIP 
and the LTIP is designed to develop a clear link between business 
objectives, shareholder value and senior management rewards. 
The performance criteria that applies to PSAs granted in 2014 
is set out on page 94.
In the period in 2014 following Mr. Hernández’s appointment as 
Group CEO, he received total payments of $124,000 in respect 
of the RSAs granted in 2012 and 2013. Using the Company’s share 
price as at 31 December 2014, Mr. Hernández’s estimated payment 
for PSA awards granted under the 2012 programme and vesting 
on the conclusion of performance in 2014 is $36,000. Using these 
calculations, LTIP awards amounted to 52% of his base salary for 
the period in 2014 during which he served as Group CEO. 
The performance criteria attaching to the PSAs granted in 2012 
is as follows:

Note: Diego Hernández joined the Group on 1 August 2012 and was granted awards under the 2012 LTIP on 22 November 2012. The portion of RSAs that vested on 9 January 2013 was reduced pro 
rata to take into account the period before Mr. Hernandez joined the Group. The payment that Mr. Hernández receives in relation to the PSAs that are due to vest in 2015 will also be reduced pro rata 
to the time that Mr. Hernández has been with the Group during the 2012 programme.
ONE-OFF AWARD
As part of the remuneration arrangements agreed on his appointment, 
Diego Hernández was granted an exceptional, long-term One-off 
Award on 22 November 2012. The One-off Award was in the form 
of conditional rights to receive a cash payment by reference to the 
market value of a number of ordinary shares in the Company at 
vesting. The One-off Award was not granted over actual shares. 
 – Half of the One-off Award is subject both to certain performance 
conditions, which are measured over a three-year period (ending 
on 1 August 2015, the three-year anniversary of the effective date 
of Diego Hernández’s appointment), and to continued employment. 
That half of the award will normally vest only after the end of the 
three-year performance period and only to the extent that those 
performance conditions are met. 
 – The other half of the One-off Award is subject to continued 
employment and will normally vest on 1 August 2015.
The One-off Award was granted to Diego Hernández to reward him 
in a way that aligns his interests with the interests of shareholders and 
with the Group’s long-term strategic plan by reference to leadership 
development metrics including:
 – Increased leadership effectiveness of the Executive Committee 
evidenced by 360 degree feedback and measured against external 
benchmarking performed in 2012 and in fully closing any gaps 
agreed with the Remuneration and Talent Management Committee;
 – Implementation of a succession plan for the role of Antofagasta 
Minerals CEO, the Executive Committee and the General Managers 
of each of the Group’s operations evidenced by the successful 
identification of at least one successor for each position that is 
deemed ready to assume the role;
 – Improvement of organisational climate in the mining 
group, specifically as regards quality of life, recognition 
and development; and
 – Implementation of a development programme  
for “high potential” employees. 
No amounts were payable or vested under the One-off Award in 2014.
Details of the potential total remuneration for Diego Hernández in 2015 
(including his One-off Awards) are set out on below.

EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION  
– EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The Executive Committee is responsible for leading the day-to-
day operation of the mining business. The Committee is led by 
the CEO of Antofagasta Minerals. No member of the Executive 
Committee, nor the Group CEO, sits on the Board of Antofagasta 
plc. Consequently, the disclosures below relating to the variable 
pay mechanisms, annual bonus and LTIP , as well as information 
on the Group CEO’s remuneration arrangements above, 
are voluntary disclosures.
REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES
The remuneration arrangements in place for the Executive Committee 
are structured to align remuneration with performance, the Group’s 
strategic objectives and shareholders’ interests. Each Executive 
Committee member is eligible to receive a combination of base 
salary and other benefits, as well as variable remuneration in the form 
of an annual cash bonus and conditional cash awards based on the 
price of the ordinary shares of the Company granted pursuant to the 
Group’s LTIP .
The performance components of variable remuneration are selected 
to incentivise the delivery of the business strategy, to reward Group 
and individual performance and to motivate the Executive Committee.
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN
Members of the Executive Committee are eligible to receive 
cash awards under the Annual Bonus Plan based on Group and 
individual performance. The bonus plan focuses on the delivery of 
annual financial and non-financial targets that are designed to align 
remuneration with the Company’s strategy and create a platform for 
sustainable future performance. The bonus payable to each Vice-
President is attributable 50% to the performance of the Group and 
50% to the performance of that Vice-President according to metrics 
fixed at the beginning of each year. 
The performance criteria for the Annual Bonus Plan are set annually 
by the Committee. The average maximum available award for the 
Executive Committee members under the terms of the Annual 
Bonus Plan, which would reflect maximum individual and Group 
performance, is 68% of base salary. In 2014 the average award for 
the Executive Committee members was approximately 44% of base 
salary. Individual award levels are calibrated at the conclusion of each 
annual performance period as part of a review of performance against 
the criteria set for the year, to ensure that performance targets remain 
stretching and that high or maximum payments under each plan are 
received only for exceptional performance. Individual award levels 
are also reviewed by the Committee.

The choice of these criteria, and their respective weightings, reflect 
the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be 
tied both to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas 
of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The Company introduced the LTIP at the end of 2011. Eligibility to 
participate in the LTIP is determined by the Committee each year 
on an individual basis and all members of the Executive Committee 
currently participate. The first awards under the LTIP were granted 
on 29 December 2011 and awards have since been granted annually. 
Under the rules of the LTIP , Directors are not eligible to participate.
Under the LTIP , participants are eligible to receive “phantom” share 
awards (conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to a 
specified number of the Company’s ordinary shares), which are paid in 
cash upon vesting and may be made to participants based on the price 
of the Company’s ordinary shares at the time of vesting.
Awards granted pursuant to the LTIP are split between Restricted 
Share Awards (“RSAs”) and Performance Share Awards (“PSAs”). 
The RSAs are conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference 
to a specified number of the Company’s ordinary shares subject to 
the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when the 
RSAs vest. The PSAs are conditional rights to receive cash payment 
by reference to a specified number of the Company’s ordinary shares 
subject to both the satisfaction of performance conditions and the 
relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when the 
PSAs vest.
REMUNERATION REPORT
96 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 The PSAs granted in 2014 will be measured over a three-year performance period based on the following performance conditions:
Weighting Objective Measure
25% Relative Total Shareholder Return Comparison against HSBC Global Mining Index with 33% vesting at performance equal to the 
index and 100% vesting of award at performance equal or greater than the index plus 5% during 
the three-year period. The index will be calculated over an average index from three months 
previous to the beginning and before the end of the period, respectively.
30% EBITDA The maximum figure corresponds to the accumulated EBITDA over the period 2014-2016. 
For 2014, this is calculated using the budget figure. For 2015 and 2016, the figures will be 
the ones resulting from the base case prepared during 2014. 
7% Mineral Resources Increase Maximum figure corresponds to the level of contained resources for the Group at the end of 2016.
5% Reserves Increase Maximum figure corresponds to level of contained copper reserves for the Group  
at the end of 2016. 
33% Projects, Development and 
Sustainability
These performance criteria relate to safety performance according to lost injury time frequency 
rates, reported incidents and successful implementation of the new Group health and safety model 
as well as the performance of priority projects for the Group including Encuentro Oxides, Antucoya, 
Los Pelambres incremental expansion and the Twin Metals Project. 
The LTIP was amended by the Committee in March 2015. 
As a consequence, any LTIP awards granted after 17 March 2015 
are subject to malus provisions in the LTIP rules which allow the 
Committee to, at its discretion, reduce the number of shares to which 
an award relates or cancel an award as a result of:
 – actions by a participant that, in the reasonable opinion of the 
Committee, amount to gross misconduct which has or may have 
a material effect on the value or reputations of the Company or any 
of its subsidiaries;
 – a materially adverse error in the consolidated financial statements 
of the Group during the resting period; or 
 – any reasonable circumstance that the Committee determines in 
good faith to have resulted in an unfair benefit to the participant.
REMUNERATION STRUCTURE
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration arrangements 
in place for the Group CEO and the Executive Committee are 
linked to performance, appropriately stretching and aligned to the 
business strategy. Variable remuneration is a core component of 
Executive Committee remuneration and up to 62% of the Executive 
Committee’s total annual remuneration may be achieved under the 
Annual Bonus Plan and the LTIP .

shareholder return (as defined below). The FTSE All-Share Index has 
been selected as an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly 
based index to which the Company belongs and relates to the London 
Stock Exchange, the market where the Company’s ordinary shares 
are traded.

Total shareholder return performance in comparison with the 
Euromoney Global Mining Index is one of the performance criteria 
for Performance Share Awards granted pursuant to the LTIP as 
described above.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical growth 
in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that 
dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing 
price applicable on the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for 
the FTSE All-Share Index and the Euromoney Global Mining Index 
is calculated by aggregating the returns of all individual constituents 
of those indices at the end of the six-year period. 
The total remuneration of the Chairman (who was Executive Chairman 
until 1 September 2014 and Non-Executive Chairman thereafter) and 
the Group CEO (from 1 September 2014) for the past six years, in US 
dollars, has been as follows:

CEO – – – – – 76%
Note: The Chairman was not eligible for any variable remuneration in 2013 and 2014 and this 
table therefore only includes variable remuneration for Mr. Hernández. The proportion of 
maximum LTIPs vesting in favour of the Group CEO represents the 100% vesting of restricted 
awards granted in 2012 and 2013 and an estimated 76% vesting of performance awards granted 
in 2012 estimated using the share price of 752.5p as at 31 December 2014.
The total remuneration paid to the Chairman from 1 January to 
31 August 2014 and to the Group CEO from 1 September to 
31 December 2014 was 20% lower than the total remuneration paid 
to the Chairman in 2013. This comprised a 30% decrease in fees/
remuneration and a 55% reduction in benefits. These amounts are 
higher than the overall decrease in total remuneration because a 
large proportion of Diego Hernández’s total remuneration is made 
up of variable remuneration. The equivalent average percentage 
change for Group employees as a whole was an increase of 6.7%. 
This comprised a 5.6% increase in salaries and a 1.1% increase in 
benefits for Group employees as a whole in 2014. It is common for 
employment contracts in Chile to include an annual adjustment for 
Chilean inflation. In 2014, Chilean inflation was 4.6%.

set out in Note 9 to the financial statements.
This report does not disclose information in relation to the following, 
which was not relevant for the 2014 financial year:
 – payments for loss of office – no such events occurred in the 2014 
financial year;
 – further details on pension arrangements – Directors do not receive 
pension benefits; and
 – payments to past Directors – no such payments were made 
in the year.
Should such events occur in future, the necessary disclosures  
will be made at the appropriate time.
TALENT MANAGEMENT AND SUCCESSION 
PLANNING 
2014 was the first full year following the implementation of the new 
talent management strategy and succession planning policy for key 
positions within the Group as identified by the Committee.
As part of this policy, the Committee oversaw processes during 
2014 to identify and agree key positions and existing employees who 
are possible successors for these positions in the future. Under the 
agreed succession planning policy, whenever a key position becomes 
vacant a replacement will first be sought from within the Group, taking 
into account the succession plan previously developed and agreed for 
that position.
During 2014, 68% of vacancies in positions identified as key positions 
were filled by internal candidates, in accordance with the new 
succession planning policy.

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with those factors likely to 
affect its future performance, are set out in the Operational review 
on pages 38 to 49. Details of the cash flows of the Group during 
the year, along with its financial position at the year end are set out 
in the Financial review on pages 61 to 66. The financial statements 
include details of the Group’s cash, cash equivalent and liquid 
investment balances in Note 20 to the financial statements, and details 
of borrowings are set out in Note 21 to the financial statements. 
Details of the Group’s financial risk management, including details 
of the management of liquidity and counterparty risk, are set out 
in Note 23 to the financial statements.
In assessing the Group’s going concern status, the Directors, with 
detailed assistance from the Audit and Risk Committee, have taken 
into account the above factors, including the financial position of 
the Group and in particular its significant balance of cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments, the borrowing facilities in place 
and their terms, the current copper price and market expectations in 
the medium term, the Group’s expected operating cost profile and its 
capital expenditure and financing plans.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The consolidated profit before tax has decreased from $2,083.5 
million in 2013 to $1,573.5 million in 2014.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 9.8 cents (2013 – 
86.1 cents) per ordinary share. An interim dividend of 11.7 cents was 
paid on 9 October 2014 (2013 interim dividend – 8.9 cents). This gives 
total dividends per share proposed in relation to 2014 of 21.5 cents 
(2013 – 95 cents). The total amount of dividends proposed in relation 
to 2014 will be $212.0 million, compared with $936.5 million in 2013.
Preference shares carry the right to a fixed cumulative dividend of 5% 
per annum. The preference shares are classified within borrowings 
and preference dividends are included within finance costs. The total 
cost of dividends paid on preference shares and recognised as 
an expense in the income statement was $0.2 million (2013 – 
$0.2 million). Further information relating to dividends is set out in the 
Financial review on page 64 and in Note 11 to the financial statements.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group did not make political donations during the year ended 
31 December 2014 (2013 – donations of $2.3 million were made 
in relation to the presidential and local elections in Chile).
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Details of the authorised and issued ordinary share capital, including 
details of any movements in the issued share capital during the year, 
are shown in Note 28 to the financial statements. The Company has 
one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each ordinary share carries one vote at any general meeting of the 
Company. Details of the preference share capital are shown in Note 
21 to the financial statements. The preference shares are non-
redeemable and are entitled to a fixed cumulative dividend of 5% 
per annum. Each preference share carries 100 votes on a poll at any 
general meeting of the Company. The nominal value of the issued 
ordinary share capital is 96.1% of the total sterling nominal value of 
all issued share capital, and the nominal value of the issued preference 
share capital is 3.9% of the total sterling nominal value of all issued 
share capital.
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares or on 
their voting rights beyond those standard provisions set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association and other provisions of applicable 
law and regulation (including, in particular, following a failure to provide 
the Company with information about interests in shares as required 
by the Companies Act 2006). The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
The Company has the authority to purchase up to 98,585,669 of 
its own ordinary shares, representing 10% of the issued ordinary 
share capital. With regard to the appointment and replacement of 
Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012, the Companies Act 2006 
and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended 
by special resolution of the shareholders. There are no significant 
agreements in place that take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company. There are no agreements in place 
between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide 
for compensation for loss of office resulting from a change of control 
of the Company.
100 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SHARES AND AUTHORITY 
TO PURCHASE OWN SHARES
At the 2014 AGM, held on 21 May 2014, authority was given to the 
Directors to allot unissued relevant securities in the Company up to a 
maximum amount equivalent to two-thirds of the shares in issue (of 
which one-third must be offered by way of rights issue). This authority 
expires on the date of this year’s AGM to be held on 20 May 2015. 
No such shares have been issued. The Directors propose to renew 
this authority at this year’s AGM for the following year. A further 
special resolution passed at that meeting granted authority to the 
Directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash, without 
regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This authority also expires on the date of this year’s AGM and the 
Directors will seek to renew this authority for the following year. 
The Company was also authorised by a shareholders’ resolution 
passed at the 2014 AGM to purchase up to 10% of its issued ordinary 
share capital. Any shares which have been bought back may be held 
as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately 
upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of 
the Company’s issued and authorised share capital. This authority 
will expire at this year’s AGM and a resolution to renew the authority 
for a further year will be proposed. No shares were purchased by the 
Company during the year.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS AND INDEMNITIES
Details of Directors’ contracts and letters of appointment, 
remuneration and emoluments, and their interests in the shares of 
the Company as at 31 December 2014 are given in the Remuneration 
Report. No Director had any material interest in a contract 
of significance (other than a service contract) with the Company 
or any subsidiary company during the year.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and to 
the extent permitted by the laws of England and Wales, Directors 
are granted an indemnity from the Company in respect of liabilities 
personally incurred as a result of their office. In respect of those 
matters for which the Directors may or may not be indemnified, 
the Company maintained a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
policy throughout the financial year. A new policy has been entered 
into for the current financial year.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Companies Act 2006 requires that a Director must avoid a 
situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. 
The Company has undertaken a process to identify and, where 
appropriate, authorise and manage potential and actual conflicts. 
Each Director has identified his or her interests that may constitute 
conflicts including, for example, directorships in other companies. 
The Board has considered the potential and actual conflict situations 
of each of the Directors and decided in relation to each situation 
whether to authorise it and the steps, if any, which need to be taken 
to manage it. The authorisation process is not regarded as a substitute 
for managing an actual conflict of interest if one arises. The monitoring 
and, if appropriate, authorisation of actual and potential conflicts of 
interest is an ongoing process. Directors are required to notify the 
Company of any material changes in those positions or situations 
that have already been considered, as well as to notify the Company 
of any other new positions or situations that may arise. In addition 
to considering any new situations as they arise, the Board usually 
considers the conflict position of all Directors formally each year.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
As at 31 December 2014 and 16 March 2015, the following significant 
holdings of voting rights in the share capital of the Company had been 
disclosed to the Company under Disclosure and Transparency Rule 5:

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION  
TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of International Accounting Standard 
(“IAS”) Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In the case of the Group’s IFRS financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present 
fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation 
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the IAS Board’s 
“Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial 
Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will 
be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ DECLARATION IN RELATION  
TO RELEVANT AUDIT INFORMATION
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
Annual Report confirms that:
 – so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 – the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware  
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 – the Directors’ report and the Strategic report include a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face; and
 – the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
ANTOFAGASTA PLC
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
 – the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and 
the related Notes 1 to 37 and the Parent Company Balance Sheet 
and related information in Note 38. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial 
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable 
by law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
GOING CONCERN
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement on page 100 that the Group is a going concern. 
We confirm that:
 – we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate; and
 – we have not identified any material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL 
MISSTATEMENT 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team and are unchanged from the prior year:
RISK HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
Carrying value of the Antucoya project  
and other capital projects 
The Antucoya project was fully impaired in December 2012 and the project 
was suspended. On completion of a project review, the Board authorised the 
resumption of the project in March 2013, with cost capitalisation resuming, but no 
reversal of the previous impairment. 
The assessment of the carrying value at Antucoya ($1.4bn) is considered to be 
one of the most judgemental audit risks. As the book value and the estimated net 
present value of the project are very similar, a small change to the key revenue and 
cost assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated net present value 
of the project and result in either further impairment or the reversal of the previous 
impairment charge.
Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements.
In assessing the carrying value of Antucoya we tested the impairment model 
prepared by management to estimate the net present value of the project. 
In particular, we tested the mechanical accuracy of the model and assessed the 
appropriateness of the key assumptions, principally capital expenditure estimates, 
production volumes, copper price assumptions and related revenue estimates, and 
estimated operating costs (principally labour, acid and power prices) with reference 
to external information. We also assessed the appropriateness of the discount rate 
used by management by engaging internal valuation specialists.
We assessed the impact of sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions, being 
the copper price and the discount rate.
We assessed other capital projects for impairment indicators by reviewing the 
progress of key projects and comparing costs incurred against latest budgets 
and forecasts.
Capitalisation of property, plant and equipment  
and of project costs
Under the Group’s accounting policies for property, plant and equipment, 
mine development expenditure is capitalised, with capitalisation ceasing 
when commercial production commences. 
Ongoing expenditure for items of plant, property and equipment are capitalised 
when they give rise to a future economic benefit. 
Project costs are typically capitalised following the approval of a pre-feasibility study 
and amounts relating to pre-feasibility activities are expensed. 
Capital additions to plant, property and equipment totalled $1.6bn in the year, 
principally comprising $0.7bn of ongoing development expenditure at Antucoya, 
$0.5bn at Centinela, $0.2bn at Pelambres and $0.1bn of costs capitalised in respect 
of projects where pre-feasibility studies have been approved and the projects are 
at the feasibility stage.
There is a risk of inappropriate categorisation of expenditure between operating 
expenditure and capital expenditure in each of these areas.
We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls 
relating to cost capitalisation at Antucoya, Los Pelambres and Centinela, and 
tested, on a sample basis, the appropriateness of costs capitalised with reference 
to supporting documentation including invoices and cash payments. We also 
physically verified a sample of additions in the year.
We verified that all projects classified as at the feasibility study stage had been 
approved in line with the Group’s internal governance processes. We also tested 
the appropriateness of cost capitalised for each significant project with reference 
to supporting documentation including invoices and cash payments.
104 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 The recognition and measurement of restoration and 
decommissioning provisions
Restoration and decommissioning provisions (of $433m) are calculated using a 
number of different assumptions, many of which require judgement, for example 
the required scope of work, projected costs, discount rates, exchange rates 
and inflation.
These estimates are subject to regular internal re-evaluation, with external experts 
engaged on a periodic basis. In 2014, external experts were engaged to advise on 
closure cost estimates at Los Pelambres, Centinela, Michilla and Antucoya. 
During the year, the net movement in decommissioning and restoration provisions 
was $60m (refer to note 27). The change in restoration estimates forms part of 
the overall $7m credit in the profit and loss account relating to provisions, with 
other movements reflecting foreign exchange movements and the unwind 
of discounting. 
The decrease in decommissioning provisions was $48m (refer to note 13  
and note 27).
We met with management’s external experts, JRI and Proust, providing closure 
cost estimates for the Group’s operations. We challenged their estimates on key 
forecast cash flow assumptions, including the future plans for decommissioning/
rehabilitation activity, future estimated costs, inflation rates, exchange rates, and 
also the discount rates applied to determine net present values. 
We evaluated the technical competence, experience, independence and objectivity 
of the external experts as required by auditing standards and we reviewed the 
updated base case data that was submitted by the Group to the Chilean National 
Geology and Mining Service along with the supporting evidence to confirm 
consistency with the closure cost estimates.
In addition we also:
 – audited the classification of closure provisions between decommissioning and 
rehabilitation; and assessed the appropriateness of the related accounting entries;
 – audited the computation of the discount unwind and amortisation of the 
decommissioning asset; and
 – reviewed the consistency of application of the closure provision policies and 
procedures throughout the Group.
RISK HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with 
the significant issues considered by the Audit and Risk Committee 
discussed on page 80.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion 
on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the 
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these 
individual matters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or 
influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be $75 million 
(2013 – $100 million), which is 4.8% (2013 – 4.8%) of pre-tax profit 
and 0.9% (2013 – 1.2%) of equity.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $1.25 million 
(2013 – $2 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing overall presentation of the financial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
As in the prior year, our Group audit scope focused primarily on 
the audit work at Los Pelambres, Michilla, Antucoya, Antofagasta 
Minerals, Ferrocaril Antofagasta a Bolivia, and Aguas de Antofagasta 
S.A., being the Group’s principal components. These were subject 
to a full audit at component materiality, which is lower than Group 
materiality, and represent over 99% of the Group’s profit before tax, 
all of the Group’s revenue and substantially all of the Group’s net 
assets. The range of materialities applied for the remaining principal 
components ranged between $2m and $71m. 
AT THE PARENT ENTITY LEVEL WE ALSO 
TESTED THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESS
The Group audit team followed a programme of planned visits that 
has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or a senior 
team member visits the component auditors in Chile at least three 
times a year. In addition, the Group audit team undertook site visits 
to operating assets in November 2014 and February 2015.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED 
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED 
TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited 
is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part 
of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
OUR DUTY TO READ OTHER INFORMATION IN 
THE ANNUAL REPORT 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual 
Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated 
to the Audit and Risk Committee which we consider should have 
been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS 
AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that 
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an Auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

110 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. For these purposes, IFRS comprise the standards issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) that have been endorsed by the 
European Union (“EU”).
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern 
basis. Details of the factors which have been taken into account in 
assessing the Group’s going concern status are set out within the 
Directors’ report.
During 2014 the Group merged Minera Esperanza and Minera El 
Tesoro into a single entity – Minera Centinela. The production of 
copper concentrate which was previously within Minera Esperanza 
is now referred to as Centinela Concentrates, and the production of 
copper cathodes which was previously within Minera El Tesoro is 
referred to as Centinela Cathodes. In the prior year comparatives the 
results and balances for Minera Esperanza and Minera El Tesoro have 
been combined into a single segment for Centinela, consistent with 
the current year presentation.
A reclassification between short-term and long-term inventories has 
been made in the prior year comparative figures, to ensure that the 
classification of inventory balances is fully in line with the detailed 
mine plans. This has resulted in a $74.4 million increase in the long-
term inventory balance as at 31 December 2013 from $178.3 million 
to $252.7 million, and a corresponding $74.4 million decrease in 
the short-term inventory balances as at 31 December 2013 from 
$476.5 million to $402.1 million.
A) ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations 
became effective in the current reporting period:
IFRIC 21 Levies
IAS 32 Financial instruments presentation
IFRS 10 and 12 and IAS 27 Investment entities
IAS 36 Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets
IAS 39 Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting
The application of these standards and interpretations effective for 
the first time in the current year has had no significant impact on the 
amounts reported in these financial statements. 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
B) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE APPLIED
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
– IFRS 9  Financial instruments 
– IFRS 14  Regulatory deferral accounts
– IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
– IFRS 11 (amendments) Accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations
– IAS 19 (amendments) Defined benefit plans, employee contributions
– IAS 16 and 38 (amendments) Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation
– IAS 16 and 41 (amendments) Bearer plants
– IAS 27 (amendments) Equity method in separate financial statements
– IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments)  Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or 
joint venture
– IFRS 10 and 12 and IAS 28 (amendments) Investment entities: applying the consolidation exception
– IAS 1 (amendments) Disclosure initiative
– Annual improvements 2010 – 2012 cycle Improvements to six IFRSs
– Annual improvements 2011 – 2013 cycle Improvements to four IFRSs
– Annual improvements 2012 – 2014 cycle Improvements to four IFRSs
The Group is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting these new standards and interpretations. 
The Group is continuing to evaluate in detail the potential impact of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, but does not currently 
expect this to have a material impact.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW
Antofagasta plc | 111
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES
A) ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
These financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention 
as modified by the use of fair values to 
measure certain financial instruments, 
principally provisionally priced sales as 
explained in Note 2(f) and financial derivative 
contracts as explained in Note 2(y).
B) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The financial statements comprise the 
consolidated financial statements of 
Antofagasta plc (“the Company”) and its 
subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”).
(i)  Su b s i d ia ri e s – A subsidiary is an entity 
over which the Group has power to govern 
the operating and financial policies in 
order to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The consolidated financial statements 
include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, 
expenses and cash flows of the Company 
and its subsidiaries after eliminating 
inter-company balances and transactions. 
For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net 
assets and net earnings attributable 
to non-controlling shareholders are 
presented as “Non-controlling interests” 
in the consolidated balance sheet and 
consolidated income statement.
Non-controlling interests that are present 
ownership interests and entitle their holders 
to a proportionate share of the entity’s net 
assets in the event of liquidation may be 
initially measured either at fair value or at 
the non-controlling interests’ proportionate 
share of the recognised amounts of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice 
of measurement basis is made on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other types 
of non-controlling interests are measured at 
fair value or, when applicable, on the basis 
specified in another IFRS. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-
controlling interests is the amount of those 
interests at initial recognition plus the non-
controlling interests’ share of subsequent 
changes in equity. Total comprehensive 
income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests 
in subsidiaries that do not result in the 
Group losing control over the subsidiaries 
are accounted for as equity transactions. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests 
and the non-controlling interests are adjusted 
to reflect the changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference 
between the amount by which the non-
controlling interests are adjusted and the fair 
value of the consideration paid or received is 
recognised directly in equity and attributed to 
owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, 
a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
and is calculated as the difference between 
(i) the aggregate of the fair value of the 
consideration received and the fair value of 
any retained interest and (ii) the previous 
carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and 
any non-controlling interests. When assets of 
the subsidiary are carried at revalued amounts 
or fair values and the related cumulative 
gain or loss has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity, the amounts previously recognised 
in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity are accounted for as 
if the Group had directly disposed of the 
relevant assets (ie reclassified to profit or loss 
or transferred directly to retained earnings as 
specified by applicable IFRSs). The fair value 
of any investment retained in the former 
subsidiary at the date when control is lost is 
regarded as the fair value on initial recognition 
for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement or, when applicable, the cost 
on initial recognition of an investment in an 
associate or a jointly controlled entity.
Acquisitions and disposals are treated as 
explained in Note 2(g) relating to business 
combinations and goodwill.
C) INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES
An associate is an entity over which the 
Group is in a position to exercise significant 
influence, but not control or joint control, 
through the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions 
of that entity. The results and assets and 
liabilities of associates are incorporated in 
these consolidated financial statements 
using the equity method of accounting. 
This requires recording the investment initially 
at cost to the Group and then, in subsequent 
periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the 
investment to reflect the Group’s share of 
the associate’s results less any impairment 
and any other changes to the associate’s 
net assets such as dividends. When the 
Group loses control of a former subsidiary 
but retains an investment in associate in 
that entity the initial carrying value of the 
investment in associate is recorded at its 
fair value at that point. When the Group’s 
share of losses of an associate exceeds the 
Group’s interest in that associate the Group 
discontinues recognising its share of further 
losses. Additional losses are recognised only 
to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments 
on behalf of the associate.
D) JOINT ARRANGEMENTS
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of 
which two or more parties have joint control. 
Joint arrangements are accounted depending 
on the nature of the arrangement.
i) Joint ventures – are accounted for using 
equity method in accordance with 
IAS 28(2011) Investment in Associates and 
Joint Ventures as described in Note 2(c).
ii) Joint operations – are accounted 
for recognising directly the assets, 
obligations, revenues and expenses of 
the joint operator in the joint arrangement. 
The assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses are accounted for in accordance 
with the relevant IFRS. 
When a Group entity transacts with its 
joint arrangements, profits and losses 
resulting from the transactions with the joint 
arrangements are recognised in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements only to the 
extent of interests in the joint arrangements 
that are not related to the Group.
E) CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency for each entity in the 
Group is determined as the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which it 
operates. Transactions in currencies other 
than the functional currency of the entity are 
translated at the exchange rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in currencies other 
than the functional currency are retranslated 
at year end exchange rates. Gains and losses 
on retranslation are included in net profit or 
loss for the period within other finance items.
The presentational currency of the Group 
and the functional currency of the Company 
is the US dollar. On consolidation, income 
statement items for entities with a functional 
currency other than the US dollar are 
translated into US dollars at average rates 
of exchange. Balance sheet items are 
translated at period-end exchange rates. 
Exchange differences on translation of the net 
assets of such entities are taken to equity and 
recorded in a separate currency translation 
reserve. Cumulative translation differences 
arising after the transition date to IFRS are 
recognised as income or as expenses in the 
income statement in the period in which an 
operation is disposed of.
On consolidation, exchange gains and losses 
which arise on balances between Group 
entities are taken to reserves where that 
balance is, in substance, part of the net 
investment in a foreign operation, ie where 
settlement is neither planned nor likely to 
occur in the foreseeable future. All other 
exchange gains and losses on Group balances 
are dealt with in the income statement.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
112 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Fair value adjustments and any goodwill 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets of the foreign entity and 
translated at the period-end rate.
F) REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue represents the value of goods and 
services supplied to third parties during the 
year. Revenue is measured at the fair value 
of consideration received or receivable, and 
excludes any applicable sales tax.
A sale is recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have passed. 
This is generally when title and any insurance 
risk has passed to the customer, and the 
goods have been delivered to a contractually 
agreed location or when any services have 
been provided.
Revenue from mining activities is recorded 
at the invoiced amounts with an adjustment 
for provisional pricing at each reporting 
date, as explained below. For copper and 
molybdenum concentrates, which are 
sold to smelters and roasting plants for 
further processing, the invoiced amount is 
the market value of the metal payable by 
the customer, net of deductions for tolling 
charges. Revenue includes amounts from the 
sale of by-products.
Copper and molybdenum concentrate 
sale agreements and copper cathode sale 
agreements generally provide for provisional 
pricing of sales at the time of shipment, 
with final pricing based on the monthly 
average London Metal Exchange (“LME”) 
copper price or the monthly average 
market molybdenum price for specified 
future periods. This normally ranges from 
one to five months after delivery to the 
customer. Such a provisional sale contains an 
embedded derivative which is required to be 
separated from the host contract. The host 
contract is the sale of metals contained in 
the concentrate or cathode at the provisional 
invoice price less tolling charges deducted, 
and the embedded derivative is the forward 
contract for which the provisional sale is 
subsequently adjusted. At each reporting 
date, the provisionally priced metal sales 
together with any related tolling charges are 
marked-to-market, with adjustments (both 
gains and losses) being recorded in revenue 
in the consolidated income statement 
and in trade debtors in the balance sheet. 
Forward prices at the period end are used 
for copper concentrate and cathode sales, 
while period-end average prices are used for 
molybdenum concentrate sales due to the 
absence of a futures market.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, 
by reference to the principal outstanding and 
the effective interest rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount.
Dividend income from available-for-sale 
investments and associates is recognised 
when the shareholders’ right to receive 
payment has been established.
G) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
AND GOODWILL
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. 
The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value, which 
is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-
date fair values of the assets transferred by 
the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group 
to the former owners of the acquiree and 
the equity interests issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
The results of businesses acquired during 
the year are brought into the consolidated 
financial statements from the effective 
date of acquisition. The identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
business which can be measured reliably are 
recorded at their provisional fair values at the 
date of acquisition. Provisional fair values are 
finalised within 12 months of the acquisition 
date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed 
as incurred.
When the consideration transferred by 
the Group in a business combination 
includes assets or liabilities resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement, the 
contingent consideration is measured at 
its acquisition-date fair value and included 
as part of the consideration transferred in 
a business combination. Changes in the 
fair value of the contingent consideration 
that qualify as measurement period 
adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, 
with corresponding adjustments 
against goodwill. Measurement period 
adjustments are adjustments that arise from 
additional information obtained during the 
“measurement period” (which cannot exceed 
one year from the acquisition date) about 
facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in 
the fair value of the contingent consideration 
that do not qualify as “measurement 
period” adjustments depends on how 
the contingent consideration is classified. 
Contingent consideration that is classified 
as equity is not remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Contingent consideration that is classified 
as an asset or a liability is remeasured at 
subsequent reporting dates in accordance 
with IAS 39, or IAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, 
as appropriate.
When a business combination is achieved 
in stages, the Group’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair 
value at the acquisition date (ie the date when 
the Group obtains control) and the resulting 
gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or 
loss. Amounts arising from interests in the 
acquiree prior to the acquisition date that 
have previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to 
profit or loss where such treatment would be 
appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business 
combination is incomplete by the end of the 
reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional 
amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional 
amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see above), or 
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, 
to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have 
affected the amounts recognised at that date.
Goodwill arising in a business combination 
is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and 
the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held 
equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the 
next identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. Any goodwill on the acquisition 
of subsidiaries is separately disclosed, while 
any goodwill on the acquisition of associates 
is included within investments in equity 
accounted entities. Internally generated 
goodwill is not recognised. Where the fair 
values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
exceed the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the surplus is credited to the 
profit or loss in the period of acquisition as a 
bargain purchase gain.
The Group often enters into earn-in 
arrangements whereby the Group 
acquires an interest in a project company 
in exchange for funding exploration and 
evaluation expenditure up to a specified 
level of expenditure or a specified stage 
in the life of the project. Funding is usually 
conditional on the achievement of key 
milestones by the partner. Typically there 
is no consideration transferred or funding 
liability on the effective date of acquisition 
of the interest in the project company and 
no goodwill is recognised on this type of 
business combination.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW
Antofagasta plc | 113
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES CONTINUED
The results of businesses sold during the 
year are included in the consolidated financial 
statements for the period up to the effective 
date of disposal. Gains or losses on disposal 
are calculated as the difference between 
the sales’ proceeds (net of expenses) and 
the net assets attributable to the interest 
which has been sold. Where a disposal 
represents a separate major line of business 
or geographical area of operations, the net 
results attributable to the disposed entity are 
shown separately in the income statement.
H) EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION 
EXPENDITURE
Exploration and evaluation costs, other 
than those incurred in acquiring exploration 
licences, are expensed in the year in which 
they are incurred. When a mining project 
is considered to be commercially viable 
(normally when the project has completed 
a pre-feasibility study, and the start of a 
feasibility study has been approved) all 
further directly attributable pre-production 
expenditure is capitalised. Capitalisation of 
pre-production expenditure ceases when 
commercial levels of production are achieved. 
Costs incurred in acquiring exploration 
licences are accounted for as intangible 
assets in accordance with the policy 
in Note 2(j) and are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation.
I) STRIPPING COSTS
Pre-stripping and operational stripping costs 
are incurred in the course of the development 
and operation of open-pit mining operations.
Pre-stripping costs relate to the removal 
of waste material as part of the initial 
development of an open-pit, in order to 
allow access to the ore body. These costs 
are capitalised within mining properties 
within property, plant and equipment. 
The capitalised costs are depreciated 
once production commences on a unit of 
production basis, in proportion to the volume 
of ore extracted in the year compared with 
total proven and probable reserves for that pit 
at the beginning of the year.
Operational stripping costs relate to the 
costs of extracting waste material as part of 
the ongoing mining process. The ongoing 
mining and development of the Group’s 
open-pit mines is generally performed via a 
succession of individual phases. The costs 
of extracting material from an open-pit mine 
are generally allocated between ore and 
waste stripping in proportion to the tonnes 
of material extracted. The waste stripping 
costs are generally absorbed into inventory 
and expensed as that inventory is processed 
and sold. Where the stripping costs relate 
to a significant stripping campaign which 
is expected to provide improved access to 
an identifiable component of the ore body 
(typically an individual phase within the 
overall mine plan), the costs of removing 
waste in order to improve access to that 
part of the ore body will be capitalised within 
mining properties within property, plant and 
equipment. The capitalised costs will then 
be amortised on a unit of production basis, 
in proportion to the volume of ore extracted 
compared with the total ore contained in the 
component of the pit to which the stripping 
campaign relates.
J) INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that 
are acquired separately are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Intangible assets include 
the cost of acquiring exploration licences. 
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
The estimated useful life and amortisation 
method are reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for 
on a prospective basis. Intangible assets 
with indefinite useful lives that are acquired 
separately are carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Infrastructure assets relating to the Water 
concession are recorded within intangible 
assets, as part of concession rights. 
Concession rights also include an amount 
recognised in respect of the right to use 
those assets not recognised as their lives 
extend substantially beyond the period of the 
concession. Concession rights are measured 
as the difference between the cost of the 
concession and the fair values of the assets 
and liabilities recognised on acquisition plus 
the fair value of any further assets transferred 
to the Group by way of concession 
subsequent to acquisition.
Intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination and recognised separately 
from goodwill are initially recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date (which is 
regarded as their cost).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible 
assets acquired in a business combination 
are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses, on the same basis as intangible assets 
that are acquired separately.
An intangible asset is derecognised on 
disposal, or when no future economic 
benefits are expected from use or disposal. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition 
of an intangible asset, measured as the 
difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset, are recognised in profit or loss when 
the asset is derecognised.
K) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The costs of mining properties and leases, 
which include the costs of acquiring and 
developing mining properties and mineral 
rights, are capitalised as property, plant and 
equipment in the year in which they are 
incurred, when a mining project is considered 
to be commercially viable (normally when 
the project has completed a pre-feasibility 
study, and the start of a feasibility study has 
been approved). The cost of property, plant 
and equipment comprises the purchase 
price and any costs directly attributable 
to bringing the asset to the location and 
condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended. 
Once a project has been established as 
commercially viable, related development 
expenditure is capitalised. This includes 
costs incurred in preparing the site for mining 
operations, including pre-stripping costs. 
Capitalisation ceases when the mine is 
capable of commercial production, with the 
exception of development costs which give 
rise to a future benefit.
Interest on borrowings related to construction 
or development of projects is capitalised, 
until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale which, in 
the case of mining properties, is when they 
are capable of commercial production.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
114 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 L) DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT 
AND EQUIPMENT AND AMORTISATION 
OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated 
over its useful life, or over the remaining life 
of the operation if shorter, to residual value. 
The major categories of property, plant and 
equipment are depreciated as follows:
(i)  Land – freehold land is not depreciated 
unless the value of the land is considered 
to relate directly to a particular mining 
operation, in which case the land is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
the expected mine life. Any leasehold 
land is depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the life of the lease.
(ii)  Mining properties – mining properties, 
including capitalised financing costs, 
are depreciated on a unit of production 
basis, in proportion to the volume of ore 
extracted in the year compared with 
total proven and probable reserves at the 
beginning of the year.
(iii)  Buildings and infrastructure – straight-
line basis over 10 to 25 years.
(iv)  Railway track (including trackside 
equipment) – straight-line basis over 20 
to 25 years.
(v)  Wagons and rolling stock – straight-line 
basis over 10 to 20 years.
(vi)  Machinery, equipment and other 
assets – are depreciated on a unit of 
production basis, in proportion to the 
volume of ore/material processed or 
straight-line basis over 5 to 20 years.
(vii)  Assets under construction – no 
depreciation until asset is available 
for use.
(viii)  Assets held under finance lease – are 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term and their useful life.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at least annually, 
and changes to residual values and useful 
lives are accounted for prospectively.
The concession right is amortised on 
a straight-line basis over the life of the 
concession, or the useful life of any 
component part if less.
M) IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT 
AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE 
ASSETS (EXCLUDING GOODWILL)
Property, plant and equipment and finite life 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment 
if there is any indication that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment (if any). 
Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, 
the Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. Any intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment 
annually and whenever there is an indication 
that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value, using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which estimates of future 
cash flows have not been adjusted.
For mining properties, estimates of future 
cash flows are based on assumptions as 
to expected production levels, commodity 
prices, cash costs of production and capital 
expenditure. IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” 
includes a number of restrictions on the future 
cash flows that can be recognised in respect 
of future restructurings and improvement-
related expenditure. When calculating value 
in use, it also requires that calculations should 
be based on exchange rates current at the 
time of assessment. For operations with a 
functional currency other than the US dollar, 
the impairment review is conducted in the 
relevant functional currency.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or 
cash-generating unit is estimated to be 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount is reduced to the recoverable 
amount. An impairment charge is recognised 
in the income statement immediately. 
Where an impairment subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount is increased 
to the revised estimate of recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying value 
that would have been determined if no 
impairment had previously been recognised. 
A reversal is recognised in the income 
statement immediately.
N) INVESTMENT PROPERTY
Investment property is property held to 
earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation 
and includes land held for a currently 
undetermined future use. The Group has 
elected to adopt the cost model in IAS 
40 “Investment Property”. Accordingly, 
investment property is measured initially at 
cost, which includes transaction costs for the 
acquisition of the property and, as detailed 
in Note 2(l) relating to property, plant and 
equipment, is not depreciated.
O) INVENTORY
Inventory consists of raw materials and 
consumables, work-in-progress and finished 
goods. Work-in-progress represents material 
that is in the process of being converted into 
finished goods. The conversion process for 
mining operations depends on the nature of 
the copper ore. For sulphide ores, processing 
includes milling and concentrating and results 
in the production of copper concentrate. 
For oxide ores, processing includes leaching 
of stockpiles, solution extraction and 
electrowinning and results in the production 
of copper cathodes. Finished goods consist 
of copper concentrate containing gold and 
silver at Los Pelambres and Centinela and 
copper cathodes at Centinela and Michilla. 
Los Pelambres also produces molybdenum 
as a by-product.
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost, on 
a weighted average basis, and net realisable 
value. Net realisable value represents 
estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred 
in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress 
is production cost and for raw materials 
and consumables it is purchase price. 
Production cost includes:
 – labour costs, raw material costs and other 
costs directly attributable to the extraction 
and processing of ore;
 – depreciation of plant, equipment and 
mining properties directly involved in the 
production process; and
 – an appropriate portion 
of production overheads.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION OVERVIEW
Antofagasta plc | 115
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES CONTINUED
Stockpiles represent ore that is extracted 
and is available for further processing. 
Costs directly attributable to the extraction 
of ore are generally allocated as part of 
production cost in proportion to the tonnes 
of material extracted. Operational stripping 
costs are generally absorbed into inventory, 
and therefore expensed as that inventory 
is processed and sold. If ore will not be 
processed within 12 months of the statement 
of financial position date it is included within 
non-current assets. If there is significant 
uncertainty as to when any stockpiled ore will 
be processed it is expensed as incurred.
P) TAXATION
Tax expense comprises the charges or credits 
for the period relating to both current and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit may differ from net profit 
as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable and deductible in different years 
and also excludes items that are not taxable 
or deductible. The liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates for each entity in 
the consolidated financial statements which 
have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable 
or recoverable on temporary differences (ie 
differences between the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax basis 
used in the computation of taxable profit). 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method and is provided 
on all temporary differences with certain 
limited exceptions as follows:
(i)  tax payable on undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 
is provided except where the Group is 
able to control the remittance of profits 
and it is probable that there will be no 
remittance of past profits earned in the 
foreseeable future;
(ii)  deferred tax is not provided on the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction that does not affect 
accounting profit or taxable profit and 
is not a business combination; nor is 
deferred tax provided on subsequent 
changes in the carrying value of such 
assets and liabilities, for example where 
they are depreciated; and
(iii)  the initial recognition of any goodwill.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that they will be 
recovered through sufficient future taxable 
profit. The carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also taken 
directly to equity.
Q) PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the 
best estimate of the consideration required to 
settle the present obligation at the end of the 
reporting period, taking into account the risks 
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. 
When a provision is measured using the 
cash flows estimated to settle the present 
obligation, its carrying amount is the present 
value of those cash flows (when the effect of 
the time value of money is material).
When some or all of the economic benefits 
required to settle a provision are expected to 
be recovered from a third party, a receivable 
is recognised as an asset if it is virtually 
certain that reimbursement will be received 
and the amount of the receivable can be 
measured reliably.
R) PROVISIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING 
AND RESTORATION COSTS
An obligation to incur decommissioning and 
restoration costs occurs when environmental 
disturbance is caused by the development 
or ongoing production of a mining property. 
Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal 
closure plan and are subject to regular 
formal review.
Such costs arising from the installation 
of plant and other site preparation work, 
discounted to their net present value, are 
provided and capitalised at the start of each 
project, as soon as the obligation to incur 
such costs arises. These decommissioning 
costs are charged against profits over the life 
of the mine, through depreciation of the asset 
and unwinding or amortisation of the discount 
on the provision. Depreciation is included 
in operating costs while the unwinding of 
the discount is included as financing costs. 
Changes in the measurement of a liability 
relating to the decommissioning of plant or 
other site preparation work are added to, or 
deducted from, the cost of the related asset 
in the current year.
The costs for restoration of site damage, 
which is created on an ongoing basis during 
production, are provided for at their net 
present values and charged against operating 
profits as extraction progresses. Changes in 
the measurement of a liability relating to site 
damage created during production is charged 
against operating profit.
S) PROVISION FOR TERMINATION 
OF WATER CONCESSION
Under the terms of the Water concession 
from ECONSSA, certain items of working 
capital recognised by Aguas de Antofagasta 
are to be transferred to the state-owned 
operator ECONSSA at the end of the 
concession period for nil consideration. 
Provision is made for the estimated net 
present value of these assets and liabilities 
which are expected to be in existence 
when the concession comes to an end. 
The unwinding of the discount is charged 
within financing costs.
T) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
For cash-settled share-based payments, 
a liability is recognised for the goods or 
services acquired, measured initially at the 
fair value of the liability. At the end of each 
reporting period until the liability is settled, 
and at the date of settlement, the fair value of 
the liability is remeasured, with any changes 
in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the 
year. The Group currently does not have any 
equity share-based payments to employees 
or third parties.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
116 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 U) POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates defined contribution 
schemes for a limited number of employees. 
For such schemes, the amount charged to 
the income statement is the contributions 
paid or payable in the year.
Employment terms may also provide for 
payment of a severance indemnity when 
an employment contract comes to an end. 
This is typically at the rate of one month 
for each year of service (subject in most 
cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying 
years of service) and based on final salary 
level. The severance indemnity obligation is 
treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, 
and the calculation is based on valuations 
performed by an independent actuary using 
the projected unit credit method, which are 
regularly updated. The obligation recognised 
in the balance sheet represents the present 
value of the severance indemnity obligation. 
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
V) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on 
hand, deposits held on call with banks, highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible 
into known amounts of cash and which 
are subject to insignificant risk of changes 
in value, net of bank overdrafts which are 
repayable on demand. Cash and cash 
equivalents normally have a maturity period 
of 90 days or less.
W) LIQUID INVESTMENTS
Liquid investments represent highly liquid 
current asset investments that do not 
meet the IAS 7 definition of cash and cash 
equivalents, normally because even if readily 
accessible, the underlying investments have 
an average maturity profile greater than 
90 days from the date first entered into. 
These assets are designated as fair value 
through profit or loss.
X) LEASES
Rental costs under operating leases are 
charged to the income statement account 
in equal annual amounts over the term 
of the lease.
Assets under finance leases are recognised 
as assets of the Group at inception of the 
lease at the lower of fair value or the present 
value of the minimum lease payments 
derived by discounting at the interest rate 
implicit in the lease. The interest element 
is charged within financing costs so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability.
Y) OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised on the Group’s balance sheet 
when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
(i)  Investments – Investments which 
are not subsidiaries, associates or joint 
ventures are initially measured at cost, 
including transaction costs.
  Investments are classified as either 
held for trading or available-for-sale, and 
are normally measured at subsequent 
reporting dates at fair value. Fair value 
is determined in the manner described 
in Note 23(b). Investments in equity 
instruments that do not have a quoted 
market price in an active market and 
whose fair value cannot be reliably 
measured are measured at cost. 
Securities are classified as “held-
for-trading” when they are acquired 
principally for the purpose of sale in 
the short term, and gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are 
included in profit or loss for the period. 
Other investments are classified as 
“available-for-sale”, and gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity, within the 
“Fair value reserve”, until the security 
is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, at which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in 
equity is included in profit or loss for the 
period. Dividends on available-for-sale 
equity investments are recognised in 
the income statement when the right to 
receive payment is established.
(ii)  Trade and other receivables – Trade 
and other receivables do not generally 
carry any interest and are normally 
stated at their nominal value less any 
impairment. Impairment losses on trade 
receivables are recognised within an 
allowance account unless the Group 
considers that no recovery of the amount 
is possible, in which case the carrying 
value of the asset is reduced directly.
(iii)  Trade and other payables – Trade and 
other payables are generally not interest-
bearing and are normally stated at their 
nominal value.
(iv)  Borrowings (loans and preference 
shares) – Interest-bearing loans and 
bank overdrafts are initially recorded 
at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. They are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield 
basis. The effective interest method is 
a method of calculating the amortised 
cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. 
The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis 
using the effective interest rate method. 
Amounts are either recorded as financing 
costs in profit or loss or capitalised in 
accordance with the accounting policy 
set out in Note 2(k). Finance charges 
are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise. 
  The sterling-denominated preference 
shares issued by the Company carry 
a fixed rate of return without the 
right to participate in any surplus. 
They are accordingly classified within 
borrowings and translated into US 
dollars at period-end rates of exchange. 
Preference share dividends are included 
within finance costs.
(v)  Equity instruments – Equity instruments 
issued are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. 
Equity instruments of the Company 
comprise its sterling-denominated issued 
ordinary share capital and related share 
premium. As explained in Note 2(e), the 
presentational currency of the Group and 
the functional currency of the Company 
is US dollars, and ordinary share capital 
and share premium are translated into 
US dollars at historical rates of exchange 
based on dates of issue.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES CONTINUED
(vi)  Derivative financial instruments – 
As explained in Note 23(d), the Group 
uses derivative financial instruments to 
reduce exposure to foreign exchange, 
interest rate and commodity price 
movements. The Group does not use 
such derivative instruments for trading 
purposes. The Group has applied the 
hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 
“Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement”. The effective portion 
of changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments that are designated 
and qualify as hedges of future cash 
flows have been recognised directly in 
equity, with such amounts subsequently 
recognised in profit or loss in the 
period when the hedged item affects 
profit or loss. Any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Realised gains and losses on commodity 
derivatives recognised in profit or loss 
are recorded within revenue. The time 
value element of changes in the fair value 
of derivative options is excluded from 
the designated hedging relationship, 
and is therefore recognised directly in 
profit or loss within other finance items. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial 
instruments or other host contracts are 
treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of host contracts and the 
host contracts are not carried at fair value. 
Changes in fair value are reported in profit 
or loss for the period. The treatment 
of embedded derivatives arising from 
provisionally-priced commodity sales 
contracts is set out in further detail in 
Note 2(f) relating to revenue.
(vii)  Impairment of financial assets – 
Financial assets, other than those at fair 
value through profit or loss, are assessed 
for indicators of impairment at each 
balance sheet date. Financial assets 
are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that as a result of one or 
more events that occurred after the 
initial recognition of the financial asset 
the estimated future cash flows of 
the investment have been impacted. 
For loans and receivables the amount of 
the impairment is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying value and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. Any impairment loss is 
recognised in profit or loss immediately.
 
 The carrying amount of the financial asset 
is reduced by the impairment loss directly 
for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables.
With the exception of available-for-sale equity 
instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the 
amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively 
to an event occurring after the impairment 
was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through profit 
or loss immediately to the extent that the 
carrying amount of the investment at the 
date the impairment is reversed does not 
exceed what the amortised cost would 
have been had the impairment not been 
recognised. In respect of available-for-sale 
equity instruments, any increase in fair 
value subsequent to an impairment loss 
is recognised directly in equity.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING 
JUDGEMENTS AND KEY 
SOURCES OF ESTIMATION 
UNCERTAINTY
Determining many of the amounts included 
in the financial statements involves the 
use of judgement and/or estimation. 
These judgements and estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the 
relevant facts and circumstances having 
regard to prior experience, but actual results 
may differ from the amounts included in the 
financial statements. Information about such 
judgements and estimates is included in the 
principal accounting policies in Note 2 or the 
other notes to the financial statements, and 
the key areas are set out below.
A) CAPITALISATION OF PROPERTY, 
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OF 
PROJECT COSTS
As explained in Note 2(k) the costs of 
developing mining properties are capitalised 
as property, plant and equipment in the year 
in which they are incurred, when the mining 
project is considered to be commercially 
viable. Management reviews amounts 
capitalised to ensure that the treatment 
of that expenditure as capital rather than 
operating expenditure is reasonable, in 
particular in respect of the commercial 
viability of the project. Commercial viability 
is normally considered to be demonstrable 
when the project has completed a pre-
feasibility study, and the start of a feasibility 
study has been approved.
B) USEFUL ECONOMIC LIVES OF 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
AND ORE RESERVES ESTIMATES
As explained in Note 2(l), mining properties, 
including capitalised financing costs, are 
depreciated in proportion to the volume 
of ore extracted in the year compared with 
total proven and probable reserves at the 
beginning of the year.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent 
in estimating ore reserves, and assumptions 
that were valid at the time of estimation may 
change when new information becomes 
available. These include assumptions as to 
grade estimates and cut-off grades, recovery 
rates, commodity prices, exchange rates, 
production costs, capital costs, processing 
and reclamation costs and discount rates. 
The actual volume of ore extracted and 
any changes in these assumptions could 
affect prospective depreciation rates and 
carrying values.
The majority of other items of property, plant 
and equipment are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over their useful economic lives. 
Management reviews the appropriateness 
of useful economic lives at least annually and, 
again, any changes could affect prospective 
depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
C) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
As explained in Note 2(m), the Group reviews 
the carrying value of its intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment to determine 
whether there is any indication that those 
assets are impaired. In making assessments 
for impairment, assets that do not generate 
independent cash flows are allocated to an 
appropriate cash-generating unit (“CGU”). 
The recoverable amount of those assets, 
or CGU, is measured at the higher of their 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Management necessarily applies its 
judgement in allocating assets to CGUs, 
in estimating the probability, timing and value 
of underlying cash flows and in selecting 
appropriate discount rates to be applied 
within the value in use calculation. The key 
assumptions are set out in Note 2(m). 
Subsequent changes to CGU allocation, 
licensing status, reserves and resources, 
price assumptions or other estimates and 
assumptions in the value in use calculation 
could impact the carrying value of the 
respective assets.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
118 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 Development of the Antucoya project was 
temporarily suspended in December 2012 
while a review of the project was undertaken. 
An impairment review was performed in 
respect of the project as at 31 December 
2012, and as a consequence an impairment 
of $500 million was recognised in respect of 
the project’s assets at that date. An updated 
review of the carrying value of the project’s 
assets was performed during 2014, which 
indicated that no further impairment or 
reversal of the earlier impairment was 
appropriate. The recoverable amount in 
the impairment review was determined by 
a value in use calculation prepared using 
management’s forecasts as to capital 
expenditure, future commodity prices, 
operating costs and production volumes. 
Changes in these forecasts could have a 
significant positive or negative impact on the 
estimated recoverable amount. The present 
value of the forecast future cash flows was 
calculated using a post-tax real discount rate 
of 8.0%.
D) PROVISIONS FOR 
DECOMMISSIONING AND SITE 
RESTORATION COSTS
As explained in Note 2(r), provision is 
made, based on net present values, for 
decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs 
as soon as the obligation arises following 
the development or ongoing production 
of a mining property. The provision is 
based on a closure plan prepared with 
the assistance of external consultants.
Management uses its judgement and 
experience to provide for and (in the case of 
capitalised decommissioning costs) amortise 
these estimated costs over the life of the 
mine. The ultimate cost of decommissioning 
and site rehabilitation is uncertain and cost 
estimates can vary in response to many 
factors including changes to relevant legal 
requirements, the emergence of new 
restoration techniques or experience at other 
mine sites.
The expected timing and extent of 
expenditure can also change, for example 
in response to changes in ore reserves or 
processing levels. As a result, there could 
be significant adjustments to the provisions 
established which would affect future 
financial results.
E) DEFERRED TAXATION
As explained in Note 2(p), deferred tax 
is not provided for future tax payable on 
undistributed earnings where the Group is 
able to control the remittance of profits and it 
is probable that there will be no remittance of 
past profits earned in the foreseeable future.
Management uses its judgement 
in estimating the probability of such 
remittances. These are based on Group 
forecasts and include assumptions as to 
future profits and cash flows (which depend 
on several factors including commodity 
prices, operating costs, production levels, 
capital expenditures, interest costs, 
debt repayment and tax rates) and cash 
requirements (which may also depend on 
several factors including future dividend 
levels). A change in the assumptions used 
or in the estimate as to the probability 
that past profits will be remitted would 
impact the deferred tax charge and balance 
sheet provision.
4 SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group’s reportable segments are 
as follows:
 – Los Pelambres
 – Centinela
 – Michilla
 – Antucoya
 – Exploration and evaluation
 – Railway and other transport services
 – Water concession
 – Corporate and other items
For management purposes, the Group is 
organised into three business divisions 
based on their products – Mining, Railway 
and other transport services and the 
Water concession. The mining division 
is split further for management reporting 
purposes to show results by mine and 
exploration activity. Los Pelambres, 
Centinela and Michilla are all operating mines 
and Antucoya is a development project. 
Los Pelambres produces primarily copper 
concentrate and molybdenum as a by-
product. Centinela produces primarily copper 
concentrate containing gold as a by-product 
and copper cathodes. Michilla produces 
copper cathodes. The transport division 
provides rail cargo (based in Chile and Bolivia) 
and road cargo (based in Chile) together with 
a number of ancillary services (based in Chile). 
The water division produces and distributes 
potable water to domestic customers and 
untreated water to industrial customers in 
Chile’s Antofagasta Region. The Exploration 
and evaluation segment incurs exploration 
and evaluation expenses. “Corporate and 
other items” comprises costs incurred by 
the Company, Antofagasta Minerals, the 
Group’s mining corporate centre and other 
entities that are not allocated to any individual 
business segment. Consistent with its 
internal management reporting, the Group’s 
corporate and other items are included within 
the mining division.
Management monitors the operating results 
of business segments separately for the 
purpose of making decisions about resources 
to be allocated and of assessing performance. 
Segment performance is evaluated based on 
the operating profit of each of the segments.

NOTES TO SEGMENT REVENUES AND RESULTS
(i)  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. Operating profit excludes the share 
of net loss from associates and joint venture of $4.1 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – net loss of $14.4 million). 
(ii)  Inter-segment revenues are eliminated on consolidation. Revenue from the Railway and other transport services is stated after eliminating 
inter-segmental sales to the mining division of $0.4 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – $2.1 million). Revenue from the Water concession 
is stated after eliminating inter-segmental sales to the mining division of $7.3 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – $7.2 million) and after 
eliminating sales to the Railway and other transport services of $0.2 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – $0.2 million). 
(iii)  Revenue includes the effect of both final pricing and mark-to-market adjustments to provisionally priced sales of copper and molybdenum 
concentrates and copper cathodes. Further details of such adjustments are given in Note 5.
(iv)  Revenue includes a realised gain at Michilla of $18.3 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – gain of $25.2 million) and a realised gain 
at Centinela of $0.1 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – gain of $0.2 million) relating to commodity derivatives. Further details of such 
gains or losses are given in Note 23(d).
(v)  The copper and molybdenum concentrate sales are stated net of deductions for tolling charges. Tolling charges for copper and molybdenum 
concentrates are detailed in Note 5.
(vii)  The effects of tax and non-controlling interests on the expenses within the Exploration and evaluation segment are allocated to the mine that 
the exploration work relates to.
(viii)  The assets of the Railway and transport services segment includes $78.3 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – $91.9 million) relating 
to the Group’s 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos S.A. (“Inversiones Hornitos”), which owns the 165MW Hornitos thermoelectric power 
plant in Mejillones in Chile’s Antofagasta Region and $8.8 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – $6.7 million) relating to the Group’s 30% 
interest in Antofagasta Terminal International S.A. (“ATI”), which operates a concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta. 
The assets of the Corporate and other items segment includes $24.5 million (year ended 31 December 2013 – $24.4 million) relating to the 
Group’s 30% interest in Parque Eólico El Arrayán S.A., an energy company which operates a wind farm in Chile, $11.2 million (year ended 
31 December 2013 – $1.1 million) relating to the Group’s 50.1% interest in the Energia Andina joint venture and a negative investment of 
$0.4 million relating to the Group’s 50% interest in the Tethyan Copper joint venture. The assets of Los Pelambres includes $8.3 million 
(year ended 31 December 2013 – $51.9 million) relating to the Group’s 40% interest in Alto Maipo SpA which is constructing a hydroelectric 
project in Chile. Further details of these investments are set out in Note 16.
(ix)  As explained in Note 16, the Group holds a 40% interest in Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”), which until July 2014 was 
accounted for as a subsidiary as the Group exercised control over the company. In July 2014 the Group lost its ability to control Twin 
Metals and accordingly the company ceased to be a subsidiary of the Group, and has been accounted for as an associate from that point. 
This disposal of the investment in subsidiary and the recognition of an interest in an associate at fair value resulted in a gain of $28.6 million 
(shown above within “Gains on disposals” within the “Corporate and other items” segment). An impairment charge of $26.3 million has 
been recognised in respect of Duluth shares as set out in Note 8.

Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales 
at the time of shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly average 
molybdenum price for specified future periods. This normally ranges from one to five months after shipment to the customer. The provisional 
pricing mechanism within the sale agreements is an embedded derivative under IFRS. Gains and losses from the marking-to-market of open 
sales are recognised through adjustments to revenue in the income statement and to trade debtors in the balance sheet. The Group determines 
mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end month average prices 
for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market in the market price references for that commodity in the majority of 
the Group’s contracts.
In addition to mark-to-market and final pricing adjustments, revenue also includes realised gains and losses relating to derivative commodity 
instruments. Details of these realised gains or losses are shown in the tables below. Further details of derivative commodity instruments in place 
at the period end are given in Note 23.

At 31 December 2014 an expense of $27.4 million relating to net interest expense and other finance items at Antucoya was capitalised 
(at 31 December 2013 – $6.4).
As at 31 December 2014 the Group held a 17.2% stake in Duluth Metals Limited (“Duluth”), accounted for as an available-for-sale investment. 
As at 31 December 2014 Duluth held a 60% interest in Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”), with the Group holding the remaining 40% 
interest in Twin Metals. As disclosed in Note 36, in November 2014 Antofagasta entered into a binding letter of agreement to acquire 100% of 
Duluth. The acquisition completed subsequent to the year-end following approval from Duluth’s shareholders in January 2015. Movements in 
the fair value of the available-for-sale investment in Duluth had previously been recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. The agreed acquisition terms indicated a final fixed value for the Duluth shares, and that there had therefore been an impairment in the 
value of the Duluth shares to this amount. Accordingly, an impairment charge of $26.3 million has been recognised in respect of this available-
for-sale investment, with fair value losses previously recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income being transferred to 
the income statement and recognised within this impairment loss. This impairment change is largely offset by the related $28.6 million disposal 
gain in respect of the temporary loss of control of the Twin Metals project as set out in Note 16.
The fair value through profit or loss line represents the fair value gains relating to liquid investments.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 9 TAXATION
The tax charge for the year comprised the following:
2014 
$m
2013 
$m
Current tax charge
– Corporate tax (principally first category tax in Chile) (377.6) (382.6)
– Mining tax (royalty) (71.9) (90.5)
– Withholding tax (279.3) (208.0)
– Exchange losses on corporate tax balances (0.4) (0.4)
 (729.2) (681.5)
Deferred tax charge
– Corporate tax (principally first category tax in Chile) 11.7  (72.4)
– Adjustment to deferred tax attributable to changes in tax rates (220.6) –
– Mining tax (royalty) (7.2) (8.7)
– Withholding tax provision 222.5  (81.1)
 6.4  (162.2)
Total tax charge (722.8) (843.7)
The rate of first category (ie corporate) tax in Chile is currently 21% (2013 – 20%).
On 29 September 2014 a significant reform of the Chilean system was enacted into law. The corporate tax rates which now apply in the period 
from 2014 to 2016 are: 2014 – 21%; 2015 – 22.5%; 2016 – 24%. The 21% rate for 2014 applies retrospectively with effect from 1 January 2014.
From 2017 two alternative taxation systems will apply – either the partially-integrated system or the attributable system. The default position 
for the Group’s operating companies is the partially-integrated system. The companies can each elect to apply the attributable system, provided 
there is unanimous agreement from that company’s shareholders.
Under the partially-integrated system the corporate tax rate will be 25.5% in 2017 and 27% from 2018 onwards. The Company’s shareholders 
will pay withholding tax based on the cash distributions made by the company, as with the current tax system. If the Company’s shareholders 
are not tax resident in countries with applicable tax treaties with Chile the withholding tax rate will be 17.45%, and so if the Company distributes 
all of its earnings the total corporate and withholding tax burden will be 44.45%. If the company’s shareholders are tax resident in countries 
with applicable tax treaties with Chile the withholding tax will be 8%, and so if the company distributes all of its earnings the total corporate 
and withholding tax burden will be 35%. 
Under the attributable system the corporate tax rate will be 25% from 2017 onwards. The Company’s shareholders must pay withholding based 
on the profits earned by the Company in the period, rather than based on cash distributions, at a rate of 10%. The total tax burden will therefore 
be 35%.
In order for any of the Group’s operating companies to apply the attributable system rather than the default partially-integrated system, that 
company’s shareholders must make a unanimous election to the Chilean Revenue Service by November 2016. The attributable system will then 
apply to that company for 5 years before it is possible to make a further election to move to the partially-integrated system if the company does 
not wish to continue with the attributable system at that point.
The Group’s deferred tax balances have been recalculated using the new tax rates which are expected to apply in the future periods when 
the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Given that the partially integrated system is the default system for the Group’s operating 
companies, and is the system which will apply unless the companies’ shareholders make a unanimous election to adopt the attributable system, 
the partially integrated system rates have been used when recalculating the deferred tax balances. This has resulted in an increase in the net 
deferred tax liabilities during 2014 of $220.6 million, which has been reflected via a deferred tax charge in the income statement. This has 
resulted in a total effective tax rate for the Group in 2014 of 45.9%. Excluding this deferred tax charge, the effective tax rate for the Group in 
2014 would have been 31.9%. The impact on net earnings of this deferred tax charge is $142.2 million and the impact on 2014 earnings per 
share is 14.4 cents per share.
The Group’s mining operations are also subject to a mining tax (royalty). From 1 January 2013 production from Los Pelambres, the Tesoro 
Central and Mirador pits at Centinela Cathodes and Michilla have been subject to the mining tax at a rate of 4% applied to taxable operating 
profit, and Centinela Concentrates has been subject to a rate of 5%. Production from the Tesoro North-East pit and the run-of-mine processing 
at Centinela Cathodes has been subject to a rate of 5-14% of taxable operating profit based on a sliding scale with minimum rate of 5% applying 
to operations with an operating profit margin of below 35% and maximum rate of 14% applied to operations with an operating profit margin 
above 85%. 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
128 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 In addition to first category tax and the mining tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on any remittance of profits from Chile and deferred tax 
is provided on undistributed earnings to the extent that remittance is probable in the foreseeable future. Withholding tax is levied on remittances 
of profits from Chile at 35% less first category (ie corporate) tax already paid in respect of the profits to which the remittances relate.

The tax charge for 2014 was $722.8 million and the effective tax rate was 45.9%. This rate varied from the standard rate (comprising first 
category tax) principally due to the deferred tax charge of $220.6 million reflecting the increase in tax rates as a result of the Chilean tax reform, 
the effect of items not deductible from first category tax (mainly corporate items which principally comprise exploration and evaluation costs), 
a withholding tax charge of $56.8 million and the effect of the mining tax which resulted in a charge of $79.1 million. 
In 2013 the total charge was $843.7 million, with an overall effective tax rate of 40.5% compared with the statutory rate of corporate tax of 20%. 
The effective rate of corporate tax was 21.8%, principally due to the impact of exploration expenditure (in particular in countries outside of Chile) 
which did not give rise to tax credits. In addition, the overall effective tax rate reflects the Chilean mining tax charge of $99.2 million and the 
withholding tax charge of $289.1 million.

The Group has pledged assets with a carrying value of $169.3 million (2013 – $3,365.2 million) as security against bank loans provided 
to the Group. The decrease in the value of pledged assets compared with 2013 reflects the release of guarantees relating to the Centinela 
project financing during 2014.
At 31 December 2014 the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting 
to $253.2 million (2013 – $842.8 million).
Compensation from insurance companies related to property, plant and equipment included in the consolidated income statement was 
$2.5 million in 2014 (2013 – $0.5 million). 
At 31 December 2014 $26.4 million (2013 – $39.9 million) of depreciation in respect of assets relating to Los Pelambres, Centinela, Antucoya 
and Michilla has been capitalised within property, plant and equipment or inventory, and accordingly is excluded from the depreciation charge 
recorded in the income statement as shown in Note 4(a).

Investment property represents the Group’s forestry properties, which are held for long-term potential and accordingly classified as investment 
property and held at cost as permitted by IAS 40.
The fair value of the Group’s investment property at 31 December 2014 was $11.0 million (2013 – $11.0 million), based on an independent 
valuation carried out during 2008 by Gabriel Durán, who is not connected with the Group. Mr. Durán is a Forestry Engineer, Valuer and Assessor 
of forestry properties for Banco Itau in Chile, with extensive experience of valuation in the region where the assets are located. The valuation 
was based on market evidence of transaction prices for similar properties.
Direct operating expenses (principally ongoing maintenance costs) arising on these properties amounted to $0.1 million (2013 – $0.2 million).

The investments which are included in the $198.1 million balance at 31 December 2014 are set out below:
INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES
(i)  The Group’s 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos S.A., which owns the 165MW Hornitos thermoelectric power plant operating in Mejillones, 
in Chile’s Antofagasta Region. 
(ii)  The Group’s 30% interest in ATI, which operates a concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta.
(iii)  The Group’s 30% interest in El Arrayán, which operates an 115MW wind-farm project, which entered into operation in June 2014.  
The Group has 20-year power purchase agreements with El Arrayán for the provision of up to 40MW of electricity for Los Pelambres. 
During the year the Group contributed $2.6 million (2013 – nil).
(iv)  The Group’s interest in Alto Maipo SPA (“Alto Maipo”), which will develop, construct, own and operate two run-of-river hydroelectric power 
stations located in the upper section of the Maipo River, approximately 50 kilometres to the southeast of Santiago, with a total installed 
capacity of 531MW. In July 2013, the Group exercised an option to acquire a 40% interest in Alto Maipo for a consideration of $50.2 million, 
and is responsible for its share of development costs. During 2013 the Group made capital contributions of $2.4 million, with no further 
contributions made during 2014, resulting in a cumulative equity investment as at 31 December 2013 of $52.6 million. Alto Maipo has used 
derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate movements in relation to the project financing and foreign exposure. 
A fair value loss of $42.3 million (2013 – $0.4 million loss) was recognised in relation to the mark-to-market of these derivative financial 
instruments with this amount deferred in reserves as it forms part of a designated cash flow hedging relationship. During the year the Group 
provided $105.4 million of funding (2013 – $47.0 million) to Alto Maipo. The balance due from Alto Maipo to the Group at 31 December 2014 
was $152.4 million (2013 – $47.0 million) representing loan financing with an interest rate of LIBOR six-months plus 4.25%.
(v)  The Group’s 40% interest in Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”), which is seeking to develop a copper-nickel-PGM deposit in 
northeastern Minnesota. The remaining 60% interest in Twin Metals is held by Duluth Metals Limited (“Duluth”) as at 31 December 2014. 
Under the terms of the participation agreement with Duluth, prior to July 2014 Antofagasta had exercised control over Twin Metals and 
accordingly consolidated Twin Metals as a 40%-owned subsidiary. In July 2014 the Group terminated its option to acquire an additional 25% 
stake in Twin Metals, which resulted in the Group losing its ability to control Twin Metals under the terms of the participation agreement, with 
Duluth taking control over Twin Metals at that point. Accordingly, from July 2014 Twin Metals ceased to be a subsidiary of the Group, and has 
been accounted for as an associate from that point. The initial carrying value of the investment in associate recognised at July 2014 has been 
recorded at its fair value of $67.4 million. This effective disposal of the investment in subsidiary, and its replacement with an investment in 
associate, resulted in a gain of $28.6 million, reflecting the difference between the $67.4 million initial fair value of the investment in associate 
recognised at July 2014 and $38.8 million reflecting the Group’s 40% share of the book value of Twin Metals’ net assets derecognised at 
that point. As shown in Note 3, this gain has been recorded within “Gains on disposals” within the “Corporate and other items” segment. 
This gain on disposal is largely offset by the related $26.3 million impairment charge in respect of the available-for-sale investment relating 
to Duluth Metals Limited, included within Other finance items as set out in Note 8. Between July 2014 and the year-end the Group provided 
$2.8 million of funding to Twin Metals.
As set out in Note 36 in November 2014 Antofagasta entered into a binding letter of agreement to acquire 100% of Duluth. The acquisition 
completed subsequent to the year-end following approval from Duluth’s shareholders in January 2015. Accordingly, subsequent to the year-end 
the Group has a 100% interest in Duluth and as a result of this a 100% interest in Twin Metals. Accordingly, the Group will consolidate Twin 
Metals as a 100% owned subsidiary from 2015.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
134 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES
(vi)  The Group’s 50.1% (2013 – 60%) interest in Energia Andina, which is a joint venture with Origin Energy Geothermal Chile Limitada (“Origin”) 
for the evaluation and development of potential sources of geothermal and solar energy. 
(vii)  The Group’s 50% interest in Tethyan Copper Company Limited (“Tethyan”), which is a joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation over 
Tethyan’s mineral interests in Pakistan, which is now subject to international arbitration as set out in Note 35 below.

The largest balances of trade receivables are held with equity participants in the key mining projects. Many other significant trade receivables 
are secured by letters of credit or other forms of security. The average credit period given on sale of goods and rendering of service is 37 
days (2013 – 45 days). There is no material element which is interest-bearing. Trade debtors include mark-to-market adjustments in respect 
of provisionally priced sales of copper and molybdenum concentrates which remain open as to final pricing. Where these have resulted 
in credit balances, they have been reclassified to trade creditors.

With respect to the trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, there are no indications that the debtors will not meet their payment 
obligations. The carrying value of the trade receivables recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit 
risk. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
At 31 December 2014, the other debtors include $28.4 million (2013 – $13.6 million) relating to prepayments.
20 CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND LIQUID INVESTMENTS
The fair value of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments is not materially different from the carrying values presented. The credit

and Measurement”, are as follows:
 
2014 
$m
2013 
$m
Financial assets
Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships 0.2 12.9 
Available-for-sale investments 15.6 16.6 
Loans and receivables at amortised cost (including cash and cash equivalents) 1,895.2 1,662.2 
Fair value through profit and loss (liquid investments and mark-to-market debtors) 1,529.1  2,108.3 
Financial liabilities
Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships (11.0) (9.8)
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (3,104.1) (2,149.5)
Fair value through profit and loss (mark-to-market creditors) (70.6) (5.7)
  254.4  1,635.0 
B) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
 – the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined 
with reference to quoted market prices;
 – the fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance with generally 
accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions; and
 – the fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted 
cash flow analysis based on the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing 
models for optional derivatives.
The fair value of each category of financial asset and liability is not materially different from the carrying values presented for either 2014 or 2013.
The following table provides an analysis of the financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 – level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 – level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices); and
 – level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

C) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and 
other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in general to reduce exposure to commodity price, 
foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board 
with its review of the effectiveness of the risk management process, and monitoring of key risks and mitigations. Internal Audit undertakes both 
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.
(i) Commodity price risk
The Group generally sells its copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes output at prevailing market prices, subject to final 
pricing adjustments which may range from one to five months after delivery to the customer, and it is therefore exposed to changes in market 
prices for copper and molybdenum both in respect of future sales and previous sales which remain open as to final pricing. In 2014, sales of 
copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathodes represented 86.4% of Group turnover and therefore revenues and earnings depend 
significantly on LME and realised copper prices.
The Group uses futures, min-max instruments and options to manage its exposure to copper prices. These instruments may give rise to 
accounting volatility due to fluctuations in their fair value prior to the maturity of the instruments. Details of those copper and molybdenum 
concentrate sales and copper cathode sales which remain open as to final pricing are given in Note 6. Details of commodity rate derivatives 
entered into by the Group are given in Note 23(d).
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the copper price on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date. 
A movement in the copper forward price as at the reporting date will affect the final pricing adjustment to sales which remain open at that date, 
impacting the trade receivables balance and consequently the income statement. A movement in the copper forward price will also affect 
the valuation of commodity derivatives, impacting the hedging reserve in equity if the fair value movement relates to an effective designated 
cash flow hedge, and impacting the income statement if it does not. The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as currency rates, 
remain constant.
 – If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had increased by 10 cents, net earnings would have increased by $16.5 million 
(2013 – increase by $17.3 million) and hedging reserves in equity would have decreased less than $0.1 million (2013 – decrease by $5 million).
 – If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had decreased by 10 cents, net earnings would have decreased by $16.5 million 
(2013 – decrease by $20.0 million) and hedging reserves in equity would have increased less than $0.1 million (2013 – increase 
by $10.9 million).
In addition, a movement in the average copper price during the year would impact revenue and earnings. A 10 cents change in the average 
copper price during the year would have affected net earnings by $64.7 million (2013 – $77.8 million) and earnings per share by 6.6 cents 
(2013 – 7.9 cents), based on production volumes in 2014, without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing and hedging activity.  
A $1 change in the average molybdenum price for the year would have affected net earnings by $7.0 million (2013 – $9.1 million), and earnings 
per share by 0.7 cents (2013 – 0.9 cents), based on production volumes in 2014, and without taking into account the effects of provisional 
pricing. A $100 change in the average gold price for the year would have affected net earnings by $9.7 million (2013 – $14.9 million), and earnings 
per share by 1.0 cents (2013 – 1.5 cents), based on production volumes in 2014, and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
AND FINANCIAL RISK 
MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
(ii) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to a variety of 
currencies. The US dollar, however, is the 
currency in which the majority of the Group’s 
sales are denominated. Operating costs are 
influenced by the countries in which the 
Group’s operations are based (principally in 
Chile) as well as those currencies in which the 
costs of imported equipment and services 
are determined. After the US dollar, the 
Chilean peso is the most important currency 
influencing costs and to a lesser extent sales.
Given the significance of the US dollar to the 
Group’s operations, this is the presentational 
currency of the Group for internal and external 
reporting. The US dollar is also the currency 
for borrowing and holding surplus cash, 
although a portion of this may be held in 
other currencies, notably Chilean pesos and 
sterling, to meet short-term operational and 
capital commitments and dividend payments.
When considered appropriate, the Group 
uses forward exchange contracts and 
currency swaps to limit the effects of 
movements in exchange rates in foreign 
currency denominated assets and liabilities. 
The Group may also use these instruments 
to reduce currency exposure on future 
transactions and cash flows. Details of any 
exchange rate derivatives entered by the 
Group in the year are given in Note 23(d).
The currency exposure of the Group’s cash, 
cash equivalents and liquid investments is 
given in Note 20, and the currency exposure 
of the Group’s borrowings is given in Note 
21. The effects of exchange gains and losses 
included in the income statement are given in 
Note 6. Exchange differences on translation 
of the net assets of entities with a functional 
currency other than the US dollar (the most 
material of which is Aguas de Antofagasta 
S.A.) are taken to the currency translation 
reserve and are disclosed in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity on page 108.
Currency sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the 
impact of a movement in the US dollar/
Chilean peso exchange rate on the financial 
instruments held as at the reporting date.
The impact on profit or loss is as a result of the 
retranslation of monetary financial instruments 
(including cash, cash equivalents, liquid 
investments, trade receivables, trade payables 
and borrowings). The impact on equity is as a 
result of changes in the fair value of derivative 
instruments which are effective designated 
cash flow hedges, and changes in the fair 
value of available-for-sale equity investments. 
The calculation assumes that all other variables, 
such as interest rates, remain constant.
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10% 
against the Chilean peso as at the reporting 
date, net earnings would have decreased by 
$6.2 million (2013 – decrease by $0.5 million); 
and hedging reserves in equity would have 
decreased by $6.1 million (2013 – decrease by 
$5.2 million). If the US dollar had weakened 
by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the 
reporting date, net earnings would have 
increased by $15.2 million (2013 – increase by 
$0.6 million); and hedging reserves in equity 
would have increased by $0.7 million (2013 – 
increase by $6.3 million).
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is generally to borrow and 
invest cash at floating rates. Fluctuations in 
interest rates may impact the Group’s net 
finance income or cost, and to a lesser 
extent on the value of financial assets and 
liabilities. The Group occasionally uses 
interest rate swaps and collars to manage 
interest rate exposures on a portion of its 
existing borrowings. Details of any interest 
rate derivatives entered into by the Group 
are given in Note 23(d).
Interest rate exposure of the Group’s 
borrowings is given in Note 21.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the 
impact of a movement in interest rates in 
relation to the financial instruments held 
as at the reporting date. The impact on 
profit or loss reflects the impact on annual 
interest expense in respect of the floating 
rate borrowings held as at the reporting date, 
and the impact on annual interest income in 
respect of cash and cash equivalents held as 
at the reporting date. The impact on equity 
is as a result of changes in the fair value of 
derivative instruments which are effective 
designated cash flow hedges. The calculation 
assumes that all other variables, such as 
currency rates, remain constant.
If the interest rate increased by 1%, based 
on the financial instruments held as at the 
reporting date, net earnings would have 
increased by $2.5 million (2013 – increase 
by $11.9 million) and hedging reserves in 
equity would have increased by $0.3 million 
(2013 – increase by $2.1 million). This does 
not include the effect on the income 
statement of changes in the fair value of 
the Group’s liquid investments relating 
to the underlying investments in fixed 
income instruments.
(iv) Other price risk
The Group is exposed to equity price risk on 
its available-for-sale equity investments.
Equity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below shows the 
impact of a movement in the equity values 
of the available-for-sale financial assets held 
as at the reporting date.
If the value of the available-for-sale 
investments had increased by 10% as 
at the reporting date, equity would have 
increased by $1.6 million (2013 – increase 
by $1.7 million). There would have been 
no impact on the income statement.
(v) Cash flow risk
The Group’s future cash flows depend on 
a number of factors, including commodity 
prices, production and sales levels, operating 
costs, capital expenditure levels and financial 
income and costs. Its cash flows are therefore 
subject to the exchange, interest rate and 
commodity price risks described above as 
well as operational factors and input costs. 
To reduce the risk of potential short-term 
disruptions to the supply of key inputs such 
as electricity and sulphuric acid, the Group 
enters into medium and long-term supply 
contracts to help ensure continuity of supply. 
Long-term electricity supply contracts are in 
place at each of the Group’s mines, in most 
cases linking the cost of electricity under the 
contract to the current cost of electricity on 
the Chilean grids. The Group seeks to lock in 
supply of sulphuric acid for future periods of 
a year or longer, with contract prices agreed 
in the latter part of the year, to be applied 
to purchases of acid in the following year. 
Further information on production and sales 
levels and operating costs are given in the 
Operational review on pages 38 to 49.
(vi) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from trade and other 
receivables, cash, cash equivalents, 
liquid investments and derivative financial 
instruments. The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
to trade receivables. The credit risk on cash, 
cash equivalents and liquid investments and on 
derivative financial instruments is limited as the 
counterparties are financial institutions with 
high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit agencies.
All customers are subject to credit review 
procedures, including the use of external 
credit ratings where available. Credit is 
provided only within set limits, which are 
regularly reviewed.
Outstanding receivable balances are 
monitored on an ongoing basis.
The carrying value of financial assets 
recorded in the financial statements 
represents the maximum exposure to 
credit risk. The amounts presented in the 
balance sheet are net of allowances for any 
doubtful receivables.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
142 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 (vii) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by 
maintaining adequate cash reserves and 
financing facilities, through the review 
of forecast and actual cash flows.
The Group typically holds surplus cash in 
demand or term deposits or highly liquid 
investments, which typically can be accessed 
or liquidated within 24 hours.
The majority of borrowings comprise 
corporate loans at Los Pelambres, repayable 
over periods of up to three years, corporate 
loans at Centinela Concentrate, repayable 
over approximately seven years and Antucoya 
long-term subordinated debt repayable over 
approximately 12 years.
At the end of 2014 the Group was in a net 
debt position (2013 – net cash position), as 
disclosed in Note 30c. Details of cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments are given in 
Note 20, while details of borrowings including 
the maturity profile are given in Note 21. 
Details of undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities are also given in Note 21.
The following table analyses the maturity 
of the Group’s contractual commitments in 
respect of its financial liabilities and derivative 
financial instruments. The table has been 
drawn up based on the undiscounted cash 
flows on the earliest date on which the Group 
can be required to pay. The table includes 
both interest and principal cash flows.

* The preference shares pay an annual dividend of £100,000 ($160,334) in perpetuity, and accordingly it is not possible to determine total amounts payable for periods without a fixed end date.
(viii) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives are to return capital 
to shareholders while leaving the Group 
with sufficient funds to progress its short, 
medium and long-term growth plans as well 
as preserving the financial flexibility to take 
advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
This policy remains unchanged. The Group 
monitors capital on the basis of net cash 
(defined as cash, cash equivalents and liquid 
investments less borrowings) which was 
a net debt by $1.6 million at 31 December 
2014 (2013 – net cash $1,311.2 million), as 
well as gross cash (defined as cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid investments) which was 
$2,374.5 million at 31 December 2014 (2013 
– $2,685.1 million). The Group’s total cash is 
held in a combination of on demand and term 
deposits and managed funds investing in high 
quality, fixed income instruments. Some of the 
managed funds have been instructed to invest 
in instruments with average maturities greater 
than 90 days. These amounts are presented 
as liquid investments but are included in net 
cash for monitoring and decision-making 
purposes. The Group has a risk averse 
investment strategy. The Group’s borrowings 
are detailed in Note 21. Additional project 
finance or shareholder loans are taken out 
by the operating subsidiaries to fund projects 
on a case-by-case basis.
D) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL 
INSTRUMENTS
The Group occasionally uses derivative 
financial instruments, in general to reduce 
its exposure to commodity price, foreign 
exchange and interest rate movements. 
The Group does not use such derivative 
instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Group has applied the hedge accounting 
provisions of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement”. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that are designated and effective 
as hedges of future cash flows have been 
recognised directly in equity, with such 
amounts subsequently recognised in the 
income statement in the period when the 
hedged item affects profit or loss. 
Any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Realised gains and losses on commodity 
derivatives recognised in the income 
statement have been recorded within 
revenue. The time value element of changes 
in the fair value of derivative options is 
excluded from the designated hedging 
relationship, and is therefore recognised 
directly in the income statement within other 
finance items. Realised gains and losses and 
changes in the fair value of exchange and 
interest derivatives are recognised within 
other finance items for those derivatives 
where hedge accounting has not been 
applied. When hedge accounting has 
been applied the realised gains and losses 
on exchange and interest derivatives are 
recognised within other finance items and 
interest expense respectively.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The long-term incentive plan (the “Plan”) was introduced at the end of 2011. Awards granted pursuant to the Plan form part of the remuneration 
of senior managers in the Group. Directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan.
DETAILS OF THE AWARDS
Under the Plan, the Group may grant awards based on the price of ordinary shares in the Company and cannot grant awards over actual shares.
 – Restricted Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Company’s 
ordinary shares, subject to the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when the Restricted Award vests; and
 – Performance Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Company’s 
ordinary shares subject to both the satisfaction of a performance condition and the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when 
the Performance Award vests.
When awards vest under the Plan, participants become entitled to receive a cash payment by reference to the number and portion of awards 
that have vested and the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of vesting. There is no exercise price payable by participants 
in respect of the awards.
Restricted Awards can only vest in full if participants remain employed by the Group for three years from the date that Restricted Awards are 
granted. In ordinary circumstances, the first one-third of a Restricted Award will vest after one year, the second one-third will vest after two 
years and the remaining one-third will vest after three years. There are no performance criteria attached to Restricted Awards. The fair value 
of Restricted Awards granted under the Plan is recorded as a compensation expense over the vesting periods, with a corresponding liability 
recognised for the fair value of the liability at the end of each period until settled.
Performance Awards only vest if certain performance criteria are met. The performance criteria reflect a number of factors including total 
shareholder return, earnings levels, growth in the Group’s reserves and resources and project delivery targets. The fair value of Performance 
Awards under the Plan is recorded as a compensation expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability at the end of each period 
until settled.
A One-off Award was granted to Diego Hernández, the Group CEO, following his appointment during 2012. This award was granted for 
the same purpose as the awards granted under the LTIP but by reference to metrics which are specific to the participant’s role as CEO. 
VALUATION PROCESS AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE AWARDS
The fair value of the awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The inputs into the Monte Carlo simulation model 
are as follows:
2014 2013
Weighted average forecast share price at vesting date USD 11.46 USD 7.09
Expected volatility 28.32% 41.48%
Expected life of awards 3 years 3 years
Expected dividend yields 2.45% 1.60%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous five years. The expected life 
of awards used in the model has been adjusted based on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability and compliance of 
the objectives determined according to the characteristic of each plan.
The number of awards outstanding at the end of the period is as follows:
Restricted 
Awards

The Group has recorded a liability for $8.9 million at 31 December 2014, of which $4.9 million is due after more than one year (31 December 
2013 – $4.8 million, of which $3.1 million was due after more than one year) and total expenses of $5.8 million for the year (2013 – expense 
of $1.7 million). 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
146 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 25 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
A) DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees. The amount charged to the income statement in 2014 
was $0.2 million (2013 – $0.2 million), representing the amount paid in the year. There were no outstanding amounts which remain payable at 
the end of either year.
B) SEVERANCE PROVISIONS
Employment terms at some of the Group’s operations provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes to 
an end. This is typically at the rate of one month for each year of service (subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of 
service) and based on final salary level. The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, and the obligation 
recognised is based on valuations performed by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are regularly updated. 
The obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the severance indemnity obligation. Actuarial gains and losses are 
immediately recognised in other comprehensive income.
The most recent valuation was carried out in 2014 by Ernst & Young, a qualified actuary in Santiago-Chile who is not connected with the Group.
The main assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were as follows:
2014 2013
Average nominal discount rate 4.5% 5.3%
Average rate of increase in salaries 2.6% 3.3%
Average staff turnover 5.0% 4.8%

Rate of increase in salaries
This represents the estimated average rates of future salary increases, reflecting likely future promotions and other changes.  
This has been based on historical information for the Group for the period from 2011 to 2014.
Turnover rate
This represents the estimated average level of future employee turnover. This has been based on historical information for the Group  
for the period from 2011 to 2014. 
Sensitive analysis
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and staff turnover. 
The sensitive analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end 
of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
 – If the discount rate is 100 basis points higher the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $8.8 million. If the discount rate is 100 basis 
points lower the defined benefit obligation would increase by $10.4 million.
 – If the expected salary growth increases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would increase by $9.8 million. If the expected salary growth 
decreases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $8.4 million. 
 – If the staff turnover increases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $1.5 million. If the staff turnover decreases 
by 1% the defined benefit obligation would increase by $1.5 million.

The credit to the income statement of $9.3 million (2013 – $160.1 million charge) includes a credit for foreign exchange differences 
of $2.9 million (2013 – includes a credit of $2.1 million).
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable 
right to do so. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balance (after offset):
2014 
$m
2013 
$m
Deferred tax assets 104.6 76.9 
Deferred tax liabilities (979.8) (965.9)
Net deferred tax balances (875.2) (889.0)
At 31 December 2014, the Group had unused tax losses of $14.3 million (2013 – $235.9 million) available for offset against future profits. 
A deferred tax asset of $1.5 million has been recognised in respect of these losses in 2014 (2013 – $4.5 million). These losses may be carried 
forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2014, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was $4,520.4 million (2013 – $5,124.5 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of 
these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is likely that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.

A) DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION
Decommissioning and restoration costs relate to the Group’s mining operations. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan 
and are subject to regular independent formal review. It is estimated that the provision will be utilised from 2024 until 2059 based on current 
mine plans.
$69.5 million of the provision relates to Michilla, and this element of the provision is expected to be utilised following the termination 
of operations at Michilla at the end of 2015.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the decommissioning and restoration provisions at the Group’s mining operations decreased by a net 
total of $60.0 million, mainly relating to decreases in decommissioning costs which were reflected through adjustments to the corresponding 
asset balances. The net decrease mainly relates to Los Pelambres, reflecting updated forecasts of the exact nature of required closure activities 
and their costs. 
B) TERMINATION OF WATER CONCESSION
The provision for the termination of the Water concession relates to the provision for items of plant, property and equipment and working capital 
items under Aguas de Antofagasta’s ownership to be transferred to the previous state-owned operator ECONSSA (formerly known as ESSAN) 
at the end of the concession period, and is based on the net present value of the estimated value of those assets and liabilities in existence 
at the end of the concession.

32 CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS
In 2003, the Group was awarded a 30-year concession to operate the water rights and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile previously 
controlled by the state-owned operator ECONSSA (formerly known as ESSAN). The concession consists of two businesses, one an unregulated 
business supplying mines and other industrial users and the other a regulated water business supplying domestic customers. The concession 
contract was signed and control of the assets and operation assumed on 29 December 2003 by Aguas de Antofagasta S.A., a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Group.
Under the concession contract, certain assets and liabilities (mainly certain specific tangible fixed assets and working capital items) were 
transferred to Aguas de Antofagasta by way of sale. Other assets (mainly water rights and infrastructure) were transferred by way of concession 
and will devolve to ECONSSA at the end of the 30-year period.
Aguas de Antofagasta will also be required to transfer to ECONSSA any tangible fixed assets and working capital items under its ownership 
at the end of the 30-year concession period. A provision for the termination of the Water concession has been created for the fixed assets 
and working capital items under Aguas de Antofagasta’s ownership to be transferred to ECONSSA at the end of the concession period. 
The provision is based on the net present value of the estimated value of these assets and liabilities in existence at the end of the concession. 
The release of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of future costs is charged to the income statement in each accounting 
period and is disclosed as a financing cost. Further details of this provision are given in Note 27(b).
The Chilean Water Regulator (Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios) sets domestic tariffs every five years following a regulatory review 
including representations from the operator of the concession. The last regulatory review was completed during 2011 and there was not 
significant variation compared to the last regulatory review in 2006.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 35 LITIGATION AND 
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Antofagasta plc or its subsidiaries are subject 
to various claims which arise in the ordinary 
course of business. No provision has been 
made in the financial statements and none of 
these claims are currently expected to result 
in any material loss to the Group. Details of 
the principal claims in existence either during, 
or at the end of, the period and the current 
status of these claims are set out below: 
LOS PELAMBRES – MAURO TAILINGS 
DAM 
As previously announced, during 2008 Los 
Pelambres entered into binding settlements 
in respect of litigation relating to the Mauro 
tailings dam. Since then, there have been a 
series of civil claims filed by some members 
of the Caimanes community (which is located 
near the Mauro valley) seeking to stop the 
operation of the dam. Many of these claims 
have been rejected by the relevant courts. 
Two of these claims are currently ongoing 
and Los Pelambres is continuing to take 
necessary steps to protect its position.  In 
the first claim, the plaintiffs have argued that 
the tailings dam affects their alleged water 
rights and the environment. This allegation is 
based on assertions that the dam interferes 
with the flow and quality of the water in the 
Pupío stream, a stream that passes through 
the Caimanes community. This claim was 
rejected by the Civil Court in Los Vilos in a 
judgement issued in November 2012, which 
was than affirmed by the Court of Appeals of 
La Serena in August 2013. In October 2014, 
the Supreme Court, by split decision, upheld 
the appeal and ordered Los Pelambres to 
submit back to the Civil Court in Los Vilos, 
within one month, an implementation plan for 
works that would ensure that the operation 
of the dam does not affect the normal flow 
and quality of the waters of the Pupío stream. 
Los Pelambres believes that the requirements 
of this order have already been met as Los 
Pelambres has undertaken significant works 
to ensure that the flow of the Pupío stream 
is not altered and that the operation of the 
tailings dam does not affect the quantity or 
quality of these waters – something that has 
been confirmed by accredited independent 
assessors and other public services in Chile 
and confirmed by the Supreme Court in 
a parallel decision. 
Nevertheless, on 21 November 2014, Los 
Pelambres submitted this plan to the Civil 
Court in Los Vilos. On 9 March 2015 that 
Court found that the plan submitted by Los 
Pelambres was not sufficient to address the 
requirements of the Supreme Court order, 
and as a consequence Los Pelambres must 
destroy part, or all, of the tailings dam wall. 
Los Pelambres considers the ruling to be 
flawed, has appealed the Court’s decision 
and is considering the exercise of all available 
legal measures that may be required to 
overturn this decision and address its 
potential consequences.
In the second claim, the plaintiffs are 
seeking demolition of the dam on the 
basis of the risk that its collapse would 
pose to the community. The Civil Court in 
Los Vilos issued a decision in May 2014 
denying the demolition request but ordering 
Minera Los Pelambres to undertake some 
additional measures to ensure protection 
of the community, in the event of a major 
earthquake or similar natural event. 
These measures need to be reviewed and 
agreed with the technically competent bodies 
responsible for supervision of the dam. 
The decision of that Court has been appealed 
by both the plantiffs and Los Pelambres and 
these appeals will be heard before the Court 
of Appeal of La Serena. The Court of Appeal 
of La Serena is expected to hear this matter 
in the second quarter of 2015. Any decision of 
the Court of Appeal may also be subject to an 
appeal to the Supreme Court of Chile.
LOS PELAMBRES – BOTADERO CERRO 
AMARILLO
Xstrata Pachon S.A. has filed a claim against 
Los Pelambres before the Federal Court 
of San Juan, Argentina, alleging that Los 
Pelambres has unlawfully deposited waste-
rock (“Botadero Cerro Amarillo”) on its 
property on the Argentinian side of the Chile/
Argentina border. 
Los Pelambres is located on the Chilean side 
of a section of the border between Chile and 
Argentina in the Coquimbo region of Chile and 
Xstrata Pachon is located on the Argentinian 
side of the border in the same area. 
Los Pelambres received all of the required 
authorisations from the Chilean government 
at the time before depositing the waste-rock 
in its current location for the first time, which 
according to the official Chilean cartography 
at that time was located within Chile. 
Subsequently, Chile modified the official 
cartography in this area without making public 
this change. 
Los Pelambres stopped using (and depositing 
rock) in the relevant area of the Botadero 
Cerro Amarillo in 2011. After this time, a Bi-
national Border subcommission undertook 
a demarcation mission in the area, placing 
markers in the area to demarcate the 
borderline. Following the completion of 
this exercise, it was established that part 
of the Botadero Cerro Amarillo is located 
in Argentina.
Los Pelambres has informed the Chilean 
government of the claim filed by Xstrata 
Pachon, noting that the use and operation of 
the Botadero Cerro Amarillo was at all times 
properly authorised by the Chilean authorities.
Los Pelambres has presented objections to 
the jurisdiction of the Argentinean courts 
to hear the Xstrata Pachon’s claim and any 
decision of this Court on this preliminary 
issue may be appealed by each party. It is not 
expected that a determinative outcome will 
be reached on these facts for several years.
TETHYAN COPPER COMPANY 
PTY LIMITED
The Group holds a 50% interest in Tethyan 
Copper Company Pty Limited (“Tethyan”), its 
joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation 
(“Barrick”). In February 2011, Tethyan 
submitted an application for a mining lease 
to the Government of Balochistan which 
was subsequently rejected in November 
2011. Tethyan is pursuing two international 
arbitrations in order to protect its legal rights: 
one against the Government of Pakistan 
under the auspices of the International 
Centre for Settlement of Investment 
Disputes (“ICSID”), and another against 
the Government of Balochistan under the 
auspices of the International Chamber of 
Commerce (“ICC”). Tethyan is seeking 
monetary damages only and is no longer 
seeking the grant of a mining lease at 
Reko Diq. During 2014, Tethyan presented 
arguments on preliminary issues before the 
ICC tribunal (including as to the jurisdiction of 
the ICC tribunal) and on jurisdiction and merits 
before the ICSID tribunal. Both arbitrations 
are continuing: Tethyan prevailed on the 
preliminary issues before the ICC Tribunal, 
which will now proceed to consider the 
merits of the parties’ respective claims, 
while a decision from the ICSID Tribunal on 
jurisdiction and liability is anticipated in 2015.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
154 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 36 EVENTS AFTER THE 
BALANCE SHEET DATE
DULUTH METALS LIMITED AND TWIN 
METALS MINNESOTA LIMITED
In January 2015 the Group completed its 
acquisition of 100% of Duluth Metals Limited 
(“Duluth”). Duluth holds a 60% stake in Twin 
Metals Minnesota Limited (“Twin Metals”), 
the company in which the Group held a 40% 
stake as at December 2014. Twin Metals 
is seeking to develop a copper-nickel-
PGM deposit in northeastern Minnesota. 
In November 2014 Antofagasta entered 
into a binding letter of agreement to acquire 
100% of Duluth. The acquisition completed 
subsequent to the year end following approval 
from Duluth’s shareholders in January 2015. 
Accordingly, subsequent to the year end the 
Group has a 100% interest in Duluth and as a 
result of this a 100% interest in Twin Metals. 
As at 31 December 2014 the Group held 
17.2% of Duluth’s share capital, with a 
fair value of US$9 million. The fair value 
of the consideration transferred to acquire 
the remaining share capital of Duluth in 
January 2015 was US$48 million, reflecting 
the agreed acquisition price of C$0.45 per 
share. As part of the acquisition agreement 
the Group agreed to redeem convertible 
debentures previously issued by Duluth, 
at a cost of US$34 million. Accordingly, 
the total cash consideration related to the 
acquisition was US$82 million. Including the 
US$9 million value of the 17.2% of Duluth’s 
share capital already held by the Group 
at 31 December 2014, the total fair value 
of 100% of Duluth (taking account of the 
redemption of the convertible debentures) 
was $91 million. 
The principal asset of Duluth was its 60% 
interest in Twin Metals. The provisional 
estimate of the net fair value of the other 
identifiable assets and liabilities of Duluth 
at the acquisition date is a net liability of 
US$10 million. The difference between 
the total consideration and the net assets 
acquired (other than the interest in Twin 
Metals) is therefore provisionally estimated 
to be US$101 million, which represents the 
fair value of Duluth’s 60% stake in Twin 
Metals. From January 2015 Twin Metals will 
be consolidated as a 100% subsidiary of the 
Group, with its principal asset being its mining 
properties, reflected within property, plant 
and equipment. Accordingly, the provisionally 
estimated US$101 million value, which 
reflects the fair value of Duluth’s 60% interest 
in the Twin Metals project, will be reflected 
within the Twin Metals mining properties 
held within property, plant and equipment. 
37 ULTIMATE PARENT 
COMPANY
The immediate parent of the Group is 
Metalinvest Establishment, which is 
controlled by E. Abaroa Foundation, in which 
members of the Luksic family are interested.
Both Metalinvest Establishment and the 
E. Abaroa Foundation are domiciled in 
Liechtenstein. Information relating to the 
interest of Metalinvest Establishment and 
the E. Abaroa Foundation are given in the 
Directors’ report.

PARENT COMPANY  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
156 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 38A BASIS OF PREPARATION 
OF THE BALANCE SHEET 
AND RELATED NOTES OF THE 
PARENT COMPANY
The Antofagasta plc Parent Company balance 
sheet and related notes have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom generally 
accepted accounting principles (“UK GAAP”) 
and in accordance with UK company law. 
The financial information has been prepared 
on a historical cost basis. The financial 
statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. The functional currency 
of the Company and the presentational 
currency adopted is US dollars.
A summary of the principal accounting 
policies is set out below. There were no 
changes in accounting policies in 2014.
The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with UK GAAP requires the use 
of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at 
the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the period. Although these estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge 
of the amount, event or actions, following 
implementation of these standards, actual 
results may differ from those estimates.
As permitted by section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the profit and 
loss account of the Parent Company is 
not presented as part of these financial 
statements. The profit after tax for the 
year of the Parent Company amounted to 
$948.2 million (2013 – $433.0 million).
It is currently expected that the individual 
company accounts of Antofagasta plc will 
be prepared in accordance with FRS 101 
from 2015 onwards. FRS 101 applies the 
recognition and measurement bases of IFRS 
with reduced disclosure requirements. It is 
expected that the 2015 individual company 
accounts for Antofagasta will be prepared 
in accordance with FRS 101 unless the 
Company receives objections in respect 
of this.
38B PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES OF THE PARENT 
COMPANY
A) CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company’s functional currency is the 
US dollar. Transactions denominated in other 
currencies, including the issue of shares, are 
translated at the rate of exchange ruling on 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities, including amounts due from 
or to subsidiaries, are translated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the end of the financial 
year. Exchange differences are charged or 
credited to the profit and loss account in the 
year in which they arise.
B) REVENUE RECOGNITION
Interest is accounted for on an accruals 
basis. Dividends proposed by subsidiaries 
are recognised as income by the Company 
when they represent a present obligation of 
the subsidiaries, ie in the period in which they 
are formally approved for payment.
C) DIVIDENDS PAYABLE
Dividends proposed are recognised when 
they represent a present obligation, ie in the 
period in which they are formally approved for 
payment. Accordingly, an interim dividend is 
recognised when paid and a final dividend is 
recognised when approved by shareholders.
D) INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
Investments in subsidiaries represent 
equity holdings in subsidiaries and long-
term amounts owed by subsidiaries. 
Such investments are valued at cost less 
any impairment provisions. Investments are 
reviewed for impairment if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a 
review for impairment is conducted, the 
recoverable amount is assessed by reference 
to the net present value of expected future 
cash flows of the relevant income generating 
unit or disposal value if higher.
As explained in Note 39D, amounts owed 
by subsidiaries due in foreign currencies are 
translated at year end rates of exchange with 
any exchange differences taken to the profit 
and loss account.
E) CURRENT ASSET INVESTMENTS AND 
CASH AT BANK AND IN HAND
Current asset investments comprise highly-
liquid investments that are readily convertible 
into known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value, typically maturing within 12 months.
Cash at bank and in hand comprise cash in 
hand and deposits repayable on demand.
F) BORROWINGS – PREFERENCE 
SHARES
The sterling-denominated preference shares 
issued by the Company carry a fixed rate 
of return without the right to participate in 
any surplus. They are accordingly classified 
as borrowings and translated into US 
dollars at period-end rates of exchange. 
Preference share dividends are included 
within finance costs.
G) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS – ORDINARY 
SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Equity instruments of the Company comprise 
its sterling-denominated issued ordinary 
share capital and related share premium.
As explained above, the presentational and 
the functional currency of the Company is US 
dollars, and ordinary share capital and share 
premium are translated into US dollars at 
historical rates of exchange based on dates 
of issue.
H) CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The Company’s individual financial 
statements are outside the scope of 
FRS 1 “Cash Flow Statements” because 
the Company prepares publicly available 
consolidated financial statements which 
include a consolidated cash flow statement. 
Accordingly, the Company does not present 
an individual company cash flow statement.
I) RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
The Company’s individual financial 
statements are exempt from the 
requirements of FRS 8 “Related Party 
Disclosures” because its individual 
financial statements are presented 
together with its consolidated financial 
statements. Accordingly, the individual 
financial statements do not include related 
party disclosures.
38C EMPLOYEES AND 
DIRECTORS
Antofagasta plc had no employees 
during 2014 and 2013. Details of fees 
payable to Directors are set out in the 
Remuneration report.

in US dollars at period-end rates of exchange.
The preference shares are non-redeemable and are entitled to a fixed 5% cumulative dividend, payable in equal instalments in June and 
December of each year. On a winding-up, the preference shares are entitled to repayment and any arrears of dividend in priority to ordinary 
shareholders, but are not entitled to participate further in any surplus. Each preference share carries 100 votes (see Note 21a(xvii)) at any 
general meeting.

OTHER INFORMATION INTRODUCTION
The ore reserves and mineral resources 
estimates presented in this report comply 
with the requirements of the Australasian 
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, 
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2012 
edition (the JORC Code) which has been 
used by the Group as minimum standard 
for the preparation and disclosure of the 
information contained herein. The definitions 
and categories of Ore Reserves and Mineral 
Resources are set out below. 
The information on ore reserves and mineral 
resources was prepared by or under the 
supervision of Competent Persons as defined 
in the JORC Code. The Competent Persons 
have sufficient experience relevant to the 
style of mineralisation and type of deposit 
under consideration and to the activity 
which they are undertaking. The Competent 
Persons consent to the inclusion in this report 
of the matters based on their information 
in the form and context in which it appears. 
The Competent Person for Exploration 
Results and Mineral Resources (except for 
the Twin Metals Mineral Resource Estimate) 
is Guillermo Muller (CP , Chile), Manager of 
Mineral Resource Evaluation for Antofagasta 
Minerals. The Competent Person for the 
Twin Metals Mineral Resource Estimate is 
Dr. Harry Parker, SME, Registered Member, 
Technical Director of AMEC. The Competent 
Person for Ore Reserves is Murray Canfield 
(P .Eng. Ontario), Technical Manager of Mining 
for Antofagasta Minerals.
The Group’s operations and projects are 
subject to a comprehensive programme 
of audits aimed at providing assurance in 
respect of ore reserves and mineral resources 
estimates. The audits are conducted by 
suitably qualified Competent Persons 
from within a particular division, another 
division of the Company or from 
independent consultants. 
The ore reserves and mineral resources 
estimates represent full reserves and 
resources, with the Group’s attributable share 
for each mine shown in the ‘Attributable 
Tonnage’ column. The Group’s economic 
interest in each mine is disclosed in the 
notes following the estimates on pages 
167 to 169. The totals in the table may 
include some small apparent differences 
as the specific individual figures have 
not been rounded. 
DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORIES 
OF ORE RESERVES 
AND MINERAL RESOURCES
A ‘Mineral Resource’ is a concentration or 
occurrence of material of intrinsic economic 
interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such 
form, quality and quantity that there are 
reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a 
Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence 
and knowledge. Mineral Resources are 
sub-divided, in order of increasing geological 
confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and 
Measured categories. 
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part 
of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, 
grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a low level of confidence. It is inferred 
from geological evidence and assumed but 
not verified geological and/or grade continuity. 
It is based on information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes which may be limited or of uncertain 
quality and reliability. 
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that 
part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, 
grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a reasonable level of confidence. It is 
based on exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 
The locations are too widely or inappropriately 
spaced to confirm geological and/or grade 
continuity but are spaced closely enough 
for continuity to be assumed. 
A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that 
part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, 
grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a high level of confidence. It is based 
on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 
and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations 
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings 
and drill holes. The locations are spaced 
closely enough to confirm geological 
and grade continuity. 
An ‘Ore Reserve’ is the economically 
mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated 
Mineral Resource. It includes diluting 
materials and allowances for losses, which 
may occur when the material is mined. 
Appropriate assessments and studies have 
been carried out, and include consideration 
of and modification by realistically assumed 
mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, 
legal, environmental, social and governmental 
factors. These assessments demonstrate 
at the time of reporting that extraction could 
reasonably be justified. Ore Reserves are 
sub-divided in order of increasing confidence 
into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved 
Ore Reserves. 
A ‘Probable Ore Reserve’ is the 
economically mineable part of an Indicated, 
and in some circumstances, a Measured 
Mineral Resource. It includes diluting 
materials and allowances for losses which 
may occur when the material is mined. 
Appropriate assessments and studies have 
been carried out, and include consideration 
of and modification by realistically assumed 
mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, 
legal, environmental, social and governmental 
factors. These assessments demonstrate 
at the time of reporting that extraction could 
reasonably be justified. 
A ‘Proved Ore Reserve’ is the 
economically mineable part of a Measured 
Mineral Resource. It includes diluting 
materials and allowances for losses 
which may occur when the material is 
mined. Appropriate assessments and 
studies have been carried out, and include 
consideration of and modification by 
realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors. 
These assessments demonstrate at 
the time of reporting that extraction could 
reasonably be justified.

ORE RESERVES AND  
MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATES 
AT 31 DECEMBER 2014
166 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 NOTES TO ORE RESERVES 
AND MINERAL RESOURCES 
ESTIMATES
The ore reserves mentioned in this report 
were determined considering specific cut-off 
grades for each mine and using a long-term 
copper price of $3.10/lb ($3.00/lb in 2013), 
$11.00/lb molybdenum (unchanged from 
2013) and $1,300/oz gold ($1,200/oz gold in 
2013), unless otherwise noted. These same 
values have been used for copper equivalent 
(CuEq) estimates, where appropriate.
In order to ensure that the stated resources 
represent mineralisation that has “reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic extraction” 
(JORC code) the resources are enclosed 
within pit shells that were optimised based on 
measured, indicated and inferred resources 
and considering a copper price of $3.60/lb 
($3.30/lb in 2013). Mineralisation estimated 
outside these pit shells is not included in the 
resource figures unless they can expect to be 
exploited by underground methods.
A) LOS PELAMBRES
Los Pelambres is 60% owned by the Group. 
The cut-off grade applied to the determination 
of ore reserves and mineral resources is 
0.35% copper. For 2014 the mineral resource 
model has been updated with 225 drill holes 
for a total of 76,100 metres.
The decrease of 65 million tonnes in ore 
reserves is due principally to depletion in the 
period and reflects the remaining capacity of 
the existing tailing dams, limiting the amount 
of mineral resource that can be converted 
into ore reserves.
Mineral resources increased overall by a 
net 510 million tonnes, including depletion. 
Mineral resources in the measured 
plus indicated categories increased by 
1,022 million tonnes while resources in the 
inferred category decreased by 512 million 
tonnes, reflecting increased information from 
new drill holes improving the confidence in 
the Mineral Resource categories. 
B) CENTINELA (EX-ESPERANZA, 
INCLUDING EX-EL TESORO)
Centinela is 70% owned by the Group and 
consists of the integration of the Esperanza 
(referred to as Centinela Concentrates) and 
El Tesoro (referred to as Centinela Cathodes) 
operations. The cut-off grade applied to the 
determination of ore reserves for Centinela 
Concentrates (ex-Esperanza) is 0.20% 
equivalent copper, with 0.15% copper used 
as a cut-off grade for mineral resources. 
The cut-off grade used for the Centinela 
Cathodes (ex-El Tesoro) pits is as follows: 
Tesoro Central and Tesoro North-East 
deposits is 0.41% copper for ore reserves 
and 0.31% for mineral resources; the Mirador 
deposit is 0.30% copper for ore reserves 
and 0.15% for mineral resources. The cut-off 
grade applied to oxides contained in the 
Centinela Concentrates deposit (processed 
separately as Run-of-Mine leach, or ROM) 
is 0.20% copper for ore reserves and 0.15% 
copper for mineral resources. For 2014 the 
mineral resource model has been updated 
with 91 drill holes for 30,500 metres, 
all in the Centinela Concentrates deposit.
The Centinela integrated ore reserves 
increased by a net 89 million tonnes after 
depletion of 41 million tonnes, and the 
integrated mineral resources by a net 
93 million tonnes. The increase is mainly 
due to changes in the Esperanza Sur pit 
design, taking into consideration updates 
to the resource model, geotechnical design 
and economic parameters in the period. 
The Centinela Cathodes ore reserves are 
made up of 99 million tonnes at 0.66% 
copper of heap-leach and 109 million tonnes 
at 0.30% copper of ROM ore.
C) ANTUCOYA 
Antucoya is 70% owned by the Group. 
The cut-off grade applied to the determination 
of ore reserves is approximately 0.2% copper, 
with 0.15% copper used as a cut-off grade 
for mineral resources. 
Pre-stripping continued in the Antucoya 
pit during 2014, with no depletion of ore 
reserves or mineral resources in the period. 
Ore reserves have increased by 46 million 
tonnes due to changes in the cut-off 
grade strategy, taking into consideration 
an increased copper price assumption and 
changes to the geo-metallurgical model. 
Mineral resources have remained 
virtually unchanged. 
D) MICHILLA 
During 2014 the Group increased its 
ownership in Michilla to 99.9% (from 74.2% 
in 2013). Its operations comprise open 
pit mines, underground mines and other 
workings. The cut-off grade applied to the 
determination of ore reserves and mineral 
resources is 0.38 % copper for open pit, 
1.2% copper for the Estefanía underground 
mine and 0.8% copper for other workings.
Ore reserves decreased by a net 6 million 
tonnes, including depletion of 4 million 
tonnes. Plant feed was 4.5 million tonnes, 
with the difference coming from ore not 
considered in the mine plan. 
Mineral resources decreased by 1 million 
tonnes. The mineral resources estimate 
for Michilla includes several resource block 
models, incorporating the multiple deposits 
on the property.
Not included in the mineral resources 
estimate is the spent ore deposited on site. 
This is material that is removed from the 
dynamic heap-leach pads after the primary 
leach cycle is completed. During 2014, 
8.4 million tonnes of spent ore at a grade of 
0.26% was processed through the secondary 
leaching process. 2.6 million tonnes of this 
material was from the dynamic leach pads 
(re-leaching of part of the ore processed 
during 2014) and 5.8 million tonnes from 
the existing spent ore dump.
E) ENCUENTRO 
Encuentro is 100% owned by the Group. 
The cut-off grade applied to the determination 
of mineral resources for both oxides and 
sulphides is 0.15% copper.
Total mineral resources have decreased by 
53 million tonnes, with updates to the cost 
model used in the optimisation process 
more than offsetting the increase in copper 
price used. 
F) POLO SUR 
Polo Sur is 100% owned by the Group. 
The cut-off grade applied to the determination 
of mineral resources for both oxides and 
sulphides is 0.20% copper. 
Total mineral resources have decreased by 
66 million tonnes, with updates to the cost 
model used in the optimisation process more 
than offsetting the increase in copper price 
used. The 2014 resource model incorporates 
information from 9,900 metres of additional 
drilling in 36 drill holes.

offsetting the increase in copper price used. 
H) MIRADOR (EX-MIRADOR SULPHIDES)
Mirador is 100% owned by the Group. 
A portion of the Mirador oxides are subject 
to an agreement between the Group and 
Centinela, whereby Centinela purchased the 
rights to mine the oxide ore reserves within 
an identified area. The ore reserves and 
mineral resources subject to the agreement 
with Centinela are reported in the Centinela 
Cathodes section. The cut-off grade applied 
to the determination of mineral resources for 
oxides is 0.15% copper and for sulphides is 
0.20% copper.
Total mineral resources have decreased by 
67 million tonnes, with updates to the cost 
model used in the optimisation process 
more than offsetting the increase in copper 
price used. 
I) LOS VOLCANES (EX-CONCHI)
Los Volcanes is 51% owned by the Group. 
The cut-off grade applied to the determination 
of mineral resources for both oxides and 
sulphides is 0.20% copper. Los Volcanes was 
upgraded to Mineral Resources in mid 2014.
Total mineral resources have increased by 
45 million tonnes, with updates to the cost 
model used in the optimisation process only 
partially offsetting the increase in copper 
price used.
J) TWIN METALS MINNESOTA LLC 
At year end the Group had a 40% interest in 
Twin Metals Minnesota LLC (“Twin Metals”), 
with the remaining 60% held by Duluth 
Metals Limited (“Duluth”). In November 
2014 Antofagasta entered into a binding letter 
of agreement to acquire 100% of Duluth. 
The acquisition completed subsequent to the 
year-end following approval from Duluth’s 
shareholders in January 2015. Accordingly, 
subsequent to the year-end the Group has a 
100% interest in Duluth and as a result of this 
a 100% interest in Twin Metals.
The Maturi and Maturi Southwest deposits 
have been incorporated in the pre-feasibility 
study completed by Twin Metals during 2014. 
The nearby Birch Lake and Spruce Road 
deposits were not part of the pre-feasibility 
study. Twin Metals has a 70% interest in the 
Birch Lake Joint Venture (“BLJV”) which 
holds the Birch Lake, Spruce Road and Maturi 
Southwest deposits, as well as a portion of 
the main Maturi deposit. The prices used for 
the Twin Metals resource estimate remain 
unchanged from 2013.
The cut-off grade applied to the determination 
of mineral resources is 0.3% copper, which 
when combined with credits from nickel, 
platinum, palladium and gold, is deemed 
appropriate for an underground operation. 
In the resource table “TPM” (Total Precious 
Metals) refers to the sum of platinum, 
palladium and gold values in grammes per 
tonne. The TPM value of 0.57 for the Maturi 
resource estimate is made up of 0.15 g/tonne 
platinum, 0.34 g/tonne palladium and 
0.08 g/tonne gold. The TPM value of 0.30 
for the Maturi Southwest resource estimate 
is made up of 0.08 g/tonne platinum, 
0.17 g/tonne palladium and 0.05 g/tonne 
gold. The TPM value of 0.70 g/tonne for 
the Birch Lake resource estimate is made 
up of 0.19 g/tonne platinum, 0.41 g/tonne 
palladium and 0.10 g/tonne gold. The Spruce 
Road resource estimate does not include 
TPM values as they were not assayed for.
Total Mineral Resources increased by 
26 million tonnes, all in the Maturi deposit, 
mostly as a result of new information from 
a drill campaign in the upper portion of 
the deposit being incorporated into the 
2014 Resource Model. 65 drill holes were 
added to the database for the 2014 mineral 
resource estimate.

MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATES 
AT 31 DECEMBER 2014
168 | Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 K) OTHER MINERAL INVENTORY 
In addition to the Mineral Resources noted above, the Group has interests in other deposits located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, some of 
them containing gold and/or molybdenum. At the moment they are in exploration or in the process of resource estimation. The potential quantity 
and grade of each of the deposits is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define these deposits as mineral resources, 
and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a mineral resource. These include: 
(i) In the Centinela Mining District
Llano-Paleocanal is 70% owned by the Group, as part of the Centinela operation. The Mineral Inventory of the deposit (incorporating both 
oxide and sulphide mineralisation) is estimated to be in the range of 90 to 140 million tonnes with grades in the range of 0.6% to 0.4% copper. 
The table below details the deposit with its associated tonnage and grade ranges, the number of drill holes and associated metres drilled, as well 
as the Group’s ownership interest:

(ii) In the Michilla District 
In the Michilla District there are several satellite deposits to the main Michilla ore body that have been included in the Mineral Resources Table. 
However, there is at least one other deposit within a potentially economic radius of the Michilla mine: Rencoret, owned 100% by the Group.

(iii) In the El Abra District 
The Group has two mineral deposits within a few kilometres of the El Abra ore body, located near Calama in the Antofagasta Region of Chile. 
Los Volcanes (ex-Conchi) is a porphyry copper mineral deposit (with oxide and sulphide mineralisation), which was upgraded to a Mineral 
Resource during 2014, while Brujulina is an exotic-style mineral deposit (oxide mineralisation only). The Mineral Inventory of the remaining 
Brujulina deposit, owned 51% by the Group, is estimated to be in the range of 50 to 80 million tonnes with grades in the range of 0.65% to 
0.53% copper.

L) ANTOMIN 2 AND ANTOMIN INVESTORS 
The Group has an approximately 51% interest in two indirect subsidiaries, Antomin 2 Limited (“Antomin 2”) and Antomin Investors Limited 
(“Antomin Investors”), which own a number of copper exploration properties in Chile’s Antofagasta Region and Coquimbo Region. 
These include, among others, Penacho Blanco, Los Volcanes (ex-Conchi) and Brujulina (see Note k(iii) above). The remaining approximately 
49% of Antomin 2 and Antomin Investors is owned by Mineralinvest Establishment (“Mineralinvest”), a company controlled by the Luksic family. 
Further details are set out in Note 38(d) to the financial statements.

NOTES
(i) The production and sales figures represent the actual amounts produced and sold, not the Group’s share of each mine. The Group owns 60% of Los Pelambres, 70% of Centinela, 
70% of El Tesoro and 99.9% of Michilla.
(ii) Los Pelambres produces copper and molybdenum concentrates, Centinela produces copper concentrate and copper cathodes and Michilla produces copper cathodes. The figures for Los 
Pelambres and Centinela Concentrates  are expressed in terms of payable metal contained in concentrate. Los Pelambres and Centinela Concentrates are also credited for the gold and silver 
contained in the copper concentrate sold.
(iii) Cash costs are a measure of the cost of operational production expressed in terms of dollars per pound of payable copper produced. Cash costs are stated net of by-product credits and include 
tolling charges for concentrates at Los Pelambres and Centinela Concentrates. Cash costs exclude depreciation, financial income and expenses, hedging gains and losses, exchange gains 
and losses and corporation tax.
(iv) Realised copper prices are determined by comparing revenue from copper sales (grossing up for tolling charges for concentrates) with sales volumes for each mine in the period. 
Realised molybdenum and gold prices are calculated on a similar basis. Realised prices reflect gains and losses on commodity derivatives, which are included within revenue.
(v) The totals in the tables above may include some small apparent differences as the specific individual figures have not been rounded.

OTHER INFORMATION MINING INDUSTRY
Brownfield project A development or exploration project in the vicinity 
of an existing operation.
By-products  
(credits in copper  
concentrates)
Products obtained as a result of copper processing. 
Los Pelambres and Centinela Concentrates receive 
credit for the gold and silver content in the copper 
concentrate sold. Los Pelambres also produces 
molybdenum concentrate.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration process, 
such as flotation or gravity concentration, which 
involves separating ore minerals from unwanted 
wasted rock. Concentrates require subsequent 
processing (such as smelting or leaching) to break 
down or dissolve the ore minerals and obtain the 
desired elements, usually metals.
Contained copper The proportion or quantity of copper contained 
in a given quantity of ore or concentrate.
Copper cathode Refined copper produced by electrolytic refining 
of impure copper by electrowinning.
Cut-off grade The lowest grade of mineralised material 
considered economic to process and used in the 
calculation of ore reserves and mineral resources.
Flotation A process of separation by which chemicals in 
solution are added to materials, some of which are 
attracted to bubbles and float, while others sink. 
This results in the production of concentrate.
Grade A 
copper cathode
Highest-quality copper cathode (LME registered 
and certified in the case of Centinela Cathodes 
and Michilla).
Greenfield project The development or exploration of a new project 
not previously examined.
Heap-leaching A process for the recovery of copper from ore. 
The crushed material is laid on a slightly sloping, 
impermeable pad and leached by uniformly trickling 
(gravity fed) chemical solution through the beds 
to ponds. The metal is then recovered from the 
solution through the SX-EW process.
JORC Joint Ore Reserves Committee of Australia.
Leaching The process by which a soluble mineral can be 
economically recovered by dissolution.
LOM or Life-of-Mine The remaining life of a mine expressed in years, 
calculated by reference to scheduled production 
rates (ie comparing the rate at which ore is 
expected to be extracted from the mine to current 
defined reserves).
Mineral resources Material of intrinsic economic interest occurring 
in such form and quantity that there are reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic extraction. 
Mineral resources are stated inclusive of ore 
reserves, as defined by JORC.
MW Megawatts (one million watts).
Open pit Mine working or excavation that is open 
to the surface.
Ore Rock from which metal(s) or mineral(s) can 
be economically and legally extracted.
Ore grade The relative quantity, or percentage, of metal 
content in an ore body or quantity of processed ore.
Ore reserves Part of Mineral Resources for which appropriate 
assessments have been carried out to demonstrate 
that at a given date extraction could be reasonably 
justified. These include consideration of and 
modification by realistically assumed mining, 
metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors.
Oxide and 
Sulphide ores
Different kinds of ore containing copper. Oxide ore 
occurs on the weathered surface of ore-rich 
lodes and normally results in the production of 
cathode copper through a heap-leaching process. 
Sulphide ore comes from an unweathered parent 
ores process and normally results in the production 
of concentrate through a flotation process which 
then requires smelting and refining to produce 
cathode copper.
Payable copper The proportion or quantity of contained 
copper for which payment is received after 
metallurgical deduction.
Porphyry A large body of rock which contains disseminated 
chalcopyrite and other sulphide minerals. 
Such a deposit is mined in bulk on a large scale, 
generally in open pits, for copper and its by-
product molybdenum.
Run-of-Mine 
(“ROM”)
A process for the recovery of copper from ore, 
typically used for low-grade ores. The mined, 
uncrushed ore is leached with a chemical solution. 
The metal is then recovered from the solution 
through the SX-EW process.
Stockpile Material extracted and piled for future use.
SX-EW Solvent-Extraction and Electrowinning. A process 
for extracting metal from an ore and producing pure 
metal. First the metal is leached into solution; the 
resulting solution is then purified in the solvent-
extraction process; the solution is then treated in an 
electrochemical process (electrowinning) to recover 
cathode copper.
Tailings dam Construction used to deposit the rock waste which 
remains as a result of the concentrating process 
after the recoverable minerals have been extracted 
in concentrate form.
TC/RCs Treatment and refining charges, being terms used 
to set the smelting and refining charge or margin 
for processing copper concentrate and normally 
set either on an annual basis or on a spot basis.
Tolling charges Charges or margins for converting concentrate  
into finished metal. These include TC/RCs,  
price participation and price sharing for 
copper concentrate and roasting charges 
for molybdenum concentrate.
tpd Tonnes per day, normally with reference to the 
quantity of ore processed over a given period 
of time expressed as a daily average.
Underground mine Natural or man-made excavation under the surface 
of the ground.

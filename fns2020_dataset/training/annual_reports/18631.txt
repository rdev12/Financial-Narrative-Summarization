Since formation in 1991 our clear vision has been the creation of value 
through active and entrepreneurial management and risk-controlled
development of property assets.
As a knowledge and skill based business we identify properties, through
careful stock selection and research of the local market place, where 
we can generate a good return on capital employed over an average 
three year timescale.

Market Hall, a historic and listed building, also provides 
a popular traditional covered market of some 100 stalls. halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002 3
This approach enables us to react quickly to changing market conditions 
and take advantage of regional opportunities throughout the UK and is
reflected in our current focus on the retail sector.
Our admission to AIM in 2001 has provided the Company with additional
resources, and we continue to seek opportunities to further expand our
equity base.

I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress
in our first full year as an AIM listed company. This was
achieved against a background of a global economic slowdown
and extremely volatile stock markets, all exacerbated by the
terrible events of September 11th.
The UK economy slowed rapidly in the final quarter of 2001
but appears to have avoided recession. The most recent CEBR
forecast indicates GDP growth of 1.5% in 2002 and 2.1% in
2003. The direct property market again performed well and for
the second year running was the top performing asset class in
the UK with total returns of 6.7% in the calendar year 2001.
For the year to 30th April 2002 the Company’s profit before
tax rose from £849,000 to £1,151,000, an increase of 36%.
Earnings per share were 5.34p, a reduction from last year’s
restated figure of 7.66, but this reflected the substantially
higher number of ordinary shares in issue compared with the
average number last year. Net asset value per ordinary share,
based on the pro forma unaudited balance sheet, rose by 13% 
from 68.9p to 77.6p. These results are fully analysed in the
Financial Review.
Following the interim dividend of 0.5p per share paid on
14th February 2002, the directors are proposing a final dividend
of 0.75p per share for the year ended 30th April 2002. Subject 
to approval at the Annual General Meeting this will be paid 
on 27th September 2002 to shareholders on the register on
30th August 2002. The Board’s stated intention is to pursue 
a progressive dividend policy. In an era of low inflation
investors are likely to be increasingly attracted to companies
offering sustained income growth in addition to capital growth
and that is precisely what we aim to deliver.
As you will see from the Chief Executive’s Review and 
the Operational Review the last twelve months have seen an
extremely high level of transactional activity. As Chairman I am
conscious that this has put a tremendous workload on my
executive colleagues and indeed on all of our staff. As I would
have expected they have coped with this in exemplary fashion.
Delivering value to shareholders in the coming years remains
your Board’s fundamental objective and I know that everyone 
at Halladale understands this and will strive hard to achieve it.
Our Annual General Meeting takes place in Glasgow on 
10th September 2002. Although there is always a certain
amount of formal business to be conducted I do regard the
AGM as an important opportunity for communication between
shareholders and the Board. I look forward therefore to
welcoming as many of you as possible at this year’s meeting.

chairman’s statement “For the year to 30th April
2002 the Company’s profit before tax rose from
£849,000 to £1,151,000, an increase of 36%.
Earnings per share were 5.34p. Net asset value per

fred shedden, non-executive chairman 6 halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002
The year under review has been one of substantial activity and
significant achievement on all fronts, despite a background of
international turbulence and economic slowdown in the UK 
and elsewhere.
Within the UK property market there is a clear differential
between the occupier market where tenant demand is weak,
particularly for offices, and the investment market where there 
is strong demand from institutional and private investors.
There has been a distinct improvement in sentiment towards
property, influenced by its recent outperformance of equities
and gilts and a perception that bricks and mortar represent a
safe investment in uncertain times.
Property
It has been an active year for the Company and this is demon-
strated by transactions totalling £82m this year compared to
£34m last year, and a 92% increase in the portfolio under
management to £116m at 30th April 2002. We are pleased that
this is also reflected in the 36% increase in profit before tax to
£1.151m this year and a 13% increase in proforma NAV to 77.6p
at the year end.
Total acquisitions of £63.5m during the year will provide
interesting asset management opportunities which should
contribute to profit in future years. Disposals of £18.23m during
the year took advantage of strong investor demand and were
also consistent with our strategy of realising profit, once 
the asset management opportunities have been achieved, 
and recycling the capital released into new projects.
With continued strong consumer spending, we believe our
current focus on the retail sector is the right strategy in today’s
market. We continue to favour shopping centres where rental
levels are realistic and provide prospects for growth, but more
importantly where we can identify specific opportunities to 
add value. We are also growing our development and project
management activities recognising, in the present economic
climate, the key risk element is the end occupier. We will only
undertake developments where we have reached agreement
with the end occupier or where local economy supply and
demand factors convince us there will be continued
occupational demand.
The increase in our property activities has required us to
expand our management team and we recruited two asset
managers during the year, based in our Glasgow and London
offices. As the Company grows we are determined to ensure 
we continue to attract the highest calibre of management 
to maintain and enhance the professional standards we 
set ourselves.
Corporate
Our experience as an AIM listed Company has been good 
and there is no doubt it has raised the Company’s profile 
in the market place. The choice of AIM was the right one 
as the regulatory environment is much more suited to a
transaction-orientated company like Halladale. Furthermore,
for as long as the business continues as a trading group, 
the ordinary shares will be eligible for capital gains tax
business asset taper relief.
One of the reasons for seeking a Stock Exchange Listing
was the ability to raise new equity to grow the Company 
and, since Admission on 27th April 2001, we have raised
£722,000 through two share issues, both of which were
associated with the setting up of new joint ventures. The 
first of these in July 2001 was a joint venture with Haworth
Nominees Ltd, a private client of Kleinwort Benson Private
Bank, and involved the acquisition of an existing company
which owned two shopping centres valued at £18.1m. 
The second share issue in January 2002 was to the Bank 
of Scotland in association with the formation of Halladale
Ventures Ltd. This company was established with £1m of 
equity from each of Halladale and the Bank of Scotland,
together with revolving credit facilities and unsecured loan
stock, totalling £33m provided by the Bank. I would take 
this opportunity of extending a warm welcome to all our 
new shareholders.
As well as the new relationships referred to above, we 
have strengthened our existing relationship with Citigroup
Alternative Investments through two new joint ventures, 
one during the year and one since the year end, both of 
which are described in the Operational Review.
In addition to raising £722,000 of new equity on our own
balance sheet since Admission, we have in the same period
also raised £15.6m of new equity off balance sheet for specific
projects through joint ventures. As I explain later, whilst 
joint venture relationships are important to us, this does
demonstrate we have the capacity to initiate and manage a
much bigger portfolio on our own balance sheet. The term 
‘joint ventures’ includes all associate and joint venture
companies as disclosed in Note 12 to the accounts.
chief executive’s review “In the medium term 
the macro picture for the property market should
continue to be good with improving investment
sentiment and a stable background of low inflation
and low interest rates.”
david lockhart, chief executive halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002 7
Strategy
Our core strategy continues to be to create value for share-
holders through active and entrepreneurial management 
and risk controlled development of property assets over 
an average three year timescale.
Increasingly we implement that strategy through joint
ventures and at the year end 53% of the portfolio under
management was in off balance sheet joint ventures. 
This reflects the growing trend in the property industry 
of separating the long term ownership of property assets 
from their management.
We are committed to expanding our joint venture activities
through existing and new relationships. We believe the growing
demand for property as an investment will increase the need 
for innovative and specialist co-investment vehicles and that 
we are well placed with our range of property and financial
skills and experience to set up, in partnership with others, 
and manage these vehicles.
As a consequence, our fee income continues to grow and 
in future years we expect to see that forming a significant part
of our recurring income. Co-investing is also an effective use 
of our capital through incentivised equity returns.
Prospects
In the medium term the macro picture for the property market
should continue to be good with improving investment
sentiment and a stable background of low inflation and low
interest rates.
Occupational demand and the prospects for rental growth
should return as and when the economy resumes normal
growth trends. In the meantime local economic factors vary
across the country and opportunities to add value can still be
identified through careful and well researched stock selection.
We have a strong and committed management team and we
remain determined to drive the business forward through the
next phase of its growth. I believe we can face the challenges
ahead with confidence.
I would like to thank our management team, staff and
professional advisors for their commitment and their hard 
work throughout the year.

Once again property has been the top performing asset class
recording a 6.7% total return during the year to 31st December
2001 as reported by the Investment Property Databank. 
There was no substantial variance between the principal
commercial sectors with retail at 5.5%, offices at 7.6% and
industrial at 8.2%.
Despite the outperformance of property, there has been a
slowdown in rental growth across all sectors. It has been most
severe in the previously buoyant office sector particularly in 
the south east of England.
2002 started with strong demand from debt driven
purchasers and limited interest from the institutions. Over 
the last three months this has changed with new allocations 
to institutional investors increasing the amount of funds
committed to a market already limited in terms of supply. 
If this trend continues it is likely that it will have a positive
impact on capital values despite limited prospects for rental
growth in the short term.
As at 30th April 2002 the total portfolio value was £116m
(2001 – £60.27m). Unit shops represented 25%, shopping
centres 53%, industrials 5% and offices 17%. DTZ valued the
majority of this portfolio at 30th April 2002 with the exception
of Queen Street, Glasgow which was valued by Knight Frank,
Glasgow. The properties at Brentwood and those comprising
the Scottish Retail Portfolio referred to below were valued at
cost due to their acquisition being so close to the year end.
Acquisitions
Over the last twelve months total acquisitions increased
significantly to £63.5m (2001 – £18.17m) throughout the UK.
The largest was the acquisition, through a joint venture with 
a private client of Kleinwort Benson Private Bank, of Allied
London Retail Trading Ltd. This company owned two shopping
centres in Carlisle and Newton Abbott at a value of £18.1m,
reflecting an initial yield of 8%. The two centres offer attractive
opportunities to add value by restructuring long leasehold
interests, refurbishments including extensions to the centres
and regearing existing leases. 
We purchased the shopping centre in Woodley, Reading 
for £7.585m, at an initial yield of 9.5%. The Centre comprises 
14 unit shops, an anchor foodstore let to Waitrose, 17,000 sq. ft. 
of office accommodation and 7 residential units and offers
interesting asset management opportunities which are being
pursued. This acquisition is our second joint venture with
Citigroup Alternative Investments.
The Chapel High Shopping Centre, Brentwood, was acquired
for £7.25m, at an initial yield of 8.4%, and is the first project
through Halladale Ventures Limited our new joint venture with
Bank of Scotland. This dated shopping centre comprises
approximately 70,000 sq. ft. retail on two levels, a vacant
cinema and a 66,000 sq. ft. vacant office tower above, together
with associated multi-storey car parking. The Centre presents
major asset management and redevelopment opportunities
which are being worked up in discussion with the Council. 
A portfolio of four retail properties in Ramsgate, Reading,
Fleet and Southampton and two offices in Glasgow and
Uxbridge was purchased at a price of £14.14m, at an initial 
yield of 8.7% and since the year end we purchased, through
Halladale Ventures Ltd, a Scottish Retail Portfolio located in
Barrhead, Erskine, Inverness and Glasgow at a price of £11.5m
and an initial yield of 8.2%. Both portfolios present good
opportunities to add value through break up, rent reviews 
and relettings.
Since the year end the Company has also acquired, in its
third joint venture with Citigroup Alternative Investments, 
a high quality portfolio of 15 properties for £32m at an initial
yield of 7.56%, with asset management opportunities. Twelve
of the properties are located in England and three in Scotland
and they comprise six retail units, two retail warehouses, 
two trade counters, one office and four industrial units.
Disposals
During the year we completed sales totalling £18.23m 
(2001 – £15.22m) at a surplus over book cost where we had
implemented our planned asset management strategy. These
included a mixed portfolio of eight properties for £8.79m.
In Glasgow’s West End we sold a site for £2.07m to a
residential builder, which we had assembled from a number of
ownerships and for which we had procured a planning consent
for 16 new luxury flats. We also sold a vacant site adjacent to
one of our industrial estates in Glasgow to an industrial
developer for £500,000.
We took advantage of the strong demand for small retail
investment, and sold ten retail properties individually in the
year for a total of £6.57m. 
Finally, as part of the Queen Street, Glasgow development
referred to below, we sold to a student residence developer 
the airspace required for that development for £302,000.
Development & Asset Management
Our largest project in Queen Street, Glasgow, should be
completed later this year and the newly constructed building
will comprise 20,000 sq. ft. of retail, a 180 student residential
development which has been forward sold, and 23 high quality
city centre flats with basement car parking. The flats were
recently marketed and the majority of them are either under
operational review “The past twelve months 
has been particularly successful in terms of a 
very significant increase in the assets under
management which now provide many interesting
opportunities to add value in the next few years.”

offer or legally contracted for sale. There is also a good level 
of interest in the retail space which provides large floor plates
close to the prime shopping in Buchanan Street.
Planning permission was granted, after appeal, to redevelop
part of the shopping centre in Daventry. Demolition has 
recently commenced and work will shortly start to construct
10,000 sq.ft. of new retail space, with nine new maisonettes
above. Completion is expected later this year and there is
already a good level of tenant interest, with the maisonettes 
all under offer for sale. Planning consent was also obtained 
to redevelop the Craigshill Shopping Centre in Livingston 
to create 6,000 sq. ft. of additional retail space.
At Woolwich, planning permission has been granted 
to develop a 3.8 acre site comprising a terrace of trade 
counter units, a drive-thru restaurant and car showroom. 
The development is being carried out in partnership with 
Tilfen Ltd. who own the site and it is hoped to commence 
later this year with a number of key pre-lets in place.
The office development at Queens Road, Reading, has 
been affected by the slowdown in tenant demand for South
East offices. Part of the building was let during the year 
and the balance of the space continues to be marketed.
We purchased a small site in Rutherglen jointly with a 
local housebuilder and work has recently commenced on site 
to construct six new residential units, with strong interest 
from potential owner occupiers.
Our subsidiary company, L’Etoile Developments Ltd, has
entered into an exclusivity agreement with Kent County Cricket
Club to promote the development of a hotel adjacent to the
cricket ground and this is currently being marketed. L’Etoile
have also been appointed as project managers for hotel
developments in Cambridge and Hackbridge near Croydon. 
Future Activities
With limited rental growth prospects across most sectors,
performance will depend on the strong asset management
skills that the Company possesses. The past twelve months 
has been particularly successful in terms of a very significant
increase in the assets under management which now provide
many interesting opportunities to add value in the next 
few years.
The large retail element in the Company’s portfolio will
benefit from strong consumer spending and the fast improving
sentiment by investors towards this sector. Property is
perceived by both private and institutional investors as a
particularly attractive asset class and this position is likely 
to continue over the next twelve months.

Operating performance
There are two main reasons why the Group’s operating 
profit has increased only marginally from £3.64m in 2001 to 
£3.70m, while pre-tax profit has improved from £849,000 in
2001 to £1.151m this year. Firstly, there has been a high level 
of property trading in the year which saw property sales 
of £18.23m (2001 – £15.22m) from 21 properties (2001 – 
17 properties) contributing a profit at the operating level of
£1.85m (2001 – £1.39m). Many of these sales completed in 
the early part of the year resulting in reduced rental income
until the proceeds were reinvested and consequently is a 
timing issue. The second reason is the increased emphasis on
joint venture projects in the year, as referred to in the Chief
Executive’s Review, fees from which contributed significantly 
to the increase in other income from £264,000 in 2001 to
£570,000 this year. Accordingly, although at 30th April 2002 
the total annualised rent roll under management, including
properties owned by joint venture vehicles, was £8.44m, only
properties with an annual rent roll of £3.65m were accounted
for on balance sheet. Properties held in 50% Joint Venture
companies, where the Company accounts for 50% of the
attributable rental income, increases the sum attributable 
to the Company by £0.78m. As a result of both these factors,
rental income fell from £3.74m in 2001 to £3.38m. A full year of
additional costs relating to the Company’s listed status, along
with an overall increase in activity and staffing levels saw
administration costs increase from £1.75m in 2001 to £2.1m. 
The net interest cost in the year, excluding the share of
interest payable by associated companies, fell from £2.82m 
in 2001 to £2.65m. The decrease is a result of falling interest
rates, to the extent that the Company benefits from floating
rates as explained below, as well as reflecting the level 
of property trading. The average interest rate on property 
debt at 30th April 2002 was 7.29% compared to 7.97% at 
30th April 2001.
The increase in pre-tax profit is a combination of the above
factors and the net share of profits and losses of associate
companies of £79,000 (2001 – £19,000). 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share this year are 5.34p compared to 7.66p 
in 2001. Although this shows a decrease this is solely due to 
the fact that the average number of ordinary shares in issue
immediately before flotation on 27th April 2001 was 4,000,000,
increasing to 16,812,500 through the flotation by 30th April,
2001, giving an average number of shares of 4,140,410. This
year’s figure and calculation, on the same basis as last year, 
is only marginally distorted by the issue of shares in the year
due to the comparatively small size of the new share issues 
and their respective timing.
Adjusted shareholders’ funds
As in previous years, a proforma balance sheet has been
prepared to reflect the difference between properties carried 
at cost and their open market value based on a valuation by
DTZ Debenham Tie Leung at 30th April 2002. This is required
as, in accordance with accounting convention, all of the Group’s
properties are held as trading stock and therefore at cost. The
uplift to valuation is necessary to provide a meaningful figure of
net assets per share. This uplift, reflecting value of properties
held as stock on the Group balance sheet, as well as taking
account of the Group’s share of properties held as stock in 
the balance sheets of associate companies, shows adjusted
shareholders’ funds of £14.05m (2001 – £11.53m) and this is 
the figure referred to in these accounts as ‘proforma’. The
proforma balance sheet and information does not form part of
the financial statements and is unaudited, although the only
change between this and the statutory balance sheet is the
revaluation of properties as explained above.
The impact on net assets per share is in the table below:

Proforma Net Assets 14,053 77.6 halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002 11
The Company made two new share issues in the year, 
as referred to in the Chief Executive’s Review, which had a
marginally dilutive effect on net asset value per ordinary share.
800,000 shares were issued at 59p per share in July 2001, and
495,000 shares were issued at 50.5p per share in January 2002.
Borrowings, gearing and banking
At 30th April 2002 the Group had total borrowings of £41.13m
(2001 – £41.71m) including £5.23m relating to developments 
in progress, and cash in hand of £1.91m (2001 – £3.06m).
Gearing at 30th April 2002 was 479% (2001 – 559%) on a 
statutory basis and 279% (2001 – 332%) on a proforma basis. 
These figures have been increased through the structuring of
the non-recourse debt of a joint venture arrangement fully on
balance sheet. This has increased gearing at 30th April 2002 
by 70% on a statutory basis and by 40% on a proforma basis.
Of total property borrowings, £16.33m is at fixed rates
averaging 8.16% p.a and the balance is at floating rates, based
either on LIBOR or base rate, at an average rate of 6.65% p.a.
Additionally there is an unsecured loan of £2.25m (2001 –
£2.25m) from The Throgmorton Trust plc, a shareholder in the
Company, amortising over four years at a fixed rate of 8% p.a.
The Group requires to retain flexibility on timing of
repayment of debt to allow active trading and minimise interest
rate breakage costs. A balance continues to be struck between
this and securing protection over exposure to interest rate
movements. Accordingly at the year end 45% of total group
debt is at fixed rates, with the balance benefiting from current
lower rates of interest.
FRS 13
As last year a full report on the use of derivatives and other
financial instruments under FRS 13 is contained in Note 17. 
This shows a fair value adjustment for the current year of 
£1.1m (2001 – £1.2m). After tax this adjustment would reduce
net assets per share by 4.25p (2001 – 5p). The main factor in
this figure for both years, is a loan from Sun Life of Canada
maturing in 2014 at a fixed rate of 10.29% p.a. The Company 
has no current intention to seek to make early repayment of
this debt, other than in accordance with the amortisation 
in terms of this facility.
FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’
As explained in Note 2, the Company has reflected the impact
of FRS 19 by making full provision for all timing differences
between accounting and tax treatments of items in the
accounts. Previously the requirement was only to provide
where it was reasonably expected that timing differences would
reverse in the foreseeable future. The main items provided for
are accelerated capital allowances (where historically certain
properties had been held as fixed assets) and depreciation. 
The Company had provisionally made prudent provisions for
deferred tax and accordingly the overall impact at 30th April
2002 is minimal. It should be noted that 2001 comparatives in
this report are shown at their restated amounts in accordance
with Note 2 of the accounts.

directors’ report
The directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 30th April 2002.
1. Activities and future prospects
The principal activities of the Group are trading, asset management and development of property located throughout the UK. 
A full review of the Group’s business and results for the year is contained in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review,
Operational Review and Financial Review, which should be read in conjunction with this report.
2. Results and dividends
The Group profit for the year after taxation and minority interest amounted to £938,076. An interim dividend of 0.5p per share,
amounting to £88,176, was paid in February 2002 and it is proposed that a final dividend of 0.75p per share, amounting to
£135,806, be paid in September 2002. This leaves a surplus of £714,094 to be transferred to reserves.
3. Share capital
The changes to share capital during the year principally relate to two new issues made in the year as detailed in Note 19 of the
accounts.
4. Substantial shareholders
As at 30th April 2002, the only substantial interests notified to the Company of 3% or more of the allotted and fully paid ordinary
shares of the Company were as follows:
Shares held %
3i Group 4,345,000 24.00
The Throgmorton Trust plc 2,812,500 15.53

George S. Lockhart Trust for Niece & Nephews* 1,000,000 5.52
Frank Nominees Limited 800,000 4.42
* these shareholders are considered to be related.
5. Power to allot shares 
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting resolutions will be proposed to increase the directors’ power to allot, at any time
during the following five years, shares equal to up to 10% of the issued share capital, otherwise then on a pre-emptive basis.
6. Corporate governance
The Company’s shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market and it is therefore not required to comply with the provisions
of the Combined Code. The Board is however committed to ensuring that proper standards of corporate governance operate and 
has established governance procedures and policies that are considered appropriate to the nature and size of the Group.
Internal Control
The directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control, the key elements of which are as follows:
• Board Procedures to establish the controls within which management operate
• The measurement of Group financial performance on a monthly and project-by-project basis against budget. On a quarterly
basis this reporting is formalised within a report circulated and considered by the Board.
• A system of authorisation and approval of expenditure, together with relevant cheque signatory limits has been put in place. 
Directors’ Responsibilities
Details of the composition of the Board are disclosed in this report. The non-executive directors are independent of the Company.
Board meetings are held on average every two months, where a formal schedule of matters including, inter alia, overall strategy
and monitoring of financial performance, are discussed.
On 27th April 2001 two committees were established. The Minutes of these committees are circulated and reviewed by the
directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three non-executive directors who have a remit to meet at least twice a year to monitor 
the Company’s financial reporting and accounting policies and the adequacy of internal financial controls. The Committee also
reviews interim reports, preliminary announcements and the Annual Report and Accounts prior to their submission to the Board. halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002 15
directors’ report continued
6. Corporate governance (continued)
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three non-executive directors and meets at least once a year to determine the
remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the executive directors of the Company. In particular, the Remuneration
Committee sets the level of discretionary bonus payments to each of the executive directors, based on pre-set performance criteria.
The total sum paid in bonus to the executive directors for the year to 30th April 2002 was £100,000.
Additionally, the full Board acts as the Nomination Committee to consider, when necessary, the appointment of any new
directors or Company Secretary.
Going Concern
After making due enquiry, the directors are of the opinion that at the time of approving the accounts, taking into account available
bank facilities, the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The accounts
have therefore been prepared on the Going Concern basis.
7. Directors
The present membership of the Board is set out on pages 12 and 13.
The directors who retire from office by rotation under Article 24 of the Articles of Association are A.C. Shedden and K.F. Lindsay.
Being eligible, their re-election is recommended by the Board at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The directors’ interests, as defined in the Companies Act 1985, in the shares of the Company at 30th April 2002 are as follows:

Companies Act 1985.
9. Payment of suppliers
It is the Company’s payment policy with all suppliers to settle outstanding accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions

8th July 2002  statement of directors’ responsibilities
16 halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002 17
independent auditors’ report to the members of halladale group plc
We have audited the financial statements of Halladale Group plc for the year ended 30 April 2002 which comprise the profit and
loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the statement of total recognised gains and losses and the
related notes 1 to 25 together with the consolidated reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds, statements of movements
in reserves, reconciliation of net cash to movement in net debt and notes to the consolidated cash flow statement. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibility is to audit
the financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company
and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year as described in the
contents section and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the Group,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 
30 April 2002 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

notes to the financial statements
Year ended 30th April 2002
1. Accounting Policies
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular
accounting policies adopted by the directors, which have remained unchanged from the previous year other than as detailed 
in Note 2, are described below.
(a) Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment
properties held in associate companies, and in accordance with all applicable accounting standards. 
The Company has applied two new accounting standards, FRS 18 and FRS 19, during the year. The adoption of FRS 19 Deferred
Tax has required a change to the accounting treatment of deferred tax, and the prior year results have been restated accordingly
(see Note 2). The impact of the adoption of FRS 18 Accounting Policies is detailed in Note 2. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 
30th April 2002 (Note 12). Associated companies and joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method of accounting. 
This is considered appropriate for the Company’s investments due to the level of involvement of management in the running 
of the respective companies. No profit and loss account is presented for Halladale Group plc as provided by S230 of the 
Companies Act 1985. 
(c) Income recognition
Turnover is recognised on the sale of land and buildings at the date of completion of the contract.
(d) Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost in equal instalments over their
estimated useful lives. The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Furniture and equipment 15% straight line
Computer equipment 25% straight line
Motor vehicles 25% straight line
(e) Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost. Other investments are stated at cost less provision for any permanent
diminution in value.
(f) Stocks
Properties held for re-sale or development are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents
the estimated sales price less costs estimated to be incurred up to the date of disposal.
(g) Interest capitalisation
For properties in the course of development, interest is capitalised in stocks up until the date of Practical Completion. From that
date, interest is charged against profit.
(h) Goodwill
Goodwill is capitalised in the year in which it arises and amortised over its estimated useful life. The directors regard 10 years 
as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful life of existing goodwill. Capitalised goodwill on a fair value basis relating to
joint ventures is included within the carrying value of the joint venture.
(i) Deferred taxation
In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet
date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current
tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in
periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences
arising from the revaluation of investment properties where there is no commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
(j) Hire purchase
Assets held under hire purchase agreements and the related obligations are recorded in the balance sheet at the fair value of 
the assets at the inception of the agreements. The excess of the payments over the recorded obligations are treated as finance
charges which are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the periods of 
the leases. halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002 25

Year ended 30th April 2002
2. Restatement of comparatives
Deferred tax
The adoption of FRS 19 Deferred Tax has required a change to the accounting treatment of deferred tax and the prior year results
have been restated accordingly as follows:
(a) Balance sheet
Deferred Profit and
tax provision loss account
££
As previously reported at 30 April 2001 66,431 (822,428)
Adoption of FRS 19 at 30 April 2001 107,873 (107,873)
30 April 2001 restated 174,304 (930,301)
Under FRS 19 the Company is required to make full provision for deferred tax in respect of timing differences recognising in total
the potential future tax impact of past transactions. Under SSAP 15 provision for deferred tax was only required if it was expected
that timing differences would reverse in the foreseeable future.
(b) Profit and loss account

ordinary activities

Adoption of FRS 19 (85,000) 85,000
Year ended 30 April 2001 restated 48,780 800,267
The adoption of FRS 19 has resulted in increasing the profit and loss account tax charge and reducing profit after tax by £85,000 in
the year ended 30 April 2002.
Revaluation of investments in subsidiary companies
At 30th April 2002 the Company changed its accounting policy relating to the revaluation of investments in subsidiary companies.
Investments were previously stated at valuation based on the net asset value of underlying subsidiaries adjusted for the uplift of
stocks to Open Market Value. As the Group policy is to carry properties held for resale at cost, the directors feel that it is more
appropriate to carry investments on a similar basis. The effect of this is to eliminate the revaluation reserve in Halladale Group plc,
the Company, only and there is no impact on current or prior year results in the consolidated accounts.

Reconciliation of tax charge
The standard rate of current tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax is 30% (2001 – 30%). The actual tax
charge for the current and prior years is less than 30% for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation:
2002 2001
£000 £000
Profit before tax 1,151 849

10. Earnings per share
Earnings per share are calculated on the Group profit after tax and dividend to preference shareholders and minority interest,
divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, as follows:
2002 2001
Profit Number of shares Pence per share Profit Number of shares Pence per share
Restated Restated

£p£p
Earnings per share 938,076 17,569,116 5.34 316,788 4,140,410 7.66
There are no dilutive potential ordinary shares. Accordingly basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.
The fall in earnings per share in the year is a result of the fact that admission to AIM took place on 27th April 2001, before which
date there were only 4,000,000 ordinary shares in issue. Therefore at 30th April 2001 the average number of ordinary shares was
only 4,140,410 whereas at that date the actual number of shares in issue was 16,812,500.

17. Financial assets and liabilities
The Group holds financial instruments only to manage the interest rate risk arising from its borrowings. As all transactions are
undertaken in sterling and within the UK, there is no perceived currency risk. No speculative transactions are permitted.
The Group’s borrowings are, other than one loan of £2,250,000, wholly in relation to and secured by properties held as stock.
Accordingly a relatively short term view is required to be considered when reviewing the interest rate risk. This risk is managed by
securing a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt and by the use of interest rate swaps. The actual balance of these measures is
determined by the nature of the asset to which the borrowing relates and is established and reviewed in consultation with the
relevant lender.
The Group has defined financial assets and liabilities as those of a financial nature, being cash and borrowings. Short term
debtors and creditors, taxation and prepayments and accruals are not considered.

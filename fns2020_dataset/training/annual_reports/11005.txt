Chairman’s Statement
2011 was an excellent year for NetplayTV. Following the 
restructuring at the end of 2010, the year started very well, 
gathered momentum and ultimately exceeded expectations.
With the correct internal structure in 
place and costs ﬁrmly under control at 
the start of the year we were able to 
concentrate on developing the core 
revenue drivers behind the business. 
This involved investing heavily in 
marketing with a particular emphasis on 
TV advertising. This advertising proved 
increasingly successful as the year 
progressed resulting in four impressive 
quarters of KPI growth and three proﬁt 
upgrades during the year. I believe we 
have a great team of people working 
at NetplayTV and their enthusiasm and 
hard work combined with our USP of 
live TV casino has helped us deliver 
such a strong set of results. I want to 
thank all of our staff for their hard work 
this year.
In October after working closely with 
Channel 5 for two years we signed a 
new ﬁve year partnership agreement 
to continue broadcasting seven nights 
a week, thereby securing one of the 
key channels for customer acquisition 
for Supercasino.com until 2016. This 
was a milestone for the Group as it 
illustrates not only the strength of the 
SuperCasino brand, but also that the 
commercial relationship between the 
companies is creating value for both 
parties and that the brand SuperCasino 
is going from strength to strength. 
The new agreement incorporates the 
existing post midnight teleshopping 
airtime which in turn is complimented 
by a signiﬁcant amount of pre midnight 
advertising spots.
In December the Group launched 
its iPad application to add to the 
already successful iPhone application 
and the uptake so far has been very 
encouraging. We see mobile and tablet 
as one of the key growth drivers for 
the Group in 2012 and we are uniquely 
positioned through our TV presence 
to exploit the potential of this rapidly 
growing market.
I am extremely happy with the 
Company’s performance in 2011 and 
I am pleased to report that 2012 
has commenced strongly with Q1 
KPIs ahead of both Q1 2011 and 
Q4 2011. Furthermore, the Group is 
making progress with its share capital 
reorganisation, which if approved will 
create positive distributable reserves 
which will in turn facilitate the potential 
introduction of a future dividend policy. 
We are in a good position to drive 
shareholder value from our existing UK 
business whilst continuing to consider 
newly regulated market opportunities.

Non-Executive Chairman 
23 April 2012 04 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 BUSINESS MODEL
Business Model
The NetPlayTV business model is focused 
around the online casino gambling market 
with TV customer acquisition as the key 
differentiating factor. The Group operates 
with a combination of propriety front-
end technology and third party back-end 
software. NetPlayTV offers its customers 
licensed games with the added layer of its 
live TV casino games broadcast on over 
30 hours of terrestrial television per week.
Our approach differentiates NetPlayTV 
signiﬁcantly from its competitors. The 
high level of exposure on TV creates 
strong brand awareness and trust and 
loyalty with its customers. This has 
resulted in some of the highest player 
values and player retention rates in the 
market.
The TV coverage acts as a unique 
marketing tool and is ﬁlled with 
continual calls to action, attracting 
new customers to open an account. 
Customers see the live roulette show on 
TV then have the option of opening and 
funding an account either via traditional 
telephone, web, smartphone or tablet. 
Once the account is opened the 
customer has the choice of playing the 
live games broadcast on television or 
any of the other games on the website. 
All games are available 24 hours a day 
and not just while the show is being 
broadcast. 
NetPlayTV is focused on two brands, 
Supercasino.com on Channel 5 and 
Jackpot247.com (previously known as 
Challengejackpot.com) on ITV. The 
commercial agreements with these 
broadcasters are structured in such a 
way that both parties beneﬁt as the 
performance of the brand improves. 
This ensures NetPlayTV and the 
broadcaster act in partnership with a 
common goal rather than a straight-
forward airtime purchase.

 The group plans to launch a dedicated Android application in

NetPlayTV operates from its own state of the art TV studios 
which were fully refurbished in 2010. The running of the live 
TV casino shows are largely a ﬁxed cost. The Group is trading 
well above this ﬁxed cost base allowing a high percentage of 
incremental revenue to ﬂow straight to EBITDA*. 
*   EBITDA is a non-GAAP, company specific measure and excludes share based payment charges described in note 26 and exceptional charges described in

 TV PARTNERSHIPS
  NetPlayTV broadcasts in excess of 
30 hours per week on two of the 
UK’s leading TV broadcasters. The 
Group also undertakes commercial 
advertising on these channels as 
well as other terrestrial, digital and 
cable channels. This strategy delivers 
extensive viewer reach to target 
potential new customers.
 PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION & 
INNOVATION
  NetPlayTV is the only company 
offering live TV casino on terrestrial 
television channels in the UK. The 
Group controls all front end customer 
interfaces including iPhone and iPad 
which are seeing significant growth 
and already accounts for over 15.9% 
of all SuperCasino players. The Group 
sees its mobile and tablet as a very 
strong growth area for 2012 with 64% 
of people who own a tablet, watching 
TV and using the device at least once 
a week known as dual screening*. 
 DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER 
ACQUISITION CHANNELS
  The Group will develop other 
acquisition channels, such as the 
affiliate network, display, pay per click 
and SEO marketing.
 NEW MARKETS
  Europe is experiencing rapid change 
with many countries opening up, 
going through the process of 
regulating online gambling and issuing 
licenses.
  CONTINUED FOCUS ON CORE LIVE 
TV CASINO
  The Group intends to increase UK 
market share by leveraging existing 
broadcaster relationships and 
expanding commercial advertising to 
compliment the core Teleshopping 
airtime. It also sees significant growth 
in the ability to target customers 
watching TV who have a smartphone 
or tablet live at the same time.
  RETENTION OF EXISTING PLAYERS
  Driving player life-time value and 
with 40.0% of revenues from players 
who have been registered over 12 
months there is significant value 
in the existing customer base. The 
Group has very high retention rates 
and has a dedicated team of account 
managers and retention specialists 
in place alongside the best retention 
tool being that the customer sees 
the brand every night on terrestrial 
TV rather than just traditional email 
marketing.
  NEW MARKETS
  Due consideration will be given to 
newly regulated markets such as 
Italy, Spain, France, Denmark and 
potentially the Netherlands. Not 
all markets will be attractive due to 
onerous tax rates. The Group will only 
look to enter with the right airtime 
partner for that particular country.

Financial Overview
2011 was a record year for NetPlayTV with revenue up 12.4% 
to £22.3m (2010: £19.8m), positive EBITDA* of £3.4m (2010: 
negative EBITDA of £2.8m), profit before tax of £0.6m (2010: 
loss before tax of £14.2m) and net cash from operating activities 
of £2.5m (2010: negative £3.8m).
PRODUCT SEGMENTATION
Casino revenue accounted for £20.6m during 2011 representing year on year growth of 18.6%. Casino EBITDA was £4.6m 
(2010: EBITDA loss of £1.6m). Bingo only contributed £1.7m in revenue for 2011 (2010: £2.5m) and EBITDA of £0.1m (2010: £0.3m).

Other Income 117 –

EBITDA from continuing operations 3,420 (2,779)
During the year the Group continued its strategy of focussing management time and marketing in its core live TV casino 
business and this can be seen by Casino accounting for 97.6% of segmental EBITDA. Overall EBITDA Margin increased during 
the year from negative 14.0% to positive 15.4% 
In 2012 the Group has disposed of its UK Bingo operation for £375,000. This operation was continuing at 31 December 2011. 
The EBITDA from continuing operations excluding the Bingo operation is £3,305,000 (2010: EBITDA loss of £3,111,000).
EXPENSES
Although the Group has seen a 12.4% increase in revenue during the year, expense control remains a key focus within 
the business. Cost of sales have reduced by £1.3m and administrative expenses have reduced by £11.0m. There were no 
exceptional or impairment charges during 2011 (2010: £8.0m).

For comparison purposes, adjusted administrative expenses is £3.7m (2010: £6.0m). This reduction is a result of the 
restructuring carried out at the end of 2010 and management’s continued focus on keeping ﬁxed costs to a minimum and 
linking variable costs, where possible, to performance.
The result of the above increased revenue and reduced costs has increased the Group’s gross proﬁt margin to 31.2% 
(2010: 16.2%) and EBITDA margin to 15.4% (2010: negative 14.0%).
CASH FLOW
The Cash balance at 31 December 2011 is £7.9m (2010: £5.6m) representing an increase of £2.4m. Cash generated from 
operations was £2.5m and is one of the key performance indicators used by the directors in running the business. This 
measure not only reﬂects the liquidity of the Group but also on the EBITDA to cash conversion. The increase of £2.5m during 
2011 was after taking into account £1.2m of prior year restructuring costs. There are no outstanding prior year restructuring 
costs at 31 December 2011. The Adjusted Earnings per Share calculated using net cash generated from operating activities is 
0.89 pence for 2011 (2010: Adjusted loss per share of 1.77 pence).

2011 REVIEW
We started the year with a solid 
management structure in place and 
a clear strategy to deliver continued 
growth in our core live TV casino 
business. I am pleased to announce 
we delivered on every element of 
this strategy which has resulted in 
strong total revenue growth of 12.4%, 
casino revenue growth of 18.6% and 
generated an EBITDA* proﬁt of £3.4m 
compared to an EBITDA loss of £2.8m, 
giving an overall EBITDA margin of 
15.4% (2010: negative 14.0%). Cash 
balances increased by £2.4m during 
the year to £7.9m and the Group made 
proﬁt after taxation of £0.6m (2010: loss 
after taxation of £13.7m).
During the ﬁrst half of the year we 
focused on improving the live product 
offering to enable us to extract 
maximum player acquisitions from our 
existing TV teleshopping post midnight 
airtime on Channel 5 and ITV1. This 
strategy proved to be successful and 
the results were clearly demonstrated 
by the interim results posting both 
a very healthy EBITDA of £1.7m and 
positive cash ﬂow of £0.5m. 
The second half of the year was 
mostly about continued product 
development whilst also looking to 
new channels for customer acquisition. 
After a successful trial advertising 
campaign on pre midnight airtime 
across multiple terrestrial and digital 
channels the Group increased its TV 
advertising expenditure signiﬁcantly 
from July onwards. By leveraging our 
strong broadcaster relationships we 
were able to optimise our advertising 
spend and maximise acquisition of 
players by linking the adverts with the 
existing post midnight airtime on both 
Channel 5 and ITV1. The beneﬁt of this 
increased advertisement spend can be 
seen in strong H2 revenue growth of 
10.3% compared with H1 and resultant 
EBITDA of £1.7m and an increase in cash 
ﬂow of £1.9m.
We spent a lot of time during the year 
working closely with our broadcast 
partners looking at ways to improve 
efﬁciency of TV as a medium for 
acquiring new customers and it was 
a real endorsement of our live TV 
casino product to sign a new ﬁve year 
deal with Channel 5 in October. In a 
market that is highly competitive for 
new customer acquisitions this puts the 
Group in a very strong position knowing 
it has secured one of its main marketing 
channels for the next ﬁve years. 
It has also been a year in which the 
mobile industry has seen huge growth 
in the sale of smart phones and 
NetplayTV has positioned itself to 
ensure it takes maximum advantage 
of this exponential growth and 
the resultant changes in consumer 
behaviour when interacting with 
smartphones and tablets while watching 
TV. 
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
2012 has started strongly with Q1 
new depositing customer acquisitions 
up 69.9% year on year and 34.3% 
quarter on quarter with active 
depositing players up 43.9% and 23.0% 
respectively. This resulted in average 
daily casino revenue growth of 20.3% 
year on year and 8.5% quarter on 
quarter. 
Since the year end we disposed of our 
UK Bingo business allowing the Group 
Casino revenue

18.6

Cash and cash 
equivalents

to focus on the core live TV casino 
business where the marketing strategy 
is paying off and yielding much higher 
returns on investment.
The Group launched its Supercasino.
com iPad application in December 2011 
and in March 2012 launched iPhone 
and iPad for Jackpot247.com. Both 
brands have beneﬁted from this launch 
and we expect to see strong quarter 
on quarter growth from customers 
accessing our brands via mobile and 
tablet while we continue to invest in 
this area of product development and 
take advantage of our unique position 
of acquiring customers watching TV 
directly into the smartphone and tablet 
applications.
The Group have started the process of 
a capital reduction to create positive 
distributable reserves. The special 
resolution was passed at an EGM on 
3 April 2012 and the court hearing to 
conﬁrm the capital reduction will take 
place on 2 May 2012. If approved, this 
will give the board greater ﬂexibility 
when considering its future dividend 
policy.
We are conﬁdent the Group has strong 
growth opportunities in the UK and 
can continue to take market share. 
Whilst driving growth in the business 
is a key focus of the Board we are at 
the same time keeping a close eye on 
the European markets that are going 
through a process of regulation. We will 
look for broadcast partners in markets 
where we can leverage our existing 
ﬁxed cost base and where the tax 
rates makes sense to build long term 
shareholder value.
We are excited about 2012 and are 
looking forward to building further on 
the positive momentum and successful 
results of 2011.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
23 April 2012 12 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 DIRECTORS' REPORT
The directors present their annual 
report together with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2011.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
During the year, the Group provided 
interactive casino and bingo services to 
consumers in the UK and Europe. 
BUSINESS REVIEW
A review of activities during the year, 
year end position and commentary on 
future developments is given in the 
chairman’s and chief executive ofﬁcer’s 
statements.
Details of risks facing the Group and 
policies to manage these risks can be 
found below.
Details of the performance of individual 
business segments can be found in note 
2 to the ﬁnancial statements.
The Group’s KPIs of revenue, new 
depositing casino players and active 
depositing casino players can be found 
in the Financial Overview on page 8.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The results for the year, showing a 
proﬁt after taxation of £642,000 (2010: 
loss after taxation of £13,708,000), are 
set out on page 20.
The directors do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: 
no dividend proposed).
POLITICAL AND CHARITABLE 
DONATIONS
During the year the Group made 
donations of £2,908 to UK charities 
(2010: £6,873).
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Details of the Group’s ﬁnancial risk 
management objectives and policies 
are included in note 23 to the ﬁnancial 
statements.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Group disposed of its UK Bingo 
operation on 29 February 2012. 
At a general meeting held on 3 April 
2012 a resolution was proposed and 
passed, subject to the conﬁrmation of 
the High Court of Justice in England 
and Wales the share premium account 
of the Company be reduced. 
Full details of these subsequent events 
are given in note 31 to the ﬁnancial 
statements.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business model is set out 
on page 4, ﬁnancial overview on page 
8, and current trading and outlook set 
out in the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s 
statement on page 10. 
The Group’s budget and forecasts, 
taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, 
show that the Group should be able 
to function entirely from its cash 
generated from operations. The Group 
is currently funded entirely through 
shareholders funds. 
After making enquiries, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the 
annual report and ﬁnancial statements.
DIRECTORS
The directors who served during the 
year and to the date of this report were:
C A N Butler
G Templer (resigned 31 March 2011)
C Jones CBE
A C Lapping
T S Mickley
G P Stevens
EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES
Employee equity interest is seen as an 
integral part of the total remuneration 
package for employees. A more 
detailed review of the Group’s share 
schemes is contained in note 26 to the 
ﬁnancial statements.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY
Whilst no formal code is followed, 
the Group agrees payment terms and 
conditions with individual suppliers. 
It is the Group’s policy that payments 
to suppliers are made in accordance 
with the terms and conditions agreed 
between the Group and its suppliers, 
providing that all trading terms and 
conditions have been complied with.
The Group’s average trade payable days 
for the year ended 31 December 2011 
was 30 days (2010: 26 days), calculated 
in accordance with the requirements set 
down in the Companies Act 2006. This 
represents the ratio, expressed in days, 
between the amounts invoiced to the 
Group by its suppliers in the year and 
the amounts due, at the year end, to 
trade payables within one year.
PRINCIPAL RISKS RELATING TO THE 
BUSINESS OF THE GROUP
Casino risk
The Group is exposed to gaming risk in 
relation to its casino operations. Whilst 
the Group’s casinos and other games 
incorporate a ‘house edge’ designed 
to provide a return to the Group over a 
large number of bets, in the short term 
the Group’s casinos and other games 
may experience losses.
Wagering limits are in place to mitigate 
the Group’s exposure to individual 
transactions.
Regulatory risk
During the year, the Group’s gambling 
activities were operated under a 
licence under the Alderney Gambling 
Control Commission, the Lotteries 
and Gambling Authority in Malta 
and the UK Gambling Commission. 
A number of brands were relocated 
to Alderney in 2010, where all of 
the Group’s gaming operations are 
now based. The regime under which 
Alderney permits remote gaming 
operations to be operated within its 
jurisdiction may be altered or restricted 
Directors’ report 13
through legislation in Alderney which 
renders the Group’s operating base 
unusable or uneconomic. In addition, 
territories where the Group wishes to 
market its Alderney based gambling 
services may impose restrictions upon 
remote gambling services which would 
restrict the Group’s ability to market 
to potential customers in that territory 
or to service existing customers by, 
for example, restricting ﬁnancial 
transactions.
Where such restrictions exist, or come 
into existence in the future and/or 
in each case are actively enforced, 
the Group may not be able to offer 
its gambling or gaming services, or 
may be required to seek on-shore 
gambling and gaming licences local 
to these territories. Restrictions on 
promotion or the operation of remote 
gambling and gaming services in any 
particular location might also diminish 
or inhibit the Group’s ability to secure 
distribution in such territories.
It is not considered likely that any such 
changes in legislation will be made at 
the present time.
Reputational risk
Under-age and problem gaming are 
inherent risks associated with the 
online gaming industry and the Group 
is no exception. The Group devotes 
considerable resources to putting in 
place prevention measures coupled 
with strict internal procedures designed 
to prevent under-aged players from 
accessing its real money sites. In 
addition, the Group promotes a safe 
and responsible gaming environment 
to its customers supplemented by its 
corporate culture.
The Group has full GamCare 
Certiﬁcation for Supercasino.com 
and Jackpot247.com. The GamCare 
Certiﬁcation was awarded due to high 
levels of social responsibility and player 
protection. As the leading provider 
of advice, practical help, support and 
treatment for anyone affected by 
problem gambling, GamCare is ideally 
placed to offer practical advice on 
player protection. GamCare supports 
the development and implementation 
of responsible policies and practice 
across the gambling industry and 
GamCare Certiﬁcation is the mark of 
best practice.
GamCare puts gaming companies 
through a rigorous social responsibility 
and player protection assessment 
process. This includes review of 
customer-facing areas of business, such 
as age veriﬁcation practices and staff 
training in social responsibility.
Taxation risk
The Group aims to ensure that each 
legal entity within the Group is a tax 
resident of the jurisdiction in which 
it is incorporated and has no taxable 
presence in any other jurisdiction. While 
the Group’s customers are located 
predominantly in the UK, certain 
jurisdictions may seek to tax such 
activity which could have an adverse 
effect on the amount of tax payable by 
the Group or on customers’ behaviour. 
The UK Government announced in 
the 2012 Budget that it would move 
to tax remote gambling on a place 
of consumption basis. HM Treasury 
ofﬁcially opened the consultation 
period on 5 April 2012 and this will 
close on 28 June 2012. The Group is 
undertaking a full review to examine 
how such a ﬁscal policy would affect 
its results. The Group does not expect 
such a tax to be introduced until 
December 2014, at the earliest.
All gaming activities are based in 
Alderney, where the Group currently 
beneﬁts from a zero corporate tax rate 
and is outside the scope of UK VAT. 
If there was a change in the rate of 
corporate tax or VAT in Alderney or in 
UK legislation such that the Alderney 
subsidiary had a place of establishment 
in the UK for VAT purposes this would 
have an adverse effect on the overall 
tax rate of the Group.
Information Technology risks
As a leading online business, the 
Group’s IT systems are critical to its 
operation. The Group is reliant on the 
performance of these systems. Cutting-
edge technologies and procedures are 
implemented throughout the Group’s 
technology operations and designed 
to protect its networks from malicious 
attacks and other such risks. These 
measures include trafﬁc ﬁltering, 
anti-DDoS (Distributed Denial of 
Service) devices, anti-virus protection 
from leading vendors and other such 
means. Physical and logical network 
segmentation is used to isolate and 
protect the Group’s networks and 
restrict malicious activities. In order to 
ensure systems are protected properly 
and effectively, external security scans 
and assessments are carried out in 
a timely manner. The Group has a 
high-end storage solution to ensure 
storage availability and performance. 
All critical data is replicated to another 
storage device for disaster recovery 
purposes and all data is stored off-site 
on a daily basis. In order to minimise 
dependencies on telecommunication 
service providers, the Group invests in 
network infrastructure redundancies 
whilst regularly reviewing its service 
providers.
The Group takes information 
technology risks seriously and keeps 
its policies under review in order to 
mitigate these risks.
Dependence on third parties
Due to the nature of live broadcasts, the 
Group’s business is highly dependent 
on broadcasters, networks, software 
providers and mobile operators, as 
well as other service providers who, for 
example, provide payment processing  14 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 DIRECTORS' REPORT
and customer age and ID veriﬁcation. 
If there is any interruption to the 
products or services provided by other 
third parties or if there are problems in 
supplying the products or services, the 
Group’s business could be adversely 
affected.
By its nature this risk is not within the 
Group’s control. To mitigate this risk the 
Group takes care to select third parties 
that are reputable and reliable, and 
ensures that contractual agreements 
with key third parties offer adequate 
protection to the Group.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN 
RELATION TO THE COMPANY’S 
AUDITOR
The directors who held ofﬁce at the 
date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report conﬁrm that, so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and each director 
has taken steps that ought to have been 
taken as a director to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
BDO LLP have expressed their 
willingness to continue in ofﬁce and 
a resolution to reappoint them will 
be proposed for the annual general 
meeting in accordance with Section 489 
of the Companies Act 2006.

Corporate governance
The Board has given consideration to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) applicable for 
listed companies for ﬁnancial periods 
after 29 June 2010.
Although companies traded on AIM 
are not required to provide corporate 
governance disclosure, or follow 
guidelines in its Code, the directors 
have chosen to provide certain 
information on how the Group has 
adopted various principles of the Code.
BOARD
At the date of this report, the Group 
board was made up of one executive 
and four non-executive directors. Under 
the Company’s Articles of Association 
a director shall retire from ofﬁce at the 
ﬁrst annual general meeting after his or 
her appointment and one third, but not 
exceeding one third, of the directors 
are required to retire by rotation each 
year.
The board meets regularly throughout 
the year and all directors have full 
and timely access to the information 
necessary to enable them to discharge 
their duties. There is a scheduled board 
meeting at least every second month 
and a meeting of the management 
board every month. Additional board 
meetings are held as required.
During the year, the Board met 8 times 
and the following attendance occurred:
C Jones CBE 8
C A N Butler 8
G Templer 3
G P Stevens 8
A C Lapping 7
T S Mickley 7
The board is assisted in the discharge 
of its duties by the following board 
committees:
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee, which comprises 
three non-executive directors: 
G P Stevens who chairs the Audit 
Committee; C Jones; and A C Lapping. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that the ﬁnancial performance 
of the Group is properly reported on 
and monitored, and for overseeing 
the operation of internal ﬁnancial 
controls appropriate to the size and 
operations of the Group. The Audit 
Committee meets twice a year to 
review the results, the ﬁndings of 
the auditors, the independence and 
objectivity of the auditors, and the 
internal controls. It also reviews the 
application and appropriateness of the 
Group’s accounting policies, including 
any changes to ﬁnancial reporting 
requirements brought about by both 
external and internal requirements 
and it gives consideration to all major 
ﬁnancial announcements made by 
the Group including its interim and 
preliminary announcements and annual 
report and accounts.
The external auditors and other 
executive directors may be invited to 
attend the meetings.
During the year the Audit Committee 
met three times. G P Stevens and 
A C Lapping attended all meetings and 
C Jones attended one of the meetings.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee (“the 
Committee”), which comprises three 
non-executive directors: G P Stevens 
who chairs the Committee; C Jones; 
and A C Lapping. The Committee 
has the principal function of agreeing 
with the board the framework and 
policy for the remuneration of the 
Group’s executive management and 
determining, on behalf of the board, 
the remuneration packages of the 
executive directors. The Committee 
also determines the policy on executive 
appointments. 
No member of the Committee has any 
personal ﬁnancial interest (other than 
as a shareholder), conﬂict of interest 
arising from cross-directorships or 
day-to-day involvement in running the 
business. No director plays a part in any 
discussion about his own remuneration.
The chief executive ofﬁcer may be 
invited to attend certain discussions of 
the Committee.
During the year the Remuneration 
Committee met twice. G P Stevens and 
A C Lapping attended both meetings.
REMUNERATION POLICY AND 
ARRANGEMENTS
The objective of the remuneration 
policy is to ensure that the executive 
directors and managers of the 
Group are provided with appropriate 
incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance and are, in a fair and 
reasonable manner, rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success 
of the Group. Each director is assessed 
individually so that their remuneration 
is directly related to their performance 
over time and so that a proportion 
of their remuneration is performance 
related.
There are ﬁve main elements of the 
remuneration package for executive 
directors: 
(i) Basic salary:
  An executive director’s basic salary 
is determined by the Committee 
before the start of each year and 
when an individual changes position 
or responsibility. In deciding 
appropriate levels, the Committee 
seeks to be competitive, but fair, 
using information obtained from 
both internal and external sources. 17
(ii) Performance related annual bonus:
  Performance related annual 
bonuses are designed to reward 
contribution and to encourage the 
achievement of targeted levels of 
performance over the short term. 
The maximum annual cash bonuses 
are set by the Committee and 
are subject to stretching targets 
linked to the Group’s operating 
performance in the year. 
(iii) Long-term incentive arrangements:
  The Company’s long term incentive 
arrangements are intended to 
encourage directors and other key 
employees to focus on long term, 
strategic corporate objectives and 
to further align the interests of 
management and shareholders. 
These arrangements consist of an 
Enterprise Management Incentive 
Scheme (“EMI”), an Inland Revenue 
approved share option scheme 
and an Inland Revenue unapproved 
share option scheme. Details 
of these schemes are outlined 
in note 7 and 26 to the ﬁnancial 
statements.
(iv) Pension arrangements:
  The Group does not operate a 
pension scheme for employees; 
however it does make contributions 
to personal pension plans.
(v) Other benefits:
  Other beneﬁts for executive 
directors include a private health 
care scheme.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
C A N Butler has a service agreement, 
dated 29 January 2010, which is 
terminable on six month’s notice by 
either party.
In the event of early termination, 
the directors’ contracts provide for 
compensation up to a maximum of basic 
salary plus the fair value of beneﬁts to 
which the directors are contractually 
entitled for the unexpired portion of 
the notice period. The Company seeks 
to apply the principle of mitigation in 
the payment of compensation on the 
termination of the service contract of 
any executive director.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
All non-executive directors have speciﬁc 
terms of engagement, the dates of 
which are set out below. There are no 
provisions for compensation payable in 
the event of early termination. The non-
executive directors are appointed for 
an initial period of one year, following 
which the notice period is three months.

T S Mickley 1 November 2010
The determination of the non-
executive directors’ remuneration has 
been delegated by the board to the 
executive directors, within the limits 
set by the Articles of Association. The 
fees paid to the non-executive directors 
in the year, shown in note 7 to the 
ﬁnancial statements, are inclusive of 
the additional work performed for the 
Group in respect of membership of the 
board committees. At the 2004 Annual 
General Meeting, shareholder approval 
was granted to allow non-executive 
directors to participate in the Group’s 
unapproved share option scheme.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Group is committed to ongoing 
communication with its shareholders. 
At the Annual General Meeting, 
individual shareholders are afforded the 
opportunity to question the board.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The board has overall responsibility 
for the system of internal control 
established by the Group and 
places considerable importance 
on maintaining a strong control 
environment. However, such a system 
is designed to identify, manage and 
mitigate rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Key elements of the Group’s system of 
internal control are as follows:
 Financial management
  Annual budgets are prepared for 
each business division and for the 
Group. These budgets are reviewed 
and agreed by the board and actual 
performance is measured against 
these budgets on a regular basis. 
Monthly management accounts are 
prepared, reviewed, analysed and 
presented to the board. The Group 
has in place documented authority 
levels for approving purchase 
orders, invoices and all bank 
transactions.
 Company management
  The executive directors meet 
regularly to monitor and evolve 
the Group’s strategic direction, 
including product offerings and 
routes to market. In addition, the 
chief executive conducts regular 
management meetings to ensure 
that the strategy is cascaded 
throughout the Group’s operations 
and is being acted upon accordingly.
 Risk analysis
  The Group maintains a 
comprehensive risk register. The 
board approves annual updates and 
appropriate risk mitigating action 
plans. 18 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare ﬁnancial statements 
for each ﬁnancial year. Under that 
law the directors have elected to 
prepare the Group and Company 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law 
the directors must not approve the 
ﬁnancial statements unless they are 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the proﬁt or 
loss of the Group for that period. The 
directors are also required to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on the 
Alternative Investment Market. 
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, 
the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the finan-
cial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufﬁcient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁnancial position of 
the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
WEBSITE PUBLICATION
The directors are responsible for 
ensuring the annual report and the 
ﬁnancial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements 
are published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of 
ﬁnancial statements, which may vary 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website is the 
responsibility of the directors. The 
directors’ responsibility also extends 
to the ongoing integrity of the ﬁnancial 
statements contained therein. 19
Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of 
NetPlay TV plc

of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and company statements

parent company ﬁnancial statements, 
as applied in accordance with the

Notes to the financial statements
1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Reporting entity
NetPlay TV plc is a public limited company which is listed on AIM and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2011 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’ and individually as ‘Group entities’). The Company ﬁnancial statements deal 
with the parent as a standalone entity.
The Group is primarily involved in the provision of TV and internet gambling services.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in 
relation to the ﬁnancial information of NetPlay TV plc and its subsidiaries.
Basis of preparation
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as 
adopted for use in the EU. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made 
up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating 
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any 
deﬁciency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is credited to proﬁt or loss in 
the period of acquisition.
The proﬁts or losses of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The results of those 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue for the casino & bingo divisions represents gross bets and wagers less player winnings in the ﬁnancial year.
Revenue for the discontinued mobile division (which was discontinued in 2010) is the aggregate amount of revenue derived 
from the provision of end user mobile telephony services supplied to customers. Revenue from mobile telephony services is 
recognised upon delivery of media content.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the company’s rights to receive payment have been established.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the date of the statement of ﬁnancial position.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
 the initial recognition of goodwill;
 the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and 28 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the financial statements
CONTINUED
1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
 investment in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the 
difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available 
against which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
 the same taxable group company; or
 different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are expected to be settled or recovered.
Pension costs
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for its employees; however it does make contributions to personal pension 
plans. The amount charged to administrative expenses represents the contributions payable to the individuals in respect of 
the accounting period.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which they operate (their “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in statement of comprehensive income.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when 
the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition 
of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating 
the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve. 
Exchange differences recognised as proﬁt or loss in Group entities’ separate ﬁnancial statements on the translation of long-
term monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassiﬁed to other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating 
to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of 
the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items include expenditure that the directors believe is of such a size or nature that it should be shown separately 
on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identiﬁed as the chief executive ofﬁcer. The Group’s segments comprise 
casino, bingo and mobile (the mobile segment was discontinued in 2010). 29
1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed 
prior to 1 January 2010, the Group’s interest in the fair value of identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
and, in the case of business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the 
identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed 
and equity instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition. Changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration 
arising on business combinations completed by this date are treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, result in a 
change in the carrying value of goodwill.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, cost comprised the fair value of assets given, liabilities 
assumed and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree plus, if the business 
combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree. Contingent consideration is 
included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent consideration classiﬁed as a ﬁnancial liability, re-
measured subsequently through proﬁt or loss. For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs 
of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. Where the fair value of identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the 
fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the 
acquisition date.
Customer databases
Externally acquired customer databases are capitalised at cost and are subject to 50% straight-line amortisation. 
Customer databases acquired as part of business combinations are valued by estimating discounted cash ﬂows that will be 
generated by the assets over their lifetime and are subject to 50% straight-line amortisation.
The carrying value of player databases is reviewed when there is an indication of impairment.
Internally generated player databases are not capitalised.
Websites and other development costs
Website and other development expenditure relating to the application and infrastructure development of websites is 
capitalised where the expenditure leads to substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are 
technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufﬁcient resources to complete the development. All other 
development expenditure relating to planning, content development and other operational activities is charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income in the period it is incurred. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it clearly 
increases the economic beneﬁts to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
Website expenses are capitalised at cost and are subject to 50% straight-line amortisation. The carrying value of websites is 
reviewed when there is an indication of impairment.
Purchased licences for broadcasting TV channels
Purchased licences for broadcasting TV channels are capitalised at cost and are subject to 10% straight-line amortisation. 
Their carrying value is reviewed when there is an indication of impairment.
Domain names
Externally acquired domain names are capitalised at cost and are subject to 5% straight-line amortisation.
Domain names acquired as part of business combinations are valued by estimating discounted cash ﬂows that will be 
generated by the assets over their lifetime and are subject to 5% straight-line amortisation.
The carrying value of domain names is reviewed when there is an indication of impairment. 30 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the financial statements
CONTINUED
1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Partner relationships
Partner relationships entered into as part of a business combination are valued by estimating discounted cash ﬂows that will 
be generated by the assets over their lifetime and are subject to straight-line amortisation over the life of the relationship. 
Their carrying value is reviewed when there is an indication of impairment.
Internally generated partner relationships are not capitalised.
Investments (Company accounts)
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the fair value of the consideration paid plus share based payments 
incurred to date. Investments that were acquired prior to the Company’s conversion to IFRS are held at cost, where cost is 
the aggregate of the nominal value of the Company’s shares and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the 
share capital of the subsidiary undertakings. Provision is made where there is an impairment in the value of the investment.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated in the statement of ﬁnancial position at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of 
depreciation, as follows:
Computer equipment 33.3% straight line
Fixtures & ﬁttings 33.3% straight line
Leasehold improvements Shorter of the unexpired period of the lease and the estimated useful 
economic life of the assets
The gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is expensed to proﬁt or loss for the period.
Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks or rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to proﬁt or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group 
(“a ﬁnance lease”), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. 
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classiﬁed and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either 
ﬁnancial assets, ﬁnancial liabilities or equity instruments.
Financial assets
Financial assets held by the Group consist of loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They arise principally through the provision of services to customers, but also incorporate other types of contractual 
monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their 
acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at cost less impairment provisions.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculties on the part 
of the counterparty or default or signiﬁcant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due 
under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the 
present value of the future expected cash ﬂows associated with the impaired receivable. Trade receivables are reported net of  31
impairment provisions, with impairment losses being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. On conﬁrmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the 
asset is written off against the associated provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short 
term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and, for the purpose of the statement of cash 
ﬂows, bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of 
ﬁnancial position.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of bank overdrafts, trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument and subsequently at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its 
liabilities.
The Company’s ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity instruments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the expected 
beneﬁts to be derived from contracts are less than the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contracts. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the amounts that are expected to be paid to settle the obligations.
Share based payments
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period.
Where equity settled share options are awarded to parties other than employees in exchange for services performed, the 
fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the 
expected lifetime of the services received by the Group.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at 
each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of 
options that eventually vest. Non-vesting conditions and market vesting conditions are considered when calculating the fair 
value of the options granted.
The fair value of share options issued without market-based vesting conditions is measured by the application of the Black-
Scholes option pricing model by reference to the grant date of the options. The fair value of share options issued with market-
based vesting conditions is measured by use of the Monte Carlo method.
Capital management
The Group had a relatively small amount of debt in 2010 which was repaid in 2011. The group is therefore now funded entirely 
though shareholders funds.
When ﬁnancing is required the board will consider whether debt or equity ﬁnancing is more appropriate and proceed 
accordingly. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Notes to the financial statements

1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are based on historical experience, expectations of future events, and other factors deemed to be 
relevant in the circumstances.
Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired with business combinations
Identiﬁed intangible assets and goodwill are capitalised at fair value when entering into a business combination. Establishing 
the fair value of the assets generally requires use of a technique such as discounting expected future cash ﬂows.
Any process which attempts to estimate future outcomes is subject to uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation 
uncertainty can give rise to material differences in asset carrying values, this will be stated in the relevant notes to the ﬁnancial 
statements.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and their values are written-down on the basis of the 
Group’s expectations of future economic beneﬁts expected to be received by the group.
Any process which attempts to estimate future outcomes is subject to uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation 
uncertainty can give rise to material differences in asset carrying values, this will be stated in the relevant notes to the ﬁnancial 
statements.
Standards and interpretations
None of the new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2011 
are expected to have a material effect on the Group’s future ﬁnancial statements.
2.  SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
Description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues
The Group has reportable segments as follows:
 Casino – this division consists of online casino products. The brands operated in this division are Supercasino.com and 
Jackpot247.com which are aggregated into one reportable segment.
 Bingo – this division runs a number of different online bingo websites operating in the UK and Europe.
 Mobile – this division was discontinued in 2010. Its results are included within note 3.
Factors that management used to identify the Group’s reportable segments
The Group’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. Each segment 
has its own management team. These divisions are managed separately because each business requires different software 
technology and marketing strategies. 
Measurement of operating segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of signiﬁcant accounting 
policies. The Group evaluates performance on the basis of segment EBITDA which is deﬁned as the segment proﬁt or loss 
excluding segment depreciation and amortisation and non-recurring losses, such as exceptional items, intangible asset 
impairment, and the effects of share-based payments. Head ofﬁce costs not derived from operations of any segment and are 
only disclosed in total.
During the year, the Group traded in the following geographical segments: 
 UK (comprising Supercasino.com, Jackpot247.com, and an element of the Bingos.com service) 
 The British Virgin Islands which holds Bingo Domain Names.
 The ‘rest of the world’ segment includes Italy, Spain, Poland and Sweden (comprising an element of the Bingos.com service). 33

Group’s direction. This category of expenses includes items such as ofﬁce closure costs and staff redundancies.
Onerous contracts relate to TV airtime and distribution agreements entered into by the Group which have become loss-
making. Since the Group has been able to establish itself with signiﬁcant presence on terrestrial channels, it rendered 
obsolete some of the existing airtime agreements on non-terrestrial platforms, such as Freeview and Freesat.

£2,564,000 of goodwill arose on the acquisition of NetPlay TV Services Limited and NetPlay TV Broadcasting Limited in 
December 2006. 45
16. GOODWILL (CONTINUED)
The recoverable amount of the SuperCasino cash generating unit, to which the goodwill was allocated, has been determined 
using a value in use calculation. 
The calculation of value in use is based on several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player 
behaviour. The key assumptions of the forecast were as follows:
 number of new player depositing registrations;
 rate of retention of existing players; 
 spending patterns of players; 
 cost per acquisition (CPA) from different acquisition sources;
 the growth rate applied to cash flows arising after the end of approved budgets; and
 the discount rate applied to cash flows.
The above assumptions are based on past experience, as considered appropriate for any external inﬂuences. For example a 
planned increase of marketing activity or TV airtime would be expected to increase player registrations.
Management forecasts cover a 12-month period and, beyond that, a growth rate of 2% is applied to cash ﬂows up to 
60 months. A discount rate of 19.8% has been used.
The directors do not believe that any reasonably possible change in key assumptions would lead to impairment of the carrying 
amount of the SuperCasino cash generating unit.
£1,050,000 of goodwill arose on the business combination due to the acquisition of certain assets from Two Way Gaming 
Limited (“TWG”) and the simultaneously entering into production and gaming contract with VMTV to operate the Jackpot247 
Service.
The calculation of value in use is based on several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player 
behaviour. The key assumptions of the forecast were as follows:
 number of new player registrations;
 rate of retention of existing players; 
 spending patterns of players;
 the growth rate applied to cash flows arising after the end of approved budgets; and
 the discount rate applied to cash flows.
The above assumptions are based on past experience, adjusted as considered appropriate for any external inﬂuences. For 
example a planned increase of marketing activity or TV airtime would be expected to increase player registrations.
Management forecasts cover a 12-month period, beyond that no growth is applied to cash ﬂows. A discount rate of 19.8% has 
been used.
In 2010 the Group disposed of mobile-based SMS subscription quiz services resulting in an impairment charge of £97,000 to 
the income statement and the £916,000 disposal of goodwill cost and accumulated impairment. 46 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group holds several highly desirable domain names which were acquired as part of the Bingos transaction in 2008, 
some of which being .de, .fr and .it domains, are particularly attractive for use in the German, French and Italian markets 
respectively. 
During the year, the directors of the company have considered any indications of impairment and have come to the conclusion 
that there are none.
In 2010, it became apparent that legislation in France and Italy would restrict these domain names from being utilised to 
their full potential. Following an impairment review which took place in 2010 that considered the likely income that would 
be generated from selling or leasing the domain names the decision was taken to reduce the carrying value of a number of 
individual domain names by a total of £2,686,000.
In March 2010 the Group acquired the full rights to the Challenge Jackpot database from Virgin Media Television (“VMTV”). 
As part of this transaction the terms of the production agreement were amended and consequently an impairment charge of 
£985,000 had been expensed in the income statement to fully-impair the asset. In June 2010, notice was given that as of 31 
December 2010 NetPlay TV would cease broadcasting the Challenge Jackpot service on VMTV. Consequently the directors 
re-assessed the value of the VMTV contract as of the date of notice and as at 31 December 2010 the full remainder of the 
carrying value of £682,000 has been impaired. Therefore the total impairment charge in 2010 in relation to the VMTV contract 
was £1,667,000. 47

deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses given the Group’s track record at this time, future deferred 
tax assets will be recognised when the Group has established a track record of expected future taxable proﬁt.

During the year the Company increased its investment in subsidiary undertakings by increasing its capital contribution due 
to Group share based payment arrangements between the parent and its subsidiary. The company impaired its investment 
in NetPlay TV Services Ltd by £11,000 as the company ceased trading in 2010. The company disposed of its investment in 
NetPlay TV Spain SL during the year. 
Mobileworkﬂow Limited a dormant subsidiary in 2010 was formally dissolved in 2011. The movement in reserves represents 
the transfer of Mobileworkﬂow Limited’s merger reserve to retained earnings.
An impairment charge of £3,747,202 was realised in the Company’s 2010 accounts against the carrying value of its investment 
in NetplayTV Marketing BVI Ltd. The trigger event for this impairment was the impairment of domain names by the directors 
of NetplayTV Marketing BVI Ltd explained in note 17. In considering the fair value of the investment the directors took 
into account both the market value of the subsidiary and net asset value and decided the most appropriate method of 
calculating the fair value of its investment to be the net asset value. The impairment charge was therefore realised to bring 
the investment value in-line with the net asset value of NetplayTV Marketing BVI Ltd. Impairment charges were also realised 
in 2010, for the full carrying value of investments in Netlay (Malta) Ltd, Netplay TV Spain SL, NetplayTV Services Ltd and 
NetplayTV Mobile Ltd for the amounts of £87,999, £139,840, £1,701,730 and £426,000 respectively. The trigger event for 
these impairment charges were the companies all ceasing to trade during the year. As all four subsidiary companies had net 
liabilities at the year end the directors considered the fair value of these investments as nil. 48 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT – GROUP
Treasury management
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise cash, along with various items, such as trade receivables and payables. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk. The board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing these risks and the policies adopted have been applied throughout the year and since the 
year end.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufﬁcient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. 
Customer funds are kept in dedicated client accounts, separately from the Group’s operational bank accounts in order to 
ensure that their liability is met.
The board receive information of cash balances daily in order to keep the Group’s liquidity under review. 50 NetPlayTV Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from cash in transit, though this exposure is relatively small 
given that the Group’s payment processors generally hold only a few days’ transactions at any given time.
Credit risk also arises where cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks or ﬁnancial institutions. It is the Group’s 
policy to deposit funds only with reputable institutions, and to keep the position under review.
Quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to ﬁnancial assets are set out below:

Market risk
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations denominated in both sterling and euros.
The Group’s policy, where possible, is to settle liabilities with cash generated from operations denominated in the same 
currency.
The directors receive a daily summary of cash balances held in each currency and regularly monitor the foreign currency risk 
exposure. 51
23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT – GROUP (CONTINUED)

Net current assets 136 82
A strengthening of 10c against sterling at the reporting date would result in an increase/decrease in net assets of £14,000 
(2010: £8,000).
Interest rate risks
The Group currently has positive cash balances and as such does not see interest rate risk as a signiﬁcant issue at the present 
time. The board will regularly review this position and amend their approach where appropriate.
Other risks
There are risks in the market in which the Group operates within; these are detailed below along with the procedures 
implemented in order to mitigate these risks.
Compliance with gambling and TV broadcasting regulations is fundamental to the Group’s success. In order to ensure that the 
requirements of the regulations are met, the Group has a number of staff monitoring the regulations on a regular basis. The 
Group also uses the services of a specialist legal advisor in the ﬁeld and regular consultations are conducted to ensure that the 
group is up to date on regulations in the ﬁeld.
The Group also sees a potential risk of fraud, resulting from customers using counterfeit payment methods and also money 
laundering. In order to mitigate this risk the Group has a dedicated in-house team which monitors unusual customer behaviour 
so to identify fraudulent activity.

£2,356,000 (2010: £1,778,000).
Interest rate risks

 10,679 10,653
During the year, directors and employees exercised a total 2,584,903 share options over ordinary share of 1p.
26. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has four employee share schemes – the 2000 All Employee Share Ownership Plan (“AESOP”), the 2000 Enterprise 
Management Incentive Scheme (“EMI”), the 2000 Approved Executive Share Ownership Scheme (“ASOS”) and the 2000 
Unapproved Share Ownership Scheme (“USOS”). To date, the Group has granted options under the AESOP and EMI schemes.
AESOP
The AESOP holds shares in trust on behalf of employees. Subject to the satisfaction of any performance condition and the 
continuous employment of the beneﬁciary, access to shares occurs three years from the date of grant, unless there is a change 
in control of the Company when access may occur earlier.
A summary of activity in shares issued through AESOP is shown below:

 NUMBER NUMBER
At the beginning of the year 99,933 99,933
Movement in the period – –
At the end of the year 99,933 99,933
The market value of the shares held by the AESOP at 31 December 2011 was £8,744 (2010: £7,295).
EMI
Options to acquire ordinary shares under the EMI may be granted up to a maximum of £3,000,000 (based on the market value 
of the shares placed under option at the date of the grant).
The determination of the number of options granted to employees is at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
No consideration is payable for the grant of an option and options are not transferable or assignable. Cash consideration is 
paid to the Company by the employee at the point that the share options are exercised. The price paid for share options by 
employees is determined at the time of grant, and is normally equal to the mid-market share price on the date that the option 
is granted.
An option is normally exercisable in stages between the 1st and 10th anniversaries of the date of grant. All options normally 
lapse if the option holder ceases to be employed by the Group, though at the discretion of the Company and depending upon 
the circumstances in which the employment has ended, some individuals may be permitted to retain options after they leave 
employment for 6 months, or an alternative timescale if agreed by the remuneration committee. 55

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be writing to you with details of our Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) which we are holding at Battersea 
Studios, 80 Silverthorne Road, London, SW8 3HE at 11.00 a.m. on Thursday 7 June 2012. The formal notice of the AGM is set 
out on pages 62 to 64 of this document and further details about the resolutions contained in the notice are provided below.
If you would like to vote on the resolutions but cannot come to the AGM, please ﬁll in the proxy form sent to you with the 
notice and return it to our registrars as soon as possible. They must receive it by 11.00 a.m. on 5 June 2012.
RECEIPT OF ACCOUNTS 
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to present to the AGM the Reports of the Directors and Auditors and 
the audited accounts of the Company for each ﬁnancial year. Resolution 1 deals with this requirement. 
RE-ELECTION OF BOARD MEMBERS
The articles of association require that one-third of the directors, or if the number is not divisible by three, the number nearest 
to but not exceeding one-third, should retire at each AGM. The director retiring by rotation this year is Andrew Christopher 
Lapping and his re-election to the Board is proposed in resolution 2. 
REAPPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS
The auditors are required to be appointed at each AGM at which accounts are presented. The Audit Committee has evaluated 
the effectiveness and independence of the auditors and, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board 
proposes, as resolution 3, the reappointment of BDO LLP as the Company’s auditors.
AUTHORITY TO ALLOT SHARES AND DISAPPLICATION OF PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS 
In resolution 4 shareholders are being asked to approve the allotment of shares up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount 
of £942,776.60 representing approximately one-third of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The authority to 
be given by this resolution shall be in substitution for all existing authorities but shall be without prejudice to any allotment 
of shares or grant of rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares already made or offered or agreed to be made 
pursuant to such authorities.
Under the provisions of section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 if the directors wish to allot any unissued shares (other than 
pursuant to options granted under an employee share scheme), they must offer them to existing shareholders in proportion 
to their existing shareholdings. This is known as the right of pre-emption. In resolution 5 shareholders are being asked to 
approve the non pre-emptive allotment of shares up to a nominal value of £ 282,832.98, representing 10% of the ordinary 
share capital. Although there are at present no plans to issue any additional shares the Board considers that in the current 
economic climate, it is possible that opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses or assets may arise. It may well be 
necessary to move quickly to take advantage of such opportunities and the Board have therefore concluded that it would be 
prudent to have an authority to issue more shares on a non pre-emptive basis.  61
Notice of Annual General Meeting
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
The directors consider that in certain circumstance it may be advantageous for the Company to purchase its own shares and 
resolution 6 is to authorise the Company to make market purchases of up to 10% (approximately) of its own ordinary shares in 
issue. The authority will expire at the conclusion of the 2013 AGM.
The directors consider it desirable for this general authority to be available to provide additional ﬂexibility in the management 
of the Company’s capital resources. The directors will only rely on the authority if, in light of the market conditions prevailing 
at the time, they believe that any such purchase will enhance earnings per share in the medium to long term and will be in 
the best interests of shareholders as a whole. Any shares purchased under this authority will ordinarily be cancelled and 
the number of shares issued reduced accordingly, though the Company now has the option to hold them as treasury shares 
following changes in company law in the UK. The purchase price will be paid out of distributable proﬁts. The directors intend 
to seek renewal of this power at subsequent annual general meetings.
The directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders as a whole. Your Board will be voting in favour of the resolutions in respect of their shareholdings of 34,730,647 
ordinary shares (representing approximately 12.3% of the current issued ordinary share capital) and unanimously recommends 
that you do so as well.
Yours sincerely

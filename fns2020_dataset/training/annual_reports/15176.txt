P32
It has been a year of great progress for  
your Company. We have a business with an 
integrated offering, a global network of 58 
offices in 18 countries across five continents 
and our operating markets have improved.  
We have gained important market share  
and the geographic, sectorial and personnel 
diversity, scale and shape of the business  
have enabled us to benefit from this improving 
trend in the form of increased profitability 
driven by mainly organic growth.
The UK market specifically has improved 
with the economy now growing at nearly 
3% a year, which is encouraging for  
Sweett Group as our UK business remains 
our largest and most established entity, 
accounting for over 50% of Group turnover 
in the year ended 31 March 2014. I am 
pleased to report that the UK business  
is gaining market share as, in particular,  
our investment in the infrastructure and 
energy sectors has paid off. In addition, 
great progress has been made with larger 
international clients, many of which are  
now using Sweett Group across several 
regions, which is a gratifying trend and 
which is taking us into new markets.
We are two years into our three year strategic 
plan which I am pleased to report has been 
extended by a further year to account for the 
considerable progress made to date and the 
improving markets, particularly in our more 
established geographies, such as the UK. 
As one of the few remaining players who can 
offer a truly independent service with global 
capability, we are in a solid position to benefit 
from the improvements which we see and 
we are well placed to build on the strong 
foundations for the next phase of our growth, 
with a well-established UK and European 
business and a scale position in APAC,  
a segment which has almost doubled in size 
over the last three years and is approaching 
critical mass. The CEO’s review which follows 
this statement goes into more detail around 
the Group’s strategy to 2016.
Financial performance
Revenue for the year was up 10.9%  
to £89.4m (2013: £80.6m) and profit  
before tax was up 59% to £2.8m (2013: 
£1.8m) after exceptionals, amortisation of  
acquired intangibles and net finance costs. 
Stripping out the one off benefit of £1.0m 
from the unwinding of the Australian hedge 
contract, the £1.2m financial close of Leeds 
Social Housing and the sale of hub North, 
underlying profits were £3.2m, up 23% 
(2013: £2.6m). Whilst operating margins 
were down slightly year on year at 2.6% 
(2013: 2.9%), basic earnings per share  
was up 47% to 2.8p (2013: 1.9p).
Net debt at the year-end was further reduced 
to £6.3m (2013: £7 . 1m) and well below the 
peak of £11m in 2012. Much focus has  
been put on improving our working capital 
management, with a priority being placed 
specifically on our needs in APAC.

The Directors have recommended a final 
dividend of 0.8p per share (2013: 0.7p) 
which will make a total dividend of 1.3p for 
the year, an increase of 30% (2013: 1.0p), 
illustrating the Board’s confidence in the 
future of the Group.
Wall Street Journal allegations
The Company has made announcements 
regarding allegations made in the Wall Street 
Journal in June 2013 of improper business 
conduct by a former employee of the Group 
operating in the Middle East. Discussions are 
ongoing with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) 
in the UK and with the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) in the US. The Group is co-operating 
with both these organisations and no 
proceedings have been issued by either  
of them. The Group has commissioned  
a further independent investigation into  
the allegations by Mayer Brown LLP .
In response to the allegations made in  
the Wall Street Journal, the Company  
has identified the need to further improve  
our internal controls and risk procedures, 
particularly in locations where we have fewer 
numbers of staff. A separate governance 
function has been created which will work 
closely with our Finance function, the Audit 
Committee and our internal auditors, KPMG. 
Most importantly, all our clients and staff 
remain loyal and the underlying business  
is not affected.
People
In January 2014, we welcomed Patrick 
Sinclair to the Board as Chief Financial 
Officer. Patrick has already made a positive 
contribution to the business. In addition,  
a number of senior level appointments  
were made during the year including Philip 
Watt joining as Company Secretary in 
September 2013. 
We continue to grow our team and evolve 
employment practices and policies to 
ensure we are able to attract and retain  
the best talent and I was delighted that 
Sweett Group received “Investors in People” 
accreditation in the UK during the year. 
We have an exceptional team of people and 
our success is due to their professionalism, 
creativity and commitment. I would like to 
thank the Sweett Group team in particular 
for their hard work and commitment.
Tenure
Experience
I would also like to thank my Board and senior 
colleagues for their help and support during 
my four years as Chairman. We experienced 
extreme recessionary conditions in our 
traditional markets and various setbacks in 
the first three years, but with a clear strategy 
combined with the professionalism of my 
executive colleagues around the world,  
we have seen the Group through this difficult 
period. I therefore leave at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting with a certain 
amount of pride in what has been achieved 
by them. Also leaving with me at the Annual 
General Meeting will be Nick Woollacott,  
a Non-Executive Director, who has served  
on the Board with great distinction for  
the last seven years and latterly as the 
Senior Independent Director. Nick has  
led the Nominations Committee in 
choosing my successor as Chairman  
and an announcement on this appointment 
will be made shortly.
Outlook
The Group is trading well as we continue to 
gain market share and leverage the benefits 
of our global network while benefiting from 
the improving economic environment in 
some of our key markets. As we move 
forwards with an order book of £109m,  
an improving margin trend and a tighter 
focus on working capital, the Board looks 
to the future with increased confidence.

Business Review
Strategy update
We have an integrated network of  
58 offices in 18 countries across five 
continents offering cost consulting  
and project management. Our service 
supports clients through every stage  
of the project life cycle based upon  
our international expertise and local 
knowledge. Our strength is our people’s 
world-class talent and expertise, through 
which we have time and again delivered 
exceptional results. The strategy builds  
on these key strengths.
We have built a global delivery platform 
having maintained an integrated business 
with a common culture of client service. 
The strategy to build the global platform 
was launched against a background  
of weak home markets in the UK,  
with limited resources to stretch across  
a wide geography. The Group undertook 
to focus on debt reduction and operating 
margin improvement, together with the 
re-allocation of capital towards our fast 
growth operations by disposing of our 
PPP investments. Since this strategy  
was first outlined, we have sold out of six 
PPP investments, releasing in excess of 
£7m of capital which has been invested in 
growing market share in the UK, growth in 
APAC (which has virtually doubled in size 
in the last three years), and in reducing debt, 
which is down from a peak of £11m in 2012.
In many areas we have achieved 
outstanding success and, in extending  
our strategic plan, we have reviewed  
every aspect of the business and the 
markets in which we operate.
One such opportunity is the recovery in  
our home UK markets. Last year I reported 
that we wanted to “Increase our market 
share in our traditional sectors whilst 
expanding further into the energy and 
infrastructure markets”. Our strategy 
appears to have been well timed. Not only 
have we increased our market share  
in these new areas, but we have also 
experienced a general market recovery  
in areas where our business has always 
been traditionally strong. Both margins  
and profitability are up year on year.  
Further scope exists to increase both of 
these as we are still some way off the peak.

 Key Performance Indicators
The Group has now successfully delivered  
on the first two years of its three year strategic 
plan. Given the success we have achieved,  
the Board has evolved and extended the 
Group’s strategy in anticipation of continued 
changes in our market environment. 
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 08 Plan to 2015 Extended Plan 
Integrated global approach
Develop a global corporate  
client base with the ability to  
deliver locally.
Introduction of account management specialists to continue enhancing  
our relationship with global corporate organisations.
Offer a consistent quality of service  
based upon international standards  
whilst sympathetic to local  
market conditions.
Having achieved ISO 9001, Investors In People accreditation, Agresso ERP  
system roll out and Project Management Tool Kit programmes, continue with  
training and process controls platforms across the Group.
Attract and develop key people in  
new sectors and new geographies, 
thereby extending our sector expertise  
and service coverage.
Sweett people have grown in numbers by 7% p.a. in the last two years.  
Continue to attract new people at similar levels, growing with cash flows.
Regional expansion
Europe – Increase our market share  
in our traditional sectors and expand 
further into the energy and infrastructure 
markets. Extend our client base across 
continental Europe.
Further organic growth across our core services with continued expansion into energy 
and infrastructure markets.
Leverage our strength in private and public sectors, to capitalise on our growing 
market share and recovery of UK activity.
Play heavily on our position as independent and specialist provider when set against  
a growing number of multi-disciplinary businesses.
Further invest in efficiency in support costs and service delivery utilisation to outweigh 
increasing wage inflation, further contributing to the net margin.
Middle East, Africa and India – 
Capitalise on the economic recovery in  
the UAE and expand our operations in 
Saudi Arabia and into Oman and Qatar. 
Extend our presence in India from four  
to six regional offices.
Limit Middle East to 10% of Group revenue – continuing to focus on improving  
the breadth and quality of its client base, concentrating main activity in UAE,  
Oman and Qatar.
Controlled organic growth in India, extending our sector coverage and  
geographic expansion.
Asia Pacific – Leverage our existing  
range of services across our existing  
client base whilst extending our 
geographic coverage and sector  
expertise. Extend our exposure  
to new sectors in Australia.
China – controlled expansion of QS offer until lockup reduces, organic growth of PM.
Hong Kong – target higher margin, larger QS projects, organic growth of PM,  
Dispute Resolution and Programming services.
South Asia – Singapore – organic growth of PM in line with market conditions  
and extension of QS service offer. Continue development of the Thailand operation  
as opportunities arise.
Australia – organic growth and targeting of larger, higher margin, projects.
North America – Develop our 
relationships with our alliance partners  
and provide clients with QS expertise  
on both the east and west coasts. 
Continue to develop our joint venture business organically, by concentrating on 
developing all five offices with the joint PM/QS offer by targeting existing client base 
and for international cross referral business.
The theme of the strategy going forward  
is to leverage the global platform we have 
created, encouraging cross-selling into 
new geographies with our larger clients. 
We will be placing more emphasis and 
capital investment into the UK business  
to continue to grow margins and our 
market share. We plan to improve risk 
management in the Middle East and focus 
on a few core markets, whilst limiting the 
Middle East to 10% of the Group’s total 
turnover and improving margins. In India, 
we have a strategy for managed growth. 
Having established a sizeable business  
in APAC, the ongoing focus will be to  
grow from that base by using regionally 
generated cash flows. Managing working 
capital in APAC and across the business 
will remain a strategic priority. The table 
below outlines some of the specifics of 
the strategic evolution:

Market Overview
Europe
Coming off the back of a long and deep 
recession, the UK construction industry  
is now growing and activity levels have 
significantly improved. We believe this 
growth is sustainable as output is 
currently still 14% below peak in 2007. 
Construction forecasts, both in terms of 
volumes and pricing, are being revised 
upwards as the UK economy grows. 
Whilst there continues to be a marked 
difference geographically, there is now 
evidence to support a recovery in many 
regional cities outside London and the 
South East. Industry forecasts, when 
measured against a 2012 base, are 
predicting output growth of circa 6% p.a.  
in each of 2015, 2016 and 2017 and cost 
consultancy and project management 
services come at the front end of the 
cycle. The strongest areas are likely to be 
private commercial and industrial, private 
housing and infrastructure, all sectors 
where we have expertise. The legacy of 
the recession for our industry is the lack  
of human resource capacity available to 
meet rising demand, and whilst this will 
create a challenge for us to attract and 
retain the best people, it will provide an 
opportunity for us to improve margins. It is 
interesting to note that we are now seeing 
a trend beginning to emerge, particularly 
in the UK market, where clients are placing 
increasing emphasis on choosing firms 
which have the right people and right 
experience, as opposed to just on price.
Middle East, Africa  
and India
Middle East: The Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) governments are expected to 
maintain relatively high levels of spending, 
underpinning growth in the non-oil sectors 
of their economies, while continuing  
to post substantial budget and current 
account surpluses. This is yielding a 
healthy economic growth averaging  
4.3% which is most evident in the 
construction and infrastructure arena, 
having always been the largest sector  
in the GCC. With building projects 
collectively amounting to US$62bn 
awarded and US$67bn completed in 
2013, both figures are estimated to  
rise to nearly US$75bn and US$128bn 
respectively. This investment, particularly 
in the areas of housing, education and 
healthcare, is being driven by substantial 
population growth. At the same time, 
private sector real estate is showing signs 
of a comeback after the Dubai real estate 
crash in 2009. This improved economic 
scenario, coupled with a surge in travel, 
has led to a strong growth in the 
hospitality sector with hotels witnessing 
record highs in the revenue per available 
room. In anticipation of major global 
events being hosted in the region, an 
estimated 45,000 additional hotel rooms 
are required in Qatar and an estimated 
need for 140,000 – 160,000 new rooms 
by 2020 to host the World Expo in Dubai. 
India: In 2013 the overall GDP growth  
was less than 5% as against the expected 
level of about 8 to 9% and there was  
a slowdown in the construction industry. 
However, with a stable government being 
formed in May 2014 there is positive 
market sentiment overall and there are 
indications of better growth prospects in 
the construction industry. The projected 
GDP growth for 2014 is 5.5% and the 
expectation is that real estate market 
activity will pick up in the second half of 
this financial year when the policy reforms 
such as relaxing Foreign Direct Investment 
(FDI) norms and the introduction of REITs 
are implemented. The housing sector, 
which is a significant contributor to overall 
economic growth, is expected to grow  
by about 15% this year. Other than the 
housing sector, the commercial and retail 
sectors are also expected to witness 
reasonable growth in 2014. 
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 10 US$1.8tn 
China is the world’s largest 
construction market at US$1.8tn
Asia Pacific
Development and construction activity in 
Asia Pacific varied across the geographies 
serviced by the Group, with activity in China 
remaining a major influence for the region  
as a whole. 
Prior to 2013, China’s construction market, 
which is the world’s largest at US$1.8 trillion 
and with an 18% global share, grew at  
over 20% p.a., but slowed considerably 
during the year as a result of Central 
Government policies aimed at dampening 
property prices and a general tightening  
of credit. Medium to long-term industry 
growth is forecast to sustain at around  
7–8% per annum, with immediate prospects 
for the first half of 2014 remaining uncertain 
as the economy transitions through the 
changes noted above. 
The slowdown in China has, to a lesser 
extent, affected our regional markets.  
Hong Kong’s private sector workload has 
eased over the period but public sector  
and infrastructure work, areas in which the 
Group is particularly strong, are in a period  
of high activity. In Singapore, our established 
sectors of corporate real estate and hospitality 
have seen a relatively flat year, but were 
bolstered by the addition of new local and 
regional work in hi-tech and data centres. 
Our business in Thailand has been impacted 
by the recent political problems, particularly 
with regard to foreign investor sentiment,  
but long-term prospects for growth of  
the US$33 billion Thai economy remain 
encouraging at around 5% per annum.
Australia’s US$220 billion construction 
market grew by 10% during the year but 
is forecast to drop by 4% in 2014, principally 
as a result of reduced demand for resources. 
The contraction is partly offset by increased 
domestic demand particularly in the 
residential sector. Our established sectors  
in healthcare, local government and aged 
care were subdued in 2013, partly due  
to local and national elections, but are 
expected to resume normal activity levels. 
Regional investment in infrastructure  
and built assets, particularly from China, 
present opportunities for the Group in the 
short to medium term, while defence 
spending, a sector in which we continue  
to be active, has increased under the recent 
federal budget.
The region’s second largest construction 
market, at US$742 billion, is in Japan,  
where the Group is in a joint venture. 
International interest in our principal sectors 
of corporate real estate and hospitality has 
recently increased, partly in anticipation of 
the forthcoming Olympic Games in 2020.  
In the medium term we anticipate higher 
levels of activity for the Group in-country  
and also with Japanese businesses 
operating outside Japan.
The Group is examining new regional 
markets in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia  
and Myanmar, all of which have construction 
sectors growing in excess of 4% p.a. and 
attracting significant international interest. 
However, in line with our current strategy  
of organic growth, any investments will be  
of a limited nature and structured to become 
quickly financially self-sustaining.

Stripping out the one off benefit of £1.0m 
from the unwinding of the Australian hedge

of Leeds Social Housing and hub North, 
underlying profits were £3.2m, up 23%

Revenue from Europe, which comprises  
the Group’s operations in the UK, Ireland 
and Continental Europe, was up to £49.3m 
(2013: £42.7m), accounting for 55% of the 
Group’s total revenue. Segment profits 
pre-exceptional administrative expenses 
and amortisation were £5.7m (2013: £3.7m). 
The European business has improved  
with net operating margins advancing from 
7 . 1% to 10.9%. This remains below peak 
margins of 1 1.6% in 2008. The order book 
stands at £53m (2013: £39m), an increase  
of some 36% year on year. Clients are  
now committing to long-term spending 
plans and giving approval to major 
Income Statement. Basic earnings per 
share were up 47% to 2.8p (2013: 1.9p) and 
pre-exceptional operating margins at 5.5% 
were up 2% (2013: 5.3%). This remains 
considerably below peak operating margins 
of 9.3% achieved in 2008.
Our current order book stands at a record 
£109m (2013: £100m), despite a negative 
foreign exchange impact of 5% over the 
period. Non GAAP adjusted profit before 
tax was £5.4m (2013: £3.7m) and adjusted 
earnings for the year were 5.0p per share 
(2013: 3.7p).
Net debt at the year-end was further  
reduced to £6.3m (2013: £7.1m) and well 
below the peak of £1 1m in 2012. Much focus 
has been put on improving our working 
capital requirements, particularly in APAC. 
Working capital remains a principal focus 
for the executive team. 
The Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 0.8p per share (2013: 0.7p) 
which will make a total dividend of 1.3p  
for the year, an increase of 30% (2013: 
1.0p), illustrating the Board’s confidence  
in the Group’s future prospects.

construction projects rather than the  
phased commitments of recent years.  
The order book is reinforced by an 
extremely robust pipeline of potential 
projects and Framework income yet  
to be formally committed.
The business operates across a diversified 
range of private and public sectors.
Our investment into the energy and 
infrastructure sectors has been rewarded 
with appointments on the NNB Genco  
Ltd Nuclear Framework, Network Rail 
Frameworks for both England & Wales  
and Scotland, and the Transport for  
London Framework. Our exposure to  
the sector increased fivefold in the year  
as we continue to build market share.
The retail sector, in which the Group is  
a recognised leader, has seen a further 
improvement in activity over the period.  
The Group has secured commissions at  
the major developments at the Whitgift 
Centre, Croydon and Brent Cross Shopping 
Centre. We currently have an involvement  
in over 40 mixed use retail developments.  
Our retail portfolio is balanced with a number 
of projects directly with retailers such as 
Selfridges, working on their flagship stores 
in Manchester, Birmingham and London,  
the rollout of Primark stores in Spain, Portugal, 
France, the UK and most recently supporting 
them on their push into the USA. Another 
success is our recent appointment to the John 
Lewis and Waitrose Consultant panel.
The offices sector, both for developers  
and corporate end users, has seen an 
upswing in activity, extending from London 
into most regional cities. Significant clients  
in this sector include BNP Paribas, Barclays, 
RBS and the BBC.
In the hotel and leisure sector, the Group has 
been very active with Hilton and Marriott 
and as client representative for the landmark 
Shangri-La Hotel in the Shard. The prospects 
for the leisure sector remain strong with  
a number of museums, gallery and stadia 
projects in the pipeline. Significant schemes 
worked on include the Tate St Ives Gallery 
Extension and a project for Merlin 
Entertainment in Istanbul.
The Group maintains a strong market 
position in the health, education and life 
sciences sectors, all areas which have 
seen continued investment over the last  
12 months. Health schemes have included 
the Royal Hospital Chelsea, University 
College London Hospital, Moorfields Eye 
Hospital and King’s College Hospital, 
London. The education sector continues 
to present a large range of opportunities 
and we are currently working with more 
than 20 universities, with notable schemes 
at Cambridge, Imperial, Robert Gordon 
and Manchester universities.
The Group operates from a wide  
range of offices throughout the UK,  
giving us the advantage of local 
knowledge and delivery capability.  
This plays a particularly important role 
when being considered for projects 
procured under national framework 
arrangements. Sweett Group has a  
wide range of experience to draw from, 
providing services on over 200 current 
public sector frameworks on a national, 
regional or local basis including the 
Ministry of Justice, London Construction 
Programme, NHS Shared Business 
Services and Waste and Resources  
Action Programme.
The culture of the organisation is based  
on maximising value for our clients by 
putting their needs first. Much of this 
culture is driven by the people we employ 
and the training we provide. In addition,  
we continue to innovate our delivery 
processes which this year has included  
the development of a Building Information 
Modelling (BIM) programme and, through 
our participation in the Rapiere embedded 
Energy Modelling tool, we are developing  
a valuable measure of the sustainability  
of entire property portfolios.

Middle East, Africa & India Asia Pacific 
Revenue from the Middle East and India 
(MEAI) accounted for 13% of Group revenues 
at £11.6m (2013: £11.9m). Segment profits 
pre-exceptional administrative expenses 
and amortisation were £0.1m (2013 £1.3m) 
and the order book is £9.2m (2013: £6.0m).
In MEAI, we have seen a pick-up in bidding 
activity as market conditions continue  
to improve. This trend is anticipated to  
be maintained over the medium term. 
Nevertheless, as part of our risk 
management and margin improvement 
strategies, the Middle East operations 
have been through a year of transition  
to de-risk the business in the longer term.
We aim to be more selective in the work 
we undertake. We will concentrate on our 
levels of service delivery, repeat clients  
and local market reputation as part of the 
plan to limit our turnover to no more than 
10% of total Group turnover. The focus  
of attention is on the UAE, and the new 
office which has recently been opened  
in Oman. Our position in Qatar is being 
developed but on a low risk, low cost 
strategy. Profits were impacted by 
reducing our dependence on very large 
projects together with certain legacy 
issues, but these are now close to being 
worked through and any future effects 
minimised. Our repeat work with clients 
such as Dubai Airports, Etihad Airways, 
Saudi Aramco and Jumeirah continues  
to grow and we are delighted to be 
working for major developers such  
as Mubadala and Emaar. 
The Group’s performance in India continued 
to be encouraging with growth in the  
year faster than anticipated. India now 
employs over 150 people across the 
region, headquartered in Chennai with 
regional offices in Bangalore, Mumbai, 
Delhi and Hyderabad. We have strengthened 
our position to be a leading provider of  
QS services with a pan-India presence 
and have an extremely strong platform to 
continue to grow long term. Whilst there 
has been some recent market slowdown, 
Delhi and Bangalore were the strongest 
performers, particularly in the commercial 
and IT sectors. Elsewhere, the residential 
market did experience a short dip, but this 
is now expected to recover once the new 
government implements its plans to grow 
the economy at a faster pace again. 
Revenue from Asia Pacific accounted  
for 32.0% of Group revenues at £28.6m 
(2013: £26.0m). Segment profit before 
exceptional administrative expenses and 
amortisation of intangibles were £1.3m 
(2013: £0.6m) and the order book stands 
at £47m (2013: £55m), primarily due to a 
foreign exchange impact of £5m. Of these 
numbers, the Group’s operations in China 
and Hong Kong contributed approximately 
£20.8m of revenues and £1.0m of net 
profit. The segment’s operating margin  
of 4.5% remains satisfactory given the 
continued levels of investment in new 
resources dedicated to the region.
During the year, the APAC business 
reported several significant new commissions 
including cost management of the £400m 
Huawei Dongguan R&D Centre in China, 
around £1,800m of hotel and casino 
development work in Macau, a series  
of commissions related to the early stages

Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 16 Outlook
During the year the Group continued  
to perform strongly. Whilst it benefited 
from one off gains from the unwinding  
of the Australian hedge contract and  
the financial close of Leeds Social 
Housing, the underlying performance 
was considerably better than the 
previous year.
Trading in the first few months of  
the year has been encouraging and  
this momentum is expected to be 
maintained as the Group benefits from 
its wider geographical platform, the 
diversified nature of our sector coverage 
and the improving trading conditions  
in its home markets. Based on an 
improving order book and pipeline,  
the prospects for turnover growth and 
margin improvement remain on track.
I would like to take this opportunity  
on behalf of the entire Sweett Group 
team of thanking Mike Henderson  
and Nick Woollacott, who both leave at 
the Annual General Meeting. Mike has 
been with the Group for the last 16 years, 
both as a Non-Executive Director and 
more latterly as Chairman. During his 
four years as Chairman of the Board,  
his leadership, guidance and support 
have been exceptional. Nick has been 
with the Group since our IPO and he  
has added considerable expertise and  
wise counsel during his time as Non-
Executive Director. We wish them  
all the best for the future.
of the £11,330m major expansion to  
the airport in Hong Kong, project 
management of the Helicopter Aircrew 
Training System for the Department of 
Defence in Australia, and programming 
services for the £700m highways link  
to the HK-Zhuhai-Macau Boundary 
Crossing in Hong Kong. Looking ahead, 
we anticipate continued growth for our  
PM and Programming services in Asia  
and China, and a sustained level of 
demand for our cost management work.
After several years of exceptionally high 
growth, our short to medium-term Asia 
Pacific regional strategy is to restrain 
further expansion to levels that are 
financially sustainable, and to upgrade  
and consolidate our management systems 
across the region. Over the year we have 
strengthened our processes for reducing 
lockup, established a process for cross-
border invoicing with our China offices, 
implemented the Group’s ERP system 
across Australia, South Asia and Hong 
Kong, with China to follow in mid-2014, 
enhanced our management team by adding 
new directors in Project Management, 
Programming and HR, and centralised  
the region’s IT and marketing support 
services. The Australian business was 
restructured during the year and a closer 
regional integration is in place to address 
the increasing demand for regionally 
integrated services. 
 
North America
Our 50/50 Joint Venture Company VVA 
Sweett Inc continues to make headway.  
We now have five joint venture offices in  
New York, Boston, New Jersey, Washington 
DC and Los Angeles. The business is  
trading profitably and income and margins 
are growing steadily.
In the US, there is an increased awareness 
of the value that an independent Quantity 
Surveyor can add to a project. Clients are 
now requesting additional services not 
typically provided in the US where Quantity 
Surveying is now being recognised.
The construction market in the US is 
growing again and this is reflected in  
the increased activity and number of  
bids VVA & VVA Sweett have made  
and been awarded during the past  
year. Of particular note are projects for  
Condé Nast, Time Inc. and Weil Gotshal  
in New York and Cooley and Viacom in 
Los Angeles. Following our work for 
Primark in the UK and Continental Europe, 
we are assisting them with the rollout of 
their stores within the USA.
There have been a number of cross 
referrals of Trans-Atlantic projects,  
with two pharmaceutical schemes for 
Biomed in the United Kingdom and 
schemes in Los Angeles, London and 
Tokyo for Jefferies.

Key Performance Indicators
The Executive Committee sets annual objectives, both financial  
and non-financial, which focus on deliverables in support of both 
short-term results and the overall long-term strategy. A number of 
metrics are used to monitor performance; these include revenue, 
operating profit, lockup, earnings per share and order book.
Definition/Relevance
Revenue growth is the percentage  
change from continuing Group operations  
in the current year from the prior years.  
This KPI measures our strategy to drive  
the business growth.
Progress 
Our strategic plan stood us in good stead in 
2014 as the improving economy in many of 
our areas of operation gave us opportunities 
to increase our market share and penetrate 
sectors more deeply. 
Definition/Relevance
The level of underlying operating profit 
represents the results of the basic operating 
elements of the Group’s performance. 
Progress 
We achieved a rise of 14% mainly as a  
result of organic growth and improved 
margins, both reflecting the successful 
execution of our strategic plan. 
* Before amortisation of acquired intangibles, PSP 
charges and exceptional administrative expenses.
Definition/Relevance
Earnings per share is a measure of the

ordinary share. It is a key metric used  
by our investors in assessing whether  
we are delivering a suitable return.
Progress 
Strong progress as the Group’s financial 
performance continues to improve. 
Definition/Relevance
Lockup is used to measure the cash 
generation of the Group and how  
successful the business is at managing  
its working capital. 
Progress 
Lockup continues to be a challenge,  
in particular in Asia Pacific, and specific 
action plans are in place to reduce this  
in the current financial year.
Definition/Relevance
A measure of firm, contracted orders. 
Progress 
Despite an adverse impact of £5m  
from foreign exchange, the order book 
continues to increase, driven in the main  
by strong growth in Europe.
Definition/Relevance
A distribution of after-tax profits divided by the 
number of ordinary shares in issue. Dividends 
give shareholders a financial reward that is a 
key element in a company’s attraction.

Chief Financial Officer
Group revenue was £89.4m (2013: £80.6m). 
Profit before taxation, after the impact  
of £1.5m of exceptional administrative 
expenses, £0.6m charge for the Performance 
Share Plan and £0.5m of amortisation  
of acquired intangibles as described in  
Note 5, amounted to £2.8m (2013: £1.8m). 
This profit includes the income on sale of 
the Group’s interests in the hub North PFI 
project and profit generated at financial 
close of the Leeds Social Housing PFI 
project. The Group’s derivative-based 
currency cover in respect of Australian 
dollar exposures was cash settled for 
£0.4m resulting in a credit of £1.0m to  
the income statement.
Revenue for the year increased by 10.9% 
to £89.4m (2013: £80.6m). Net revenue, 
after deduction of sub-consultant costs, 
was £77 .9m (2013: £72.4m).
Adjusted profit before tax increased by  
46% to £5.4m (2013: £3.7m). Pre-tax profit 
was £2.8m (2013: £1.8m) after exceptional 
administrative expenses, Performance Share 
Plan charges and amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and net finance income.
Adjusted operating profit was £4.9m (2013: 
£4.3m) and the adjusted operating profit 
margin was 6.2% (2013: 5.3%). Operating 
profit amounted to £2.3m (2013: £2.3m) and 
operating margins were 2.6% (2013: 2.9%).
Adjusted earnings per share were 5.0p 
(2013: 3.7p). Basic earnings per share  
were 2.8p (2013: 1.9p) and diluted earnings 
per share were 2.7p (2013: 1.9p).
Our current order book is approximately 
£109m, an increase from last year’s reporting 
date of 9% (2013: £100m), despite a negative 
impact of exchange rates of £5m.
In presenting the Group’s adjusted  
profit opposite, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, performance share  
plan costs and exceptional administrative 
expenses have been excluded so as to 
assist understanding of the underlying 
performance of the Group.
Trading performance
The Group’s financial performance was further 
improved during the year ended 31 March 2014 
in comparison with the previous year in terms of 
revenue, adjusted operating profit, profit before 
taxation and net debt. It was also marked by the 
completion of the hub North disposal, the financial 
close of the Leeds Social Housing PFI project 
and the renegotiating of our banking facilities.

The primary segmental analysis in Note 3  
to the financial statements details the 
segmental revenue and result. In aggregate, 
the Group’s gross margin increased from 
28.8% to 30.7%, which is encouraging.
Details of exceptional administrative 
expenses are provided in Note 5 to  
the financial statements. Exceptional 
administrative expenses of £1,523,000 
(2013: £1,455,000) comprised in the main 
costs associated with the investigation 
regarding allegations made in the Wall 
Street Journal in June 2013 of £490,000, 
restructuring costs of £978,000 (2013: 
£812,000) and interest payable to the 
vendors of Widnell Limited of £55,000 
(2013: £356,000).
Sterling appreciated during the year 
against all the Group’s major currencies, 
being the Hong Kong Dollar, Chinese 
Renminbi, UAE Dirham, Indian Rupee  
and Australian Dollar. The negative impact 
of this strengthening was approximately 
£2.9m on revenue and negligible on 
operating profit.
Cash performance
Cash generated from operations was £5.7m 
(2013: £2.2m). This arises largely through 
profit earned and improvements in working 
capital management. The Group’s work in 
progress net of fees in advance increased  
to £7 ,755,000 (2013: £6,333,000) and gross 
receivables decreased to £23,039,000 (2013: 
£24,263,000). Overdue amounts decreased 
to £7 ,843,000 (2013: £8,536,000) and there 
was a slight reduction in the amount of debt 
impaired to £1,620,000 (2013: £1,722,000). 
The lockup calculation measures the  
number of days’ activity included within 
work in progress and trade receivables, 
incorporates an annualisation of revenues 
based on the last three months’ revenues: 
lockup days at year-end were 106 days 
(2013: 103 days). Management of working 
capital is a key issue as the Group continues 
to expand, particularly in the Asia Pacific 
region, and further steps are being taken  
to improve its management and reduce 
unnecessary utilisation of the Group’s  
cash resources. Specific action is in hand 
to release funds held in mainland China.
Key Performance Indicators
A number of metrics are used to monitor 
financial performance. These include 
turnover, operating profit, cash collection, 
pre-exceptional administrative expenses, 
earnings per share and lockup. All of these 
Key Performance Indicators improved in  
the last year, with the exception of lockup. 
The latter continues to be affected by  
a retention balance of £1.0m (2013:  
£1.0m)on a project in the Middle East,  
the un-provisioned element of two trade 
receivables in Dubai of £0.5m (2013:  
£0.5m) and by a number of projects in 
China and Hong Kong which are subject 
to milestone billing arrangements. 
Underlying profit margins
The gross profit margin was 30.7%  
(2013: 28.8%) on gross revenue and 
35.3% (2013: 32.1%) on net revenue  
and the operating profit margin was 2.6% 
(2013: 2.9%). The operating profit margin 
before exceptional administrative expenses, 
PSP charges and amortisation of acquired 
intangibles was 5.5% (2013: 5.3%).
Finance income
The Group’s net finance income/cost,  
is disclosed in Note 4. This changed  
from a net cost of £565,000 in 2013 to  
a net income of £516,000 in 2014 largely 
due to the £1.0m credit arising on the 
termination of AUD11.1m derivative-based 
currency contract.
Within this total, finance income from 
available-for-sale financial assets reduced 
from £132,000 to £34,000 as a result of the 
continued sale of these income-generating 
assets and finance cost reduced from 
£735,000 to £491,000, largely as a result  
of the prior year charge of £272,000 relating 
to the Group’s AUD11.1m derivative-based 
currency contract.

Banking facilities
The Group funds its activities through 
cash generated from operations and 
supplemented, where necessary and 
appropriate, with bank borrowings and 
asset funding.
The Group’s principal banker is Bank  
of Scotland plc, part of the Lloyds Banking 
Group, which provides Sweett Group with 
overdraft, term loan and contract guarantee 
facilities as well as a guarantee facility to 
secure obligations to third parties.
At 31 March 2014, the amount undrawn 
under the Group’s credit lines was £2.3m 
(2013: £3.0m). Amounts drawn under  
the term loan are shown as non-current 
liabilities to the extent that repayments are 
due after 31 March 2015. All other liabilities 
to Bank of Scotland plc and overseas 
banks are shown as current liabilities.  
All banking covenants were met during  
the financial year and at 31 March 2014.
The Bank of Scotland plc facility 
agreements contain four separate financial 
covenants, being:
•  Net worth shall not at any time be less 
than £25m;
•  The ratio of EBITDA to Total Interest 
shall not at any time be less than 4:1;
•  The ratio of Net Operating Cash flow to 
Bank Debt Service on each test date 
shall not be less than 1.1:1; and
•  The ratio of Total Net Debt to EBITDA 
shall not at any time exceed 2.75:1.
During the year facilities were negotiated 
with HSBC in China and Hong Kong. 
These comprise an accounts receivables 
facility in Hong Kong of £1.4m and a loan 
facility in Hong Kong secured against 
Renminbi deposits in China of £0.8m.
Tax
The charge for the year was £932,000, 
being 33.0% of the profit before taxation 
(2013: £476,000, being 26.8%). The reasons 
behind this movement are analysed further 
in Note 7 .
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounted to 2.8p 
(2013: 1.9p) and fully diluted earnings per 
share were 2.7p (2013: 1.9p). Tax-adjusted 
earnings per share prior to exceptional 
administrative expenses and Performance 
Share Plan charges were 5.0p (2013: 3.7p). 
Balance sheet
The Group ended the year with:
•  Net borrowings of £6.3m, compared 
with £7.1m at 31 March 2013;
•  Net assets of £27.4m, compared with 
£27.9m at 31 March 2013;
•  Work in progress (net of fees in 
advance) of £7.8m compared with 
£6.3m at 31 March 2013; and
•  Trade receivables of £21.5m compared 
with £22.7m at 31 March 2013.
We continue to invest particularly in IT 
equipment and software to ensure that,  
as the business environment becomes 
more complex and technology evolves, 
the Group’s IT systems and equipment 
are kept up-to-date and properly serve 
the business.

Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 24 Going concern
A detailed examination of the Group’s 
cash flow and trading forecasts has been 
undertaken to enable the Board to 
conclude that the Group can operate 
within its banking covenants, such that  
it could be established that the Group 
should continue to prepare its financial 
statements on the going concern basis. 
The Group’s bankers have confirmed  
that, in the normal course of events,  
the overdraft facility will be replaced on 
expiry late in the 2014 calendar year.
Material considerations in a forward  
look at covenant compliance include:
•  The assumption that a retention  
balance of £1m on a Middle East 
contract will be recovered during  
the current financial year
• Working capital
• Profitability
Internal controls
In the established parts of the Group  
there are well developed policies and 
procedures to support a sound internal 
control environment. These policies 
continue to be rolled out across the 
enlarged Group. Further systems 
enhancements over the next year,  
based on the completion of the Group 
roll-out of our Agresso ERP system  
with only China remaining, will further 
strengthen internal controls. As a 
temporary measure, more intense 
management review processes are in 
operation until such time as the roll-out  
is completed. The corporate governance 
section of this Report outlines further 
issues of internal control within the Group.
Treasury
Treasury matters and banking arrangements 
are overseen by a treasury committee, 
which is chaired by the Group Chairman.
Dividends
An interim dividend for the year to  
31 March 2014 of 0.5p per share at a  
cost of £342,000 (2013: 0.3p per share  
at a cost of £203,000) was paid on  
17 January 2014 to all shareholders  
on the register on 20 December 2013.  
The Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 0.8p per share at a cost, 
assuming no issues of shares in the 
intervening period, of £549,000 (2013:  
0.7p at a cost of £474,000) which,  
if approved by the shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on  
12 September 2014 to all shareholders  
on the register on 15 August 2014.  
A dividend reinvestment service is 
available through the Registrar.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Group’s Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
is a separately administered discretionary 
trust in Jersey for the benefit of employees. 
Shares owned by the EBT are shown as  
a reduction in capital and reserves as 
treasury shares. The EBT has not held any 
of the Company’s shares since January 
2011 and consideration is being given to 
winding up the Trust.
Share Incentive Plan
The Share Incentive Plan (SIP), originally 
launched in February 2001, enables UK 
resident employees to acquire shares  
in the Group out of untaxed income  
and provides a tax-efficient means for 
employees to own shares. Dividends 
received by the plan in cash are used to 
purchase additional shares on behalf of 
employees. Shares held in the plan which 
have not been allocated to individual 
employees are shown as a reduction in 
capital and reserves as Treasury shares.
Summary
Sweett Group’s trading performance  
has improved during the year under 
review and, having exited the remaining 
investment businesses and renegotiated 
our banking facilities, the Group is in  
a more robust position going into the  
new financial year.

Governance Financial statements Risk management
Sweett Group embed the consideration  
of risk across the full scope of their policies  
and procedures. 
A central register is maintained which brings together the range of  
risks and uncertainties that the Group is exposed to, many of which  
are common to other companies operating in similar market segments.  
The register is reviewed on a regular basis and, in addition, risk is 
specifically considered in the annual business planning process and  
at key investment decision points. The corporate risk register highlights  
any regional variations in exposure levels and each item is linked to a  
lead risk owner, responsible for monitoring the risk item and ensuring 
controls are effective. Residual risk is evaluated enabling the Board  
to make judgements around tolerability and the cost effectiveness  
of further mitigation. 
Risk Description Mitigation
Strategic
Economic and  
Market Conditions
Changes to economic and market conditions can have an impact on the level of construction sector spend and the 
competitive pricing pressures. These factors apply to both public and private sectors. Changing demand affects the 
level of resourcing required and the associated support functions to enable efficient operation and maintain 
competitiveness. Longer-term market trends also affect the required skill sets.
Our strategy is to continue to diversify our sectors, services and geographies to manage the impact of change in any one area of the  
business on the whole. We monitor changes in the economic climate and market conditions on a continual basis and align our strategy  
to match resourcing levels to any changes in the demand for our services.
Growth and 
Integration
The Group’s operations continue to expand both in scale and geographic reach. This presents risks in the control  
and management of this growth, both organic growth and that achieved through acquisition. There are also risks  
to compliance and efficiency arising from any failure to fully integrate and align all areas of the business.
A strong emphasis is maintained on integration and controlled growth through the various cross regional management committees.  
Supporting this, the implementation of the Company’s ERP system is nearing completion and this is reinforcing a consistent approach  
to business processes as well as enabling greater transparency. There is careful due diligence undertaken on potential business partners  
and acquisition targets to ensure risks are fully considered and mitigated as part of the decision making process.
Reputation The reputation of Sweett Group is fundamental to our future success. Our typical role in construction projects  
is one of high trust, managing and advising on decisions that can have a major financial impact upon our clients.  
Any damage to this reputation would undermine the confidence that clients have in our ability to execute these roles 
without error and with a high level of professional integrity. Damage to the reputation of Sweett Group would have  
a significant negative impact on the ability to win new business.
The Board maintains a focus on quality and integrity through induction, employee training, their own leadership and supporting  
management systems. The Group operates an integrated Health, Safety, Quality & Environmental management system which has been  
accredited to ISO 9001. Additional to the control of service quality, policies and procedures provide clear guidance to employees on  
the expectation of high ethical standards.
Finance
Financial  
Constraints
The primary financial risk relates to liquidity and covenant compliance. The prudent management of the Group’s 
funding arrangements is key to ensuring the business manages any issues that could affect considerations of going 
concern. Funding and liquidity also must be balanced with growth and the nature of the commercial arrangements  
the Group enters into in order to have a managed and sustainable growth plan.
Management continually monitor the adequacy of the Group’s liquidity supported by good quality management information. This monitoring 
process includes day to day operational matters as well as strategically balancing growth plans with funding availability. Guidance is provided  
to operational management on the payment terms to be sought from clients and there are active credit management processes in place.  
The arrangements in place to control the detailed financial risks are summarised further in Note 28 to the financial statements.
Foreign  
Currency Risk
The Group operates over a wide geographic area and there are risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations 
across these regions. Changes in exchange rates could affect the profitability of projects delivered by resources  
from several regions. Changes in exchange rates could also affect the forecast levels of profit returned from different 
regions when converted back to the Group’s primary reporting currency of GBP.
The majority of trading activity takes place within each legal entity, thereby matching the currency of cost and income. Where this is not  
possible, management review the level of exchange rate risk exposure and consider if it is appropriate to hedge the risk. A macro analysis  
is also undertaken to look at the cumulative exposure across the business and the impact that changes would have on reporting in the  
Group’s presentation currency. The arrangements in place to control this risk are summarised further in Note 28 to the financial statements.
Financial  
Performance
Shareholders in the business have expectations of a level of return on their investment. Failing to manage and meet market 
expectations could result in a reduction in the share price and a consequential impact on the ability to fund future growth.
The Group has a range of business processes designed to deliver a predictable and acceptable level of financial performance. These are  
founded on a robust budgeting process supported by controls on capital expenditure, regular forecasting of project profitability and the  
active review of monthly management accounts.
Operational
Health, Safety  
& Environment
The management of the health & safety of Sweett Group employees and those affected by our business activities is of 
the utmost importance. Additionally, the Group must comply with all relevant legislation and has a policy of minimising 
its impact on the environment wherever practicable. Failure to manage these risks could lead to injury or loss of life as 
well as formal action against the business for any process shortcomings.
The Group operates an integrated Health, Safety, Quality & Environmental management system which has been accredited to ISO 14001  
and OHSAS 18001. There is clear ownership within the business on these matters and an active audit regime to ensure compliance with  
the various systems, processes and training which have been put in place. An external advisor is retained and referred to where required  
to ensure the accuracy of information being used to guide decision making in this area.
People Sweett Group is a people business. The quality of our people, their technical ability, professional approach and  
ethical standards are all key drivers in clients entrusting us with delivery of their projects. A failure to engage with  
our employees or high attrition rates can have a significant impact on efficiency. There are also risks relating to 
technical quality and business conduct if employees are not fully aware of and abiding by the Company’s procedures.
The Group seeks to attract and retain high quality staff through offering competitive remuneration, adopting modern working practices and  
having a robust selection process. Induction procedures assist in ensuring clarity of expectations around conduct and regular performance  
reviews are aimed at maximising engagement and development. The UK business has recently secured accreditation against the Investors In 
People (IIP) standard and is rolling out a number of the underlying principles of this framework globally.
Systems and IT In common with most businesses, the Group is critically dependent on its IT infrastructure and systems for delivery  
of its services and management of the business. Failure of systems or significant down time could lead to a loss of 
output, a lack of reliable management information or a loss of data.
A business impact analysis has been undertaken on the core systems and IT infrastructure. This has informed the redundancy provisions made, 
back-up processes and disaster recover arrangements. The most critical business management systems are replicated to a separate data centre 
and the failover procedure is subject to periodic testing. Capital investment decision making in this area takes into account business continuity risks.

output, a lack of reliable management information or a loss of data.
A business impact analysis has been undertaken on the core systems and IT infrastructure. This has informed the redundancy provisions made, 
back-up processes and disaster recover arrangements. The most critical business management systems are replicated to a separate data centre 
and the failover procedure is subject to periodic testing. Capital investment decision making in this area takes into account business continuity risks.
Risk management  
framework
The risk management process 
involves identifying the principal 
risks relating to the Group and 
its achievement of the business 
strategy, establishing appropriate 
controls to manage these risks 
and ensuring there is a robust 
monitoring regime in place.
The Group’s risk assessment 
process seeks to achieve an 
optimal balance between the 
cost of mitigation and the 
uncertainty or impact the risk 
presents. The risk identification, 
review and response process 
engages the key stakeholders 
across the business who can 
add value in risk identification or 
the implementation of controls.

Corporate responsibility
At Sweett Group, we recognise that our operations 
and services we provide have a significant impact  
on the communities and environments in which  
we operate. Our strategy of long-term, sustainable  
growth is directly linked to our Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) efforts.
The Group’s CSR efforts focus on four main areas:
Employee well-being
Our clients work with us because of the 
quality of our staff and the added value 
their expertise and knowledge represents. 
We see our CSR work as a mechanism 
for boosting morale, fostering team spirit 
and encouraging healthy living, all of 
which contribute to creating happier, 
healthier members of staff.
Environment
The construction, maintenance and 
operation of property and infrastructure 
developments accounts for a significant 
portion of the world’s annual carbon 
emissions. Our consultants play an 
important role in reducing these 
emissions by working with our clients 
to minimise the environmental impact 
of projects throughout their lifecycle.
Community
Operating within the built environment 
we have a responsibility to ensure we 
engage with and play an active role in the 
local communities in which we operate. 
We do this through the development of 
the services we offer our clients and by 
building long-term relationships with key 
local stakeholders through our community 
outreach and charitable activities.
Charity
The Group and its staff have supported 
a number of charities across the world, 
covering causes such as cancer care, 
men’s health and animal welfare.  
The Group’s global charitable cause 
continues to be the theme of children 
and youth in the community.

sound governance and transparency to  
be fundamental to achieving its objective

Dear shareholder
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance, which we consider 
to be of fundamental importance to the future success 
of Sweett Group. This commitment is demonstrated by 
our continued attention to embedding our core values, 
principles, ethics and risk management throughout  
the organisation during the financial year. In particular, 
our focus on simplifying structures across the Group 
worldwide and introducing common business processes 
has enhanced the effectiveness of corporate governance.
The Board continued to pay significant attention to 
succession planning throughout the year. In particular,  
I am stepping down as Chairman so the Nominations 
Committee has overseen the process of securing a 
successor to the role. Similarly, the Board has played  
an active part in addressing succession planning issues 
across the wider leadership team, evidenced by the 
appointment of Patrick Sinclair as CFO in January 2014. 
The Board continues to take the view that it has an 
effective, well-balanced structure, which includes a 
group of non-executives who collectively draw on a 
wealth and variety of experience, thus providing for 
meaningful discussion, constructive challenge and 
effective decision making.
Diversity is regarded as a business enabler across  
the Group, and the Board seeks to ensure that equal 
opportunity is afforded to all, regardless of gender,  
age, ethnic background or religious belief. The Board 
also believes, however, that of equal importance is the 
need to ensure that staff skills and competencies are 
matched to the strategic and operational needs of the 
business in our core markets.
The Board (primarily through the activities of the Audit 
Committee) continues to focus on ensuring that the 
Group’s risk management processes (which include 
clarifying roles and responsibilities throughout the 
governance structure, refreshing the Company-wide  
risk framework, training and communication) are 
embedded across the entire Group.

Governance
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 33
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance
Details are provided below of how the Company applies those 
parts of the Code which it believes to be appropriate. 
Leadership
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board and  
for ensuring the effectiveness of the Board as a whole. The Board’s 
role is to determine the strategic direction of the Group within a 
framework of best practice corporate governance and prudent and 
effective controls, which enables risks to be assessed and managed. 
It sets the Group’s values and standards, including matters relating  
to corporate social responsibility, and ensures that its obligations  
to its shareholders and others are understood and met.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate  
and clearly defined and a Senior Independent Director has 
been appointed.
The role of the Non-Executive Directors is to challenge constructively 
and review executive proposals, including the development of 
strategy. The Board’s annual strategy session, which all Directors 
attended, was held in March and gave the Board the opportunity  
to work in a very focused way on the Group’s strategy for the  
coming years. All Directors are expected to attend all meetings  
of the Board and of those Committees on which they serve  
and to devote sufficient time to the Company’s affairs to enable 
them to fulfil their duties as Directors. The table below details the 
attendance of Directors at Board and Committee meetings they 
were eligible to attend in the year:

David Wilton 10/10 4/4 4/5 2/2
Chris Goscomb resigned on 31 December 2013 and  
Patrick Sinclair was appointed on 1 January 2014. 
Specific responsibilities reserved to the Board include:
•  The acquisition or disposal of a business or of shares  
in a company; 
•  The establishment of a new business or closure of  
an existing business; 
• The annual budget and strategic plan; 
•  Significant capital expenditure, IT equipment and  
leasing arrangements; 
•  Proposed contracts satisfying specific criteria; 
•  Changes to the organisational structure or management 
structure; and 
• Dividend policy.
Effectiveness
The Board comprises four Executive and four Non-Executive 
Directors, meeting every other month and additionally when 
necessary. In the reporting period there were 10 formal Board 
meetings and also a one-day strategic planning workshop 
dealing with shorter-term budgeting and longer-term planning 
issues. Sub-committees of the Board meet as required.
The Executive Directors have long and deep experience of 
business in the sectors in which they operate. This is complemented 
by the expertise of the Non-Executive Directors, who have strong 
track records of running both large and smaller companies in 
diverse sectors, both nationally and internationally. This collective 
mix of skills and experience is a major contribution to the proper 
functioning of the Board, ensuring that matters are constructively 
challenged and fully debated and that no individual or group 
dominates the Board’s decision-making process.
Directors are appointed by the Board on the recommendation  
of the Nominations Committee. They are subject to periodic 
re-appointment by shareholders and statutory provisions regarding 
removal. This applies equally to Non-Executive Directors and, 
because the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company has served 
on the Board since 1998, he is subject to annual re-election at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting. The Board has determined 
that the Chairman continues to be independent in character and 
judgement and that the Company is fortunate to have someone  
of his calibre and expertise to lead it.
Each Non-Executive Director has significant external commercial 
experience and brings experience and judgement to the Board. 
The Board considers that all of the Non-Executive Directors are 
independent of management and have no business or other 
relationships, which could materially interfere with or affect the 
exercise of their independent judgement. None has previously 
been involved in the management of the Company. 
Nicholas Woollacott was appointed Senior Independent Director 
on 30 November 2010. When required, he presides over meetings 
of the Board and shareholders in the absence of the Chairman 
and is available should occasion arise where there is a need to 
convey concerns to the Board other than through the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive and the other Executive Directors.
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 34 All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and there is a procedure for Directors to 
seek independent professional advice, in furtherance of their 
duties, at the Company’s expense. The Company Secretary  
is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman,  
on all governance matters. Under the direction of the Chairman,  
the Company Secretary ensures that the information presented  
to the Board is timely and of sufficient quality to enable members  
to make informed decisions and ensures good information  
flows within the Board and its Committees and between  
Senior Management and Non-Executive Directors.
The Board is committed to evaluating its own performance,  
that of its Committees and its individual Directors. Individual  
Board members (Executive and Non-Executive) are evaluated 
annually on similar timing to the Company-wide appraisal system. 
This is led by the Chairman of the Board generally and by the  
Senior Independent Director in relation to the Chairman. The Code 
recommends that an effectiveness review be conducted every 
year, but the Board considers it to be more reasonable to hold the 
review when required rather than every year. As referred to in last 
year’s Annual Report, the Board conducted an effectiveness review 
in early 2013, the results of which have been reviewed and have 
formed the basis of an action plan, which is being overseen by 
Nicholas Woollacott, Senior Non-Executive Director.
Nominations Committee
The members of the Nominations Committee are the Non-Executive 
Directors. It meets at least twice a year and is responsible for 
reviewing the Board’s structure, size, composition, balance of  
skills, experience, independence and knowledge. During the  
year, the Nominations Committee advised the Board on possible 
appointments and resignations to and from the Board and 
succession planning, as well as reviewing the position of Chairman. 
Succession planning for the Group, Senior Management  
and the Board is in place and is continually updated as  
part of a Company-wide succession planning programme.  
The Nominations Committee leads this process for the Board. 
During the year, the Nominations Committee began the process 
of finding a Non-Executive Chairman, the present incumbent 
having advised his intention to retire. The Chairman of the 
Nominations Committee is leading this process.
Accountability
The Board is responsible for establishing, reviewing and 
maintaining the Group’s systems of internal control and risk 
management and ensuring that these systems are effective for 
managing the business risk within the Group. The Group has 
established a framework for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks faced by the Group. 
It is the responsibility of the management to ensure that the 
controls and procedures that operate within the framework are 
followed and that the Board is kept fully appraised of any risks 
and control issues, both operational and financial. The Board 
recognises that any system of internal control exists to minimise 
the risk of failure rather than to eliminate it and that any system  
of internal control can only provide reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Work to  
reduce operational and financial risks and to improve the  
control environment is a continuous process across the Group. 
As part of these improvements, a Treasury Committee meets to 
review significant treasury risks. Its remit includes the consideration 
of new banking facilities, the renewal of existing facilities and 
those risks arising from cross-border inter-company exposures.
The risk management of joint ventures and strategic partnerships 
is agreed between the parties and periodic reviews carried out 
where appropriate.
The Group reviews the effectiveness of the risk management 
system and its internal controls annually. The Internal Control  
Self Assessment, which was rolled out in 2012 by KPMG LLP, 
the Group’s Internal Auditors, has recently been completed for 
a third year. In addition, specific internal controls reviews were 
performed by KPMG LLP focusing on UAE, Hong Kong and 
China. The results of these reviews have been presented to  
the Audit Committee.
The roll-out of Agresso, a standardised ERP system across the 
Group, already embedded in the UK, is continuing and during the 
financial year the roll-out was completed in India and Hong Kong 
adding to Europe and the Middle East. Having been implemented 
in Australia and South Asia Pacific since 1 April 2014, the final 
step in the programme sees China going live by the end of 2014;  
this will complete the roll-out across the entire Group.
Audit Committee
The Company’s Audit Committee comprises the Non-Executive 
Directors and meets not less than three times per year. During 
the year ended 31 March 2014, the Committee met four times. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by David Wilton. David is a 
Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in the support 
services sector. He is considered by the Board to have the 
necessary recent and relevant financial experience for his role  
as Chairman. 
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
the Company’s independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP and internal audit providers, KPMG LLP, are normally invited 
to attend Audit Committee meetings and other executives are 
invited to attend as and when appropriate.
The Audit Committee operates under formal terms of reference. 
The terms of reference authorise the Committee to obtain 
external professional advice as necessary.
The main roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to:
•  Review the half-year and annual financial statements and 
reports of the Company, before their submission to the Board;
•  Review the process whereby the Board assesses the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems;
•   Consider other topics, as defined by the Board, such as  
the Company’s policies for preventing or detecting fraud,  
its code of corporate conduct/business ethics or the  
policies for ensuring that the Company complies with  
relevant regulatory and legal requirements;
•  Review the performance of the Company’s external and 
internal auditing functions;

Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 35
Strategic report Financial statements Corporate governance 
continued
•  Review the results and cost effectiveness of the audit and  
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors;
•  Make recommendations to the Board on the appointment  
of the independent auditors, the audit fee and any questions  
of resignation or dismissal relating to the auditors; and
•  Strengthen the independent position of the Company’s 
independent auditors by providing channels of communication 
between them and the Non-Executive Directors.
The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee as discharged 
during the period were as follows:
•  At its meetings held in November 2013 and June 2014,  
the Audit Committee reviewed, respectively, the Group’s 
Half-Yearly Report and Annual Results Announcement/ 
Annual Report and Accounts. On both occasions,  
the Committee received reports from management on 
significant aspects of the Group’s financial statements  
and reports from the auditors identifying any accounting  
or judgemental issues requiring its attention;
•  At each of the four meetings held during the year,  
the Committee received reports from the internal auditor,  
KPMG, which considered, among other things, the ongoing 
internal audit programme, which included the Internal Control 
Self Assessment Questionnaire and the results of internal 
controls reviews in the UAE, Hong Kong and China; and
•  The Committee also reviewed the independent auditors’ 
control findings and monitored the updating of the risk  
register by management.
The Audit Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board in relation to the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the independent auditors. The Committee takes into 
consideration a number of factors including the quality of reports 
provided by the independent auditors and of advice given, the level 
of understanding demonstrated of the Company’s businesses,  
the objectivity of the auditors’ views on the controls throughout  
the Company, ability to co-ordinate a global audit, the cost 
competitiveness of the auditors, the tenure of incumbent auditors 
and the periodic rotation of the senior audit management assigned 
to the audit of the Company. Having considered these factors the 
Committee agreed to recommend the auditors for reappointment.
Where the auditors have provided non-audit services,  
the Committee has ensured protection of their objectivity  
and independence taking account of relevant ethical guidance. 
Details of all fees paid to the auditors are included within  
Note 5 to the financial statements.
The outsourced internal auditor, KPMG LLP, reports to the 
Committee, which reviews and approves the internal audit  
work programme each year.
The Group has in place a whistleblowing policy as part of its  
ethical guidelines to encourage openness and an environment 
where any relevant matter can be reported to management.  
A helpline is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week,  
by an external organisation that specialises in these services.  
The policy exists in English and Chinese and the facility is available 
to all Group employees.
An Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy has also been established. 
The Board applies a zero tolerance approach to any breach of 
this policy.
Remuneration
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee  
which meets at least twice a year. It reviews the performance  
of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of 
their remuneration and the basis of their service agreements  
with due regard to the interest of shareholders. The year was  
the third year since introduction of the PSP and options were 
granted to Executive Directors Dean Webster, Derek Pitcher,  
Kim Berry and Patrick Sinclair. The PSP was designed by 
external consultants, with performance conditions that are 
stretching and promote the long-term success of the Company. 
Further details on the PSP can be found in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 37 to 42.
Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to a continuing dialogue with its 
shareholders. The Chairman ensures that the views of 
shareholders are communicated to the Board as a whole.
Following the announcement and presentation of the interim  
and year end results, there is a series of formal meetings  
with institutional shareholders and analysts. These meetings 
enable the Executive Directors to appraise the investors of  
the Group’s business and future plans and the shareholders  
can communicate any concerns they may have. The Group’s 
brokers and financial PR advisors provide feedback from the 
shareholder and analyst meetings and present the results  
to the Board.
The investor relations’ section on the Group’s website  
(www.sweettgroup.com) contains information on the Group’s 
financial results and its stock exchange announcements.  
The Board has decided that in future the presentations given  
to shareholders regarding the interim and year-end results will  
be made available on the website. Additionally, the Annual 
General Meeting provides a useful interface with shareholders. 
All shareholders are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting 
and all members of the Board will be available at the meeting to 
answer questions. Full Interim and Annual Reports are made 
available to all shareholders.

Directors’ remuneration report
Unaudited information
The following disclosures are sufficient to meet the requirements 
of the AIM rules.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company and is chaired by Roger Mabey.
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee determines the overall 
remuneration package for each Executive Director, with the  
aim of attracting, motivating and retaining Executive Directors  
of a high calibre. To this end, the Remuneration Committee  
takes external independent advice where it considers it  
appropriate to do so.
Basic salary
The salary of each Executive Director is determined by the 
Committee, taking into account their personal performance  
and the prevailing rates in the employment market for  
executives of comparable status, responsibility, skill and  
position in other relevant companies. When determining 
Directors’ salaries the Committee is always sensitive to pay 
 and employment conditions throughout the Group.
Executive bonus scheme 
Under the 2014 executive bonus scheme, £141,000 is due  
(2013: £66,000).
Share Option Plans
The Executive Directors hold options under the Enterprise 
Management Incentive share options scheme, the HMRC 
approved Company Share Option Plan and the unapproved 
Company Share Option Plan. The Company no longer qualifies  
to grant further options under the Enterprise Management 
Incentive scheme. New scheme rules for both the approved  
and unapproved plans were put in place in June 2010, the 
approved scheme rules having received consent from HMRC. 
The Executive Directors’ previous participation in the award  
of share options has been replaced by the PSP scheme  
detailed below.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The Executive Directors have received no further share options 
(except where a Director was granted those share options prior 
to being appointed to the Board of Sweett Group plc) under  
any of the Group’s schemes since the implementation of a  
new Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), which was approved  
at the Annual General Meeting held on 2 September 2011.  
The Committee made awards under the PSP to three of  
the Executive Directors in 2011 and to all four Executive and  
one Executive Committee member in 2012. The Committee 
subsequently made awards to three Executive Directors and  
one Executive Committee member in 2013. The conditions  
and performance criteria governing the new scheme for a  
three year performance period are cumulative earnings per share 
targets, lockup days targets and relative total shareholder returns 
performance targets, each applying to a third of achievable awards.

The performance conditions:
Cumulative Earnings per Share (‘EPS’)
One third of the total number of shares subject to an option is subject to the EPS Performance Condition. The EPS Performance 
Condition is that cumulative EPS must be at least 15.0p. After the first year’s performance, the Remuneration Committee found it 
appropriate to amend this performance criterion to at least 10.0p for the 2012 plan to make it more fair and reasonable. For the plan 
that was implemented in 2013, the same performance criterion was agreed. However, for 2014, the Remuneration Committee has 
agreed that the EPS Performance Condition reverts to being at least 15.0p. Vesting under the EPS condition is as follows:
Performance condition Granted in 2011 Granted in 2012 and 2013
Cumulative EPS Less than 15p 0% Less than 10p 0%

15p 25%
Between 15p and 19p Between 25% and 100%
19p or more 100%
* On a straight line basis
The Total Shareholder Return and Average Lockup Days’ performance conditions remained unchanged.
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’)
One third of the total number of shares subject to an option is subject to the TSR Performance Condition. The TSR Performance 
Condition is that the Company’s Total Shareholder Return over the performance period must be at least equal to the Total 
Shareholder Return of the Index over the same period. Vesting under the TSR Performance Condition is as follows:
Performance condition Granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and proposed to be granted in 2014
Total Shareholder Return Exceed index by 20% 100%
Equal to Index 25%
Between the above levels 100%

*
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 38 Lockup Days 
Any shares subject to an option that are not subject to the EPS Performance Condition or the TSR Performance Condition are subject to 
the Lockup Days Performance Condition. The Lockup Days Performance Condition is that the percentage reduction in the Company’s 
average lockup days over the Performance Period must be at least 2%. Vesting under the Lockup Days Performance Condition is as follows:
Performance condition Granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and proposed to be granted in 2014
Average Lockup days Less than 2% 0%

Other benefits
Each of the Executive Directors is provided with the use of a car or receives an annual cash allowance in lieu of this provision.  
Each also has the option of receiving the benefit of private medical insurance for themselves and/or their spouse and/or children. 
Other benefits provided include the payment of professional subscriptions and access to the Group’s gym membership scheme.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and the level of 
remuneration reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of their roles.

Employment policy
The Group is an Equal Opportunity Employer in the UK and  
its policy is to ensure greater diversity and inclusion. It seeks  
to ensure that all employees and job applicants are given  
equal opportunity, irrespective of their sex, race, ethnic origin, 
disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation or religious 
affiliation in all respects of employment and training and that  
no such person is placed at a disadvantage by requirements  
or conditions which cannot be shown to be justified.
The Group encourages, where possible, the employment of 
disabled people and retention of those who become disabled 
during their employment with the Group. Such individuals will  
be encouraged and supported to take advantage of the  
Group’s learning and development initiatives and career 
progression opportunities.
The Group seeks to ensure that all its businesses operate sound 
and progressive employment policies and promotes initiatives  
to attract and retain talent and promote employee engagement. 
Consultation and communication with employees continues  
at all levels, with the aims of ensuring that their views are taken 
into account when decisions are made that are likely to affect 
their interests, that information is promulgated on matters of 
concern to them and that all employees are aware of the financial 
and economic factors that may affect the performance of their 
business units and of the Group as a whole. This is achieved,  
for example, by a regular CEO blog on the intranet. 
The Group encourages employees’ interest in its financial 
performance through various share schemes, details of which 
are included at Notes 24 and 25 to the financial statements.

The Group’s strategy is to position itself as an employer of  
choice in its sector. Shortly before the financial year end, the 
Group was awarded with Investors in People (IIP) accreditation  
in the UK. The Group is proud of this achievement and is now 
working towards the bronze level of accreditation. The award 
reflects the commitment that the Group has towards engaging 
with and developing its employees. 
Environmental policy
Sweett Group recognises that its business activities have an  
impact on the local, regional and global environment. We undertake 
to carry out our operations with due regard to the effect they  
may have on the environment, acknowledging both current  
best practice and our legal obligations. We are committed to 
continuous improvement in our environmental performance.
In meeting its obligations with regards to its environmental  
policy, Sweett Group will: 
•  Meet relevant regulatory requirements and minimise  
any adverse environmental effects caused as a result  
of our activities, including the prevention of pollution
•  Raise awareness, provide knowledge and support to 
employees on environmental management 
•  Give training on the importance of environment and 
sustainability to our business and our clients’ success,  
to all appropriate employees
•  Invest in research and development to improve our  
own capability to predict and enhance building and  
investment performance
•  Promote an awareness of environmental objectives,  
the inclusion of sustainability requirements and the benefits  
of sustainable procurement to our clients throughout the 
broader activities as a construction consultant
•  Where practicable, promote and utilise resource efficient 
products i.e. products with a high recycled content, energy 
efficient appliances
•  Consider programmes for replacement and substitution  
of consumable materials and components with less 
environmentally damaging alternatives 
•  Where practicable, purchase goods that can be easily 
upgraded by adding or replacing parts that comply with  
all relevant procurement and environmental legislation  
as well as the continued use of fair trade products
•  Operate a policy of reduce, re-use and recycle for our 
materials and ensure waste is recycled where practical
•  Regularly review our environmental practices and policy  
in accordance with the principles of ISO 14001
•  Establish performance objectives, targets and management 
programmes to achieve these 
•  Ensure adequate resources are provided to implement the 
Environmental Management System
Corporate social responsibility
Sweett Group recognises that our operations and the services  
we provide have a significant impact on the communities and 
environments in which we operate. Our strategy of long-term, 
sustainable growth is directly linked to our Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) efforts.
Being a good corporate citizen also involves creating an 
environment that facilitates staff participation in charitable  
and community related activities – both in their professional 
capability and in their spare time.
The Group’s CSR policy addresses four main areas  
of responsibility:
1. Employee well-being
2. Community
3. Charity
4. Environment
•  Employee well-being – Our clients work with us because  
of the quality of our staff and the added value their expertise 
and knowledge represents. We see our CSR work as a 
mechanism for boosting morale, fostering team spirit and 
encouraging healthy living, all of which contribute to creating 
happier, healthier members of staff. 
•  C o mm u ni t y – Operating within the built environment we  
have a responsibility to ensure we engage with and play  
an active role in the local communities in which we operate.  
We do this through the development of the services we offer 
our clients and by building long-term relationships with key 
local stakeholders through our community outreach and 
charitable activities.
•  Ch a r it y – The Group and its staff have supported a number  
of charities across the world, covering causes such as cancer 
care, men’s health and animal welfare. In January 2012, after  
a significant staff consultation process, the Board of Directors 
adopted the theme of children/youth in the community as the 
Group’s charitable cause. Each regional CSR Committee’s 
charitable activities are focused on this cause, with local, 
relevant charities having been adopted across the Group.
•  E n vi ron m e n t – The construction, maintenance and operation 
of property and infrastructure developments accounts for  
a significant portion of the world’s annual carbon emissions. 
Our consultants play an important role in reducing these 
emissions by working with our clients to minimise the 
environmental impact of projects throughout their lifecycle.  
We also work across our own estate of offices and fleets to 
ensure energy and water consumption is kept to a minimum 
and recycling takes place where possible, minimising our 
waste to landfill.
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 44 In recognition of the link between our strategy for sustainable 
growth and our CSR efforts, responsibility for the Group’s CSR 
work lies with the Board of Directors, which guides the work of 
our local CSR Committees through the Group CSR Policy.
The Group recognises the benefits of sustainable construction 
and protecting the environment whilst carrying out construction 
projects and associated activities.
All activities are undertaken in a manner that manages the 
Group’s environmental impact, fulfils opportunities to enhance 
the environment, prevents pollution, minimises waste, controls 
noise, uses materials and resources efficiently and protects wildlife.
The Group has underpinned its commitment to managing the 
environmental impact of its operations by gaining ISO 14001 
certification for the Environmental Management System for its 
head office with a programme underway for roll out to other 
regional offices in the UK. It is working to deliver environmental 
objectives of: reducing waste and encouraging recycling, 
investigating ways of minimising resource consumption and 
developing environmental requirements for new offices.
Sweett Group’s corporate goal is to leverage its environmental 
expertise to create the most cost effective solutions for the 
sustainable built environment by: 
•  embedding sustainability expertise into its core services  
to enable staff to actively contribute to the sustainability  
of projects;
•  increasing the degree to which all staff have developed  
their sustainability knowledge; and
•  appointing an expert specifically tasked with supporting  
the operational business with the tools and data they need 
to realise this goal.
Sweett Group continues to work with the UK’s Waste and 
Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to support the construction 
and property sectors to make more efficient use of natural 
resources, helping to save money and reduce carbon emissions. 
We are currently helping WRAP to expand their work within the 
built environment including development of the business case for 
resource efficiency, design of simple but effective procurement 
clauses and development of an online portal to help businesses 
define their goals and track performance. Our work with WRAP  
is just one example of Sweett Group’s commitment to help in 
developing effective responses to the sustainability challenges 
facing the built environment. Other work includes major studies 
and policy advice for the Department for Energy and Climate 
Change, Department for Business Innovation and Skills,  
Green Construction Board, UK Green Buildings Council,  
BRE, Investment Property Forum and Zero Carbon Hub.
The Group complies with environmental legislation and environmental 
codes of practice applicable to the construction industry.
Health and safety policy
It is the Group’s policy to fulfil its duties under the Health and 
Safety at Work Act 1974 and all other associated acts and  
legal obligations applicable to the construction industry in the  
UK and overseas. The Health and Safety Policy sets out the 
arrangements in place, including the roles and responsibilities  
of all relevant parties, for managing health and safety across  
the organisation. 
Hazards specific to Sweett Group have been identified and  
any further actions to reduce or control these are prioritised  
in a health and safety plan which sets out the objectives for 
continual improvement in health and safety management and 
aims to ensure that the Group achieves best practice.
Where necessary the Policy is supported by more detailed 
guidance. All guidance is reviewed and updated on a regular 
basis to ensure that it remains legally compliant, is accurate and 
reflects contemporary best practice. The Policy and Plan are 
reviewed at least annually when there are changes in legislation 
that may affect the organisation or changes in work practices.
The Group provides suitable and sufficient resources to 
implement the arrangements set out in the Policy, including 
information, instruction and training as required. All staff are 
informed of their responsibility to take care of their own health 
and safety and actively participate and co-operate with the 
Group to enable it to discharge its statutory responsibilities  
and fulfil its desire for continual improvement in all safety,  
health and welfare matters.
Supplier payment policy
The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly communicating 
terms and conditions for business transactions with its suppliers. 
Payment is then made in accordance with these terms, subject to 
terms and conditions being met by the suppliers. At 31 March 2014 
the Group had 42 (2013: 45) days of purchases in trade payables 
and the Company had no trade payables (2013: none).
Whistleblowing policy
The Group has established a whistleblowing policy as part of its 
ethical guidelines to encourage openness and an environment 
where any relevant matter can be reported to management.

Disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the Directors at the time of approval  
of this report, each Director confirms that:
•  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
•  he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness  
to continue in office and a resolution that they be re-appointed 
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Going concern
The Directors are confident that they have the right strategy  
and action plan to operate within the requirements of the bank 
covenants and, on this basis, have a reasonable expectation  
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial 
statements. Further details on going concern are set out in Note 1 
to the financial statements. 
Forward-looking statements
Certain statements in this annual report and accounts  
are forward-looking. Although the Group believes that the 
expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements  
are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these 
expectations will prove to have been correct. Because these 
statements involve risk and uncertainties, actual results may  
differ materially from those expressed or implied by these 
forward-looking statements.
We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking 
statements whether as a result of new information,  
future events or otherwise.

Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 46 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect  
of the annual report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and  
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and  
the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2014 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s 
and the Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
•  the Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in  
the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements and Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared  
by Sweett Group plc, comprise:
•  the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets as at  
31 March 2014;
•  the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year  
then ended;
•  the Consolidated and Company Statement of Cash Flows  
for the year then ended;
•  the Consolidated and Company statement of changes  
in equity for the year then ended; and
•  the notes to the financial statements, which include a  
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in  
their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by  
the European Union and, as regards the Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of  
the Companies Act 2006.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the Directors have 
made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect  
of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, 
they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting  
framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual  
Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements  
and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and
•  the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with  
the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 48 Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and  
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•  the Company financial statements are not in agreement  
with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 47, the Directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and  
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Financial statements
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 57
Governance Strategic report Notes to the financial statements
1. General information
Sweett Group plc is a public limited 
company with shares listed on the 
Alternative Investment Market and is 
incorporated and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. 
The address of the registered office is  
60 Gray’s Inn Road, London, WC1X 8AQ.  
The Company is the parent company  
of a group of international companies  
and the principal activities of the Group 
include the provision of construction cost 
consultancy, project management and other 
specialised consultancy services, including 
building surveying. These activities are 
carried out in Europe, the Middle East,  
Africa and India (MEAI) and Asia Pacific,  
the Group’s operating segments.
Basis of preparation
The Group’s and parent company’s 
financial statements have been prepared  
in accordance with International  
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union,  
and the Companies Act 2006 applicable  
to companies reporting under IFRS as 
they apply to the financial statements  
of the Group and the parent company  
for the year ended 31 March 2014.  
The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared on a going concern 
basis and under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation 
of available-for-sale financial assets,  
and financial assets and financial liabilities, 
including derivatives at fair value through 
profit or loss.
The parent company has elected to take 
the exemption under Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 not to present its 
own income statement or statement  
of comprehensive income.
Going concern
The Group’s activities are funded by a 
combination of long-term equity funds,  
a reducing loan and overdraft facilities 
from the principal banker , Bank of Scotland 
plc, and other facilities overseas.
In considering the ability of the Group  
to meet its financial obligations as they  
fall due, the Board has considered the 
expected trading performance of the  
Group, including pressures on margins, 
working capital requirements, the level  
of overheads and interest to be funded  
and loan repayments.
The Board has modelled a wide range  
of scenarios in respect of each of these 
variables with particular regard to future 
compliance with the financial covenants  
to Bank of Scotland plc listed in the 
preceding financial review.
The Directors believe that the principal 
sensitivities and actions which can have 
the greatest impact on the headroom  
in the covenant compliance include:
•  Trading performance and managing 
working capital requirements across  
the Group;
•  Ensuring recovery of retentions  
amounting to £1m on a Middle East 
contract. The Directors have no reason  
to believe that the outstanding sums  
will not be recovered, though timing 
is uncertain.
The Directors are confident that they  
have the right strategy and action plan  
to operate within the requirements of the 
bank covenants and, on this basis, have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Group’s financial statements.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies in the 
preparation of this financial information are 
set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to financial statements 
for the years ended 31 March 2014 and  
31 March 2013, unless otherwise stated.
Adoption of new and revised 
standards 
The following accounting standards and 
amendments to accounting standards 
have been adopted by the Group for the 
first time for the financial year beginning 
on 1 April 2013 and have an impact on  
the Group. 
(i) The amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial 
Statement Presentation’, whereby other 
comprehensive income/(loss) is now 
grouped on the basis of whether such 
income/(loss) is potentially reclassifiable  
to profit or loss. 
(ii) IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’. 
See Note 21 for further information. 
The following accounting standards are 
effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2014 and have not 
yet been adopted by the Group. 
(i) IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’. The 
standard addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and liabilities. 
The Group has yet to assess the full 
impact of this accounting standard. 
(ii) IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial 
Statements’. This standard builds on 
existing principles by identifying the 
concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements. The Group has yet to assess 
the full impact of this standard.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC 
interpretations that are not yet effective 
that would be expected to have a material 
impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial information of 
Sweett Group plc and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 31 March 2014, 
adjusted to eliminate intra-group balances, 
transactions, income and expenses.  
The Group has used the acquisition 
method of accounting to consolidate the 
results of subsidiary undertakings, entities 
over which the Group has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies 
of the subsidiary, which are included from 
the date of acquisition.
Business combinations are accounted  
for under the acquisition method.  
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
subsidiary are measured at their fair values 
at the date of acquisition. Any excess of  
the cost of acquisition over the fair values 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency  
of the cost of acquisition below the fair 
values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition)  
is credited to the income statement in  
the period of acquisition.
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 58 2. Significant accounting policies 
continued
The consideration transferred for an 
acquisition is measured at fair value of the 
consideration given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed  
at the date of exchange. This includes  
any contingent consideration. Acquisition 
related costs are expensed as incurred. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration to be 
transferred by the Group is recognised  
at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value  
of the contingent consideration that is 
deemed to be an asset or liability is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 39  
in profit or loss, except for those arising  
on acquisitions before 2010. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity  
is not remeasured, and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated  
at cost less provisions for impairment 
where appropriate.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included 
in the consolidated income statement 
from the effective date of acquisition  
or up to the effective date of disposal,  
as appropriate, being the date at which 
control passes.
Where necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial information of subsidiaries 
to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions and balances 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in  
a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating 
decision-maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, 
has been identified as the Board.
Unallocated corporate costs are costs 
incurred centrally which are neither directly 
nor reasonably attributable to individual 
segments. Unallocated assets and liabilities 
include certain items which cannot be 
directly attributed to individual segments.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rate ruling  
at the date of the transaction. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation 
are included in the income statement. 
Translation differences on non-monetary 
financial assets, such as equities classified 
as available for sale, are included in other 
comprehensive income. Gains or losses  
on the translation of opening and closing 
net assets of subsidiary undertakings 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
The consolidated financial information  
is presented in pounds sterling, which is  
the Company’s functional and presentation 
currency. On consolidation, income 
statements and cash flows of foreign 
entities are translated into pounds sterling 
at average exchange rates for the year 
and their balance sheets are translated at 
the exchange rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the balance sheet date.
The Group, through its ownership of 
branches and subsidiaries based outside 
the UK, has foreign currency-denominated 
assets and liabilities. To mitigate the effect 
of currency exposure arising from net 
investments overseas, the Group selectively 
hedges those exposures, where material, 
using borrowings denominated in foreign 
currency or financial hedging instruments.
The financial statements are presented in 
sterling to the nearest thousand (£’000).
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable 
and represents amounts receivable for 
services provided in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, value added 
tax and other sales related taxes and after 
eliminating intra-group sales.
Contract work in progress
When the outcome of a construction contract 
can be estimated reliably and it is probable 
that the contract will be profitable, contract 
revenue is recognised over the period of the 
contract by reference to the stage of 
completion. Contract costs are recognised 
as expenses by reference to the stage  
of completion of the contract activity at  
the end of the reporting period. When it  
is probable that total contract costs  
will exceed total contract revenue, the 
expected loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately. When the outcome of a 
construction contract cannot be estimated 
reliably, contract revenue is recognised 
only to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that are likely to be recoverable. 
Variations in contract work, claims and 
incentive payments are included in contract 
revenue to the extent that it may have been 
agreed with the customer and are capable 
of being reliably measured. The Group 
uses the ‘percentage-of-completion method’ 
to determine the appropriate amount to 
recognise in a given period. The stage of 
completion is measured by reference to the 
contract costs incurred up to the end of the 
reporting period as a percentage of total 
estimated costs for each contract. Costs 
incurred in the year in connection with 
future activity on a contract are excluded 
from contract costs in determining the 
stage of completion. On the balance sheet, 
the Group reports the net contract position 
for each contract as either an asset or a 
liability. A contract represents an asset 
where costs incurred plus recognised 
profits (less recognised losses) exceed 
progress billings; a contract represents a 
liability where the opposite is the case.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot  
be estimated reliably, contract revenue  
is recognised to the extent of contract  
costs incurred that it is probable will be 
recoverable. Contract costs are recognised 
as expenses in the period in which they  
are incurred. When it is probable that total 
contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised  
as an expense immediately.
Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs are capitalised and 
treated as work in progress only if they can 
be separately identified, measured reliably 
and it is probable that the related contract 
will be won. Until this time, all such costs 
are expensed to the income statement  
in the period in which they are incurred.  
To the extent that contract terms do not 
allow for recoupment of bid costs at 
financial close of PPP contracts, such 
costs are amortised over the length of 
each contract.

2. Significant accounting policies

Time-based contracts
Revenue on time-based products  
is recognised in line with labour  
hours delivered.
Finance income
Interest income is recognised in the 
income statement as it is earned.
Finance cost
Interest expense is recognised in  
the income statement as it accrues.
Changes in fair value of derivative 
instruments that do not qualify for  
hedge accounting, or have not been 
designated as hedges, are recognised  
in the income statement within finance 
costs/income as they arise.
Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when the 
right to receive payment is established.
Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation 
represents the excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the Group’s interest in  
the fair value of the identifiable assets  
and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date  
of acquisition.
For subsidiaries, goodwill is recognised  
as an intangible asset and is tested at least 
annually for impairment or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate potential impairment. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately  
in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed. On disposal of  
a subsidiary the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination  
of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating 
Units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment 
testing. The allocation is made to those 
CGUs that are expected to benefit from  
the business combination in which the 
goodwill arose identified according to 
operating segments.
Goodwill is held at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
(ii) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are 
capitalised on the basis of costs incurred 
to acquire and bring to use the specific 
software. Computer software licences  
are held at cost and amortised on  
a straight-line basis over four years.
Costs associated with developing  
or maintaining computer software 
programs are recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Costs directly associated  
with identifiable and unique software 
products controlled by the Group and 
which are expected to generate economic 
benefits beyond one year are recognised 
as intangible assets and amortised over  
their estimated useful economic lives.
Computer software is held at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any 
impairment losses.
(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets identified in a 
business combination are capitalised  
at fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, the carrying 
amount of such an intangible asset is its 
cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment loss. 
Useful economic lives of intangible assets 
are assessed on acquisition to be either 
indefinite or finite. Amortisation is charged 
as appropriate on those intangibles with 
finite lives.
The identified fair value of customer 
relationships and order books acquired  
on business combinations is being 
amortised over a period of between  
seven and ten years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment mainly 
comprises furniture, fixtures and 
equipment and is shown at cost less 
subsequent accumulated depreciation 
and impairment. Cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable  
to the acquisition of these assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the 
asset’s carrying amount only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to  
the Group and the cost of the item  
can be measured reliably. Repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the income 
statement during the financial period in 
which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated to write off  
their cost less residual value over their 
expected useful lives.
The rates of depreciation used for  
the assets are as follows:
Fixtures and fittings  20%  
– straight line
Computer hardware  25% – 50% 
– straight line
The assets’ residual values and useful 
lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal  
or retirement of an asset is determined as  
the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset  
and is included in the income statement.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life,  
for example goodwill, are not subject  
to amortisation and are tested annually  
for impairment and whenever events or 
changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation and 
depreciation are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may  
not be recoverable. An impairment loss  
is recognised for the amount by which  
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Non-financial assets other than goodwill 
that suffered impairment are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at  
each reporting date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event,  
it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation, and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. The amount 
recognised as a provision at the balance 
sheet date is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the 
present obligation taking into account  
the risks and uncertainties surrounding 
the obligation. Where there is a material 
effect the expected future payments are 
discounted. When some or all of the 
economic benefits required to settle a 
provision are expected to be recovered 
from a third party, the receivable is 
recognised as an asset only if it is  
virtually certain that reimbursement  
will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 60 2. Significant accounting policies 
continued
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as ‘available 
for sale’ financial assets and ‘loans and 
receivables’. Available for sale financial 
assets are non derivative financial assets 
and are recorded at fair value less 
transaction costs. Gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in the statement of 
comprehensive income, until the asset  
is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, at which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in 
equity is included in the income statement 
for the period. Impairment losses on 
available for sale financial assets are  
not reversed. Loans and receivables are 
classified as financial assets when they 
are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market and are 
initially measured at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised  
cost using the effective interest method 
less accumulated impairment losses.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are carried at original 
invoice amount less provision made for 
impairment of these receivables. A provision 
for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able  
to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms. The amount of the provision 
is recognised in administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash 
in hand and deposits held with banks. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within current 
financial liabilities on the balance sheet.
For the purposes of the statement of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents are net 
of bank overdrafts.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to 
the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the 
company’s equity share capital (treasury 
shares), the consideration paid, including  
any directly attributable incremental costs 
(net of income taxes) is deducted from equity 
attributable to the company’s equity owners 
until the shares are cancelled or reissued. 
Where such shares are subsequently 
reissued, any consideration received,  
net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income  
tax effects, is included in equity attributable 
to the owners of the parent.
Impairment of financial assets
(a) Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at the end of each 
reporting period whether there is objective 
evidence that a financial asset or group  
of financial assets is impaired. A financial 
asset or a group of financial assets is 
impaired and impairment losses are 
incurred only if there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more 
events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) 
and that loss event (or events) has an 
impact on the estimated future cash flows 
of the financial asset or group of financial 
assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the Group uses to 
determine that there is objective evidence 
of an impairment loss include:
•  significant financial difficulty of the 
issuer or obligor;
•  a breach of contract, such as a default 
or delinquency in interest or principal 
payments;
•  the Group, for economic or legal 
reasons relating to the borrower’s 
financial difficulty, granting to the 
borrower a concession that the lender 
would not otherwise consider;
•  it becomes probable that the borrower 
will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation;
•  the disappearance of an active market 
for that financial asset because of 
financial difficulties; or
•  observable data indicating that there is 
a measurable decrease in the estimated 
future cash flows from a portfolio  
of financial assets since the initial 
recognition of those assets, although 
the decrease cannot yet be identified 
with the individual financial assets in the 
portfolio, including: adverse changes in 
the payment status of borrowers in the 
portfolio; and national or local economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults 
on the assets in the portfolio.
The Group first assesses whether 
objective evidence of impairment exists.
The amount of the loss is measured  
as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value  
of estimated future cash flows (excluding 
future credit losses that have not been 
incurred) discounted at the financial 
asset’s original effective interest rate.  
The asset’s carrying amount is reduced 
and the amount of the loss is recognised  
in the consolidated income statement.  
If a loan or held-to-maturity investment  
has a variable interest rate, the discount 
rate for measuring any impairment loss  
is the current effective interest rate 
determined under the contract. As a 
practical expedient, the Group may 
measure impairment on the basis of  
an instrument’s fair value using an 
observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount  
of the impairment loss decreases and the 
decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was 
recognised (such as an improvement in 
the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal  
of the previously recognised impairment 
loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
(b) Assets classified as available for sale
The Group assesses at the end of each 
reporting period whether there is objective 
evidence that a financial asset or a group  
of financial assets is impaired. For debt 
securities, the Group uses the criteria 
referred to in (a) above. In the case of 
equity investments classified as available-
for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline 
in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is also evidence that the assets are 
impaired. If any such evidence exists  
for available-for-sale financial assets,  
the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference between the acquisition  
cost and the current fair value, less any 
impairment loss on that financial asset 
previously recognised in profit or loss  
– is removed from equity and recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in the 
consolidated income statement on equity 
instruments are not reversed through the 
consolidated income statement. If, in  
a subsequent period, the fair value of a  
debt instrument classified as available- 
for-sale increases and the increase  
can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss  
was recognised in profit or loss, the 
impairment loss is reversed through  
the consolidated income statement.

Impairment testing of trade receivables  
is described in Note 16.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either 
financial liabilities ‘at fair value through 
profit or loss’, or other financial liabilities. 
Financial liabilities carried at fair value 
through profit or loss, are initially 
recognised at fair value, and transaction 
costs are expensed in the profit for the 
financial year. Gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of the financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
category are presented in the profit for  
the financial year.
Other financial liabilities, including 
borrowings, are initially measured at fair 
value, net of transaction costs and 
subsequently at amortised cost.
Financial assets and financial liabilities  
are recognised in the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Company becomes  
a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument. Financial liabilities are 
presented as current liabilities if expected 
to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, 
they are classified as non-current.
Derivative financial instruments and 
hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date a derivative contract  
is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at their fair value. The method 
of recognising the resulting gain or loss 
depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument, and  
if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
The Group designates certain derivatives 
as hedges of a net investment in a foreign 
operation (net investment hedge).
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of a net 
investment hedge is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or  
loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity 
are included in the income statement 
when the foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
or have not been designated as hedges, 
are recognised in the income statement 
within finance costs/income as they arise. 
These derivative instruments are designated 
at fair value through profit or loss.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts 
are initially recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs,  
are accounted for on an accruals basis in 
the income statement using the effective 
interest method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to  
the extent that they are not settled in  
the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially  
at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost.
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment 
by which the Group has substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the inception of  
the lease at the lower of fair value and the 
estimated present value of the underlying 
lease payments, with a corresponding 
liability established. Each lease payment is 
allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant  
rate of interest on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding rental 
obligations, net of finance charges, are 
included in liabilities. The interest element  
of the finance cost is charged to the 
income statement over the lease period. 
Property, plant and equipment acquired 
under finance leases are depreciated over 
the shorter of the asset’s useful life and 
the lease term. Leases where a significant 
portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases are charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of 
the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on 
taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and  
it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be 
payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amount of assets  
and liabilities in the financial information  
and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the liability method. 
Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises 
from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction, other than in a business 
combination, that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting  
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax  
is determined using tax rates and laws  
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related tax 
asset is realised or the tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, except where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary difference is 
controlled by the Group and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred 
tax relating to items recognised directly  
in equity is recognised in equity and not  
in the consolidated income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and  
liabilities are offset when there is a  
legally enforceable right to offset current  
tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities relate to income taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority on either 
the same taxable entity or different taxable 
entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balance on a net basis.

Employee benefits
Pension obligations
Group companies operate various 
pension schemes. The schemes are 
funded through payments to insurance 
companies or trustee-administered funds. 
The Group has both defined benefit and 
defined contribution plans. A defined 
benefit plan is a pension plan that defines 
an amount of pension benefit that an 
employee will receive on retirement, 
usually dependent on one or more  
factors such as age, years of service  
and compensation. The pension cost  
for defined benefit schemes is assessed  
in accordance with the advice of  
qualified independent actuaries.
The liability records the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date less 
the fair value of plan assets. Independent 
actuaries calculate the obligation annually 
using the “projected unit” funding method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are not recognised in the income 
statement and are presented in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
A defined contribution plan is a pension  
plan under which the Group pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity.  
The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the 
fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to employee 
service in the current and prior periods. 
Contributions are recognised as an expense 
in the income statement when they are due.
Share based payments
The Company operates executive and 
employee share schemes. For all grants  
of share options and awards with the 
exception of those under the Performance 
Share Plan (PSP), the fair value as at  
the date of grant is calculated using the 
Black-Scholes option pricing model and 
the corresponding expense is recognised 
over the period to which the associated 
employee’s service relates. The Company 
has taken advantage of the transitional 
provisions of IFRS 2 only to recognise 
equity settled awards granted after  
7 November 2002 that had not vested 
before 1 January 2005. For the nil-cost 
options granted under the Performance 
Share Plan, which can be settled in cash 
or shares, the cost is estimated at the 
balance sheet date based on the level at 
which the conditions have been met, and 
accrued through the income statement.
At the end of each reporting period,  
the Group revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to 
vest based on the non-market vesting 
conditions. The Group recognises the 
impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the income statement with  
a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The grant by the Company of options over 
its equity instruments to the employees  
of subsidiary undertakings in the Group 
 is treated as a capital contribution.  
The fair value of employee services 
received, measured by reference to 
the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to 
investment in subsidiary undertakings, 
with a corresponding credit to equity.
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
The Company’s EBT is a separately 
administered discretionary trust for the 
benefit of employees. The assets of  
the EBT mainly comprise shares in the 
Company. The assets, liabilities, income  
and costs of the EBT are consolidated in the 
financial information. The investment in own 
shares is treated as a deduction in equity.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability  
in the Group’s accounts in the period  
in which the dividends are approved  
by the Company’s shareholders.
Exceptional and other items
Exceptional items are those that the 
Directors consider are of such unusual 
size or nature that they are required to  
be separately disclosed to allow the user 
of the financial statements to understand 
the underlying performance of the Group. 
These are shown on the face of the 
income statement as exceptional 
administrative expenses.
Other items which are recurring in nature 
but which warrant separate disclosures 
include the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and the Performance Share 
Plan (PSP), the costs of which we are 
accruing for the first time.
Earnings and diluted earnings per  
share are calculated after exceptional  
and other items whilst earnings per  
share before exceptional administration 
expenses are calculated after amortisation 
of acquired intangibles.
Critical accounting estimates and 
significant judgements
The preparation of the financial 
information requires the Group to make 
estimates, judgements and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 
and related disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. The Directors base 
their estimates on historical experience 
and various other assumptions that  
they believe are reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgements about 
the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates under different assumptions 
or conditions.
The estimates and assumptions that have  
a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities, all of which are on  
the basis that the Group is a going 
concern as addressed in Note 1 to these 
financial statements, are addressed below:
(a) Carrying value of goodwill
The Group tests annually whether  
goodwill has suffered any impairment,  
in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy. In determining the recoverable 
amount of all cash generating units it is 
necessary to make a series of assumptions 
to estimate the present value of future  
cash flows. In each case, these key 
assumptions have been made by 
management reflecting past experience 
and future expectations. The main 
assumptions within forecast operating 
cash flows include the achievement of 
future sales, the costs to be incurred  
and the anticipated after tax profit.  
Further details are given in Note 10.
The goodwill has a carrying value of 
£15.2m (2013: £16.3m) at the year end.

continued
(b) Deferred contingent consideration
Where deferred consideration in respect 
of acquisitions is payable, this may be 
contingent upon future events or the 
acquired business’s performance.  
The most probable outcome of these 
future events is estimated to ascertain  
the fair value of the obligation. Any change 
to this outcome will be reflected in the 
statement of comprehensive income in 
future periods, unless affected by the 
transitional provisions in IFRS 3 (revised). 
Further details are given in Note 20. 
(c) Revenue recognition
The Group uses the percentage of 
completion method in accounting for its 
fixed price contracts to deliver services. 
Use of the percentage of completion 
method requires the Group to estimate 
the work performed to date as a proportion 
of the expected work for the whole contract. 
In respect of pre-contract costs, where 
such costs relate to a PFI or PPP bid,  
a view is taken as to probability of award 
with reference to progress on contract 
negotiations and the likely date of 
achievement of preferred bidder status. 
The Group will also assess the ability  
to bill and collect these amounts when 
determining revenue to be recognised. 
Due to the volume and complexity of  
the Group’s many contracts in existence  
at any one time it is not practicable to 
quantify how changes to the assumptions 
used for each individual contract would 
affect the Group’s financial statements.
(d) Available for sale financial assets
The Group classifies each of its 
investments in PFI and PPP projects  
as available for sale financial assets.  
The value of these is assessed at the 
balance sheet date based on offers 
received or contracted by third parties  
for the sale of equivalent assets.
(e) Impairment of trade receivables
The Group assesses at the balance sheet 
date whether there is objective evidence 
of impairment of trade receivables. 
Evidence of impairment may include  
that a debtor or group of debtors is 
experiencing financial difficulty, default  
in payments, the probability that they  
will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation, or where observable  
data indicate that there is a measurable 
decrease in the estimated future cash 
flows such as changes in arrears or 
economic conditions which correlate  
with defaults.
(f) Pension benefits
The present value of the pension 
obligations depends on a number of 
factors that are determined on an actuarial 
basis using a number of assumptions.  
The assumptions used in determining  
the net cost for pensions include the 
discount rate. Any changes in these 
assumptions will impact the carrying 
amount of pension obligations.
Other key assumptions for pension 
obligations are based in part on current 
market conditions. Additional information 
is disclosed in Note 21.
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 64 3. Segmental analysis
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as being the Board.
The Board considers Sweett Group’s business and internal reporting by geography, being Europe, the Middle East, Africa & India and 
Asia Pacific. The Investments business, which was previously reported as a separate segment, is dealt with as part of Europe and 
comparatives have been adjusted since its future size does not warrant separate identification. All three categories generate revenues 
from the provision of quantity surveying, project management and specialist services/management consultancy and the Europe 
business generated profits on the disposal of its PPP/PFI financial assets available for sale.
The Board assesses performance based on a measure of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). This measurement is net of 
intra-group trading balances and this basis excludes the effects of corporate and central costs. Interest income and expenditure  
are not included in the results for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board.

instrument on maturity in March 2012 and subsequently in March 2013. In September 2013 the contract was fully exited, resulting in  
the positive fair value adjustment of £970,000 in finance income above.
Interest expense on unwinding of discount relates to the notional interest on deferred acquisition consideration.

9. Earnings per share continued
Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares (Note 24). 
The weighted number of shares excludes shares held by employee trusts.
Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company’s dilutive potential ordinary shares are share options. A calculation  
is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual 
market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share 
options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming 
the exercise of the share options.
Before exceptional administrative expenses and Performance Share Plan charges
Tax-adjusted earnings per share are calculated before exceptional administrative expenses and Performance Share Plan charges and 
after amortisation of acquired intangibles using the weighted average number of shares.

There were no acquisitions during the years to 31 March 2014 or 2013.
The Group’s goodwill arose predominantly on the acquisitions of Cyril Sweett Limited, Nisbet LLP, BurnsBridge Holdings Pty Limited 
and Widnell Limited and the Company’s goodwill arose on the acquisitions of Cyril Sweett Limited.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”), which are generally the smallest operating level at which the Directors 
believe that they can prepare appropriate cash flow forecasts. The recoverable amount of all CGUs was determined based on value in use 
calculations. The calculations used were based on short-term financial projections approved by management. The short-term projections 
indicated that the value in use of each CGU exceeded the goodwill carrying values. No provision for impairment was considered necessary.
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 72 10. Goodwill continued
The adjustment to goodwill represents an adjustment in respect of deferred consideration relating to the acquisition of Padgham  
& Partners Pty Limited on 4 March 2010. On 28 February 2014 the Company issued 314,387 ordinary shares of 10p each at a 
premium of 16.15p per share, in part satisfaction of the acquisition of Padgham & Partners Pty Limited and its subsidiary company, 
Padgham Cost Management Private Limited. These shares were issued on behalf of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Sweett 
Group (Australia) Pty Limited which acquired Padgham & Partners Pty Limited. In addition, Sweett Group (Australia) Pty Limited paid 
cash of £144,000 against which there were accrued liabilities of £47,000.
The financial projections used in these calculations were based on the following key data and assumptions:
1.  Budgeted revenue and profit after taxation for 2015, as agreed by the Board, is used for the basis of determining projected  
net profit margins and hence anticipated future cash flows. The Group budget is based on a combination of past performance,  
the order book and an assessment of future market conditions.
2.  Net profit margins were projected forward for each CGU having regard to their relative markets and risk profiles. A growth factor  
of 2.5% was applied for each CGU. These cash flows were projected forward for a total of five years plus a discounted terminal 
value at five years, with 0% growth rate.
3.  Maintaining gross profit margins and net profit margins at 2015 budgeted levels.
4.  Applying the discount rate of 12% (the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC)). The WACC is calculated using the 
capital asset pricing model according to market data and the level of debt to equity in existence.
5.  Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and growth rates was performed to identify the level of headroom in the calculation for 
each CGU. A range of changes to assumptions was tested including: an increase of two percentage-points being applied to the 
discount rate; reducing growth rates by one percentage-point; and assuming zero growth. Previous operating performance was 
also considered in the context of determining the forecast profits used in the calculations. 
The impairment tests showed a high degree of tolerance to increases in the discount rates being used. If the discount rates had  
been increased by 2% or the growth rate reduced to zero, there would still have been no impairment in any of the CGUs. In addition, 
a decrease of at least 28% in profit before tax in any of the individual CGUs would be necessary for any goodwill impairment to 
become a consideration.
The carrying value of goodwill by segment is as follows:

Financial assets available for sale relate to the capital cost of 15% of E4D&G Holdco Limited, a company incorporated in England and 
Wales, and 33.3% of the A shares of Express Lift Investments Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales. The Group 
also owns 50% of Sweett Equitix Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales, at a cost of £51. The Directors do not 
believe that the Group is able to exert significant influence over either Express Lift Investments Limited or Sweett Equitix Limited.
These companies are special purpose vehicles involved in the construction of health and educational facilities under PFI/PPP 
schemes. The balance of risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets is not borne by the Group, and therefore its interest  
is accounted for as a financial asset and is classified as available-for-sale and loans and receivables respectively. The Group has  
now disposed of its interest in all these PFI/PPP schemes except for the retained equity interests referred to above, the benefits  
of which relate to future potential dividend income. These assets are therefore held at cost and the Directors believe that this 
approximates to their fair value.
Previously the Group’s interest in such assets were held at fair value on the basis that once the construction of the facilities is 
complete and they are in the operational phase, the fair value could be measured by computing the forecast project cash flows 
relevant to the Group’s interest, discounted at relevant market discount rates, or by reference to an agreed market value.
On 21 January 2014 Sweett Investments Limited transferred its interest in the Scottish hub North Territory project to a new joint 
venture company, Sweett Equitix Limited jointly owned by Sweett Investments Limited and Equitix Hubco 3 Limited. Under the  
terms of the transfer agreement, Equitix Hubco 3 Limited will provide substitute financing for the two existing hub North schemes  
and fund future schemes to the extent previously underwritten by the Group. The cash amount paid to the Group in consideration  
for the transfer was approximately £900,000.
In February 2013 the Group disposed of its investment in 15% of the unsecured loan notes 2039 in the Dumfries & Galloway PFI 
project. The transaction was achieved via the sale of Cyril Sweett Investments Limited, whose only asset at completion was the loan 
notes. The consideration was £2,250,000 resulting in a profit of £500,000. The underlying project was Dumfries & Galloway Schools. 
The Group retains its interest in 15% of the issued share capital of E4D&G Holdco Limited via its wholly owned subsidiary, Sweett 
Investments (D&G) Limited.
In September 2012 Cyril Sweett Investments Limited disposed of its holding of 19% of the issued share capital and subordinated 
debt of Lift Investments Limited for £700,000, resulting in a profit of £0.4m. The underlying project was Plymouth Lift.
In July 2012 Cyril Sweett Investments Limited disposed of its holding of 19% of the issued share capital and subordinated debt of  
e4i Holdings Limited for £2,192,860 resulting in a profit of £800,000. The underlying project was Inverclyde Schools.
Loans and other receivables represent subordinated loan notes together with accrued interest receivable of £nil (2013: £323,000)  
and rental deposits repayable after more than one year of £91,000 (2013: £244,000).

On 26 February 2013 the Company sold its investment in Cyril Sweett Investments Limited to Infrastructure Intermediaries No 1 
Limited. This disposal concluded the sale of its investment in 15% of the unsecured loan notes 2039 in the Dumfries & Galloway  
PFI project. The consideration, £2.25m in cash, was paid in full on completion and this sale was part of Sweett Group’s wider 
programme to reduce its investments in PFI and PPP projects. The trade and other remaining assets of Cyril Sweett Investments 
Limited were retained within the Group.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Trade and other 
receivables are included as part of financial assets.
Within the trade receivables balance at 31 March 2014 is a retention balance of £1.0m (2013: £1.0m) on a Middle East contract.
Amounts due from Group undertakings are unsecured, interest free and repayable on demand.
As at 31 March 2014, trade receivables of £1,620,000 (2013: £1,722,000) were impaired by either a bad debt or credit note provision. 
The amount of the debt provision was £1,516,000 (2013: £1,595,000). The individually impaired receivables relate to clients’ inability  
to raise funding in the current climate, the impact of the recession on clients’ ability to pay and ongoing minor disputes with clients. 
The level of credit risk is, in the view of the Board, generally low, due to a wide mix of clients in each of the geographical areas in 
which the Group operates with the exception of the Middle East, Africa and India, where there is a smaller number of clients than 
elsewhere. The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

21. Retirement benefit obligations
Defined benefit pension schemes
Group and Company 
The Company’s funded defined benefit pension scheme was closed to new members from 1 January 1999 and with effect from  
30 June 2003 the Company stopped making contributions to this scheme for current members in respect of their future service. 
Contributions that previously would have been paid into this scheme are now being paid into the Sweett Group Personal Pension 
Scheme, which is a defined contribution pension scheme.
Full actuarial valuations are prepared every three years and the valuation at 30 June 2011 was completed using the following annual 
growth rate assumptions:
Investment return 4.8% – 6.3%
Salary increases n/a
Pension increases 3.45%
At the date of the latest completed actuarial valuation completed as at 30 June 2011 the market value of the assets was £10,992,000 
which represented 87% of the benefits accrued to members on an ongoing basis, the resulting deficit being £1,693,000.
During the year the Company contributed £276,000 (2013: £326,000) to the defined benefit pension scheme.
An updated actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2014 by an independent actuary, for the purposes of inclusion of 
information about the pension scheme in these accounts. The main assumptions used by the actuary were:
As at
31/03/2014
As at
31/03/2013
Discount rate 4.30% 4.00%
Inflation assumption (RPI) 3.50% 3.50%
Inflation assumption (CPI) 2.50% 2.50%
Rate of increase in salaries n/a n/a
Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 3.50% 3.50%
Statutory revaluation of deferred benefits 2.50% 2.50%
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 84 21. Retirement benefit obligations continued
Assumed life expectancies on retirement at age 65 are:
As at
31/03/2014
As at
31/03/2013
Retiring today – males 24.0 24.0
Retiring today – females 25.1 25.0
Retiring in 20 years’ time – males 25.4 25.3
Retiring in 20 years’ time – females 26.6 26.6
The assumptions used by management are best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which,  
due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected future lifetime of a male pensioner aged 65 is 24 years. For a future pensioner retiring in 20 years, this increases  
to 25.4 years.
The fair value of the scheme’s assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change 
before they are realised, and the present value of the scheme’s liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long 
periods and are inherently uncertain, were:

IAS 19 Employee Benefits (amended 2011) has been implemented for the year ended 31 March 2014. The impact of the implementation 
on the previous year’s amounts is not considered material and the comparative amounts have not been amended in these financial 
statements. The comparative disclosures above reflect the impact of the amended IAS 19 had the implementation been applied to 
the prior period. 
The contributions to be paid during the financial year to 31 March 2015 are expected to amount to £276,000.

Sweett Group Employee Benefit Trust
The Employee Benefit Trust was established as a scheme for encouraging or facilitating the holding of shares in the Company by  
or for the benefit of bona fide employees of the Company. Assets and liabilities recorded by the Employee Benefit Trust are treated  
as assets and liabilities of the Company, but are under the day to day control of trustees. 
The trustees have the power to grant options over any shares held by the trust or to sell or transfer any such shares to any 
beneficiaries from time to time provided always that the trustees consider that the grant of options or sale of shares will be 
advantageous to the beneficiaries. Costs of the Employees Benefit Trust have been recorded as a part of operating expenses  
of the Company. At 31 March 2014 the Employee Benefit Trust held no shares (2013: no shares).
Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 88 Sweett Share Incentive Plan
The Share Incentive Plan was established to enable qualifying employees to acquire shares in the Company out of untaxed income 
and provides a tax efficient means of granting shares to employees. Dividends received by the plan in cash are used to purchase 
additional shares on behalf of individuals. Free shares are awarded to qualifying employees based on remuneration.
At 31 March 2014 the plan held 35,895 shares with a value of £17,000 which had not been allocated to individual employees  
(2013: 38,532 shares with a value of £10,000).
25. Equity settled share based payments
The Company has granted certain unapproved share options together with share options under its Approved Company Share  
Option Plan (CSOP) and its Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) scheme, although the Company no longer qualifies to grant 
further options under the EMI. Options granted have a contractual life of 10 years and are exercisable on the third anniversary from 
the date of grant. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash and options lapse  
if an option holder is not a full-time employee of the Group. During the year the Company also granted nil cost options under the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP), details of which are provided in the Directors’ remuneration report. The other options have no 
additional vesting requirements. The unexercised options at the end of the year are stated below.

The estimated fair values of these share options range between 5p per share and 20p per share. This was calculated by applying the 
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model inputs were the share price at grant date, the appropriate exercise price, expected 
volatility of 40% (2013: 40%), expected dividend yield of 1.9% (2013: 2.8%), contractual life of ten years and a risk-free interest rate  
of 2.75% (2013: 5.0%). It was assumed that employees would exercise their options during the first year after the option vesting date. 
The volatility of 40% represents the average of the volatility of a range of listed companies which operate in the same or similar sector 
as this Company. The share price at the date of grant for the CSOP and Unapproved grants during the year was 47.5p per share.
The value of employee services provided of £42,000 (2013: £40,000) has been charged to the income statement.

Sweett Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 92 28. Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, credit risk, interest risk and liquidity risk.  
The Group seeks to manage these risks in a manner which ensures straightforward administration and operational flexibility,  
whilst minimising risk. The financial instruments used by the Group comprise internal cash resources, borrowings, receivables  
and payables arising from normal trading activities, available for sale assets and loans and receivables. Banking facilities are 
negotiated to provide working capital and acquisition finance to meet current and future requirements and to hedge foreign  
currency exposures where appropriate. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to ensure sufficient cash reserves are available to fund ongoing activities and future development plans.  
This risk is managed by the policy of regular invoicing on long-term contracts and ensuring that banking facilities are negotiated  
to provide working capital and acquisition finance to meet current and future requirements.

28. Financial risk management continued
The bank facilities at 31 March 2014 were subject to the following covenants:
• Net worth not to be less than £25m including goodwill and other intangibles;
• Interest cover: EBITDA to Total Interest not to be less than 4:1;
• Gearing: Net Debt to EBITDA not to be more than 2.75:1; and
• Net Operating Cash Flow to Bank Debt Service not to be less than 1.1:1.
The Group had £2,732,000 (2013: £1,337,000) of cash and cash equivalents at the year end immediately available for use.
Foreign currency risk
Most of the Group’s trading activity is denominated in the currency relevant to the trading entity, thereby matching the currency with 
its cost base. Where contracts are denominated in non-local currency, the policy is to mitigate the risk having regard to all the relevant 
circumstances, normally by seeking to hedge the resultant currency exposure by way of a contract with the bank. Exposures arising 
on intra-group balances are similarly hedged. The use of derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting as a means of 
managing foreign currency risk is explained more fully in Note 2; significant accounting policies. Note 4 to the financial statements 
discloses income of £1.0m (2013: cost of £0.3m) relating to the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument under IAS 39 
which has now been satisfied in full.
Trading in foreign currencies is predominantly in Hong Kong Dollars, Chinese Renminbi, Australian Dollars, Singapore Dollars,  
Indian Rupees, UAE Dirhams, Saudi Riyals and Euro. If sterling had strengthened/weakened by 10% against these currencies in  
the year to 31 March 2014 versus actual rates, the Group’s post-tax result would have changed by £0.1m (2013: £0.1m).
Interest rate risk
The Group has an exposure to interest rate increases on its long-term debt. While interest rates remain at their current low levels,  
this risk has not been hedged, but exposures are under constant review.
The Group’s borrowings at 31 March 2014 were in sterling, Hong Kong Dollars and Australian Dollars (2013: sterling and Australian 
Dollars). The effect of an increase/decrease in interest rates, assuming no change in lenders’ margins, in the years to 31 March 2014 
and 2013 of 20% would have been less than £100,000. 
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide  
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the costs of 
capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,  
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Details of the financial covenants with which the  
Group must comply are stated in the Financial Review. The Group was in compliance with all covenants during the year and at  
31 March 2014.
The Group monitors capital predominantly on the basis of the gearing ratio, which is calculated as net debt divided by earnings 
before exceptional items, interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (‘adjusted EBITDA’). Net debt is defined as total current  
and non-current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, to the extent immediately available. At 31 March 2014, net debt was 
£6.3m (2013: £7.1m) and adjusted EBITDA was £6.2m (2013: £5.5m). Accordingly the gearing ratio was 1.1: 1 (2013: 1.3: 1).
Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in terms of unusually large amounts due from individual clients with the 
exception of a retention balance amounting to £1m on a Middle East contract. In the current economic climate, there is an inherent 
risk in exposure to the property market which the Group seeks to mitigate by regular credit checks, regular payment requirements  
in its standard terms and conditions and the implementation of appropriate credit control procedures.
Credit quality of financial assets
The Group operates in various locations in the UK and overseas and has a large number of blue-chip clients for whom it has provided 
services for long periods. The Directors believe that the Group’s client engagement process, through its Management Procedures, 
provides a sufficient means of identifying and controlling material credit risk. It is not practical for the Group to provide an assessment 
of the credit quality of financial assets by reference to external credit ratings in all cases, although this approach is used where 
deemed appropriate.
The level of credit risk is, in the view of the Board, generally low, due to a wide mix of clients in each of the geographical areas  
in which the Group operates, with the exception of the Middle East, Africa and India, where there is a smaller number of clients  
than elsewhere.

The Company has guaranteed the overdraft facility of Sweett (UK) Limited amounting to £4.9m (2013: £4.9m).
There exists a threatened High Court action by a former employee for breach of contract. The Directors are of the view that there is little  
evidence to support the merit of this possible litigation, in respect of which no provision has therefore been made in these financial statements.
With respect to the investigation into allegations contained in the Wall Street Journal in 2013, as explained in the Chairman’s 
Statement, at present, the Directors believe that there is not sufficient evidence to form a view as to the likelihood of any potential 
fines or other financial consequences. Accordingly no provision has been included within these financial statements.
33. Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant post balance sheet events.

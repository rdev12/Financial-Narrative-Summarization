Chairman’s review
Shire leveraged its proven business
model throughout the year, achieving
remarkable results.
Those of us monitoring the global economy throughout
2011 saw many forces at play.
On the one hand, recessionary headwinds, aging
populations, the growing prevalence of chronic disease,
and the resultant cost of funding new medicines and
technologies pressured already strained healthcare
budgets and payors. 
On the other, the healthcare expectations of people
grew, and the extraordinary innovation of scientists 
and researchers brought new treatments to the market,
continuing to change the way disease is both
diagnosed and treated.
Against this backdrop, those who develop and market
medicines had important decisions to make. What
pipeline projects should be advanced? What products
will be reimbursed? How should resources be
distributed within a rapidly changing world? What could
pharmaceutical companies do for patients whose 
wellbeing—and, indeed, sometimes their lives—often
depend on effective treatment?
As Shire’ s Chairman, I was reassured by the many 
ways this specialty biopharmaceutical company both
recognized and addressed the global pressures.

201 1 highlights 
Another strong year for Shire:
� Revenues exceed $4 billion for the ﬁrst time
� Non GAAP diluted earnings per ADS up 26% to $5.34
Shire leveraged its proven business model throughout
the year, achieving remarkable results. It reinforced 
its commitment to specialist physicians and specialty
medicines, expanded key manufacturing capabilities,
gained approvals for proven medications in new
countries, and maintained its focus on responsibility. 
It maintained its track record as a strategic organization
that doesn’t just react to the challenges of the day, 
but also anticipates them.
During the year Shire took risks—moved into new
therapeutic areas, launched innovative development
projects, diversified its team, and required more of 
itself in essential ways. Shire’ s ability to rise above the
noise of the year and to make steady progress on
behalf of patients, physicians, payors, and policymakers
profoundly accelerated its position as a company 
willing to ask hard questions, make significant changes,
and lead by example.
My association with Shire began in 2003. I continue 
to be grateful for the depth of the Leadership T eam 
and the dedication, innovation, and energy that all Shire
people bring to work each day. I am grateful as well 
for the considerable wisdom that Jeffrey Leiden and
Patrick Langlois brought to our Board in their final year
with Shire. I now look forward to working with Susan
Kilsby, an investment banker with global expertise 
who recently joined our Board and the other members
of the Shire Board in the year ahead.
No one is expecting the dynamics playing out across
the global economy to ease soon. Certainly there will
be more questions than answers. But Shire’ s strategy
and delivery of meaningful solutions will continue 
to differentiate the company as the future unfolds.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review
Angus Russell, Chief Executive Officer
Throughout 2011 at Shire, we were thinking about
value. About how to do more in challenging times.
About understanding the complex and interwoven
needs of patients, physicians, payors, and
policymakers. We recognize that patients’ lives improve
only when we understand not just them, but the 
entire web of care. We believe that when we respond
thoughtfully to the concerns of others, we perpetuate
what we’ve come to call the circle of value. We’re not
just interested in advancing our own standing in the
healthcare community. We’re committed to the basic
ideal that when we can help create value for others, 
we become more valuable ourselves.
Our long-term strategy of delivering differentiated
specialty products, focusing on symptomatic diseases,
and making responsible, disciplined investments in
research and development produced yet another
strong year. Our worldwide product sales were up 26%
for the year, revenue grew to $4,263 million, operating
income was $1,109 million, and diluted earnings per
ADS were $4.53. With some 5,000 people operating
in 29 countries, and a balanced portfolio of products,
we continued to leverage a strategy that year-after-year
delivers results, even in turbulent economic times. 
Still, we want to do more. We’re focused on all our
stakeholders—patients, physicians, policymakers,
payors, investors, and employees. In 2011, we spent
time in the company of patients, their families, their
communities. We talked to physicians about the
frustrations they face as they seek to treat symptoms
and make diagnoses. We talked to policymakers
around the world and we talked to payors about how
they measure and reward value. We talked, we
listened, and we responded to the benefit of all of our
stakeholders—systematically advancing our pipeline. 
We grew both organically and through acquisitions. 
We continued to explore the potential application 
of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, currently approved 
as VYVANSE in the US for children and adults with
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), 
in conditions ranging from negative symptoms and
cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and major
depressive disorder to binge eating and excessive
daytime sleepiness. These are all conditions for which
there are not, at this time, adequate treatments.
We also made significant headway in our research on
the potential application of mesalamine, our ulcerative
colitis medicine sold as LIALDA/MEZAVANT in 16
countries around the world, for those diagnosed with

diverticulitis. Two Phase 3 studies will be completed
this year for this painful and life-altering condition,
which often results in repeated flare-ups and is not
adequately managed by current medicines. 
At the same time, within our Human Genetic Therapies
(“HGT”) business, we continued our exploration of the
potential application of intrathecal delivery—the use 
of ports to deliver medicine directly to the central
nervous system—for the treatment of Hunter syndrome,
Sanfilippo, and Metachromatic Leukodystrophy. As this
research program advances, we hope to be able to 
do more for patients diagnosed with these often life-
threatening and heartbreaking diseases. 
We made great headway as well for patients depending
on our HGT enzyme replacement therapy products. 
The accelerated construction and approval of a new
manufacturing facility, in Lexington, Massachusetts,
ensured greater access and a sustainable supply 
of medication for patients diagnosed with Fabry and
Gaucher disease. Meanwhile, we beat our own
deadlines as we worked to expand the manufacturing
capacity of VPRIV , now available in 30 countries across
Europe and serving patients with type 1 Gaucher
disease. We also launched FIRAZYR, an orphan drug
used for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary
angioedema (“HAE”) in adults 18 years of age or 
older in the US. Throughout the year, we continued 
to meet with patients and physicians— in conferences
and at special meetings—all with an eye toward
working together to ensure better diagnoses and 
more effective treatments.
Our ambition to reach beyond our current expertise
also resulted in the acquisition of Advanced
BioHealing, Inc. (“ABH”), which brought us a new
business in Regenerative Medicine—adding to our
portfolio DERMAGRAFT, a bioengineered skin
substitute that assists in restoring damaged tissue 
and supports the body’s natural healing process.
Created from cultured skin cells and applied via a
biodegradable mesh, DERMAGRAFT is approved in
the US for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The
continued growth of ABH within Shire has, we believe,
demonstrated the potential that can be made from 
a focused regenerative medicine business. We are
excited about the opportunities in this area and 
are looking forward to bringing DERMAGRAFT
to more patients and to expanding Shire’s offering 
in regenerative medicine.
We strengthened our global presence throughout 
the year—expanding our international hub in Nyon,

Switzerland, with diverse and talented people; opening
offices and finalizing marketing agreements in countries
ranging from Brazil to Japan and keeping an eager eye
on new opportunities where we can serve our multiple
stakeholders effectively.
Throughout the year, we made continuing investments
in our culture—reinforcing, through numerous channels,
just what it is to be a Shire employee. Through 
various programs we reinforced our commitment 
to differentiating ourselves as the company that 
always strives to be as brave as the people we help.
We worked to ensure that our employees are inspired
by our strategic vision, that they understand the
importance of fostering our brave values, and that 
they are improving their ability to both listen and
respond—all of which contributes to our collaborative,
responsible environment. 
We launched the first of what will become an annual
external recognition program—the BRAVE Awards, 
in which non-professional caregivers from around the
world were recognized and rewarded for their courage
and dedication, and for the difference they make 
in the lives of those they care for. 
Though by many measures 2011 will be remembered
as another year of great success for Shire, we also
think of it as a year in which we developed new growth
opportunities. In 2012, we’ll continue to invest in our
people, pipeline, and values—in those things that
differentiate us as a company. We’ll prepare for the
launch of VENVANSE in Europe, advance pipeline
projects, and look for new acquisitions—defining 
and assessing the value of such programs as early 
as possible. 
But most of all, we will be listening—paying acute
attention to the world around us and continuing 
to address the needs of the stakeholders who make 
up our circle of value. I look forward to sharing our
news with you as the year progresses. 
Finally, I would like to acknowledge those who make
Shire’s story so distinct, so vibrant, and so full of
promise: our people. Many have been helping to drive
our growth for some years now. Others, such as the
400 or so individuals from ABH and the talent newly
hired into positions all around the world, are just
starting to contribute their insights, creativity, and
expertise to Shire. Speaking for the entire Leadership
Team, we are grateful for the relentless efforts and
dedication, the ambitions, and the proven capabilities
of all Shire employees.

Annual Report. 
Overview
Shire’s strategic goal is to be the world’s leading specialty
biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs 
of the specialist physician. Shire focuses its business on ADHD, GI
diseases, HGT and RM, as well as opportunities in other therapeutic
areas to the extent they arise through acquisitions. Shire’s in-licensing
and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets
with strong intellectual property protection or other forms of market
exclusivity and global rights. Shire believes that a carefully selected 
and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned 
and relatively small-scale sales forces will deliver strong results. 
Substantially all of the Company’s revenues, expenditures and net
assets are attributable to the R&D, manufacture, sale and distribution
of pharmaceutical products within three reportable segments: SP , 
HGT and RM. The Company also earns royalties (where Shire has 
out-licensed products to third parties) which are recorded as revenues. 
Revenues are derived primarily from two sources—sales of the
Company’s own products and royalties: 
� 93% (2010: 90%) of total revenues are derived from product sales, 
of which 66% (2010: 71%) are within SP , 31% (2010: 29%) are within
HGT and 3% (2010: nil) are within RM; and
� 6% of total revenues are derived from royalties (2010: 9%).

Royalties received from other products
ANTI VIRAL PRODUCTS
The Company receives royalties on anti viral products based on 
certain of the Company’s patents licensed to GSK. These anti viral
products are for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) and Hepatitis B
virus. The table below lists these products, indicating the principal
indications, the company responsible for marketing the product and 
the relevant territory. In 2009, GSK established a partnership with 
Pfizer called ViiV Healthcare (“ViiV”) that brought together the HIV
portfolios of GSK and Pfizer. ViiV markets the HIV products licensed 
to GSK by the Company.
The terms of the Company’s license agreement with GSK include
royalty rates in the mid-teens on sales of products in territories with
patent coverage and single-digit royalties in territories without patent
coverage. GSK is required to pay royalties through the term of the last
to expire patent in each territory. In territories where no patent exists,
GSK is required to pay royalties for ten years from the first commercial
sale. Royalty terms expire in most territories outside of the US 
during 2012. In the US, royalty terms expire between 2014 and 2018.
After expiration the Company will cease to receive royalties from 
GSK on sales of products in the affected territories.
The Company may terminate the agreement in the event GSK fails to
pay royalties for two successive quarters. Either party may terminate
the agreement for material breach or insolvency. 
ADHD
ADDERALL XR
Shire receives royalties from Impax’s sales of authorized generic
ADDERALL XR.
Hyperphosphatemia
FOSRENOL
The Company licensed the rights to FOSRENOL in Japan to Bayer in
December 2003. Bayer launched FOSRENOL in Japan in March 2009.
Shire receives royalties from Bayer’s sales of FOSRENOL in Japan. 
The Company may also receive milestone payments from Bayer 
based on the achievement of certain sales thresholds.
OTHER ROYALTIES
The Company has licensed the rights to other products to third parties
and receives royalties on third party sales.

Manufacturing and distribution
Active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) sourcing
The Company sources API from third party suppliers for its SP
products and its HGT product FIRAZYR. Shire has manufacturing
capability for agalsidase alfa, idursulfase and velaglucerase alfa 
at its protein manufacturing plant in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
US for its HGT products, REPLAGAL, ELAPRASE and VPRIV 
and manufacturing capability for its RM product DERMAGRAFT 
at its manufacturing facility in La Jolla, California, US.
The Company currently has dual sources of API for VYVANSE,
ADDERALL XR, LIALDA and PENTASA and is developing a second
source for INTUNIV . The Company manages the risks associated 
with reliance on single sources of API by carrying additional inventories
or developing second sources of supply. 
In order to support the rapid growth of VPRIV and REPLAGAL, as well
as to support clinical development, additional manufacturing capacity
has been added in Lexington, Massachusetts, US. The facility has
been approved for the purification of REPLAGAL API, and in November
2011 the Company submitted regulatory filings with both the 
EMA and the FDA for the production of VPRIV API at the new facility.
On February 21, 2012 the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products 
for Human Use approved the production of VPRIV in this facility.
DERMAGRAFT is grown from a cryopreserved master cell bank 
that was procured from a single neonatal foreskin sourced in 1990. 
The cell line has been qualified by the FDA and the Company performs
extensive testing to help ensure the safety of the fibroblast cells in 
the master cell bank.
Finished product manufacturing
The Company sources all of its SP products from third party contract
manufacturers. HGT finished products are manufactured by contract
manufacturers specializing in aseptic fill-finish operations.
The Company currently has dual sources for ELAPRASE, REPLAGAL
and VYVANSE and is developing a second source for the finished
product manufacturing of LIALDA. The Company sources finished
product for ADDERALL XR, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, INTUNIV , PENTASA,
RESOLOR and VPRIV from a single contract manufacturer for each
product. The Company manages the risks associated with reliance 
on single sources of production by carrying additional inventories. 
The Company currently utilizes numerous third party suppliers 
for the raw materials used in the manufacturing of DERMAGRAFT. 
The Company currently obtains certain serum reagents, the mesh
framework and the manifold used in the manufacture of DERMAGRAFT
from single suppliers. The Company manages the risks associated 
with reliance on single sources by carrying additional inventories and,
where appropriate, entering into contractual supply agreements with 
a bulk order provision in the case of early termination by the supplier.
During 2009, following a comprehensive evaluation of its operations
and strategic focus, Shire decided to phase out operations at its SP
manufacturing facility at Owings Mills, Maryland. This phase out was
successfully completed during 2011. 
Distribution
The Company’s US distribution center for SP products, which includes
a large vault to house US Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”)
regulated Schedule II products, is located in Kentucky. From there, 
the Company primarily distributes its products through the three major
wholesalers who have hub or distribution centers that stock Schedule II
drugs in the US, providing access to nearly all pharmacies in the US. 
The distribution and warehousing of HGT products for the US market 
is contracted out to specialist third party contractors. 
The Company ships DERMAGRAFT from its La Jolla, California facility
using third party carriers that are experienced in cold-chain logistics as
well as from a third party carrier and distributor’ s site located in Louisville,
Kentucky, from which the Company ships the majority of DERMAGRAFT
intended for customers located in the Eastern part of the US.
Outside of the US, physical distribution of SP and HGT products is
either contracted out to third parties (where the Company has local
operations) or facilitated via distribution agreements (where the
Company does not have local operations).
Material customers
The Company’s three largest trade customers are Cardinal Health, Inc.,
McKesson Corp, and AmerisourceBergen which are based in the US.
In 2011, these wholesale customers accounted for approximately 23%,
19% and 7% of product sales, respectively.
Intellectual property 
An important part of the Company’s business strategy is to protect its
products and technologies through the use of patents and trademarks,
to the extent available. The Company also relies on trade secrets,
unpatented know-how, technological innovations and contractual
arrangements with third parties to maintain and enhance its
competitive position where it is unable to obtain patent protection 
or where marketed products are not covered by specific patents. 
The Company’s commercial success will depend, in part, upon its
ability to obtain and enforce strong patents, to maintain trade secret
protection, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others
and to comply with the terms of licenses granted to it. The Company’s
policy is to seek patent protection for proprietary technology whenever
possible in the US, Canada, major European countries and Japan.
Where practicable, the Company seeks patent protection in other
countries on a selective basis. In all cases the Company endeavors 
to either obtain patent protection itself or support patent applications
by its licensors. The markets for some of the potential products for 
rare genetic diseases caused by protein deficiencies are small, and,
where possible, the Company has sought orphan drug designation 
for products directed to these markets.
In the regular course of business, the Company’s patents may 
be challenged by third parties. The Company is a party to litigation 
or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights. 
Details of ongoing litigation are provided in Note 20 “Commitments 
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
The degree of patent protection afforded to pharmaceutical inventions
around the world is uncertain. If patents are granted to other parties
that contain claims having a scope that is interpreted by the relevant
authorities to cover any of the Company’s products or technologies,
there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain
licenses to such patents or make other arrangements at reasonable
cost, if at all. 
The existence, scope and duration of patent protection varies among 
the Company’ s products and among the different countries where 
the Company’ s products may be sold. They may also change over the
course of time as patents are granted or expire, or become extended,
modified or revoked. The following non-exhaustive list sets forth details 
of granted US and EP patents pertaining to the Company’ s material
products and certain products from which the Company receives a
royalty, which are owned by, or licensed to, the Company and that are

Review of our business
important to an understanding of the Company’ s business taken as 
a whole. The listed EP patents do not necessarily have a corresponding
national patent registered in each EU member state and the rights
granted pursuant to an EP patent are enforceable only in the EU member
state where the EP patent has been registered as a national patent. 
The expiration dates set forth below do not necessarily reflect changes 
to the patent term afforded by Patent T erm Extensions in the US, nor
supplementary protection certificates (“SPCs”) which are available in
many EU member states. The Company also holds patents in other
jurisdictions, such as Canada and Japan and has patent applications
pending in such jurisdictions, as well as in the US and the EU.
Competition 
Shire believes that competition in its markets is based on, among 
other things, product safety, efficacy, convenience of dosing, reliability,
availability and price. Companies with more resources and larger R&D
expenditures than Shire have a greater ability to fund the research and
clinical trials necessary for regulatory applications, and consequently
may have a better chance of obtaining approval of drugs that would
then compete with Shire’s products. Other products now in use or
being developed by others may be more effective or have fewer side-
effects than the Company’s current or future products. The market
share data provided below is sourced from IMS Health.
ADHD market 
Competition in the US ADHD market has increased with the launch 
of competing products in recent years, including the launch of an
authorized generic version of CONCERTA and RITALIN LA in 2011, 
and the launch of authorized generic ADDERALL XR by Teva and
Impax in 2009. In late 2010, KAPVAY (twice daily, clonidine extended
release) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD and 
was launched in the US by Shionogi & Co., Ltd in 2011. Shire’s share 
of the US ADHD market in December 2011 was 27 .9% (compared 
to 24.5% in December 2010). Overall the US ADHD market grew 
by 10.4% in the year to December 31, 2011 (compared to 12.4% 
in the same period in 2010).
Shire’s key ADHD market is the US, with the Company having three
products for the treatment of ADHD (VYVANSE, ADDERALL XR and
INTUNIV). Shire also has ADHD products in Canada, Brazil, Mexico,
South Korea and selected EU markets and further geographic
expansion plans are underway, including a collaboration with Shionogi
and Co. Ltd. to develop and sell ADHD products in Japan.
Key branded competitors in the US are stimulants CONCERTA and
FOCALIN XR, and non-stimulants STRATTERA and KAPVAY. Generic
immediate release stimulants which constitute 28.6% of the ADHD
market (IMS NPA, December 2011) are also formidable in the US
ADHD market, growing 2.4% in the year from December 31, 2010 
to December 31, 2011.
Key competitors in the European ADHD market are CONCERTA
(Janssen-Cilag), RITALIN LA (Novartis), MEDIKINET (Medice and
distributors) and STRATTERA (Eli Lilly), depending upon the country. 
The Canadian market continues to show strong growth, driven
particularly by the adult market. CONCERTA is the number one 
selling brand in volume and share, although for the moving annual 
total (“MAT”) ending November 2011, generic methylphenidate 
volume and share grew by 15% and 2% respectively. Both the Brazilian 
and Mexican markets are growing strongly and in Brazil, which is
predominantly an IR market, there is increasing penetration of the
extended release brands. 
The Company is also aware of several clinical development programs
underway by other pharmaceutical companies. Eli Lilly and Company
Limited, Targacept, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., NextWave
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Purdue, Alcobra (in collaboration with Teva),
Theravance, Euthymics, Neuroderm, Durect Pharma and Supernus 
are seeking to develop additional treatment options for ADHD.
GI
Ulcerative colitis (“UC”) market 
UC is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The first line treatments 
for patients with mild to moderate UC are formulations containing
mesalamine (also known as 5-ASA). Shire defines the 5-ASA
competitive set as the non-sulfasalazine, oral mesalamine and
mesalamine pro-drug products. 
The US oral 5-ASA market is led by Warner Chilcott’s ASACOL. 
In December 2011, ASACOL had a 37 .4% share of the oral 5-ASA
market, declining from 42.2% in December 2010. 
In December 2011, Shire’s share of the US UC market was 35.8%
(compared to 34.5% in December 2010).
The EU oral 5-ASA market was somewhat more fragmented (all data 
in this paragraph is stated as at November 2011). Ferring’s PENTASA
and Warner Chilcott’s ASACOL were the major competitors across 
the EU. PENTASA (marketed in the EU by Ferring) captured 29.6%
versus ASACOL’s 19.0% share of the EU G5 oral 5-ASA market (UK,
Germany, Spain, Italy, and France). Warner Chilcott’s ASACOL led 
the UK market with a 45.8% share, followed by Ferring’s PENTASA,
which had a 27 .1% share. The German market was led by Dr. Falk’s
SALOFALK, with 53.2% market share, followed by Ferring’s PENTASA
with 18% share. Ferring’s PENTASA and CLAVERSAL were the 
leaders in the oral 5-ASA market in Spain with 35.2% and 29.3%
shares respectively. In 2010, Ferring launched a new competitor,
PENTASA 1g tablet, in the EU and it has been launched in multiple
countries in 2010 and 2011.
Mesalamine and balsalazide (mesalamine pro-drug) products are
generally protected by formulation patents only. In December 2007 , 
the FDA denied Salix’s Citizen Petition for COLAZAL and Salix
subsequently announced the launch of an authorized generic version
by Watson Laboratories. Three other generic versions of COLAZAL
were then introduced. Generic versions of COLAZAL had a 7 .5% 
share of the US oral 5-ASA market in December 2011.
In May 2011, Cosmo/Ferring submitted an MAA in the EU for the 
oral corticosteroid, budesonide MMX, for the induction of remission 
in mild to moderate UC. In December 2011, Cosmo/Santarus
submitted an NDA in the US for budesonide MMX for the same
indication. If approved, this will be a new competitor in 2012 or 2013.
Janssen/MSD’s biologic, REMICADE, is approved for treatment and
maintenance of moderate to severe UC in the US, Canada and the EU.
Abbott submitted a supplemental NDA (“sNDA”) in the US in late 2010
and the EMA in early 2011 for an indication in moderate to severe UC
for HUMIRA.
The Company is aware of other 5-ASA and non-ASA biologic
treatments in development for UC by Tillotts, Salix, Janssen, Cosmo,
Pfizer, and Millenium.

Chronic constipation market
In Europe, over-the-counter and prescription laxatives are the current
first line therapy for chronic constipation. The highest value laxative 
(by revenue) is MOVICOL, a polyethylene glycol (“PEG”) 3350, sold by
Norgine. In Europe, RESOLOR is indicated for symptomatic treatment
of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide
adequate relief and currently there are no other products available 
in the EU with the same indication.
Almirall submitted an MAA in the EU in September 2011 for a guanylate
cyclase type-C agonist, linaclotide (under license from Ironwood), for
the treatment of irritable bowel symptoms with constipation (“IBS-C”),
which if approved would be a new competitor in the EU in 2012 or
2013. Ironwood submitted an NDA in October 2011 for linaclotide 
in the US for the treatment of IBS-C and chronic constipation. 
If approved, we expect Ironwood and Forest (who are co developing
and co-promoting linaclotide in the US) to launch linaclotide in 2012 
or 2013 in the US.
In August 2011, Sucampo submitted an MAA in the UK for the chloride
channel activator, lubiprostone, for chronic idiopathic constipation
which, if approved, would be a new competitor in the UK in 2012.
The Company is aware of other therapies for the treatment of chronic
constipation/IBS-C being developed by Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
ARYx Therapeutics, Theravance, Inc., Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
and Albireo.
Markets for the treatment of rare genetic diseases
Competitors for LSDs include Actelion Ltd., Protalix BioTherapeutics
Inc. (“Protalix”), and Genzyme. For example, REPLAGAL competes 
with Genzyme’s FABRAZYME, and VPRIV competes with Genzyme’s
CEREZYME, Actelion’s ZAVESCA and will compete with the Protalix
compound taliglucerase alfa (worldwide rights outside of Israel licensed
to Pfizer) if approved. Shire is aware of two companies (Korea Green
Cross Corporation and JCR Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd) that are
developing ERTs for the treatment of Hunter syndrome. JCR and 
Isu-Abxis also have early stage biosimilar programs for Gaucher 
and Fabry disease, and Harvest Moon and Dong A Pharmaceuticals
have early stage biosimilar programs for Gaucher disease.
FIRAZYR competes in Europe with CSL Behring’s BERINERT P , 
a human plasma-derived C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) product, 
and with Pharming Group N.V .’s RUCONEST (a recombinant version 
of C1-INH), which has been launched in certain European countries 
by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum. FIRAZYR also competes in Europe with
ViroPharma’s Cinryze, another human plasma-derived C1-esterase
inhibitor (C1-INH) product, which was approved in 2011 for both acute
treatment and prevention of acute HAE attacks. FIRAZYR competes 
in the US with BERINERT and with Dyax Corporation’s KALBITOR, 
a plasma kallikrein inhibitor. ViroPharma’s CINRYZE, is approved in the
US only for prophylaxis of HAE attacks.

regulation” below.
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
The medical device and biotechnology industries are characterized 
by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong
emphasis on proprietary products. Competition in the regenerative
medicine industry is particularly intense, due largely to the fact that
regenerative medicine products currently compete with both traditional
and advanced products, as well as bio-engineered products.
DERMAGRAFT competes with other products based on efficacy, 
price, reimbursement, ease of use and healthcare provider education. 
DERMAGRAFT competes in the US against other living cell products,
such as Organogenesis’s APLIGRAF and also against manufacturers 
of traditional wound care products, including Healthpoint’s REGRANEX,
Healthpoint’s OASIS Matrix products, and Soluble System’s
THERASKIN. In addition, DERMAGRAFT competes against advanced
mechanical technologies, such as negative pressure wound therapy.
Negative pressure wound therapy uses a vacuum to remove excess
fluid and cellular waste that create inflammation and hinder ulcer
healing. Current competitors include KCI’s V .A.C. therapy and Smith 
& Nephew’s RENASYS. 
HIV market 
The HIV competitive landscape is becoming more crowded and
complicated as treatment trends evolve. The Company’s
3TC/lamivudine/EPIVIR products (all licensed to GSK) are part of the
Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (“NRTI”)
market. TRIZIVIR, COMBIVIR and EPZICOM/KIVEXA are part of the
combined NRTI market. TRUVADA (tenofovir/emtricitabine), sold by
Gilead, is the market leader in combination NRTI. In addition to the 
two NRTI HIV markets in which lamivudine is sold, there is competition
from NRTIs, PIs and entry inhibitors.
TRUVADA and ATRIPLA (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir), cross-class
fixed dose combination also sold by Gilead, both represent the most
direct competition to lamivudine.
Several generic drug companies have filed abbreviated new drug
applications (“ANDAs”), seeking approval for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, 
and EPZICOM in the US and several tentative approvals of generic
lamivudine have been issued by the FDA. In December 2011, the 
FDA approved generic versions of EPIVIR that are manufactured 
by Aurobindo and Apotex.
Business strategy overview
The market in which the Company conducts its business is highly
competitive and highly regulated.
There is increasing legislation both in the US and the rest of the 
world which is placing downward pressure on the net pricing of
pharmaceutical products and medical devices. For example the 
US government passed healthcare reform legislation in 2010 which
included an increase in Medicaid rebate rates and extended Medicaid
rebates to those products provided through Medicaid managed care
organizations. The legislation also imposed annual fees to be paid by
both pharmaceutical manufacturers (from 2011) and medical device
companies (from 2013). The impact of these recent changes to US
healthcare legislation, and other healthcare reforms in the rest of 
the world, has not to date had a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
The healthcare industry is also experiencing:
� pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep 
prices low while increasing access to drugs;
� increasing challenges from third party payors for products to 
have demonstrable clinical benefit, with pricing and reimbursement
approval becoming increasingly linked to a product’s clinical
effectiveness and impact on overall costs of patient care; 
� increased R&D costs, because development programs are 
typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators; 
� challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers;
� governments and healthcare systems favoring earlier entry 
of low cost generic drugs; and
� higher marketing costs, due to increased competition for 
market share.
Shire’s strategy to become the world’s leading specialty
biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these
industry-wide competitive pressures. This strategy has resulted in 
a series of initiatives in the following areas:
Markets
Historically, Shire’s portfolio of approved products has been heavily
weighted towards the North American market. The acquisition 
in 2005 of Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (“TKT”) and the consequent
establishment of our HGT business, together with the acquisitions of
Jerini in 2008 (which brought the HAE product FIRAZYR), EQUASYM
in 2009 (which facilitated Shire’s immediate access to the European
ADHD market) and Movetis in 2010 (which brought EU rights to
RESOLOR and further developed our GI pipeline), provided Shire with
platforms to increase its presence in Europe and the RoW, thereby
working towards diversifying the risk associated with reliance on one
geographic market.
In 2011 the SP and HGT businesses derived 15% and 80%,
respectively, of their product sales from outside of the US. Currently 
all RM product sales are generated in the US. Shire’ s long-term mission 
is to increase the value of product sales from (i) outside of the US 
and (ii) outside of US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Canada.
Shire has made significant progress towards geographic diversification
with additional development and commercialization activities in 2011.
In addition, Shire has ongoing commercialization and late stage
development activities which are expected to further supplement the
diversification of revenues in the future, including the following:
� continued launch of VYVANSE in Brazil (marketed as VENVANSE)
and the potential approval and launch of VYVANSE in Mexico;
� filing in 2011 of an MAA for VYVANSE (to be marketed as
VENVANSE) in certain countries in the EU to support registration 
for treatment of ADHD in children;
� INTUNIV Phase 3 clinical program to support submission 
of an MAA in the EU;
� continued roll-out of VPRIV in certain EU and Latin American
countries;
� continued roll-out of FIRAZYR in certain European and Latin
American countries;
� the LIALDA/MEZAVANT diverticulitis Phase 3 program; and
� continued roll-out of RESOLOR in the EU and the Rest of the 
World (“RoW”).
R&D
Over the last five years Shire has focused its R&D efforts on products 
in its core therapeutic areas and concentrated its resources on
obtaining regulatory approval for later stage pipeline products within
these core therapeutic areas. In addition to continued efforts in its 
late stage pipeline for the ADHD, GI, HGT and RM therapeutic areas,
Shire has also progressed work on an earlier stage pipeline.
Evidence of the successful progression of the late stage pipeline can 
be seen in the granting of approval and associated launches of the
Company’s products over the last seven years. Since January 2005,
several products have received regulatory approval including: in the
US, ELAPRASE in 2006, LIALDA and VYVANSE in 2007 , INTUNIV 
in 2009, VPRIV in 2010, and FIRAZYR in 2011; in the EU, FOSRENOL
in 2005, ELAPRASE and MEZAVANT in 2007 , and VPRIV in 2010; 
in Canada, VYVANSE in 2010.
Shire’s strategy is focused on the development of product candidates
that have a lower risk profile. As Shire further expanded its earlier
phase pipeline, R&D costs in 2011 included expenditure on several 
preclinical to Phase 3 studies for products in development as well 
as Phase 3(b) and Phase 4 studies to support recently launched
products in the SP and HGT businesses, together with the development
of new projects in both the SP , HGT and RM businesses.
Patents and market exclusivity
The loss or expiration of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity 
with respect to any of the Company’s major products could have 
a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, financial
condition and results of operations, as generic manufacturers 
may enter the market. Generic manufacturers often do not need 
to complete extensive clinical studies when they seek registration 
of a copy product and accordingly, they are generally able to sell 
the Company’s drugs at a much lower price.
As expected, in 2009 Teva and Impax commenced commercial
shipments of their authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR, 
which led to lower sales of branded ADDERALL XR compared 
to the period prior to the authorized generic launch. The FDA has 
not yet reached a decision on the Citizen Petition for ADDERALL XR 
which was filed in October 2005. An FDA decision which does 
not require generic follow-on products to complete successful 
bio-equivalence or additional clinical testing could lead to increased
generic competition for ADDERALL XR in addition to the authorized
generic versions which already exist. In 2011 authorized generic and
generic versions of the Company’s CARBATROL and REMINYL
products, respectively were launched, which led to lower sales of these
branded products compared to the period before loss of exclusivity.
Shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic
manufacturers with respect to its VYVANSE, INTUNIV , FOSRENOL,
LIALDA and ADDERALL XR patents. For more detail of current 
patent litigation, see Note 20 “Commitments and contingencies” 
to the consolidated financial statements.

REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
TREATMENTS FOR DFU
DERMAGRAFT—for the treatment of DFU
On March 21, 2011, prior to acquisition by the Company, ABH filed 
a Class IV Medical Device Application to Health Canada to seek
approval for DERMAGRAFT for the treatment of DFU.
TREATMENTS FOR VLU
DERMAGRAFT—for the treatment of VLU
On August 24, 2011 Shire announced its preliminary analysis of the
top-line results from ABH’s Phase 3 pivotal trial of DERMAGRAFT 
in subjects with VLU. The international pivotal trial was designed 
as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study 
to assess the product’s safety and efficacy in the promotion of 
healing VLU. The preliminary analysis of the data was that the trial 
did not meet the primary endpoint mutually agreed with the FDA and 
EMA and a subsequent detailed analysis of the data set is ongoing.
Business development
Shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the
acquisition and in-licensing of products and projects which have the
benefit of long-term patent protection and/or data exclusivity, other
forms of market exclusivity and/or barriers to entry.
Through the acquisition of ABH in 2011 Shire obtained DERMAGRAFT,
which is currently marketed in the US for the treatment of DFU.
Through the acquisition of Movetis in 2010, Shire obtained the recently
launched RESOLOR, a promising GI pipeline and world-class R&D
talent. In addition, in early 2012 Shire acquired the rights to market
RESOLOR in the US. In 2010 Shire also acquired an exclusive license 
in markets outside of North America for the ActRIIB class of molecules
being developed by Acceleron. The collaboration with Acceleron will
initially focus on further developing HGT-4510 (also called ACE-031) 
for the treatment of patients with DMD.
In 2009, Shire acquired the worldwide rights (excluding the US,
Canada and Barbados) to EQUASYM and EQUASYM XL from UCB
and entered into a research collaboration with Santaris Pharma A/S
(“Santaris”) for the development of its Locked Nucleic Acid (“LNA”) 
drug platform technology. 
Organization and structure
In the third quarter of 2011, following the acquisition of ABH, 
an organizational realignment was carried out. Following this 
reorganization the Company now has three business units 
and three reporting segments: SP , HGT and RM (which currently
comprises only the ABH business).
During 2010, to support the Company’s mission to increase the
proportion of product sales generated outside of the US, Shire
established an international commercial hub in Switzerland.

Remuneration Committee which also assesses how the Group has
performed against those KPIs. The 2011 Corporate Scorecard included
the following financial and non financial KPIs:
Financial KPIs
Achieve revenue growth from net product sales
Revenue growth from net product sales ($’BN)
Revenues from net product sales in 2011 were up 26% to $3.9 billion
driven by strong growth across the portfolio, including VYVANSE
(up 27% to $805 million), ADDERALL XR (up 48% to $533 million),
REPLAGAL (up 35% to $475 million), ELAPRASE (up 15% to
$465 million), LIALDA/MEZAVANT (up 27% to $372 million), 
INTUNIV (up 34% to $223 million), and VPRIV (up 79% to $256 million).
Product sales in 2011 also included $105 million of DERMAGRAFT
sales made subsequent to the acquisition of ABH.
2011 $3.9
2010 $3.1
2009 $2.7
Achieve EBITDA
(1)
 growth
EBITDA ($’M)
(1) EBITDA (being Non GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
 amortization) is a Non GAAP measure.  These Non GAAP measures are
 reconciled to their US GAAP equivalents on pages 126 to 128.
Non GAAP EBITDA increased by 27% to $1,478 million in 2011
as higher revenues (up 23% to $4,263 million) grew at a faster rate 
than R&D and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenditure,
which allowed the Group to absorb the effects of increased investment
in our targeted R&D programs and increases in SG&A activities to
support our product launches and continued growth.
2011 $1,478
2010 $1,165
2009 $982
(2) Net product sales from geographic markets outside of the US.
Product sales from ex-US markets were up $276 million, or 25%,
in 2011. Product sales from ex-US markets as a proportion of
the Group’s total product sales in 2011 remained constant at 35%.
2011 35%
2010 35%
2009 30%
(3) ROIC – Non GAAP Return on Invested Capital (see page 125 for a deﬁnition).
Non GAAP ROIC grew by 210 basis points in 2011 over 2010 
primarily due to higher product sales (up 26%) and continued 
operating leverage leading to an increase in margins, together 
with improvements in net asset efﬁciency.

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
Non financial KPIs
Non financial KPIs for 2011 included:
Achieve diversity of experiences and capabilities that reflect 
the expanding geographic diversity of Shire’s business
Shire aims to ensure that its talent base has the experience and
capabilities to support its growing business, including a reflection 
of geographic diversity.
Shire has identified a group of global leadership capabilities against
which potential company leaders will be assessed. Shire aims to have
possible successors in place for all of its leaders, and to ensure that
those individuals have formal development plans to round out their
experience and skills. This includes developing geographic diversity
through international assignments and on-the-job development. Diversity
metric reports are generated and reviewed by the organization regularly.
Succession plans for the Executive Leadership Team are also regularly
reviewed by the Board, and this process is replicated by Executive
management throughout the organization at all management levels. 
Continue to foster a culture of compliance
Shire aims to ensure that maintaining high ethical standards and
compliance are central to everything we do. Shire’ s compliance function
conducts regular training for employees, distributors, agents and other
partners doing business with Shire. In 2011 the compliance program
included extensive training on Shire’s anti-bribery policies as well 
as policies and procedures concerning interactions with physicians.
Create an environment in which employees are highly engaged
and committed to achieving Shire’s goals
Shire believes that high levels of employee engagement are key 
to driving achievement of the company’s goals. 
Over the past few years Shire has conducted a regular employee
engagement survey which this year demonstrated impressive gains 
on employee engagement. The outputs are used to identify ways to
improve employee engagement throughout the company. Survey results
showed that Shire’ s workforce is highly supportive of our culture and
mission to “enable people with life-altering conditions to lead better lives” . 
Demonstrate value to all of Shire’s customer segments
Shire seeks to demonstrate that its products provide value to all 
of its stakeholders, including patients, physicians and payors. 
Shire recognizes that for its products to be successful they need 
to demonstrate clinical and economic value to all stakeholders. 
Measures of success in 2011 against these markers included:
� Increases in market share in its ADHD, GI, HGT and RM therapeutic
areas.
� Completion of patient, physician and payor surveys for certain
products that will help us continue to meet stakeholder needs.
� Demonstration of clinical value through the approval of: 
—FIRAZYR for self-administration in the EU and US
—INTUNIV in the US as adjunctive therapy to stimulants for the
treatment of ADHD for children and adolescents
—LIALDA in the US and Canada for maintenance of remission 
of ulcerative colitis.
� Development of dossiers for certain products that demonstrate
economic value to support their pricing and reimbursement.
Results of operations for the years to December 31, 2011 and 2010
Financial highlights for the year to December 31, 2011 are as follows:
� Product sales in 2011 were up 26% to $3,950 million 
(2010: $3,128 million). On a constant exchange rate (“CER”)
(1)
basis, which is a Non GAAP measure, product sales were up 24%.
Product sales growth was generated from across the portfolio,
particularly VYVANSE (up 27% to $805 million), ADDERALL XR 
(up 48% to $533 million), REPLAGAL (up 35% to $475 million),
ELAPRASE (up 15% to $465 million), LIALDA/MEZAVANT (up 27%
to $372 million) and VPRIV (up 79% to $256 million). Product sales 
in 2011 also benefited from $105 million of DERMAGRAFT sales
made subsequent to the acquisition of ABH.
� Total revenues in 2011 exceeded $4 billion for the first time,
increasing by 23% (Non GAAP CER: up 21%) to $4,263 million
(2010: $3,471 million). The strong product sales growth more than
offset decreased royalties and other revenues, down 9% due to
lower 3TC and ZEFFIX royalties. 
� Operating income was up 40% to $1,109 million (2010: $794 million),
as total revenues grew at a faster rate than R&D and SG&A
expenditure. Operating income in 2010 included impairment charges
recorded on the divestment of DAYTRANA and an up front payment
of $45 million to Acceleron. 
� Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share were up 43% to 150.9¢ 
(2010: 105.3¢) due to higher operating income and a lower effective
tax rate in 2011 of 21% (2010: 24%). 
(1) The Company’s management analyzes product sales and revenue growth 
for certain products sold in markets outside of the US on a constant exchange 
rate (“CER”) basis, so that product sales and revenue growth can be considered
excluding movements in foreign exchange rates. Product sales and revenue 
growth on a CER basis is a Non GAAP financial measure (“Non GAAP CER”),
computed by comparing 2011 product sales and revenues restated using 2010
average foreign exchange rates to 2010 actual product sales and revenues. This
Non GAAP financial measure is used by Shire’s management, and is considered 
to provide useful information to investors about the Company’s results of
operations, because it facilitates an evaluation of the Company’s year-on-year
performance on a comparable basis. Average exchange rates for the year to
December 31, 2011 were $1.60:£1.00 and $1.39:€1.00 (2010: $1.55:£1.00 and
$1.33:€1.00).

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS
VYVANSE—ADHD
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly in 2011 as a result of higher
prescription demand, due to an increase in VYVANSE’s market share
and growth in US ADHD market (10%), and the effect of a price
increase taken in 2011. These factors more than offset the effect of 
destocking and higher sales deductions in 2011 compared to 2010.
Litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE are ongoing. Further
information about this litigation can be found in Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
ADDERALL XR—ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales grew by 48%, or $172 million, principally
as a result of lower sales deductions as a percentage of branded gross
product sales, increases in US prescription demand (in line with growth
in the US ADHD market) and a price increase taken during 2011. 
Sales deductions in 2011 represented 57% of branded gross product
sales (2010: 65% of branded gross product sales). The decrease 
in sales deductions was primarily due to the lowering of our estimate 
of inventory in the US retail pipeline and the related sales deduction
reserve in the third quarter of 2011 (representing 2% of gross 
product sales in 2011) and the mix of customer sales affecting the
rebate calculation. The eight percentage point decrease in sales
deductions (as a percentage of branded gross product sales)
contributed $85 million to ADDERALL XR’s net product sales in 2011.
ADDERALL XR sales deductions in 2012 are expected to be in the
range of 60–65%.
There are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments 
of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax should be
included in the Medicaid rebate calculation. Since authorized generic
launch in 2009 the Company has recorded its accrual for Medicaid
rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable, consistent
with the Company’s interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation.
Shire believes that its interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation 
is reasonable and correct. Additionally, from October 1, 2010 forward,
provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act provide further clarity, 
in a manner consistent with the Company’s interpretation, as to how
shipments of authorized generics from that date should be included 
in the Medicaid rebate calculation. 
The CMS could disagree with Shire’s interpretation of the Medicaid
rebate legislation for shipments of authorized generic products prior 
to October 1, 2010. CMS could require Shire to apply an alternative
interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and request that Shire
pays up to $212 million above the recorded liability. However, Shire
believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its interpretation of the
Medicaid rebate legislation, and that there would be a strong basis 
to limit any additional payment to a level approximating the full, 
un-rebated cost to the States of ADDERALL XR (equivalent to
approximately $134 million above the recorded liability), and to initiate
litigation to recover any amount paid in excess of the recorded liability.
The result of any such litigation cannot be predicted. 
Litigation proceedings regarding ADDERALL XR are ongoing. Further
information about this litigation can be found in Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
INTUNIV—ADHD
INTUNIV product sales were up 34% compared to 2010, primarily
driven by significant growth in US prescription demand together with 
a price increase taken during 2011. These positive factors were offset
by lower stocking and higher sales deductions in 2011 compared 
to 2010, and the effect of the inclusion of launch stocking shipments
within reported 2010 product sales.
Litigation proceedings relating to the Company’s INTUNIV patents 
are in progress. For further information see Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT—Ulcerative colitis
The growth in product sales for LIALDA/MEZAVANT in 2011 was
primarily driven by higher US prescription demand following increases in
US market share, a price increase taken since the fourth quarter of 2010
and the effect of stocking in 2011 compared to destocking in 2010. 
Litigation proceedings regarding LIALDA/MEZAVANT are ongoing.
Further information about this litigation can be found in Note 20
“Commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial
statements.
PENTASA—Ulcerative colitis
Product sales of PENTASA continued to grow despite lower US
prescription demand, due to the impact of a price increase taken
during 2011.
FOSRENOL—Hyperphosphatemia
Product sales of FOSRENOL outside the US decreased marginally
primarily because of mandatory price reductions that were imposed in
several key markets. Product sales of FOSRENOL in the US decreased
due to lower US prescription demand and higher sales deductions
compared to 2010, which more than offset a 2011 price increase.
Litigation proceedings regarding Shire’s FOSRENOL patents are
ongoing. Further information about this litigation can be found in 
Note 20 “Commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated
financial statements.
HUMAN GENETIC THERAPIES
REPLAGAL—Fabry disease
The 35% growth (30% on a Non GAAP CER basis) in REPLAGAL
product sales was driven by the treatment of new patients, being 
both naïve patients and switches from patients being treated with
FABRAZYME. Reported REPLAGAL sales also benefited from
favorable foreign exchange, due to the weaker US dollar over the
course of 2011 compared to 2010.
Litigation proceedings regarding REPLAGAL are ongoing. Further
information about this litigation can be found in Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
ELAPRASE—Hunter syndrome
Product sales for ELAPRASE increased as a result of increased patients
on therapy across all regions in which ELAPRASE is sold. Reported
ELAPRASE sales also benefited from favorable foreign exchange.

Financial review
VPRIV—Gaucher disease
VPRIV product sales growth was driven by the treatment of new
patients, being both naïve patients and patients switching from
CEREZYME. Reported sales also benefited from favorable foreign
exchange.
FIRAZYR—HAE
The significant growth rate in global product sales in 2011 follows 
the successful launch of FIRAZYR in the US in August 2011 
and the approval for self-administration in the EU in March 2011.
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
DERMAGRAFT—DFU
DERMAGRAFT continues to see strong revenue growth in the US, up
33% for the full year 2011 compared to the full year 2010
(1)
. The growth
resulted from a combination of an expanding US diabetic population,
continued adoption of DERMAGRAFT as a treatment for DFU, and 
the continued investment in marketing programs and additional sales
representatives to market the product.
(1) Shire acquired DERMAGRAFT through its acquisition of ABH in June 2011.
Royalty income decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as lower 
royalties from 3TC and ZEFFIX more than offset higher royalty income
from ADDERALL XR and FOSRENOL. 
Royalty income from 3TC and ZEFFIX continues to be adversely
impacted by increased competition from other products. Additionally,
with effect from the second quarter of 2011, Shire has not recognized
royalty income for 3TC and ZEFFIX in certain territories due to a
disagreement between GSK and Shire about how the relevant royalty
rates should be applied given the expiry dates of certain patents. 
GSK and Shire are holding discussions in order to seek to resolve the
disagreement. In 2012 royalty terms for 3TC and ZEFFIX will begin 
to expire in most territories outside of the US, and in the US royalty
terms for 3TC and ZEFFIX expire between 2014 and 2018. 
After expiry the Company will cease to receive royalties from GSK 
on sales of 3TC and ZEFFIX in those territories.
Cost of product sales
Cost of product sales increased to $588.1 million for the year to
December 31, 2011 (15% of product sales), up from $463.4 million 
in the corresponding period in 2010 (15% of product sales). 
Cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales stayed
constant as the effect of slightly higher margins from existing products
and lower costs incurred on the transfer of manufacturing from 
Owings Mills in 2011 were offset by the inclusion of DERMAGRAFT
(including the unwind of the fair value adjustment for inventory acquired
with ABH) and a write down of expired ELAPRASE unpurified bulk
material which was not prioritized for purification as capacity was
directed towards meeting demand for REPLAGAL and VPRIV in 2011.
For the year to December 31, 2011 cost of product sales included
depreciation of $39.8 million (2010: $38.1 million).
R&D 
R&D expenditure for the year to December 31, 2011 increased 
to $770.7 million (20% of product sales), compared to $661.5 million 
in the corresponding period in 2010 (21% of product sales). 
R&D in 2010 included an up front payment of $45.0 million
(representing 1% of product sales) on entering the collaboration with
Acceleron for development of the ActRIIB class of molecules. Excluding
this up front payment, R&D increased by $154.2 million in 2011,
reflecting the Company’s continued investment in a number of targeted
R&D programs, including new uses for VYVANSE, Sanfilippo and other
development programs. In addition, R&D in 2011 also included a full
year of Movetis’s development programs and ABH’s expenditure in the
second half of 2011, an impairment charge of $16.0 million (2010: $nil)
in respect of certain IPR&D assets and the adverse impact of foreign
exchange in 2011 compared to 2010.
For the year to December 31, 2011 R&D included depreciation 
of $25.2 million (2010: $19.0 million) and an impairment charge 
of $16.0 million (2010: $nil).
SG&A 
SG&A expenses increased to $1,751.4 million (44% of product 
sales) for the year to December 31, 2011 from $1,526.3 million
(49% of product sales) in the corresponding period in 2010. 
In 2010 SG&A included an impairment charge of $42.7 million to 
write down the DAYTRANA intangible asset to its fair value less costs
to sell, prior to the divestment of DAYTRANA to Noven. Excluding 
this impairment charge SG&A increased by $267 .8 million as the
Company supported the growth of its existing and recently launched
products along with developing its international infrastructure. 
SG&A in 2011 also included a full year of Movetis’s operating costs,
ABH’s expenditure in the second half of 2011 and the adverse impact
of foreign exchange in 2011 compared to 2010.
For the year to December 31, 2011 SG&A also included depreciation 
of $63.1 million (2010: $62.1 million) and intangible asset amortization

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
Reorganization costs
For the year to December 31, 2011 Shire recorded reorganization 
costs of $24.3 million (2010: $34.3 million) relating to the transfer 
of manufacturing from its Owings Mills facility to a third party and 
the establishment of an international commercial hub in Switzerland.
Integration and acquisition costs
For the year to December 31, 2011 Shire recorded integration and
acquisition costs of $13.7 million (2010: $8.0 million), which related 
to the acquisition and integration of ABH ($13.6 million) and the
integration of Movetis ($8.3 million), offset by an adjustment 
to contingent consideration payable for EQUASYM ($8.2 million). 
In 2010 integration and acquisition costs primarily related to the
acquisition of Movetis.
Interest expense
For the year to December 31, 2011 Shire incurred interest expense 
of $39.1 million (2010: $35.1 million). Interest expense principally relates
to the coupon and amortization of issue costs on Shire’s $1,100 million
2.75% convertible bonds due 2014.
Other income/(expense), net
For the year to December 31 , 2011 the Company recognized other
income, net of $18.1 million (2010: $7 .9 million). Other income in the year
to December 31 , 2011 included a gain of $23.5 million arising on the
disposal of substantially all of Shire’ s holding in Vertex (Shire received
these shares as partial consideration for its investment in ViroChem
following ViroChem being acquired by Vertex). Other income in the year
to December 31 , 2010 included a gain of $11 .1 million arising on the
disposal of Shire’ s investment in ViroChem.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax in 2011 was 21% (2010: 24%). The effective
tax rate in 2011 is lower than 2010 due to favorable changes in profit
mix in 2011, including the full year effect in 2011 of the Company’s
establishment of an international commercial hub in Switzerland in the
fourth quarter of 2010, together with the effect of certain expenses 
in 2010 (including the up front payment to Acceleron) being incurred 
in territories with a tax rate lower than Shire’s effective tax rate. 
Results of operations for the years to December 31, 2010 and 2009
Financial highlights for the year to December 31, 2010 are as follows:
� Product sales were up 16% to $3,128 million (2009: $2,694 million).
Product sales excluding ADDERALL XR grew strongly through 2010
(up 34% to $2,767 million), more than offsetting the decline in
ADDERALL XR product sales (down 42% to $361 million) following
loss of market exclusivity in April 2009. On a Non GAAP CER
(1)
basis, product sales excluding ADDERALL XR were up 35%. 
� The 34% growth in product sales excluding ADDERALL XR to
$2,767 million was driven by VYVANSE (up 26% to $634 million),
REPLAGAL (up 81% to $351 million), LIALDA/MEZAVANT 
(up 24% to $293 million), and recently launched INTUNIV 
($166 million) and VPRIV ($143 million).
� Total revenues were up 15% (Non GAAP CER: up 16%) 
to $3,471 million (2009: $3,008 million) due to the growth 
in product sales and higher royalties (up 12% to $328 million).
� Operating income increased by $174 million, or 28%, to $794 million
(2009: $620 million), due to higher revenues and continued operating
leverage, which allowed the Company to absorb the effects of
increased investment in its targeted R&D programs and an increase
in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) activities to support 
its recent and future growth. 
� Net income attributable to Shire increased by $96 million to 
$588 million (2009: $492 million) and diluted earnings per Ordinary
Share increased by 17% to 105.3¢ (2009: 89.7¢).
(1) The Company’s management analyzes product sales and revenue growth for
certain products sold in markets outside of the US on a CER basis, so that product
sales and revenue growth can be considered excluding movements in foreign
exchange rates. Product sales and revenue growth on a CER basis is a Non GAAP
financial measure, computed by comparing 2010 product sales and revenues
restated using 2009 average foreign exchange rates to 2009 actual product sales
and revenues. This Non GAAP financial measure is used by Shire’s management,
and is considered to provide useful information to investors about the Company’s
results of operations, because it facilitates an evaluation of the Company’s year-on-
year performance on a comparable basis. Average key exchange rates for year 
to December 31, 2010 were $1.55:£1.00 and $1.33:€1.00 (2009: $1.57:£1.00 and
$1.39:€1.00).

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS
VYVANSE—ADHD
The increase in VYVANSE product sales was driven by both an
increase in VYVANSE’s market share and US ADHD market growth
(12%) as well as the effect of price increases taken since the fourth
quarter of 2009. These factors offset the effect of higher sales
deductions in 2010 due to the impact of increased Medicaid rebates
principally as a result of US healthcare reforms.
Litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE are ongoing. Further
information about this litigation can be found in Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
ADDERALL XR—ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales decreased due to lower US prescription
demand (following the launch of authorized generic versions in 2009,
which more than offset US ADHD market growth) and higher sales
deductions in 2010 (65% of branded gross sales in 2010 compared 
to 47% in 2009). These factors more than offset the effects of stocking
in 2010 compared to destocking in 2009.
Litigation proceedings regarding ADDERALL XR are ongoing. Further
information about this litigation can be found in Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
INTUNIV—ADHD
US prescription demand for INTUNIV continued to increase throughout
2010. INTUNIV was launched in the US in November 2009, and
product sales in 2010 included both shipments made in 2010 and 
the recognition into revenue of launch stocks which had been deferred
in 2009 in accordance with Shire’s accounting policies.
Litigation proceedings relating to the Company’s INTUNIV patents 
are in progress. For further information see Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT—Ulcerative colitis
Product sales for LIALDA/MEZAVANT continued to grow in 2010,
driven by an increase in US market share and price increases taken
since the fourth quarter of 2009. These factors were partially offset 
by higher sales deductions compared to the same period in 2009 
due in part to US healthcare reforms.

Royalties
Royalty revenue increased by 12% to $328.1 million for the year to December 31, 2010 (2009: $292.5 million). The following table provides an
analysis of Shire’s royalty income:

Litigation proceedings regarding LIALDA/MEZAVANT are ongoing.
Further information about this litigation can be found in Note 20
“Commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial
statements.
PENTASA—Ulcerative colitis
Product sales of PENTASA continued to grow despite lower US
prescription demand due to the impact of price increases taken 
during 2010.
FOSRENOL—Hyperphosphatemia
Product sales of FOSRENOL outside the US increased by 6% primarily
because of higher prescription demand partially offset by mandatory 
price reductions that were imposed in 2010. Product sales of FOSRENOL
in the US decreased by 7% due to lower US prescription demand and
higher sales deductions compared to 2009, which more than offset 
the effect of price increases taken since the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Litigation proceedings regarding Shire’s FOSRENOL patents are
ongoing. Further information about this litigation can be found 
in Note 20 “Commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated
financial statements.
HUMAN GENETIC THERAPIES
ELAPRASE—Hunter syndrome
The growth in sales of ELAPRASE was driven by new patients
commencing therapy across North America, Latin America and Europe,
Middle East and Asia. On a Non GAAP CER basis sales grew by 16%.
REPLAGAL—Fabry disease
The 81% growth (87% on a Non GAAP CER basis) in REPLAGAL
product sales was driven by a significant increase in demand in 2010 
in all countries where REPLAGAL is sold as new patients commenced
therapy and existing patients switched to REPLAGAL from a competitor
product. This was attributable in part to supply shortages of that
competitor product.
Litigation proceedings regarding REPLAGAL are ongoing. Further
information about this litigation can be found in Note 20 “Commitments
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements.
VPRIV—Gaucher disease
Following the grant of a marketing authorization from the European
Commission on August 26, 2010, VPRIV is now being reimbursed on an
approved basis in several countries in the EU as well as in the US. VPRIV
was approved by the FDA on February 26, 2010. Reimbursement 
on a pre-approval basis continues in other EU countries. 
FIRAZYR—HAE
Product sales grew in line with increased volumes across markets 
in Europe. FIRAZYR is the first new product for HAE in Europe in 
30 years and has orphan exclusivity for acute attacks of HAE in adults
in the EU until 2018.
The increase in royalty revenue in 2010 was primarily due to higher
royalties received on sales of authorized generic versions of
ADDERALL XR (ADDERALL XR royalties have been received from
Impax since October 2009, and were received from Teva, at a lower
rate, between April and September 2009). Royalties received for 
3TC and ZEFFIX from GSK were lower in 2010 compared to 2009 
as 3TC based treatments continue to be adversely impacted by
increased competition from other products.
Cost of product sales 
Cost of product sales increased to $463.4 million for the year to
December 31, 2010 (15% of product sales), up from $388.0 million 
in the corresponding period in 2009 (14% of product sales). Cost 
of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased by one
percentage point compared to 2009 as lower gross margins on
ADDERALL XR in 2010 and higher costs incurred in 2010 on the
transfer of manufacturing from the Company’s Owings Mills facility 
to a third party offset the positive effect on gross margins of recently
launched, higher margin products and higher gross margins from
existing products excluding ADDERALL XR.
For the year to December 31, 2010 cost of product sales included
depreciation of $38.1 million (2009: $21.8 million). Depreciation 
charged in 2010 is higher than 2009 due to accelerated depreciation 
of $25.7 million (2009: $12.0 million) following a change in the estimate
of the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment at Shire’ s Owings
Mills facility as a result of the anticipated closure of the facility in 2011 .
R&D 
R&D expenditure for the year to December 31, 2010 increased to
$661.5 million (21% of product sales), compared to $639.9 million 
in the corresponding period in 2009 (24% of product sales). R&D
expenditure in the year to December 31, 2010 included the up front
payment of $45.0 million (1% of product sales) on entering the
collaboration with Acceleron for development of the ActRIIB class 
of molecules. R&D in the year to December 31, 2009 included 
$36.9 million (1% of product sales) related to the payment to amend 
an INTUNIV in-license agreement, $62.9 million (2% of product sales)
following the agreement with Duramed to terminate development 
of the Women’s Health products, and the up front payment to 
Santaris of $6.5 million for technology access and R&D funding.
Excluding these termination, license and up front payments, R&D
increased by $82.9 million in the year to December 31, 2010 compared
to the same period in 2009 as the Company continued to increase
investment in a number of targeted R&D programs, including
VYVANSE international and investigative uses of VYVANSE for new
indications, Guanfacine Carrier Wave, R&D programs acquired with

Financial review
Movetis and other early stage development programs. For the year 
to December 31, 2010 R&D included depreciation of $19.0 million
(2009: $15.5 million).
SG&A 
SG&A expenses increased to $1,526.3 million (49% of product sales)
for the year to December 31, 2010 from $1,342.6 million (50% of
product sales) in the corresponding period in 2009. SG&A increased 
in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to costs incurred 
to support the launches of INTUNIV and VPRIV , growth in new markets
and the inclusion of Movetis operating costs from the fourth quarter 
of 2010 following completion of the acquisition. For the year to
December 31, 2010 SG&A also included depreciation of $62.1 million
(2009: $67 .7 million), intangible asset amortization of $133.5 million
(2009: $136.9 million) and intangible asset impairment charges 
of $42.7 million (2009: $nil) to write down the DAYTRANA intangible
asset to its fair value less costs to sell prior to divestment to Noven.
Gain on sale of product rights
For the year to December 31, 2010 the Company recorded gains 
on sale of product rights of $16.5 million (2009: $6.3 million) of which
$10.4 million (2009: $nil) resulted from the remeasurement of
contingent consideration receivable on divestment of DAYTRANA 
to its fair value, and $6.1 million (2009: $6.3 million) from the disposal 
of other non-core products. 
Reorganization costs
For the year to December 31, 2010 Shire recorded reorganization 
costs of $34.3 million (2009: $12.7 million) of which $13.0 million 
(2009: $12.7 million) related to the transfer of manufacturing from its
Owings Mills facility to a third party and $21.3 million (2009: $nil) related
to the establishment of an international commercial hub in Switzerland. 
Integration and acquisition costs
For the year to December 31, 2010 the Company recorded integration
and acquisition costs of $8.0 million (2009: $10.6 million), which 
in 2010 principally related to the acquisition of Movetis, and in 2009 
to the integration of Jerini. 
Interest expense 
For the year to December 31, 2010 the Company incurred interest
expense of $35.1 million (2009: $39.8 million). Interest expense
principally relates to the coupon and amortization of issue costs 
on Shire’s $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014. 
Other income/(expense), net
For the year to December 31, 2010 the Company recognized Other
income, net of $7 .9 million (2009: $60.7 million), primarily due to the
recognition of a gain of $11.1 million (2009: $55.2 million) relating 
to the disposal of its investment in ViroChem in March 2009. At the 
time of disposal an element of the consideration was held in escrow 
for twelve months pending any warranty claims. The consideration 
was released from escrow in March 2010, resulting in the remaining
gain being recognized in the year to December 31, 2010.
Other income/(expense), net also includes a loss of $3.6 million in the
year to December 31, 2010 relating to the extinguishment of building
finance obligations at Lexington Technology Park, and in 2009 
includes a gain of $5.7 million following the substantial modification 
of a property lease.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax in 2010 was 24% (2009: 22%). 
The effective rate of tax in 2010 benefited from increased profits in
lower tax territories, including Switzerland following the implementation
of an international commercial hub there in 2010, and an increase 
in US tax incentives (notably the domestic production deduction),
partially offset by up front payments to Acceleron which were
deductible at tax rates lower than the Company’s effective tax rate.
The effective rate of tax in 2009 benefited from the decrease 
in valuation allowances relating to state tax credits and loss
carryforwards following Massachusetts state tax changes, and 
the favorable rate effect of the termination of the Women’s Health
development agreement with Duramed and the amendment 
to the INTUNIV in-license, which were both tax effected at rates
higher than the Company’s effective rate.
Financial condition at December 31, 2011 and 2010
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $69.4 million to $620.0 million
(December 31, 2010: $550.6 million). Cash generated by operating
activities of $1,073.6 million and proceeds of $106.0 million on disposal
of non-current investments and PP&E were offset by the cost of
acquiring ABH, other capital expenditure, the purchase of shares 
by the ESOT and dividend payments. 
Accounts receivable, net
Accounts receivable, net increased by $152.5 million to $845.0 million
(December 31, 2010: $692.5 million) due to increased total revenues 
in the year to December 31, 2011. Days sales outstanding remained
constant at 50 days (December 31, 2010: 50 days).
Investments
Investments decreased by $71.7 million to $29.9 million (December 31,
2010: $101.6 million) due to the disposal of substantially all of the
Company’s holding in Vertex for a cash consideration of $94.7 million. 
Goodwill
Goodwill has increased by $190.1 million to $592.6 million (December
31, 2010: $402.5 million), principally due to goodwill arising on the
acquisition of ABH.
Other Intangible assets, net
Other intangible assets have increased by $514.1 million to 
$2,493.0 million (December 31, 2010: $1,978.9 million), principally 
due to intangible assets for DERMAGRAFT product technology 
of $710.0 million acquired with ABH, offset by intangible asset
amortization and impairment charges of $182.7 million.
Convertible bonds—current
Convertible bonds—current have increased by $1,100 million due to
the reclassification of the Company’s $1,100 million 2.75% convertible
bonds due 2014 and convertible into fully paid Ordinary Shares of 
Shire plc (the “Bonds”) from non-current to current liabilities in 2011 , as
the exercise of the Put Option (see “Liquidity and capital resources”,
below) could require the Company to redeem the Bonds in 2012. 
The Company does not consider it likely that the Put Option will be
exercised in 2012. However, if the Bonds were redeemed in full in 2012,
the Company’s operating cash flow together with available cash, cash
equivalents and the new RCF (see “Liquidity and capital resources”,
below) would be sufficient to fund repayment of the Bonds. In lieu of
settling any such redemption wholly in cash, the terms of the Bonds
also permit the Company to deliver the underlying Ordinary Shares
and, if necessary, a cash top-up amount.

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
Liquidity and capital resources 
General 
The Company’ s funding requirements depend on a number of factors,
including the timing and extent of its development programs; corporate,
business and product acquisitions; the level of resources required for 
the expansion of certain manufacturing and marketing capabilities as the
product base expands; increases in accounts receivable and inventory
which may arise with any increase in product sales; competitive and
technological developments; the timing and cost of obtaining required
regulatory approvals for new products; the timing and quantum of
milestone payments on collaborative projects; the timing and quantum 
of tax and dividend payments; the timing and quantum of purchases by
the ESOT of Shire Ordinary Shares or ADSs in the market to satisfy
option exercises; the timing and quantum of any amount that could be
paid by the Company if CMS were to employ an alternative interpretation
of the Medicaid rebate legislation in respect of ADDERALL XR Medicaid
rebates for periods prior to October 1 , 2010; and the amount of cash
generated from sales of Shire’ s products and royalty receipts.
An important part of Shire’ s business strategy is to protect its products
and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies
and trademarks, to the extent available. The Company intends to
defend its intellectual property and as a result may need cash for
funding the cost of litigation.
The Company finances its activities through cash generated from
operating activities, credit facilities, private and public offerings of equity
and debt securities, and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals. 
Shire’ s balance sheet includes $620.0 million of cash and cash
equivalents at December 31 , 2011 . Substantially all of Shire’ s debt
relates to its $1 ,100 million 2.75% Convertible Bond which matures in
2014, although these Bonds include a Put Option (as defined below)
which could require repayment of the Bonds in May 2012. In addition,
Shire has committed multicurrency revolving and swing line facilities 
of $1 ,200 million, which mature in 2015, and are currently undrawn. 
Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 
On May 9, 2007 Shire issued the Bonds and the net proceeds 
of the issuance, after deducting the commissions and other direct 
costs of issue, totaled $1 ,081 .7 million. In connection with the Scheme
the Trust Deed was amended and restated in 2008 in order to 
provide that, following the substitution of Shire plc in place of Shire
Biopharmaceuticals Holdings (“Old Shire”) as the principal obligor 
and issuer of the Bonds, the Bonds would be convertible into 
Ordinary Shares of Shire plc.
The Bonds were issued at 100% of their principal amount, and 
unless previously purchased and canceled, redeemed or converted, 
will be redeemed on May 9, 2014 (the “Final Maturity Date”) at their
principal amount. 
The Bonds bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually 
in arrears on November 9 and May 9. The Bonds constitute direct,
unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the
Company, and rank pari passu and ratably, without any preference
amongst themselves, and equally with all other existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.
The Bonds may be redeemed at the option of the Company, at their
principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest if: (i) at any
time after May 23, 2012 if on no less than 20 dealing days in any period
of 30 consecutive dealing days the value of Shire’ s Ordinary Shares
underlying each Bond in the principal amount of $100,000 would
exceed $130,000; or (ii) at any time conversion rights have been
exercised, and/or purchases and corresponding cancelations, and/or
redemptions effected in respect of 85% or more in principal amount 
of Bonds originally issued. The Bonds may also be redeemed at the
option of the Bondholder at their principal amount including accrued 
but unpaid interest on May 9, 2012 (the “Put Option”), or following the
occurrence of a change of control of Shire. The Bonds are repayable 
in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the Company to 
settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the 
Final Maturity Date and following exercise of the Put Option, by 
delivery of the underlying Ordinary Shares and a cash top-up amount.
At February 21 , 2012 the Bonds were trading at above par, and the
Company does not currently consider it likely that the Put Option will 
be exercised in 2012. However, in accordance with US GAAP , as the
exercise of the Put Option could require the Company to redeem 
the Bonds within twelve months of the balance sheet date, the Bonds 
have been presented as a current liability at December 31 , 2011 .
The Bonds are convertible into Ordinary Shares during the conversion
period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier of: 
(i) the close of business on the date falling 14 days prior to the 
Final Maturity Date; (ii) if the Bonds have been called for redemption 
by the Company, the close of business 14 days before the date fixed 
for redemption; (iii) the close of business on the day prior to a
Bondholder giving notice of redemption in accordance with the
conditions; and (iv) the giving of notice by the trustee that the Bonds 
are accelerated by reason of the occurrence of an event of default.
Upon conversion, the Bondholder is entitled to receive Ordinary 
Shares at the conversion price of $32.83 per Ordinary Share,
(subject to adjustment as outlined below).
The conversion price is subject to adjustment in respect of (i) any
dividend or distribution by the Company, (ii) a change of control 
and (iii) customary anti dilution adjustments for, inter alia, share
consolidations, share splits, spin-off events, rights issues, bonus 
issues and reorganizations. The initial conversion price of $33.5879 
was adjusted to $33.17 with effect from March 11 , 2009 as a result 
of cumulative dividend payments during the period from October 2007
to April 2009 inclusive, and was further adjusted to $32.83 with effect
from March 11 , 2011 as a result of cumulative dividend payments 
during the period April 2009 to April 2011 inclusive. The Ordinary Shares
issued on conversion will be delivered credited as fully paid, and will 
rank pari passu in all respects with all fully paid Ordinary Shares in issue
on the relevant conversion date.
Revolving credit facilities agreement
On November 23, 2010 the Company entered into a committed
multicurrency revolving and swingline facilities agreement with a number 
of financial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury Services plc
(trading as Santander Global Banking and Markets), Bank of America
Securities Limited, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Limited,
Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc acted as
mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners (the “new RCF”). The new
RCF is for an aggregate amount of $1 ,200 million and canceled the
Company’ s then existing committed revolving credit facility (the “old
RCF”). The new RCF , which includes a $250 million swingline facility,
may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on
November 23, 2015. 
8446 Annual Report 2011_Annual Report 2011  15/03/2012  16:12  Page 31 Shire plc Annual Repo 32 Shire plc Annual Report 2011
Financial review
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the new RCF for each
interest period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate
of the applicable margin (ranging from 0.90 to 2.25 percent per annum)
and LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period. Shire also
pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35 percent per annum
of the applicable margin.
Under the new RCF it is required that (i) Shire’ s ratio of Net Debt to
EBITDA (as defined within the new RCF agreement) does not exceed 
3.5 to 1 for either the twelve month period ending December 31 
or June 30 unless Shire has exercised its option (which is subject 
to certain conditions) to increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive 
testing dates; (ii) the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest (as defined in the 
new RCF agreement) must not be less than 4.0 to 1 , for either the 
twelve month period ending December 31 or June 30, and (iii) additional
limitations on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence 
of indebtedness, making of loans, giving of guarantees and granting
security over assets. These financial and operating covenants have 
not had, and are not expected to have, an effect on the Company’ s
financial position and liquidity.
On entering into the new RCF in November 2010 the Company paid
arrangement costs of $8.0 million, which have been recorded as
deferred charges, with amortization of these costs to the Company’ s
income statement over the contractual term of the new RCF . The
availability of the loans under the RCF is subject to customary conditions. 
Financing
Shire anticipates that its operating cash flow together with available
cash, cash equivalents and the new RCF will be sufficient to meet its
anticipated future operating expenses, capital expenditures, tax and
interest payments and lease obligations as they become due over the
next twelve months. 
The Company anticipates that its operating cash flow together with
available cash, cash equivalents and the new RCF would be sufficient 
to enable repayment of the Bonds if the Put Option was exercised 
in 2012. In lieu of settling any such redemption wholly in cash, the 
terms of the Bonds also permit the Company to deliver the underlying
Ordinary Shares and, if necessary, a cash top-up amount.
If the Company decides to acquire other businesses, it expects 
to fund these acquisitions from existing cash resources, the new 
RCF and possibly through new borrowings and the issue of new 
equity if necessary.
Sources and uses of cash 
The following table provides an analysis of the Company’ s gross and 
net debt (excluding restricted cash), as at December 31 , 2011 and 2010:
                                                                                                      2011 2010

(1) Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign
subsidiaries (i.e, those subsidiaries incorporated outside of Jersey, Channel
Islands, the jurisdiction of incorporation of Shire plc, Shire’s holding company). 
The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries has not 
had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company’s liquidity 
and capital resources.
Cash flow activity
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to December 31 ,
2011 increased by $118.7 million or 12% to $1,073.6 million (2010:
$954.9 million). Higher cash receipts from gross product sales and
lower cash tax payments were offset by the timing and quantum of
both sales deduction and operating expenditure payments, and lower
royalty receipts in 2011 compared to 2010. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to December 31,
2010 increased by $328.0 million to $954.9 million (2009: $626.9
million), primarily due to higher cash receipts from product sales and
royalties, cash inflows from forward foreign exchange contracts in 2010
compared to outflows in 2009, partially offset by higher payments on
sales deductions, operating costs and taxes in the year to December
31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.
Net cash used in investing activities was $809.2 million in the year 
to December 31, 2011, principally relating to the cash paid (net of cash
acquired) of $725.0 million for the acquisition of ABH and expenditure
on property, plant and equipment of $194.3 million, offset by proceeds
of $94.7 million received on the disposal of substantially all of Shire’s
holding in Vertex. Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment
includes $110.0 million on construction work at HGT’s facility at
Lexington Technology Park (“LTP”). 
Net cash used in investing activities was $797 .4 million in the year 
to December 31, 2010. This included the cash paid (net of cash
acquired) of $449.6 million for, and payments of $33.4 million on 
foreign exchange contracts related to, the acquisition of Movetis 
in October 2010, and expenditure on property, plant and equipment 
of $326.6 million. Capital expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment includes $121.9 million for the acquisition of new properties
and properties previously occupied under operating leases and 
$134.5 million on construction work, at LTP . 
Net cash used in financing activities was $195.4 million for the year 
to December 31, 2011, principally due to dividend payments, the
purchase of shares by the ESOT and the repayment of debt acquired
with ABH, offset by the tax benefit associated with the exercise of
stock options.
Net cash used in financing activities was $99.5 million for the year 
to December 31, 2010, including dividend payments of $62.0 million
and $43.1 million to extinguish building finance obligations at LTP .
Outstanding letters of credit
At December 31 , 2011 , the Company had irrevocable standby letters 
of credit and guarantees with various banks totaling $34.7 million,
providing security for the Company’s performance of various
obligations. These obligations are primarily in respect of the
recoverability of insurance claims, lease obligations and supply
commitments. The Company has restricted cash of $9.2 million,
as required by these letters of credit.

Cash requirements 
At December 31, 2011 the Group’s cash requirement for long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet and other contractual obligations were
as follows:
Payments due by period

(1) Shire’s $1,100 million principal amount of 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 and the interest on the Bonds has been included based on their contractual payment dates. 
The principal amount of $1,100 million has been included within payments due in one to three years based on the Final Maturity Date of the Bonds. The Bondholders have 
a Put Option which would require the Company to redeem the Bonds at their principal amount in May 2012, and the Company has the option to call the Bonds subject 
to certain conditions after May 2012. As a result of the Put Option the Bonds have been classified as a current liability at December 31, 2011: nevertheless, the Company 
does not currently consider it likely that the Put Option will be exercised in 2012. Further details are included within Liquidity and capital resources: Shire 2.75% Convertible
Bonds due 2014 above.
(2) The Company leases certain land, facilities, motor vehicles and certain equipment under operating leases expiring through 2021. 
(3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, investments or services (including clinical trials, contract manufacturing and capital equipment), including 
open purchase orders, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. Shire expects to fund these commitments with cash flows from 
operating activities.
(4) Unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties of $79.7 million are included within payments due in one to three years. 
The contractual obligations table above does not include certain
milestones and other contractual commitments where payment 
is contingent upon the occurrence of events which are yet to 
occur (and therefore payment is not yet due). The most significant 
of the Company’s milestone and contractual commitments which 
are contingent on the occurrence of future events are as follows:
Collaboration with Acceleron Pharma Inc. (“Acceleron”) 
for activin receptor type IIB (“ActRIIB”) class of molecules 
On September 9, 2010 Shire announced that it had expanded its 
HGT pipeline by acquiring an exclusive license in markets outside 
of North America for the ActRIIB class of molecules being developed
by Acceleron. The collaboration will initially focus on further developing
HGT-4510 (also called ACE-031), the lead ActRIIB drug candidate,
which is in development for the treatment of patients with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (“DMD”). The Phase 2a trial is on hold and 
clinical safety is under review. HGT-4510 and the other ActRIIB 
class of molecules have the potential to be used in other muscular 
and neuromuscular disorders with high unmet medical need.
In the year to December 31, 2010 Shire made an upfront payment 
of $45 million to Acceleron which has been expensed to R&D. 
In the year to December 31, 2011 Shire’s share of R&D costs under this
collaboration agreement was $10.1 million (2010: $2.7 million; 2009:
$nil) which were expensed to R&D. Shire will pay Acceleron up to a
further $165.0 million, subject to certain development, regulatory and
sales milestones being met for HGT-4510 in DMD, up to an additional
$288 million for successful commercialization of other indications and
molecules, and royalties on product sales.
Shire and Acceleron will conduct the collaboration through a joint
steering committee, with subcommittees including a joint manufacture
committee, and a joint patent committee to monitor the development
of HGT-4510 and other compounds. 
Research collaboration with Santaris Pharma A/S (“Santaris”)
on Locked Nucleic Acid (“LNA”) Drug Platform 
On August 24, 2009 Shire announced that it had entered into a
research collaboration with Santaris, to develop its proprietary LNA
technology in a range of rare diseases. LNA technology has the 
benefit of shortened target validation and proof of concept, potentially
increasing the speed and lowering the cost of development. As part 
of the joint research project Santaris will design, develop and deliver
preclinical LNA oligonucleotides for Shire-selected orphan disease
targets, and Shire will have the exclusive right to further develop and
commercialize these candidate compounds on a worldwide basis.
In the year to December 31, 2009 Shire made an upfront payment 
to Santaris of $6.5 million, for technology access and R&D funding,
which was expensed to R&D. 
In the year to December 31, 2011 Shire paid success milestones 
and other support costs of $2.5 million (2010: $4.0 million; 2009: 
$nil) and $5.3 million (2010: $2.3 million; 2009: $0.1 million) to Santaris
respectively, which were expensed to R&D. Shire has remaining
obligations to pay Santaris $13.5 million subject to certain success
criteria, and development and sales milestones up to a maximum 
of $70.5 million for each indication. Shire will also pay single or double
digit tiered royalties on net sales of the product.
Shire and Santaris have formed a joint research committee to 
monitor R&D activities through preclinical lead candidate selection 
at which point all development and commercialization costs will 
be the responsibility of Shire.

Collaboration and license agreement with Sangamo BioSciences,
Inc. (“Sangamo”) to develop therapeutics for hemophilia
On February 1, 2012 Shire and Sangamo announced that they 
have entered into a collaboration and license agreement to develop
therapeutics for hemophilia and other monogenic diseases based 
on Sangamo’s zinc finger DNA-binding protein (“ZFP”) technology.
Shire will receive exclusive worldwide rights to ZFP Therapeutics
®
designed to target four genes in hemophilia and will also receive 
the right to designate three additional gene targets. Sangamo 
is responsible for all activities through submission of Investigational
New Drug Applications and European Clinical Trial Applications 
for each product and Shire will reimburse Sangamo for its internal 
and external research program-related costs. Shire is responsible 
for clinical development and commercialization of products arising 
from the alliance. Shire will pay Sangamo an upfront fee followed 
by research, regulatory, development and commercial milestone
payments, and royalties on product sales.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group has adopted a risk management strategy designed 
to identify, assess and manage the significant risks that it faces.
While the Group aims to identify and manage such risks, no risk
management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss.
Mitigation of principal risks
The management and mitigation of risks are a key focus for the Group.
The Group has established The Risk Council which is supported by 
the Global Compliance and Risk Management (“GCRM”) Department
to oversee the management and mitigation of the principal risks faced
by the Group, as set out below. 
Risk Council
The Risk Council comprises a number of senior executives, from
functions across the Group, and is charged with overseeing the risk
management process and activities of the Group. Chaired by the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, the Risk Council’s membership
includes senior members of each of the Group businesses, in addition
to the Head of Internal Audit. Each business unit and corporate
function is required to periodically review the significant risks facing 
their businesses, and are provided with a framework for use in their
review. This review includes identifying operational risks, compliance
risks and risks to the achievement of goals and objectives. That review
occurs twice annually and material risks are recorded on a corporate
risk schedule for review and assessment of the risks and associated
mitigation plans. The Risk Council identifies a manager who is given
responsibility for the management of any given risk. 
The risk schedule is reviewed and validated by the Leadership Team. 
In addition, the risk schedule is reviewed twice yearly by the Audit
Compliance & Risk (“ACR”) Committee, and on an annual basis 
by the Board.
GCRM
The Risk Council is assisted by the GCRM Department, which 
is responsible for supporting the development and implementation 
of practices that facilitate employees’ compliance with laws 
and Group policy. The department provides assistance to help
employees meet high ethical standards and comply with applicable
laws and regulations. 
The principal focus of Shire’s compliance effort is to prevent and detect
misconduct or non-compliance with laws or regulations through the
promotion of ethical behavior, policy development, appropriate training,
monitoring and audit. Shire employees are encouraged to seek help
and to report suspected cases of misconduct without fear of retaliation.
Employees can report suspected cases of misconduct to management
or through the confidential reporting lines managed by GCRM.
Concerns and allegations are fairly and independently investigated 
and appropriate disciplinary action is taken if warranted. 
The GCRM department is managed by the Chief Compliance and 
Risk Officer, who reports directly to the CEO. The Chief Compliance
and Risk Officer chairs the Risk Council and regularly provides
summary reports on the Risk Council and Compliance activities 
to the Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee. The Chief Compliance 
and Risk Officer has access at all times to the ACR Committee 
chair which provides a mechanism for bypassing the executive
management should the need ever arise. 
Set out below are the key risk factors associated with the business,
that have been identified through the Group’s approach to risk
management. Some of these risk factors are specific to the Group, 
and others are more generally applicable to the pharmaceutical
industry in which the Group operates. The Group considers that 
these risk factors apply equally and therefore all should be carefully
considered before any investment is made in Shire.

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS
The Company’s products may not be a commercial success
The commercial success of the Company’s marketed products 
and other new products that the Company may launch in the future,
will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians, patients
and other key decision makers, as well as the timing of the receipt 
of additional marketing approvals, the scope of marketing approvals 
as reflected in the product’s label, the countries in which such
approvals are obtained, the authorization of price and reimbursement 
in those countries where price and reimbursement is negotiated, 
and safety, efficacy, convenience and cost-effectiveness of the 
product as compared to competitive products.
The Company may not be able to grow its product revenues 
as quickly as anticipated if any or all of the following occur: 
� if Shire’s products or competitive products are genericized or if the
prices of competitor products are otherwise reduced significantly; 
� if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the
Company’s products or those of a competitor’s product in the 
same therapeutic area not seen in clinical trials that impact 
the physician’s willingness to prescribe the Company’s products; 
� if issues arise from clinical trials being conducted for post marketing
purposes or for registration in another country or if regulatory
agencies in one country act in a way that raises concerns for
regulatory agencies or for prescribers or patients in another country;
� if patients, payors or physicians favor other treatments over the
Company’s products;
� if government regulation is stricter for the Company’s products than
for other treatments; 
� loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or
circumvent patents (see Note 20 “Commitments and contingencies”
to the consolidated financial statements for details of current patent
litigation);
� if planned geographical expansion into emerging markets is not
successful; 
� if the sizes of the patient populations for the Company’s products 
are less than expected or the Company fails to identify new patients
for its products; or
� if there are lawsuits filed against Shire, including but not limited 
to, product liability claims, consumer law claims, and payor 
or reimbursement litigation.
If the Company is unable to commercialize any of its products
successfully, there may be a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
Unanticipated decreases in revenues from ADDERALL XR
could significantly reduce the Company’s revenues and earnings
Following the launch of authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR 
in 2009, Shire’s sales of ADDERALL XR decreased by 42% in 2010
compared to 2009. In the year to December 31, 2011 product sales 
of ADDERALL XR increased 48% to $532.8 million, representing
approximately 12% of the Company’s total revenues, (sales of
ADDERALL XR in the years to December 31, 2010 and 2009 were
$360.8 million and $626.5 million respectively). 
The Company sells authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR 
to Teva and Impax and currently receives royalties from Impax in
respect of sales of its authorized generic. Shire continues to sell the
branded version of ADDERALL XR. 
Factors that could negatively impact total revenue from ADDERALL XR
include, but are not limited to:
� erosion of ADDERALL XR product sales if the authorized generic
versions capture Shire’s branded market share;
� any approval by the FDA of any ANDAs for ADDERALL XR which
could further reduce branded market share. Any such approval 
may eliminate or reduce royalties currently received from Impax;
� issues impacting the production of ADDERALL XR or the supply 
of amphetamine salts including, but not limited to, the ability 
to get sufficient quota from the US DEA;
� changes in reimbursement policies of third party payors; and
� changes to the level of sales deductions for ADDERALL XR 
for private or public payors.
In addition, in respect of the period prior to October 1, 2010, 
when certain provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act became
effective and provided further clarity, there were potentially different
interpretations as to how shipments of authorized generic ADDERALL
XR to Teva and Impax should be included in the Medicaid rebate
calculation. The CMS may disagree with the Company’s interpretation
as to how shipments of authorized generic ADDERALL XR should be
included in the Medicaid rebate calculation, and require the Company
to apply an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation,
resulting in additional liability to be recorded by the Company.
The failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, 
or an adequate level of reimbursement, by third party 
payors in a timely manner for the Company’s products 
may impact future revenues and earnings
The Company’s revenues are partly dependent on the level 
of reimbursement provided to the Company by governmental 
reimbursement schemes for its products. Changes to governmental
policy or practices could adversely affect the Company’s revenues,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the 
reimbursement of treatments by healthcare providers, private 
health insurers and other organizations, such as health-maintenance
organizations and managed care organizations is under downward
pressure and this, in turn, could impact on the prices at which the
Company can sell its products.
The market for the Company’s products could be significantly
influenced by the following, which could result in lower prices for the
Company’s products and/or a reduced demand for the Company’s
products:
� higher levels of controls on the use of the Company’s products
and/or requirements for additional price concessions by managed
healthcare organizations;
� legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance
programs in many of the Company’s markets; and
� price controls and non-reimbursement of new and highly priced
medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are 
not established.

Financial review
The prices for certain of the Company’s products, in particular
products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases such as
REPLAGAL, ELAPRASE and VPRIV , may be high, compared to other
pharmaceutical products. The Company may encounter difficulty in
obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for such products.
The failure to obtain and maintain pricing and reimbursement 
at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect the
Company’s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
A disruption to a product’s supply chain may result in the
Company being unable to continue marketing or developing 
a product, or may result in the Company being unable to do 
so on a commercially viable basis 
The Company sources some products from third party contract
manufacturers, and for certain products has its own manufacturing
capability. Although the Company dual-sources certain key products
and/or active ingredients. The Company currently relies on a single
source for production of the final drug product for each of ADDERALL
XR, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, INTUNIV , PENTASA, RESOLOR and VPRIV ,
relies on a single active ingredient source for each of ELAPRASE,
FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, INTUNIV , REPLAGAL, RESOLOR and VPRIV
and relies on a single source for certain serum reagents, the mesh
framework and the manifold used in the manufacture of DERMAGRAFT . 
In the event of:
� financial failure of a third party contract manufacturer; or
� the failure of a third party manufacturer to comply with its contractual
obligations; or
� the failure of the Company or a third party contract manufacturer 
to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards (“Current Good
Manufacturing Standards” or “cGMP”); or
� the failure of the Company or a third party contract manufacturer
to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet demand; or
� any other form of disruption to the supply chain
the Company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to supply,
market or develop its products. Any disruption in the supply chain
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues,
financial condition and results of operations. 
There is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply 
on commercially viable terms, or be able to supply components
that meet regulatory requirements. The Company is also subject
to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities
needed to meet market requirements, which may result in the
shortage of product supplies in the market
The development and approval of the Company’s products depends
on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging
materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities. As the
marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their
own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging
materials in their applications, regulatory approval of a new 
supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging
materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the
marketing approval. The need to qualify a new supplier could delay 
the Company’s development and commercialization efforts.
The Company uses bovine-derived serum sourced from New Zealand
and North America in the manufacturing process for ELAPRASE and
DERMAGRAFT. The discovery of additional cattle in North America 
or the discovery of cattle in New Zealand with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could cause the regulatory
agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on these products,
or prohibit the Company from using them. This could disrupt the
Company’s ability to supply these products and would have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, financial conditions or
results of operations.
The actions of certain customers can affect the Company’s 
ability to sell or market products profitably, as well as impact 
net sales and growth comparisons
A small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant
share of the US and certain European markets. In 2011, for example,
49% of the Company’s product sales were attributable to three
customers in the US: McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc. and
AmerisourceBergen Corp. In the event of financial failure of either 
of these customers, the Company may suffer financial loss and 
a decline in revenues and earnings. In addition, the number of
independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail
pharmacy consolidation has occurred. Consolidation or financial
difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels, 
or otherwise reduce purchases of the Company’s products. 
Such actions could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
revenues, financial condition and results of operations. A significant
portion of the Company’s SP product sales are made to major
pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies 
in both the US and Europe. Consequently, product sales and growth
comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns 
of major distributors and other trade buyers. These fluctuations may
result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions, or other
factors. In addition, a significant portion of the Company’s revenues 
for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are
concentrated with a small number of customers. Changes in the
buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on 
the Company’s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
Investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities 
or law enforcement agencies relating to the Company’s activities
in the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result 
in the distraction of senior management, significant legal costs
and the payment of substantial compensation or fines
The Company engages in various marketing, promotional and
educational activities pertaining to, as well as the sale of,
pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is
highly regulated and the operations of market participants, such as 
the Company, are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law
enforcement agencies, including the US Department of Health and
Human Services (“HHS”), the FDA, the US Department of Justice, 
the SEC and the DEA. These authorities and agencies have broad
authority to investigate market participants for violations of federal laws
relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products,
including the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among others, for alleged improper
conduct, including corrupt payments to government officials, 
improper payments to medical professionals, off-label marketing 
of pharmaceutical products, and the submission of false claims 
for reimbursement by the federal government. Pharmaceutical
companies may be subject to enforcement actions or prosecution

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
for such conduct, as well. Any inquiries or investigations into the
operations of, or enforcement or other regulatory action against, the
Company by such authorities could result in the distraction of senior
management for prolonged periods of time, significant defense costs,
substantial monetary penalties and require extensive government
monitoring of Company activities in the future. As an example, on
September 23, 2009 the Company received a subpoena from the 
HHS Office of Inspector General in coordination with the US Attorney
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking production of
documents related to the sales and marketing of ADDERALL XR,
VYVANSE and DAYTRANA. Shire is co-operating and responding 
to this subpoena (for further information see Note 20 “Commitments 
and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements).
Adverse outcomes in legal matters could have a material adverse
effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations
During the ordinary course of its business the Company may be
involved in claims, disputes and litigation with third parties, employees,
regulatory agencies, governmental authorities and other parties. The
range of matters of a legal nature that might arise is extremely broad
but could include, without limitation, employment claims and disputes,
intellectual property claims and disputes, contract claims and disputes,
product liability claims and disputes, regulatory litigation and tax audits.
Any unfavorable outcome in such matters could adversely impact the
Company’s ability to develop and commercialize its products, distract
senior management to the detriment of the business, adversely affect
the profitability of existing products, possibly subject the Company to
substantial fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies,
and possibly result in the imposition of regulatory controls or exclusion
of certain products or the Company from government reimbursement
programs. Any such outcomes could have a material adverse 
effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations. 
(For further information see Note 20 “Commitments and contingencies”
to the consolidated financial statements.)
Contractual relationships can create a significant dependency on
third parties, the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate
the Company’s business and to develop and market products
The Company has entered into many agreements with third parties for
the provision of goods and services to enable it to operate its business.
If the third party does not provide the goods or services on the agreed
basis, the Company may not be able to continue the development or
commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis.
Additionally, it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships
with the suppliers.
The Company has entered into licensing, co-development and other
agreements with third parties. These contractual agreements may be
altered, terminated or expire and the Company may not be able to
renew, extend or contract on similar commercial terms, with the party
or another third party. In such circumstances, the Company may be
unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and
could be required to abandon or divest a product line.
RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL 
AND BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES IN GENERAL
The actions of governments, industry regulators and the
economic environments in which the Company operates 
may adversely affect its ability to develop and profitably 
market its products 
Changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry,
in any country in which the Company conducts its business, may
adversely impact the Company’s revenues, financial condition and
results of operations. For example, changes to the regulations relating
to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products
with such designation. 
A slowdown of global economic growth, or continued 
instability of the Eurozone, could have negative consequences 
for our business and increase the risk of non-payment by the
Company’s customers
Growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become increasingly
tied to global economic growth. Accordingly a substantial and lasting
slowdown of the global economy or major national economies 
could negatively affect growth in the markets in which the Company
operates. Such a slowdown, or any resultant austerity measures
adopted by governments in response to a slowdown, could also
reduce the level of reimbursement that governments are willing and
able to provide to the Company for its products and, as a result,
adversely affect the Company’s revenues, financial condition and
results of operations.
Any slowing economic environment may also lead to financial
difficulties for some of the Company’s significant customers. 
In such situations, the Company could experience delays in payment 
or non-payment of amounts owed which may result in a rising level 
of contractual defaults by its contractual counterparties. The Company
does business, both directly (with government hospitals, clinics,
pharmacies and other agencies) and indirectly (through wholesalers
and distributors), with a number of Eurozone governments (including
the governments of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain) that 
have experienced or may continue to experience declines in their
creditworthiness which may result in the continuation of significant 
cuts to public spending in an attempt to manage their budget deficits. 
In addition, there are concerns for the overall stability and suitability 
of the Euro as a single currency, given the economic and political
challenges facing individual Eurozone countries. Continuing
deterioration in the creditworthiness of Eurozone countries, the
withdrawal of one or more member countries from the EU, or the failure
of the Euro as a common European currency could adversely effect 
the Company’s revenues, financial condition or results of operations.
The introduction of new products by competitors may impact
future revenues
The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive.
Many of the Company’s competitors are large, well known
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and healthcare companies 
with considerable resources. Companies with more resources and larger
R&D expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other
development work necessary for regulatory applications. They may
also be more successful than the Company in acquiring or licensing
new products for development and commercialization. If any product
that competes with one of the Company’s principal drugs is approved,
the Company’s sales of that drug could be negatively impacted.
8446 Annual Report 2011_Annual Report 2011  15/03/2012  16:12  Page 37 Shire plc Annual Repo 38 Shire plc Annual Report 2011
Financial review
The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and regenerative medicine
industries are also characterized by continuous product development
and technological change. The Company’s products could, therefore,
be rendered obsolete or uneconomic, through the development 
of new products, technological advances in manufacturing or
production by its competitors.
The successful development of products is highly uncertain 
and requires significant expenditures and time
Products that appear promising in research or development may
be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development or the market 
for several reasons, including:
� preclinical or clinical tests may show the product to lack safety 
or efficacy;
� delays may be caused by slow enrolment in clinical studies; regulatory
requirements for clinical trial drug supplies; extended length of time 
to achieve study endpoints; additional time requirements for data
analysis or dossier preparation; time required for discussions with
regulatory agencies, including regulatory agency requests for
additional preclinical or clinical data; delays at regulatory agencies 
due to staffing or resource limitations; analysis of or changes to study
design; unexpected safety, efficacy, or manufacturing issues; delays
may arise from shared control with collaborative partners in the
planning and execution of the product development, scaling of the
manufacturing process, or getting approval for manufacturing;
� manufacturing issues, pricing or reimbursement issues, or other
factors may render the product economically unviable;
� the proprietary rights of others and their competing products 
and technologies may prevent the product from being developed 
or commercialized; and
� failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals.
Success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that
large-scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical results are frequently
susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit, or prevent
regulatory approvals. The length of time necessary to complete clinical
trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final
decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be
difficult to predict. If the Company’s large-scale or late stage clinical
trials for a product are not successful, the Company will not recover 
its substantial investments in that product. 
In addition, even if the products receive regulatory approval, they
remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including, for
example, obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other non-
clinical testing, changes to the product label (which could impact its
marketability and prospects for commercial success), new or revised
requirements for manufacturing, written notifications to physicians, 
or product recalls or withdrawals. Further, a number of the Company’s
ADHD products contain controlled substances and are subject to
regulation by the US DEA and equivalent agencies in other countries. 
The failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize
products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue
The Company enters into strategic partnerships with other companies
in areas such as product development and sales and marketing. 
In these partnerships, the Company is sometimes dependent on its
partner to deliver results. While these partnerships are governed by
contracts, the Company may not exercise direct control. If a partner
fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties, the Company 
may suffer a delay in the development, a delay in the approval or 
a reduction in sales or royalties of a product.
The failure to secure new products or compounds 
for development, either through in-licensing, acquisition 
or internal research and development efforts, may have 
an adverse impact on the Company’s future results
The Company’s future results will depend, to a significant extent, upon
its ability to in-license, acquire or develop new products or compounds.
The Company also expends significant resources on research and
development. The failure to in-license or acquire new products or
compounds, on a commercially viable basis, could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, financial condition and
results of operations. The failure of these efforts to develop products
appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, financial condition and
results of operations.
The Company may fail to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend 
the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business
The Company’s success depends upon its ability and the ability 
of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property 
rights. Where possible, the Company’s strategy is to register intellectual
property rights, such as patents and trademarks. The Company 
also relies variously on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and
technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third
parties to maintain its competitive position.
Patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies
and processes owned or licensed to the Company have been granted,
or are pending in various countries, including the US, Canada, major
European countries and Japan. The Company intends to enforce
vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to
enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the Company.
However, patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing,
using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally
equivalent to the Company’ s products or technologies. The Company’ s
patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws
providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn. The Company
cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or 
those of its commercial partners, licensors and third party
manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to
protect the Company’ s products and technology or that such patents
will not be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented
by third parties. In the regular course of business, the Company is party
to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.
(See Note 20 “Commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated
financial statements for details of current patent litigation).
Additionally, the Company’s products, or the technologies or processes
used to formulate or manufacture those products may now, or in the
future, infringe the patent rights of third parties. It is also possible that
third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might 
be necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or sale of the
Company’s products. If third parties are the first to invent a particular
product or technology, it is possible that those parties will obtain 
patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the Company 
or its strategic partners from developing, manufacturing or selling its
products. The Company may need to obtain licenses for intellectual
property rights from others to develop, manufacture and market
commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these
licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, any
licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable.
The Company also relies on trade secrets and other unpatented
proprietary information, which it generally seeks to protect by
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with its employees,
consultants, advisors and partners. These agreements may not
8446 Annual Report 2011_Annual Report 2011  15/03/2012  16:12  Page 38 Shire plc Annual Report 2011 39
Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may 
not provide the Company with an adequate remedy in the event 
of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If the Company’s
employees, scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or
processes that may be applicable to the Company’s products under
development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily
become the Company’s property, but may remain the property of
those persons or their employers. Protracted and costly litigation could
be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the Company’s
proprietary rights. The failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade
secret protection, for any reason, could allow other companies to make
competing products which could have a material adverse effect on 
the Company’s revenues, financial condition or results of operations.
The Company has filed applications to register various trademarks 
for use in connection with its products in various countries including 
the US and countries in Europe and Latin America and intends to
trademark new product names as new products are developed.
In addition, with respect to certain products, the Company relies 
on the trademarks of third parties. These trademarks may not afford
adequate protection or the Company or the third parties may not 
have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these
trademarks. The Company’s inability or the inability of these third
parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third party
claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the Company’s
trademarks and dilute their value.
If a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes 
adverse side-effects, this could result in damage to the
Company’s reputation, the withdrawal of the product and 
legal action against the Company
Unanticipated side-effects or unfavorable publicity from complaints
concerning any of the Company’s products, or those of its competitors,
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to obtain 
or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products. 
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical
products entails a risk of product liability claims, product recalls,
litigation and associated adverse publicity. The cost of defending
against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited.
A successful product liability claim against the Company could require
the Company to pay a substantial monetary award. If, in the absence
of adequate insurance coverage, the Company does not have
sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such 
a claim or to fund the legal defense of such a claim, it could become
insolvent. Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult 
to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms.
Although the Company carries product liability insurance when
available, this coverage may not be adequate. In addition, it cannot 
be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will
be available. Moreover, an adverse judgment in a product liability suit,
even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal, could generate
substantial negative publicity about the Company’s products and
business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products.
Loss of highly qualified management and scientific personnel
could cause the Company subsequent financial loss
The Company faces competition for highly qualified management 
and scientific personnel from other companies, academic institutions,
government entities and other organizations. It may not be able to
successfully attract and retain such personnel. The Company has
agreements with a number of its key scientific and management
personnel for periods of one year or less. The loss of such personnel,
or the inability to attract and retain the additional, highly skilled
employees required for its activities could have an adverse effect 
on the Company’s business.
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury operations are coordinated by 
its corporate treasury function. All treasury operations are conducted
within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually 
by the Board of Directors. As a matter of policy, the Company does 
not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its credit,
currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on restricted cash, cash
and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange contracts on which
interest is at floating rates. This exposure is primarily to US dollar,
Pounds sterling and Euro interest rates. As the Company maintains 
all of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on 
a short-term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively
managed. In the year to December 31, 2011 the average interest rate
received on cash and liquid investments was less than 1% per 
annum. The largest proportion of these cash and liquid investments
was in US dollar money market and liquidity funds.
The Company incurs interest at a fixed rate of 2.75% on $1,100 million
in principal amount convertible bonds due 2014. 
No derivative instruments were entered into during the year to
December 31, 2011 to manage interest rate exposure. The Company
continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place to
manage the risk. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous countries and as a consequence
has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies
different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. The main
trading currencies of the Company are the US dollar, Pounds sterling,
Swiss franc and the Euro. It is the Company’s policy that these
exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating
transactions in the subsidiary’s functional currency. 
Where significant exposures remain, the Company uses foreign
exchange contracts (being spot, forward and swap contracts) to
manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies different to the functional currency of the
relevant subsidiary. These assets and liabilities relate predominantly 
to inter company financing, accruals for royalty receipts and specific
external receivables. The foreign exchange contracts have not been
designated as hedging instruments. Cash flows from derivative
instruments are presented within net cash provided by operating
activities in the consolidated cash flow statement, unless the 
derivative instruments are economically hedging specific investing 
or financing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation 
into US dollars of the financial statements of non-US dollar functional
subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2011 the Company had 20 swap and forward foreign
exchange contracts outstanding to manage currency risk. The swaps
and forward contracts mature within 90 days. The Company did 
not have credit risk related contingent features or collateral linked to 
the derivatives. At December 31, 2011 the fair value of these contracts 
was a net asset of $3.0 million. Further details are included below.

Foreign exchange risk sensitivity
The following exchange rate sensitivity analysis summarizes the sensitivity of our reported revenues and net income to hypothetical changes in the

Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose Shire to concentrations 
of credit risk consist primarily of short-term cash investments, trade
accounts receivable and derivative contracts. Cash is invested in short-
term money market instruments, including money market and liquidity
funds and bank term deposits. The money market and liquidity funds 
in which Shire invests are all triple A rated by both Standard and Poor’s
and by Moody’s credit rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with
which it enters into derivative instruments. The Company limits this
exposure through a system of internal credit limits which require
counterparties to have a long-term credit rating of A-/A3 or better from
the major rating agencies. The internal credit limits are approved by the
Board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate
treasury function. The counterparties to these derivatives contracts 
are major international financial institutions. 
The Company’s revenues from product sales in the US are mainly
governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and
relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy
chains. For the year to December 31, 2011 there were three customers
in the US that accounted for 49% of the Company’s product sales.
However, such customers typically have significant cash resources and
as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered acceptable.
The Company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk
associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit
evaluation procedures. However, an inability of one or more of these
wholesalers to honor their debts to the Company could have an
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
A substantial portion of the Company’ s accounts receivable in countries
outside of the US is derived from product sales to government-owned
or government-supported healthcare providers. The Company’s
recovery of these accounts receivable is therefore dependent upon 
the financial stability and creditworthiness of the relevant governments.
In 2011 the creditworthiness and general economic condition of a
number of Eurozone countries (including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal
and Spain) has continued to deteriorate. As a result, in some of these
countries the Company is experiencing delays in the remittance of
receivables due from government-owned or government-supported
healthcare providers. 
The Company’s aggregate accounts receivable, net of the allowance
for doubtful accounts, in total from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
Spain (the “Relevant Countries”) are as follows: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     December 31,            December 31,

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
Accounts receivable due from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers in the Relevant Countries of $170 million
(2010: $126 million) are split by country as follows: Greece $4 million
(2010: $8 million); Ireland $1 million (2010: $1 million); Italy $81 million
(2010: $60 million); Portugal $14 million (2010: $5 million) and Spain
$70 million (2010: $52 million).
In 2011 the Company received $193 million in settlement of accounts
receivable in the Relevant Countries—$11 million was from Greece
(including $2.1 million in the form of Greek Government Bonds
(“GGBs”)); $18 million from Ireland; $94 million from Italy; $5 million 
from Portugal and $65 million from Spain.
To date the Company has not incurred significant losses on the
accounts receivable in the Relevant Countries, and continues to
consider that such accounts receivable are recoverable. 
Other than the GGBs (principal amount $2.1 million, carrying value
$0.7 million as at December 31, 2011) and accounts receivable from
government-owned or supported healthcare providers outlined above,
the Company does not hold any other government debt from the
Relevant Countries. Additionally the Company does not consider 
it is currently exposed to significant sovereign credit risk outside 
of the Relevant Countries.
The Company continues to evaluate all its accounts receivable for
potential collection risks and has made provision for amounts where
collection is considered to be doubtful. If the financial condition of 
the Relevant Countries or other Eurozone countries suffer significant
deterioration, such that their ability to make payments becomes
uncertain, or if one or more Eurozone member countries withdraws
from the Euro, additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be
required, and losses may be incurred, in future periods. Any such loss
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition 
and results of operations.
Inflation
Although at reduced levels in recent years, inflation continues to apply
upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used 
in the business. However, the Company believes that the net effect 
of inflation on its revenues and operations has been minimal during 
the past three years.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements, aside from the
collaborations containing contractual commitments and milestones
which are contingent on future events as outlined above, that have,
or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect 
on the Company’s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results 
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Directors’ report
The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group
together with the audited consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended December 31, 2011. The Corporate Governance Statement
set out on pages 48 to 54 forms part of this report. 
Principal activities 
Shire plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred 
to as the “Group” or “Shire”) is a leading specialty biopharmaceutical
company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist
physician.
Shire focuses its business on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
human genetic therapies, gastrointestinal diseases and regenerative
medicine as well as opportunities in other specialty therapeutic areas 
to the extent they arise through acquisitions. 
The subsidiaries and equity method investees principally affecting 
the profits and/or net assets of Shire in the year are listed in Note 30 
to the consolidated financial statements, including their country 
of incorporation. 
Business review
Shire seeks to set out in this report a fair review of the business of the
Group during the financial year to December 31, 2011, the position 
of the Group at the end of that financial year, and a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The information 
that fulfils the requirements of the Business Review can be found 
in the Chairman’s review on pages 6 and 7 , Chief Executive’s review 
on pages 8 to 11, the Financial review on pages 12 to 41 and 
the Corporate governance report on pages 48 to 54 which are
incorporated in this report by reference. The Financial review and 
Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements also provide a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
as well as the Group’s risk management objectives and policies.
There were no significant events subsequent to the balance sheet date.
Results and dividends
The income before income taxes, and equity in earnings of 
equity method investees for the year to December 31, 2011 was
$1,090.1 million (2010: $769.3 million). The net assets of Shire at
December 31, 2011 were $3,185.0 million (2010: $2,451.4 million).
In respect of the six months to December 31, 2011 the Board resolved
to pay a second interim dividend of 12.59 US cents (2010: 10.85 
US cents) per Ordinary Share. Together with the first interim payment 
of 2.48 US cents (2010: 2.25 US cents) per Ordinary Share, this
represents total dividends for 2011 of 15.07 US cents (2010: 13.10 
US cents) per Ordinary Share.
ACS HR Solutions Share Plan Services (Guernsey) Limited (“Trustee”),
trustee of the Shire Employee Benefit Trust, has waived its entitlement
to any dividends, which become due and payable in respect of shares
or other securities, which are registered in the name of the Trustee 
or its nominee(s), from time to time, except the right to receive 0.0001
pence per Ordinary Share.
Liquidity, cash flow and going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and financial position are
set out in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive Officer’s reviews and
Financial review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows,
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Liquidity
and capital resources section of the Financial review. The Financial
review also includes information concerning the Group’s objectives,
policies and processes for managing capital; its financial risk
management objectives; details of its hedging activity; and its
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. Details of the Group’s 
financial instruments are disclosed in Note 21 to the consolidated
financial statements.
Shire’s balance sheet includes $620.0 million of cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 2011. Substantially all of Shire’s debt
relates to its $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bond (the “Bonds”) 
which matures in 2014, although these Bonds include a put option
which could require repayment of the Bonds in May 2012. In addition
Shire has committed multicurrency revolving and swingline facilities 
of $1,200 million which mature in 2015 and are currently undrawn, 
the (“RCF”). At February 21, 2012 the Bonds were trading at above 
par, and the Company does not currently consider it likely that the 
Put Option will be exercised in 2012. However, if the Bonds were
redeemed in 2012, the Group’s operating cash flow together with
available cash, cash equivalents and the RCF would be sufficient 
to enable repayment of the Bonds. In lieu of settling any such
redemption wholly in cash, the terms of the Bonds also permit the
Company to deliver the underlying Ordinary Shares and, if necessary, 
a cash top up amount.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Share capital 
At December 31, 2011 the Company’s issued share capital comprised
562,472,830 Ordinary Shares. Further details of the authorized and
called up share capital of the Company as at December 31, 2011
are set out in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company was given authority at the 2011 AGM to make market
purchases of up to 56,196,681 of its own Ordinary Shares. That
authority will expire at the 2012 AGM and in accordance with usual
practice a resolution to renew it for another year will be proposed. 
The Company did not purchase any of its shares during 2011.
Directors’ interests in material contracts
Other than the insurance/indemnity provisions disclosed under
“Directors” liability insurance and indemnification’ below, none of the
Directors had a material interest in any contract of significance to 
which the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings was a party
during the period under review.
Related party transactions
There were no related party transactions in the year to December 
31, 2011.

Directors’ liability insurance and indemnification
In the year under review, the Group maintained an insurance policy for
its Directors and Officers in respect of liabilities arising out of any act,
error or omission while acting in their capacity as Directors or Officers.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions were also in place during the
year under review for the benefit of Directors in relation to certain losses
and liabilities which they may potentially incur to third parties in the
course of their duties. These remain in force at the date of this report.
Research and development
Shire has incurred, under its research and development program, 
costs of $770.7 million in the financial year to December 31, 2011
(2010: $661.5 million). Further details on the Group’s research and
development program can be found in the Financial review on 
pages 18 to 21. These costs have been charged to the consolidated
income statement in accordance with Shire’s accounting policy.
Substantial shareholdings 
As at the date of this report, the Company had been notified of the
following holdings in voting rights of 3% or more in the issued Ordinary
Share capital of the Company:
� BlackRock Inc. has a holding of 5.93%;
� FMR LLC has a holding of 5%; and
� Legal and General Group plc has a holding of 3.96%.
Political donations 
Shire did not make any donations to EU political parties during 
the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010: $nil). 
Charitable donations
During the year donations to charities (including matching of funds
raised by employees), not-for-profit organizations and entities
supporting medical education amounting to $5.0 million were made 
of which $0.8 million were made in the UK.

Employment policies
As of December 31, 2011 Shire employed 5,251 personnel, of which
69% are based in the US, 10% in the UK, 4% in Switzerland and 
17% in the rest of the world. As Shire continues to grow, we remain
dedicated to creating an environment in which employees are highly
engaged and committed to achieving Shire’s goals.
Engagement happens at every level of the business, from the 
one-to-one performance discussions between managers and their
staff, to the regular all-employee meetings held at our major sites. 
Shire communicates with all employees via an active internal
communications program which includes a worldwide intranet, all-
employee emails from the CEO, and a global employee magazine.
During 2011, the CEO used a quarterly blog to communicate in real
time and online with Shire employees around the world. Within each
business (HGT, SP and Regenerative Medicine), the Presidents have
their own internal communications strategies and plans to ensure
employees are kept aware of priorities and have the opportunity to
exchange views. Shire believes in having a progressive, collaborative
and positive workplace in which everyone feels valued and is treated
fairly, and that is reflected in the way we work together, every day.
Details of the Group’ s employee share schemes are set out in Note 29
to the consolidated financial statements.
Shire operates an equal opportunities policy that aims to treat
individuals fairly and not to discriminate on the basis of sex, race, 
ethnic origin, disability or on any other basis. Applications for
employment are fully considered on their merits, and employees 
are given appropriate training and equal opportunities for career
development and promotion. 
It is Shire’ s policy to ensure that applications for employment by disabled
persons are given full and fair consideration, bearing in mind the aptitude
of the applicant relative to the requirements of the position in question. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is 
made to ensure that their employment with Shire continues and that
appropriate training or accommodation is arranged. It is Shire’ s policy
that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons
should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees and
that reasonable accommodation is made wherever possible.
The Directors are committed to ensuring the health, safety and welfare
of Shire’s employees at work. Accordingly, it is Shire’s policy to manage
its activities so as to avoid causing any unnecessary or unacceptable
risk to employees and those who may be affected by the Group’s
business. In addition, Shire takes its corporate responsibilities seriously,
and maintains an active Responsibility coordination Team as well 
as a global environmental health and safety team devoted to promoting
employee safety at and outside work.
Payment of creditors
It is Shire’ s policy to agree payment terms with all its suppliers, making
sure the supplier is aware of those terms, and to abide by them. 
As at December 31 , 2011 the Group trade creditors’ days outstanding
based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the
year were:
                                                                                                      2011                    2010
                                                                                                     Days                    Days
Group                                                                         29                  29
The Company is non-trading and accordingly has no trade creditors.

Directors’ report
Financial instruments
Details of Shire’s use of financial instruments can be found in the
Financial review on pages 40 and 41 and in Note 21 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Audit information
The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware 
and that they have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware of that
information.
Significant agreements 
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the
counterparties to exercise the following rights in the event of a change
of control of the Company:
� under the $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bonds (due 2014) issued
by the Company pursuant to a trust deed dated May 9, 2007 
and a supplemental trust deed dated April 15, 2008, upon a change 
of control Bondholders will, for 60 days after receiving notice of 
the change of control, be able to exercise their right to convert their
bonds into Ordinary Shares in the Company at a more advantageous
price than normal, as specified in the terms and conditions of the
bonds, unless the change of control is effected by a Scheme of
Arrangement which results in the interposition of a new holding
company between the Company’s shareholders and the Company,
and certain other conditions are met (an “Exempt Scheme”). 
With respect to an offer or a scheme to acquire all or most of 
the Ordinary Shares in the Company, further requirements are 
also imposed on the Company, including a requirement to 
notify Bondholders of the offer or scheme and to use reasonable
endeavors to procure the making of an equivalent offer to
Bondholders, unless the scheme is an Exempt Scheme. For these
purposes, a change of control is defined as the acquisition, pursuant
to an offer or a scheme, by a party of the ability to control more 
than half the votes at a general meeting of the Company; and
� under the $1,200 million credit facility agreement dated November
23, 2010 between, amongst others, the Company and a number 
of its subsidiaries, Barclays Bank plc (as the facility agent) and the
banks and financial institutions named therein as lenders, upon a
change of control any lender may, following not less than 30 days’
notice, cancel its commitments and require prepayment of its
participation in any outstanding loans. For these purposes, a change
of control occurs if any person or group of persons acting in concert
gains the ability to control more than half the votes at a general
meeting of the Company or holds more than half the equity share
capital of the Company. A waiver of the mandatory prepayment
provision would require the consent of each lender under the
agreement. As at February 23, 2012, no amounts are outstanding
under the credit facility agreement.
Additional information for shareholders
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the Ordinary Shares are set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”). The
Articles may only be changed by special resolution of the members 
of the Company.
Issue of shares
Subject to applicable statutes and subject to and without prejudice 
to any rights attached to existing shares, shares may be issued with
such rights and restrictions as the Company may by special resolution
decide or, if no such resolution has been passed or so far as the
resolution does not make specific provision, as the Board may decide.
Subject to the Articles, the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended
(the “Companies Act”) and other shareholders’ rights, unissued shares
are at the disposal of the Board.
Voting
It is the Company’s practice to hold a poll on every resolution at 
annual and extraordinary general meetings. Every member present 
in person or by proxy has, upon a poll, one vote for every share held 
by him. In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior 
who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted 
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and, for this
purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.
As at December 31, 2011 the Shire Employee Benefit Trust held 1.92%
of the issued share capital of the Company on trust for the benefit of
participants of the Company’s employee share plans. The voting rights
in relation to these shares are exercised by the Trustee. The Trustee
may vote or abstain from voting in any way it thinks fit and in doing so
may take into account both financial and non financial interests of the
beneficiaries of the Trust or their dependants. Historically the Trustee
has not exercised its right to vote.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the Board otherwise decides, be entitled
to attend or vote at any general or class meeting in respect of any
shares held if any call or other sum payable by him remains unpaid.
Also, a member may not be entitled to attend or vote if served with 
a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles).
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of securities that may result in restrictions on voting rights.
The Company maintains an American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”)
program in the US. Each American Depositary Share (“ADS”)
represents three Ordinary Shares. An ADS is evidenced by an ADR
issued by Citibank, N.A. as depositary, and is listed on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market. Each ADS holder is entitled to the financial 
rights attaching to such shares although the ADR Depositary is the
registered holder of the shares.

Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company 
may by ordinary resolution from time to time, declare dividends not
exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. Subject to the
Companies Act, the Board may pay interim dividends, and also any
fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial position of the Company, 
in the opinion of the Board, justifies its payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends 
or other monies payable in respect of the shares from a person with 
a 0.25% interest (as defined in the Articles) if such person has been
served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after failure 
to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those
shares required to be provided under the Articles.
Shire has put in place income access share arrangements which
enable shareholders to elect to receive their dividends from a Shire
Group company resident for tax purposes in the UK. A shareholder 
who holds 25,000 or fewer shares at the first dividend record date after
first becoming a shareholder will be deemed to have made an Income
Access Share (“IAS”) Election such that dividends will be paid from 
a UK tax resident company, unless the shareholder notifies the
Company in writing to the contrary. Pursuant to the Articles, where any
dividend is paid by the Company, an amount is paid to the IAS Trustee
representing the dividend entitlement of persons who have elected to
receive dividends from a UK resident company and such amount is
paid by the IAS Trustee to shareholders who have made or are deemed
to have made an IAS Election. The dividend which would otherwise 
be payable by Shire to such shareholders will be reduced by an
amount equal to the amount paid to such shareholders by the IAS
Trustee. If the dividend paid on the IAS and on-paid by the IAS Trustee
to shareholders is less than the total amount of the dividend
announced or declared by Shire on its Ordinary Shares, Shire will be
obliged to pay a dividend on its Ordinary Shares equivalent to the
amount of the shortfall. The income access share arrangements may
be suspended or terminated at any time and for any reason 
by the Company, without financial recompense to shareholders.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act, rights attached to any class of shares
may be varied with written consent of the holders of not less than two
thirds in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (calculated
excluding any shares held as treasury stock) or with the sanction of a
special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of those
shares. At each such separate general meeting, except an adjourned
meeting, the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing 
by proxy not less than one third in nominal value of the issued shares 
of that class (calculated excluding any shares held as treasury stock).
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company,
except: (i) that certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by
laws and regulations (for example insider trading laws); and (ii) pursuant
to the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Services Authority whereby
certain employees of the Company require the approval of the
Company to deal in the Company’s Ordinary Shares. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities.
Powers of the Directors 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Articles and
directions given by the Company in general meeting by special
resolution, the business of the Company is managed by the Board
which may exercise all the powers of the Company whether relating to
the management of the business of the Company or not. In particular,
the Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow
money and to mortgage or charge all or any part of the undertaking,
property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital of the
Company and, subject to the Companies Act, to issue debentures 
and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security, for a
debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of a third party.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution 
or by the Board. Non-Executive Directors are appointed ordinarily for 
a term of two years, subject to shareholder approval. Non-Executive
Directors who have served on the Board for nine years or more are
appointed for one year terms. Re-appointment of Non-Executive
Directors following the expiry of their term of appointment is subject 
to Board approval. The Board may from time to time appoint one 
or more Directors to hold any executive office for such period and 
on such terms as it may determine and may also revoke or terminate
any such appointment.
The Articles provide that at each AGM all those Directors who have
been appointed by the Board since the last AGM, or who held office 
at the time of the two preceding AGMs and who did not retire at either
of them, or who has held office with the Company, other than executive
office, for a continuous period of nine years or more at the date of the
meeting, shall retire from office and may offer himself for re-election 
by the members. However, in accordance with the UK Corporate
Governance Code, all Directors will be subject to annual re-election.

Corporate governance report
Dear Shareholder
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance
which I believe to be central to how the Board, its committees 
and its business function. A sound governance structure engenders 
a successful company.
The Board is responsible for key areas such as strategy, risk
management and succession planning. 
Each year the Board spends time reviewing the Company’s strategy
with management to ensure that the Company continues to focus 
on growing the business for the long-term, given the changing
dynamics of the external environment. Strategy is reviewed on an
ongoing basis by the Board and one Board meeting is dedicated 
to this area.
The business we are in is an inherently risky business and the Board 
is focused on ensuring that the management of risk is carefully
managed by employees. The Board recognizes that the culture of the
Company is key to how risk is managed and that the Board and senior
management has an important leadership role in promoting a culture 
of measured risk taking and ensuring that robust internal controls are 
in place. The Company’s Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee reviews
the material risks to the business twice yearly and specific risks more
frequently, as needed. The Board reviews material risks once a year,
and specific risks more frequently, as needed. 
Over the last few years the Board has been focused on gaining 
greater visibility of executive talent and management succession. 
This is managed in various ways including providing opportunities 
for executive talent to present to Board members, visits by Board
members to key sites, and enabling less formal interactions such 
as at dinners and receptions.
As Chairman, it is my role to lead the Board and to ensure its
effectiveness. It is important in this regard that the composition of 
the Board comprises a diverse mix of skills, experiences, background
and gender to ensure that it is best able to serve the interests of 
the Company, its shareholders and other stakeholders. Recognizing 
the importance of this, the Board recently formalized its approach 
by the adoption of a diversity policy on this basis. Any appointment 
to the Board will be considered against this policy and these
considerations will be taken into account when reviewing the
performance effectiveness of the Board. The value of diversity 
is mirrored throughout the Company with similar policies in place 
for employee recruitment. 
Consistent with this approach to diversity, Board members who have
joined Shire’s Board in the last two years bring with them expertise 
in varied areas including science, mergers and acquisitions, finance,
international pharmaceuticals and remuneration, which complement
the skill sets and backgrounds and gender of an already highly skilled
and experienced Board. 
The Board has reviewed its approach to the re-election of directors 
and has agreed that with effect from the 2012 AGM, each Board
member should stand for annual re-election.
A comprehensive Board and Committee performance evaluation 
was undertaken internally in 2011, which included one-to-one meetings
which I held with each of the Directors. A fuller disclosure of the
evaluation process can be found on page 50 of this report. The Board
has agreed that the 2012 performance evaluation will be externally
facilitated, which is three years after the last external evaluation. 
Shire values its ongoing dialogue with institutional shareholders through
a series of meetings which are attended by various Board members
and senior management. The Board is updated regularly by the 
CEO and CFO on shareholder views on a broad range of issues.
As Chairman, I am reassured by the commitment of the Board 
and all the individuals who work at Shire, to continue to achieve
exceptional results for our shareholders within a framework that
promotes good governance.

Governance
c Annual Report 2011
The following report outlines how Shire has applied the main principles
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the UK
Financial Reporting Council in June 2010 (the “Governance Code”).
Compliance statement
For the year to December 31, 2011 the Company has, in the Directors’
opinion, complied fully with the provisions set out in the Governance
Code.
Leadership
Role of the Board
The Board which is collectively responsible for the long-term success 
of the Company currently comprises two Executive and seven 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman. 
The Board is responsible for the overall management of the Company.
The Board has formally reserved certain matters for its determination
and approval including the Company’s strategic direction, risk profile,
sound system of internal controls, annual budget, periodic financial
reports, overall governance, material transactions and succession
planning. The full list of these matters, known as the Board’s Reserve
Powers, is disclosed on the Company’s website, www.shire.com 
The Board discharges its responsibilities through regularly scheduled
meetings and ad hoc meetings, as may be required. The Board meets
in person at least five times a year. 
The Board and its Committees monitor and evaluate the performance
of the Group as a whole, through engaging with the Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, members of the Leadership Team and
other members of senior management.
The Non-Executive Directors are responsible for exercising
independent judgment in Board deliberations and for scrutinizing and
challenging the actions of senior management. The Executive Directors
are responsible for day-to-day business operations.
At each Board meeting, the Chairman of each Board Committee
informs the Board of key matters discussed and agreed at the
preceding Committee meeting. Matters not formally reserved to the
Board are delegated to the Leadership Team, which is chaired by 
the Chief Executive.
Role and responsibilities of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman,
Senior Independent Director, and Chief Executive Officer
Chairman 
The Board is chaired by Matthew Emmens. The Chairman is
responsible for the leadership of the Board which includes ensuring
that Board discussions are conducted in a way which promotes 
open discussion between Directors such that no individual Director 
or small group of Directors dominates proceedings. The Chairman is
available to meet with shareholders on any matter which is important 
to such shareholder.
Deputy Chairman
David Kappler, as Deputy Chairman, provides support and guidance 
to the Chairman and deputizes for the Chairman as required.
Senior Independent Director
As Senior Independent Director, David Kappler acts as a sounding
board for the Chairman and is available as an intermediary for the 
other Directors if necessary. The Senior Independent Director is also
responsible for chairing meetings of the Non-Executive Directors
without the Chairman and Executive Directors present and in leading
the Non-Executive Directors in evaluating annually the performance 
of the Chairman. 
Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer, Angus Russell, has the overall responsibility
for running the business on a day-to-day basis and he chairs meetings
of the Leadership Team.
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman,
Senior Independent Director, and the Chief Executive Officer are clearly
defined, separate and have been approved by the Board. More details
can be found on Shire’s website.
Board effectiveness
Composition of the Board
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the structure, size and
composition (including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity)
of the Board and its Committees to ensure that they are well balanced
to meet their respective responsibilities and makes recommendations
to the Board with regard to any change. 
The Board is of the opinion that each of its members has the skills,
knowledge, aptitude and experience to perform the functions required
of a Director of a listed company.
Biographical details of the members of the Board who served 
during the year and up to the date of this report are shown on pages
42 and 43.
The Board considers William Burns, Dr. David Ginsburg, David Kappler,
Susan Kilsby, Anne Minto and David Stout to be Independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Board views each of these Non-Executive
Directors to be independent of management, independent in judgment
and character and free from any business or other relationship which
could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgment. The Board also considered Dr. Jeffrey Leiden and Patrick
Langlois to have been Independent Non-Executive Directors while
members of the Board. The Board’s Chairman Matthew Emmens 
is not considered to be an Independent Non-Executive Director.
At the time of Dr. Leiden stepping down from the Board, Mr. Emmens
and Dr. Leiden were both directors of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.; 
Mr. Emmens in an executive capacity and Dr. Leiden as a Non-
Executive Director. When re-appointing Dr. Leiden in December 2010,
the Board concluded in its opinion that Dr. Leiden remained
independent in judgment and character, his commitment to the Group
was undiminished and his performance continued to be effective. 
Appointment and re-election of Directors 
The Nomination Committee report on page 70 provides information
about the appointment process for new Directors.
The Board may appoint any person to be a Director either to fill 
a vacancy or as an addition to the existing Board. Any Director 
so appointed must retire and offer himself or herself for election 
at the next AGM, following appointment.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board ordinarily 
for a term of two years, subject to re-appointment by the Board. 
The Board has considered and agreed that with effect from the 2012
AGM, Directors will be subject to annual re-election by shareholders. 
Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors receive a customized
detailed induction program which takes account of their particular
experience and backgrounds. This program includes meetings with
senior management from the Businesses and corporate functions.
The terms of appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors 
and the service contracts of the Executive Directors are made available
for inspection at the Company’s AGM.

Corporate governance report
Time commitment
All Non-Executive Directors are required to allocate sufficient time 
to discharge their responsibilities effectively. In addition to their work 
in relation to scheduled meetings of the Board, any Board Committee
and the AGM, the Non-Executive Directors commit time for meetings
with senior management, site meetings and to participate in additional
Board and Committee meetings as the business of the Company may
require from time to time. 
Prior to taking up a new role in another organization, Non-Executive
Directors are required to first discuss the opportunity with the
Chairman. This is to ensure that acceptance of the new role does 
not result in a conflict of interest or that the Non-Executive Director 
is unable to give sufficient time to Shire’s business.
Board performance evaluation 
The Board agreed that the 2011 Board performance effectiveness
review would be managed internally. A detailed questionnaire was
circulated to all Board members by the Company Secretary which
focused on assessing various matters including if the Board is spending
adequate time on key areas of responsibility, if the information being
provided to the Board is of the right caliber, if the Board has appropriate
access to senior management and outside advisors, if the Board’ s
culture promotes active engagement and constructive challenge 
from all members, if the Chairman demonstrates effective leadership, 
if Board members are well prepared and, if there are any suggestions 
to enhance effectiveness and performance. The responses were
aggregated by the Company Secretary and were circulated on a 
non-attributable basis to all the Board. The Chairman had one-to-one
discussions with each Board member. Following those discussions 
and the circulation of the outputs of the questionnaire, the Board met 
to review the feedback. The Board agreed ways to enhance the
operation of the Board including the level of detail provided in feedback
from Board Committees and that with the Business expanding and
growing geographically, it would be helpful to hold meetings with Board
members in additional key sites to enable the Board to engage with
talent at those sites. In addition to this process, the Senior Independent
Director spoke with each Board member, other than the Chairman, 
to assess the Board’ s views as to the effectiveness of the Chairman.
This feedback was shared at a meeting of the Non-Executive Directors,
excluding the Chairman, chaired by the Senior Independent Director.
Information and support
The Executive Directors and the Company Secretary are responsible
for ensuring that detailed information is provided to Board members in
advance of any scheduled or ad hoc Board meeting. Before decisions
are made, consideration is given to the adequacy of information
available to the Board and, if necessary, decisions are deferred if further
information is required.
Board members receive detailed information from the Executive
Directors, the Company Secretary, members of the Leadership 
Team and other senior managers to enable them to discharge their
responsibilities effectively. All Directors have access to employees 
in the Company and to the advice and guidance of the Company
Secretary and are encouraged to seek independent advice at the
Group’s expense, where they feel it is appropriate. 
Committees of the Board
The Board has established the Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee,
the Remuneration Committee, the Nomination Committee and the
Science & Technology Committee (together “the Committees”). Each
Committee has written terms of reference which have been approved
by the Board, and are available on Shire’s website www.shire.com.
Details of each Committee are set out below.
Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee
The Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee (the “ACR Committee”) has
been established for the purpose of overseeing the accounting and

internal control framework. The ACR Committee met on five occasions
in 2011. The members of the ACR Committee are all Independent Non-
Executive Directors. For further information about the ACR Committee,
its membership and activities for the year ended December 31, 2011,

and overseeing the implementation of the Group’s compensation 
and benefits policy. The remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by 
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the
members of the Leadership Team, other than the Executive Directors,
is determined by the Chief Executive Officer following discussion with
the Remuneration Committee. The members of the Remuneration
Committee are all Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee met on five occasions in 2011.

Leadership Team
The Board has delegated the day-to-day management of Shire to the
Leadership Team, which operates within clear and formal parameters.
The Leadership Team reports to and seeks guidance from the Board
on a regular basis and normally meets once a month to deliberate 
on major business issues. It also considers those matters that are of 
a size and significance as to require referral to the Board before such
matters are referred to the Board for final consideration and decision.

Directors’ remuneration
The Group’s remuneration policy is described in the Directors’
remuneration report on pages 55 to 69. The report details the
Directors’ remuneration and the basis upon which executive
remuneration is determined.
Relations with shareholders
The Group is committed to maintaining constructive relationships 
with shareholders. 
The Group announces its financial results quarterly. The Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer gave presentations on the quarterly
results by teleconference for institutional investors and analysts. As the
Company has securities listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market 
in the US, Shire also files quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and an
Annual Report on Form 10-K with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”).
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, supported
by other senior executives, also attended individual and Group
meetings with major shareholders throughout the year to discuss 
the Group’s strategy and performance and to understand the views 
of major shareholders, which are then communicated to the Board 
as a whole. The Chairman and the Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director are available also to meet with major shareholders.
Shire’s website at www.shire.com provides information about the
Group and its business and is regularly updated. The Group’s Investor
Relations department acts as a contact point for investors throughout
the year.
At the Company’ s AGM shareholders were given the opportunity to ask
questions of the Directors. The Directors also made themselves available
informally after the meeting to answer questions from shareholders.
Shire’s approach to Responsibility
Shire strives to ensure it delivers value to healthcare systems and 
to society. It is therefore critical that Responsibility is at the heart of
Shire’s business in order that we continue to build and maintain trust
with our many stakeholders (patients, physicians, policymakers,
payors, investors, employees and others) as well as in the communities
in which we operate. Shire therefore attaches great importance to
ethical business practices and to societal and environmental issues.
Accordingly, ultimate responsibility for them is taken at the highest
levels. The Board has reviewed Shire’s overall approach to
Responsibility. The Board also periodically reviews the specific business
risks related to Responsibility matters, as part of the overall risk
management review process.
During 2011, Shire continued to further advance its Responsibility
strategy by focusing on core areas that support the delivery of our
business goals. The Responsibility coordination Team, chaired by the
General Counsel, comprises senior employees who act as sponsors
for responsibility focus areas such as access to medicines, public
policy, and public/patient education on the conditions and diseases
relevant to our business. Team members’ expertise spans the areas 
of health and safety, supply chain, R&D, marketing, environment,
community and drug safety. The Responsibility coordination Team
meets at least four times a year and is responsible for working with
employees across the business to ensure that Responsibility is
understood by all employees and is embedded in the way Shire
conducts its business and seeks to deliver on its goals. Responsibility
risks are managed within the overall framework of risk management,
explained below under the heading “internal control”.

Corporate governance report
Further information about Shire’s Responsibility focus areas and 
regular news about Responsibility-related achievements, can 
be obtained from the area dedicated to Responsibility on Shire’s
website at www.shire.com/cr.
Code of Ethics
The Group is committed to the maintenance of high ethical standards.
The Group’s Code of Ethics applies to all Directors and employees 
and is available for review on Shire’s website.
Financial reporting and disclosure, internal control and the role 
of the auditors 
The Board has, through the ACR Committee, established formal and
transparent arrangements for financial reporting, external auditing and
the review of the internal control environment, including compliance
and other risk issues. The ACR Committee’s terms of reference extend
to the Group’s compliance and risk management activities as a whole
and not just the financial aspects of internal control.
The ACR Committee has access, as it may require, to the Group’s
internal and external auditors throughout the year, in addition to
presentations from both on a quarterly basis. Any significant findings 
or identified risks are closely examined and are reported by the ACR
Committee Chairman to the Board with recommendations for action.
All employees can, via an independently managed Global Compliance
Helpline, raise any concerns in any of these areas and any other area,
anonymously if they wish, to the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer in
the strictest confidence without fear of retaliation. Periodically, the Chief
Compliance and Risk Officer provides the ACR Committee with a
summary of concerns raised through the Global Compliance Helpline,
and to the extent required, any specific significant concerns raised
including the result of any follow up investigation. 
Financial reporting and disclosure 
The Board, with the assistance of the ACR Committee, has ultimate
responsibility for the preparation of accounts and for the monitoring 
of systems of internal control. The Board strives to present a balanced
assessment of the Group’s financial position and prospects and it
endeavors to present all financial, scientific and other information 
so as to be comprehensible to investors. The Group publishes quarterly
financial reports so that its shareholders can monitor the Group’s
financial position regularly.
In addition the Group has established a Disclosure Committee, which
is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. Its membership includes
executives and senior managers from the businesses and from the
legal, finance, compliance and risk functions. Its responsibilities include
ensuring that all material information is disclosed to investors in the
Group’s periodic financial reports and that such information is
recorded, summarized and reported accurately.
Following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 in the US, 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are required 
to complete formal certifications, which confirm, inter alia, that:
� the Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”) in the US does
not contain any material misstatements or omissions; 
� financial information reported in the Form 10-K fairly presents the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Group; 
� the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are
responsible for determining and maintaining disclosure controls 
and procedures for the purposes of financial reporting in the US; 
� the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
evaluated the effectiveness of those disclosure controls and
procedures; 
� the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
indicated in the Form 10-K whether there were any significant
changes in the Group’s internal control over financial reporting; and 
� based on the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
which are reasonably likely to affect adversely the Group’s ability 
to record, process and report financial information included in the
Form 10-K have been disclosed to the Group’s external auditor. 
The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
completed these certifications and they have been filed with the 
SEC in the US as part of the Group’s Annual Report as at December
31, 2011 on Form 10-K.
Risk management, compliance and internal control 
The Board, in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance on internal
control, recognizes its overall responsibility to maintain sound risk
management and internal control systems to safeguard shareholders’
investments and the Group’s assets and to regularly review the
effectiveness of such systems. While the Board acknowledges its
responsibility for the systems of risk management and internal control,
such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate all risk.
Accordingly even the most effective systems of risk management 
and internal control can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In 2011, the Board reviewed both the key risks faced by the Group 
and the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal
control systems. Aside from these reviews, the Board delegates
responsibility to the ACR Committee for more regular review of both
key risks and internal controls and for monitoring the activities of the
internal audit function. The ACR Committee has kept these areas 
under regular review during 2011.
The Group has risk management, compliance, internal audit functions
and other corporate and business assurance functions. The Chief
Compliance and Risk Officer and the Head of Internal Audit report 
to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, 
but each has direct and regular access to the Chairman of the Group,
the Chairman of the ACR Committee and the other members of that
Committee. They also both attend and regularly present at ACR
Committee meetings.
The Group’s risk management, compliance and assurance strategy 
is based on a risk and control framework containing the following 
key elements:
� an effective control environment;
� an effective process to identify, assess and manage risks;
� effective internal control procedures; and
� effective internal audit.

Governance
Effective control environment
The key elements of the Group’s control environment are as follows: 
� the Board has overall responsibility to maintain the risk management
and internal control systems and has delegated certain responsibilities
to the Leadership Team and/or the ACR Committee; 
� a framework of corporate values and a Code of Ethics which sets
appropriate standards of ethical behavior are operational throughout
the Group; 
� the internal structure of the organization is well documented with
clear reporting lines and clear limits of authority for different matters; 
� a range of corporate policies, procedures and training have been
implemented; 
� the internal audit department, overseen by the Head of Internal
Audit, carries out regular reviews of internal controls and reports
findings to management and the ACR Committee;
� the Company also maintains other corporate and business
assurance functions in the areas of Environment, Health and Safety,
Research and Development, and Manufacturing/Supply chain.
These functions also carry out regular reviews of internal controls
and report findings to management; and
� the ACR Committee considers the major findings of any internal
investigations and management’s response to them. The ACR
Committee reports annually to the Board on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s control environment. 
Effective identification, assessment and management of risks 
Management of business risk is essential for ensuring that the Group
creates and preserves shareholder value. Accordingly, the Group 
has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks that it faces. This process has been in operation
throughout the period under review and up to the date of signing 
the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Risk Council which is supported by the Global Compliance and
Risk Management Department (“GCRM”) oversees the management
and mitigation of the principal risks faced by the Group. The Risk
Council comprises a number of cross-functional senior managers
charged with overseeing the risk management process and activities 
of the Group. Chaired by the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, the
membership includes senior employees of the businesses, plus the
Head of Internal Audit. Each business unit and corporate function 
must periodically review the significant risks facing their businesses.
The functions are provided with a framework for use in their review. 
This review includes identifying operational risks, compliance risks 
and risks to the achievement of goals and objectives. That review
occurs twice annually and material risks are recorded on a corporate
risk schedule for review and assessment of the risks and mitigation
plans. Identification of a manager with responsibility for management 
of any given risk is required. 
The Chief Compliance and Risk Officer provides the risk schedule 
to the Leadership Team for review and validation. The risk schedule 
is then provided twice yearly to the ACR Committee, and annually 
to the Board.
The Risk Council is assisted by the GCRM, which is responsible 
for supporting the development and implementation of practices 
that facilitate employees’ compliance with laws and Group policy. 
The GCRM provides assistance to help employees meet high 
ethical standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
The principal focus of Shire’s compliance effort is to prevent and detect
misconduct or non-compliance with law or regulations through the
promotion of ethical behavior through policy development, appropriate
training, and monitoring or audit. Shire employees are encouraged to
seek help and to report suspected cases of misconduct without fear 
of retaliation. Employees can do this through management or through
the Global Compliance Helpline. Concerns and allegations are fairly 
and independently investigated and appropriate disciplinary action 
is taken if warranted. 
The GCRM is managed by the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, 
who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief
Compliance and Risk Officer chairs the Risk Council and regularly
provides summary reports on the Risk Council and Compliance
activities to the ACR Committee. The Chief Compliance and Risk Officer
has access at all times to the Committee Chairman which provides a
mechanism for bypassing management, should the need ever arise.
Effective internal control procedures
The Group has a system of internal control procedures. Compliance
with these procedures is monitored through a system of internal review
and regular reports prepared by internal audit, the Group’s external
auditor and other corporate and business assurance functions. 
Any significant issues arising are reported to the ACR Committee. 
Effective internal audit
The internal review of the Group’s control procedures and compliance
with such procedures is mostly undertaken through internal audit. 
The ACR Committee monitors and reviews the internal audit program,
considers the findings of internal audit reviews and management’s
response to them, and ensures efficient coordination between the
Group’s internal and external auditors. The Group’s internal audit
function, comprising a mixture of internal and out-sourced resource,
was operational throughout 2011. The ACR Committee, which is
responsible for monitoring the activity of the internal audit function, has
reviewed the effectiveness of the internal audit function during 2011.
External auditing 
The ACR Committee has the primary responsibility for making 
a recommendation on the appointment, re-appointment and removal 
of the external auditor as well as for determining the remuneration of
and overseeing the work of the external auditor. The ACR Committee
assesses at least annually the objectivity and independence of the
external auditor taking into account relevant regulatory requirements.
The Committee reviews and approves the annual external audit plan
each year and ensures it is consistent with the scope of the auditor’s
engagement. In order to ensure that the independence and objectivity
of the external auditor is maintained, the Committee applies a formal
policy for the provision of non-audit services. Such services are
categorized as follows:
� services for which the external auditor are explicitly excluded; 
� services for which the external auditor can be engaged without 
prior referral to the ACR Committee; and 
� services for which pre-approval of the ACR Committee is required. 
The Committee also considers the fees paid to the external auditor 
and whether the fee levels for non-audit services, individually and 
in aggregate, relative to the audit fee are appropriate so as not to
undermine their independence.
On an annual basis, the ACR Committee assess the performance 
of the external audit firm based on pre-established critical success
factors, management’s opinion on the firm’s independence and
objectivity and other key questions requiring ACR Committee
consideration.

Corporate governance report
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
The Group’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as 
defined in Rules 13(a) to 15(f) promulgated under the US Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The Group’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the US. 
The Group’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing 
similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board, management, 
and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, material misstatements due to error may not be prevented 
or detected. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Group’s management assessed the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission.
Based on this assessment, management believes that the Group’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December
31, 2011. 
The Group’s independent auditor, Deloitte LLP , an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an auditor’s report 
on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over financial
reporting. The Auditor’s Report appears on page F-3 of the Group’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
During the year ended December 31, 2011 there were no changes in
the Group’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Group’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration
Committee’s report for 2011 for which we will be seeking approval 
from shareholders at our AGM in April 2012.
The Committee’s continued approach is to strike a balance between
remuneration that is appropriate in order to attract and retain top talent
in a competitive global market and the need for remuneration to be
performance-linked and aligned with best practice. The Committee
also believes that remuneration must be viewed in the context of the
structure and international operations of the Company, the sector in
which we are operating and against appropriate benchmarks. Shire is
relatively unique in this regard given our UK listing, global revenue
portfolio (with over 90% of our product sales coming from markets
outside of the UK) and transatlantic shareholder base. Our remuneration
policy is reviewed against this backdrop and it therefore considers pay
trends and structures in both the UK and US markets.
Context to the Committee’s decisions
In making its decisions, the Committee considers Shire’s overall
performance, including both financial and non financial results, and in
the light of long-term strategic goals. The pharmaceutical industry has
continued to face a challenging operating environment within a difficult
economic climate, against which Shire has seen another year of strong
performance. Shire’s performance during 2011 is described in detail in
the Chief Executive’s review and particular financial highlights include:
� total revenues up 23% to $4.3 billion;
� product sales up 26% to $3.9 billion;
� growth in adjusted return on invested capital (“ROIC”) of 210 basis
points over 2010;
� product sales from non-US markets grew by 25%; and
� Ordinary Share price increase of 45% and ADS price increase 
of 44% in 2011.
In addition, other key accomplishments included a high level of
employee engagement, the ongoing development of high potential
talent, continued focus on compliance, and the demonstration of value
to Shire’s stakeholders, described in further detail later in this report.
Individual performance also forms part of the Committee’s
assessment. Consistent with the approach across the organisation,
Executive Directors’ behaviour in the context of Shire’s culture is
assessed as part of the performance assessment framework, which
includes an examination of the Executive Directors’ performance 
from both a financial and non financial perspective. The resulting
performance ratings have a direct impact on all individual
compensation decisions. 
Key Committee decisions
The Committee is comfortable that our pay decisions reflect
performance but also demonstrate responsibility in pay and that
current arrangements continue to appropriately reward our high
performing management team for delivering strong, sustainable
performance and long-term shareholder value.
� 2012 salary increases for the Executive Directors below the broader
employee budget and against the backdrop of continued strong
corporate performance.
� Annual incentive awards at or around target levels (with maximum
being at 200% of target levels). For Executive Directors, 25% of their
annual incentive awards are deferred in shares for a three-year period.
� Long-term incentive awards at or below target levels. These awards
constitute a significant proportion of the overall remuneration
package and are subject to challenging performance conditions
closely aligned with the implementation of the Company’s strategy.
The quantum is consistent with both the nature of our business and
the labour markets in which we compete for talent, including the US
pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector.
� The maximum vesting of the 2009 Portfolio Share Plan awards to
Executive Directors, which were subject to total shareholder return
performance conditions, reflects our excellent upper quartile share
price performance over the last three years.
� In light of emerging best practice, both annual incentive and 
long-term incentive awards will include clawback provisions going
forward. Clawback provisions may apply at the Committee’s
discretion if it determines that results are materially misstated 
or in the event of serious misconduct.
Both the Board and the Remuneration Committee reviewed and
discussed in 2011 the link between remuneration arrangements 
and strategic goals to ensure arrangements remain fully aligned. 
The Committee will continue to monitor the current arrangements 
to ensure they remain aligned with Shire’s strategic goals.
Directors’ remuneration report
The Committee remains committed to an ongoing dialogue with
shareholders. This report, which has been prepared in accordance 
with the UK Companies Act 2006 and related regulations, is designed
to provide helpful context and explanation of the Company’s
remuneration policies and considerations that influence our decision
making. It is set out in the following key sections:

2 Remuneration Committee
3 Remuneration policy
4 Executive Directors’ remuneration package
5 Remuneration of other employees

Finally, I would like to mention that there have been some changes to

who joined the Committee in July 2011 and brings with him extensive
international experience in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition,
Patrick Langlois and Jeffrey Leiden retired from the Committee when
they stepped down from the Board in November 2011 and January
2012 respectively. On behalf of the Committee I would like to thank
both Patrick and Jeffrey for their valuable contribution to the
Committee’s work during their tenure. 
On behalf of the Board

1 KEY INFORMATION
The following key information sections set out the Company’s remuneration policy including the composition and value of the Executive Directors’ remuneration
packages in target and stretch scenarios, together with summaries of the 2011 remuneration package for the Executive Directors. There have been no significant
changes to the structure of the package in 2011. More detail is provided later in the report, as appropriate.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy includes the following guiding principles such that all remuneration arrangements are designed to be: 
� simple and understandable;
� competitive;
� strategically and culturally aligned;
� performance oriented; and
� valued by employees.
The composition and value of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages in target and stretch scenarios under this policy are set out in the charts below. These
show that the proportion of the package delivered through long-term performance is in line with the long-term nature of the business and is significantly higher in the
stretch scenario than in the target scenario. As a result, the package promotes the achievement of superior long-term performance and aligns the interests of the
Executive Directors with those of other shareholders. A brief description of each remuneration element is set out below the charts.
Base salary corresponds to 2011 salary. Pension represents 2011 employer contributions. Executive Annual Incentive Plan (“EAIP”) reflects the 2011 target award
level for the target scenario and the maximum award level for the stretch scenario. Portfolio Share Plan (“PSP”) reflects the expected value of the 2011 target award
for the target scenario and maximum vesting for the stretch scenario. Options are valued using the same Black-Scholes model that is used to determine the share-
based compensation cost included in the Company’s financial statements.

The table below sets out the remuneration outcomes for the Executive Directors in respect of 2011.

Summary of 2011 remuneration elements for Executive Directors
Fixed remuneration—base salary, pensions and other benefits
Overview and link to performance                                Strategic alignment                                     Policy and 2011 decisions
Base salary is paid in cash and is pensionable.
Individual performance and contribution to the
business influences the annual assessment of any
changes to base salary , taking account of relevant
market data.
Pension contributions of 30% of base salary for the
CEO and 25% of base salary for the CFO are made
either into Company plans and/or by way of cash
allowance.
Core benefits include a car allowance and private 
fuel, long-term disability and private medical
insurance, and personal financial planning assistance.
Short-term variable remuneration—Executive Annual Incentive Plan
Overview and link to performance                                Strategic alignment                                     Policy and 2011 decisions
The Executive Directors participate in the
Executive Annual Incentive Plan (“EAIP”), which
rewards individuals with an award based on
achievement of pre-defined, Committee-approved
corporate objectives and the individual’s
contributions toward achieving those objectives.
75% of any EAIP award is payable in cash (non-
pensionable) and 25% is deferred into shares
which vest, subject to the participant’ s
employment not being terminated for cause, 
after three years.
Corporate objectives are established in a
scorecard format with key performance measures
established within each dimension, including both
financial and non financial measures.
The Committee also considers the impact on 
the Company’s performance of strategic actions,
as well as the Company’s response to external
opportunities and events that could not have
been predicted at the beginning of the year.
Clawback arrangements will operate for awards 
in respect of 2012 onwards to cover situations 
where results are materially misstated or in the 
event of serious misconduct.
Long-term variable remuneration—Portfolio Share Plan
Overview and link to performance                                Strategic alignment                                     Policy and 2011 decisions
The Portfolio Share Plan (“PSP”) comprises stock
appreciation rights (“SAR awards”) and
performance share awards (“PSA awards”) which
vest after three years subject to the achievement
of performance conditions. SAR awards can be
exercised up to the seventh anniversary of grant.
For 2011 awards, vesting of awards require 
the achievement of Non GAAP EBITDA and
Adjusted ROIC targets within a performance
matrix. In addition, awards only vest if the
Committee determines that the underlying
performance of the Company is sufficient to 
justify the vesting of the award.
Clawback arrangements will operate 
in respect of awards made from 2012 
onwards to cover situations where results 
are materially misstated or in the event 
of serious misconduct.
Shareholding guidelines
Executive Directors are encouraged to own shares in the Company in order to ensure the alignment of their interests with those of the Company’s shareholders. 
Both Executive Directors have met the shareholding guideline level of 200% and 150% of base salary for the CEO and CFO respectively.
The provision of an internationally
competitive core package of base
salary, pension and other benefits
enables the Company to attract and
retain the executives in order to deliver
the strategy.
Base salaries are set by reference to relevant market data and 
are influenced by individual performance and contribution to the
business, the external pay environment, salary increases across 
the Company and shareholder expectations.
Following the annual review, the Committee decided to 
increase Mr. Russell’s base salary by 2.4% to $1,290,000 and 
Mr. Hetherington’ s base salary increased by 2.2% to £465,000. 
The Committee took into account a range of factors including 
market positioning, the delivery of continued strong financial
performance with significant results to shareholders in terms 
of share price growth, and the broader employee budget of 3%.
Corporate objectives are the primary
driver for EAIP decisions for the
Executive Directors. 
2011 key performance measures are
directly aligned with the strategy set 
out on page 22 of this report and
include financial performance targets,
global market share objectives and
sales growth goals.
The 2011 key performance measures
are set by the Committee both in the
context of annual performance as well
as to ensure progress towards longer-
term, strategic goals. 
Further detail on the strategy and some
of the financial and non financial key
performance measures are set out on
pages 22 and 23 of this report.
80% and 90% of base salary is payable for “target” performance for the
CFO and CEO respectively and up to 160% and 180% at maximum.
As referenced in more detail on page 60, the Company’s key
achievements for 2011 included:
� Revenues from net product sales in 2011 were up 26% 
to $3.9 billion.
� Non GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”) increased during 2011 by 27% 
to $1.5 billion.
� Product sales from ex-US markets grew by $276 million (25%) 
in 2011, and represented 35% of total product sales in 2011.
� Adjusted ROIC grew by 210 basis points in 2011 over 2010.
� Regular Board review of Leadership Team succession plans, 
the ongoing development of high potential employees and
regular review of diversity metric reports by the organization.
� In 2011 the compliance program included extensive training 
on Shire’s anti-bribery policies as well as policies and 
procedures concerning interactions with physicians.
� A continued increase in employee engagement, as measured 
by a Company-wide engagement survey.
� Demonstration of clinical and economic value to Shire’s
stakeholders including patients, physicians and payors.
In determining EAIP awards in respect of 2011 for the Executive
Directors, the Committee considered performance against each 
of the scorecard dimensions, taking into account the strategic
acquisition of Advanced BioHealing, as well as performance 
against personal objectives.
The performance measures for the
2011 awards were selected by the
Committee to provide alignment to the
core activities and strategy of the Group
as it believes that growth in Non GAAP
EBITDA and achievement of Adjusted
ROIC above the weighted average 
cost of capital are key drivers of value
creation. These measures feature
significantly in the strategic Corporate
Scorecard, as further set out on page
22 of this report, which is reviewed 
and approved by the Committee.
The combination of these two measures
in a performance matrix is designed 
to reward the Executive Directors 
for delivering balanced growth.
For the CEO the target face values continue to be 400% of base
salary for SAR awards and 300% of base salary for PSA awards,
and, for the CFO, 300% of base salary for SAR awards and 220%
of base salary for PSA awards. The Committee determines the level
of awards for the Executive Directors by reference to a range of
80% to 120% of these target values, based on performance and
consideration of appropriate benchmarks. 
For 2012 the total face value of PSP awards (including both PSA 
and SAR awards) will be 685% of base salary for the CEO and 460% 
of base salary for the CFO, which would represent the maximum
vesting level under the performance matrix being realized.

3 REMUNERATION POLICY
Guiding principles
The guiding principles of the Company’s remuneration policy are set
out below.
i Simple and understandable
� Employees understand their impact on business performance
and how they will be rewarded accordingly.
� Arrangements are practical and easily communicated.
ii Competitive
� Packages enable the Company to attract and retain employees
with the ability to deliver the strategy for the benefit of
shareholders and other key stakeholders including patients.
� Overall remuneration is both cost-effective and appropriate.
iii Strategically and culturally aligned
� Arrangements are designed to support shareholder value 
creation by the delivery of sustainable performance consistent
with the strategy and appropriate risk management.
� Behavior consistent with the Company’s Brave culture is
expected. This culture is based around the following values:
a) Act with the highest ethical standards, integrity and respect 
for others’ views and the world we live in. Always be mindful 
we work in a business where patients’ lives are at stake.
b) Have the courage of your convictions; challenge the status 
quo with a sense of urgency for great ideas and new 
solutions, because in the lives of patients and their families,
every day matters.
c) Exemplify trust and openness through collaboration 
and teamwork; recognize that being Brave is a collective
and individual endeavor; hold yourself accountable for what
you do, and what you don’t do.
iv Performance oriented
� Plans allow for differentiation based on individual performance.
� Plans are linked to performance at the corporate, business 
and individual level, as appropriate.
� Remuneration arrangements provide for an appropriate balance
between short- and long-term performance.
� The exercise of informed discretion plays an important role 
in remuneration decisions to help avoid perverse outcomes.
v Valued by employees
� Each element of the package is valued by employees and 
cost-effective. 
The guiding principles provide a framework for remuneration decisions
across the Company, including the Committee’s decisions for the
Executive Directors. When making these decisions, the Committee 
is sensitive to pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the
Company.
As set out above, the Company’s remuneration policy is designed 
to attract, retain and motivate talented executives of the high caliber
required to ensure that the Company is managed successfully 
to the long-term benefit of shareholders. To achieve this, an
internationally competitive package linked to the Company’s 
strategy and performance is provided. The package and these 
linkages are outlined in the table on page 57 .
Remuneration benchmarking
The Committee takes a responsible approach to benchmarking for 
the Executive Directors and reviews remuneration relative to company
and individual performance and to the practice of other comparable
organizations in the markets in which the Company competes for
talent. Reflecting the shape of Shire’s international operations, market
data is based on a blend of US and UK companies taking into account
scale and international complexity. UK market data is based on other
companies within the FTSE 100 index excluding financial services,
utilities and mining companies. The greater number of comparable US
companies allows further refinement of US market data to only include
companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical equipment
and medical supplies sectors.
Base salary is targeted at around median of the relevant market 
and may be positioned below or above the median depending on 
a variety of factors as described later in this report. In terms of total
remuneration, the Company’s policy is to target at around median 
of the relevant market and to allow for the achievement of higher pay
levels to recognize superior performance.
Composition and structure of pay
The remuneration package for the Executive Directors is designed 
to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable,
performance-related components, with a significant proportion 
of long-term variable pay given the long-term nature of the business.
The EAIP and PSP are considered performance-related elements,
while base salary is essentially “fixed”, although performance is
considered when determining any annual increases. 
Illustrations of the impact of the remuneration policy on the composition
and value of the CEO’s and CFO’s remuneration package in target 
and stretch scenarios are set out in the key information section on
page 56.
The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the
remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivize undue
risk taking. In light of best practice, clawback provisions will be
introduced in respect of future incentive awards to cover situations
where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious
misconduct.
Share ownership policy
The Committee believes that employee share ownership is an
important means to support long-term commitment to the Company
and the alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders.
The interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives are
closely aligned with those of other shareholders in this regard through
the operation of the Company’s long-term incentive plan and, for the
Leadership Team, the deferral of one quarter of any EAIP award into
shares for a period of three years. These remuneration elements
constitute a significant proportion of individual remuneration packages.
The CEO, CFO and other members of the Leadership Team are
encouraged to own shares in the Company equivalent to 200%, 
150% and 100% of base salary, respectively, within a five-year 
period following their appointment. All shares beneficially owned 
by an executive or deferred under the EAIP count towards achieving
these guidelines.
The Committee reviews share ownership levels annually for this group.

Value of of base ownership
shares salary guideline
Angus Russell $9,331,613 723% 200%
Graham Hetherington £1,381,369 297% 150%
The Company also operates broad-based share plans (an HMRC-
approved Sharesave scheme in the UK and an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan in the US and other countries) to encourage wider 
share ownership among the Company’s employees.
Awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and 
“all-employee” share plans are satisfied either by market purchased
shares which are held in an employee benefit trust or the issue of new
shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were
approved. These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers’
guidelines which require that no more than 10% of a company’s issued
share capital may be used for employee share plans in any ten-year
period. Within the 10% limit, up to 5% may be used for discretionary
employee share plans.
4 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION PACKAGE
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually to ensure the level remains
appropriate. The Committee’s salary decisions are informed by the
market rate for an Executive Director’s skills and experience, as well 
as a variety of other factors, including individual performance and
contribution to the business, the external pay environment, salary
increases across the Company and shareholder expectations.
Following the annual review, the Committee decided to increase 
Mr. Russell’s base salary by 2.4% to $1,290,000 and Mr. Hetherington’s
base salary increased by 2.2% to £465,000. The Committee took 
into account a range of factors including market positioning, the
delivery of continued strong financial performance with significant
results to shareholders in terms of share price growth, and the broader
employee budget of 3% (with individuals eligible to receive higher
increases depending on, for example, individual performance and
market positioning).
Base salaries for the Executive Directors are set out in the table below.
Any salary increases typically take effect on January 1, each year.
2011 2012 %
base salary base salary change
Angus Russell $1,260,000 $1,290,000 2.4%
Graham Hetherington £455,000 £465,000 2.2%
Executive Annual Incentive Plan
The Executive Directors participate in the EAIP which rewards the
achievement of pre-defined, Committee-approved corporate objectives
and the individual’s contributions toward achieving those objectives.
The Committee also considers the impact of strategic actions on the
Company’s performance, as well as the Company’s response to
external opportunities and events that could not have been predicted
at the beginning of the year.
Corporate objectives are established in a scorecard format with four
dimensions. For 2011, these were as follows: Financial (40% weighting),
Operational Excellence (20% weighting), People and Capabilities 
(20% weighting) and Customers (20% weighting). Key performance
measures are established within each dimension, with both financial
and non financial performance considered.
EAIP awards are paid in cash (75%) and Ordinary Shares or American
Depositary Shares (“ADS”) (25%). The cash element is paid in the first
quarter of the year following the performance year, and the share-
based element is deferred and released after a period of three years,
subject to the participant’s employment not being terminated for cause.
The release of deferred shares awarded from 2011 onwards include
dividend shares representing accumulated dividends in respect of the
shares under award that vest.
For 2011, the Company’s key achievements included the following:
� Revenues from net product sales in 2011 were up 26% to 
$3.9 billion driven by strong growth from the Group’s product
sales including VYVANSE (up 27% to $805 million), REPLAGAL
(up 35% to $475 million), LIALDA/MEZAVANT (up 27% to 
$372 million), INTUNIV (up 34% to $223 million), ADDERALL XR
(up 48% to $533 million) and VPRIV (up 79% to $256 million). 
� Non GAAP EBITDA increased during 2011 by 27% to $1.5 billion
as a result of higher revenues and continued operating leverage,
which allowed the Group to absorb the effects of higher
investment in our targeted R&D programs and increases in 
SG&A activities to support our recent and future growth.
� Product sales from ex-US markets grew by $276 million (25%) 
in 2011, and represented 35% of total product sales in 2011.
� Adjusted ROIC grew by 210 basis points in 2011 over 2010
primarily due to stronger operating margins and improvements 
in net asset efficiency.
� Succession plans for the Leadership Team are regularly reviewed
by the Board and this process is replicated by Executive
management throughout the organization at all management
levels. In addition, diversity metric reports are generated and
reviewed by the organization regularly.
� Shire’s compliance function conducts regular training for
employees, distributors, agents and other partners doing
business with Shire. In 2011 the compliance program included
extensive training on Shire’s anti-bribery policies as well as
policies and procedures concerning interactions with physicians.
� Shire completed a Company-wide engagement survey that
showed a continued increase in employee engagement. Survey
results showed that Shire’ s workforce is highly supportive of our
culture and mission to “enable people with life-altering conditions
to lead better lives” .
� Value has been demonstrated to Shire’s stakeholders in 2011,
with successes including:
—Increases in market share in its ADHD, GI, HGT and RM
therapeutic areas;
—Completion of patient, physician and payor surveys for certain
products that will help us continue to meet stakeholder needs;
—Demonstration of clinical value through the approval of: 
—FIRAZYR for self-administration in the EU and US;
—INTUNIV in the US as adjunctive therapy to stimulants 
for the treatment of ADHD for children and adolescents;
—LIALDA in the US and Canada for maintenance of remission 
of ulcerative colitis; and
� Development of dossiers for certain products that demonstrate
economic value to support their pricing and reimbursement.

Governance
c Annual Report 2011
In determining 2011 EAIP awards for the Executive Directors, the
Committee considered performance against each of the scorecard
dimensions, including the achievements set out above, taking 
into account the impact of the strategic acquisition of Advanced
BioHealing, as well as performance against personal objectives. 
The Committee approved an EAIP award of 90% of base salary 
(of 180% maximum) which represents 100% of target (of 200%
maximum) for Mr. Russell and an EAIP award of 85% of base 
salary (of 160% maximum) which represents 106% of target 
(of 200% maximum) for Mr. Hetherington. 
The 2012 EAIP will continue to use a scorecard approach with 
the number of key performance measures reduced and grouped 
under Financial and Non Financial dimensions. This change is 
intended to allow for greater focus on the most significant strategic
business drivers.
Key performance measures for 2012 include:
� achieving net product sales targets;
� achieving Non GAAP EBITDA targets;
� achieving Adjusted ROIC targets;
� strengthening the commercial portfolio over 2012–2015;
� expanding the development pipeline portfolio; and
� enhancing the leadership capabilities in the organization.
As in previous years, key performance measures are set by the
Committee both in the context of annual performance as well as 
to ensure progress towards longer-term, strategic goals. In addition, 
the Board as well as the Committee reviewed and discussed in 2011
the link between remuneration more widely and strategic goals to
ensure arrangements remain fully aligned.
Long-term incentives
The Company uses the Portfolio Share Plan (“PSP”) to grant long-term
incentives to motivate, reward and retain employees and to align the
interests of employees with those of the Company’s shareholders.
Annual participation in the PSP is at management discretion and is
approved by the Committee.
The PSP comprises two types of award, which can be operated
separately:
� SAR awards A Stock Appreciation Right (“SAR”) is the right to
receive Ordinary Shares or ADSs linked to the increase in value of a
specified number of Ordinary Shares or ADSs over a period between
one and seven years from the date of grant. SAR awards granted to
Executive Directors vest three years after the date of grant, subject
to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, described
below. SAR awards can be exercised up to the seventh anniversary
of the date of grant.
� PSA awards A Performance Share Award (“PSA”) is the right to
receive a specified number of Ordinary Shares or ADSs between 
one and three years from the date of grant. PSA awards granted to
Executive Directors vest three years from the date of grant, subject
to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, described
below. Upon vesting of the PSA Award, Ordinary Shares or ADSs 
will be released to the participant automatically without any action 
on the part of the participant.
The performance conditions for PSP Awards granted to Executive
Directors require the achievement of Non GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted
ROIC targets over a three-year period. These measures were selected
by the Committee to provide alignment to the core activities and
strategy of the Group as the Company believes that growth in 
Non GAAP EBITDA and achievement of Adjusted ROIC above the
weighted average cost of capital are key drivers of value creation. 
The combination of these two measures in a performance matrix 
is designed to reward the Executive Directors for delivering balanced
growth. Performance targets are set annually by the Committee 
within the context of the Company’s long-range plans and strategy.
This timing also helps ensure that executives are not incentivized
inadvertently to take inappropriate risks.
Award levels
The maximum face value of awards for any participant under the PSP
Rules, which were approved by shareholders in 2008, are 600% of
base salary for SAR awards and 400% of base salary for PSA awards. 
For the CEO the target face values continue to be 400% of base salary
for SAR awards and 300% of base salary for PSA awards, and, for the
CFO, 300% of base salary for SAR awards and 220% of base salary
for PSA awards. These targets are considered by the Committee in
expected value terms as it enables internal relativities and external
benchmarking to be more robustly taken into account. The Committee
determines the level of awards for the Executive Directors by reference
to a range of 80% to 120% of these target values, based on
performance and consideration of appropriate benchmarks. 
The expected value of PSP awards is determined by using the Black-
Scholes model (which is widely accepted and takes into account
factors such as the grant price of the award, the expected stock-based
award term, volatility of the Company’s share price, the risk-free rate
and the Company’s dividend yield) and taking into account the
probability of vesting in light of applicable performance conditions. 
The Committee adopted this expected value approach across 
the entire Company for the reasons set out above and also because 
it believes that it communicates the intrinsic value of the award
individuals receive, is less sensitive to share price fluctuations running
up to the date of grant and allows the Company to plan the cost 
of the awards, as recorded in the Company’s income statement. 
The Committee recognizes that some shareholders may be more
familiar with a face value approach and therefore has set out face
values in this report. It also confirms that the move to an expected
value approach was not used to impact remuneration levels. 
For completeness, the expected value of 2012 PSP awards are
included in the table on page 56.
2012 awards
For 2012 the face value of the SAR awards will be 391% of base salary
for the CEO and 265% of base salary for the CFO. The face value of
the PSA awards will be 294% of base salary for the CEO and 195% 
of base salary for the CFO. Consistent with the 2011 awards set out
above, these values represent maximum vesting levels and would 
be realized only if stretching and interdependent performance targets 
as provided below were met in full. In addition, awards only vest if 
the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the
Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.

Directors’ remuneration report
The Committee reviewed the performance matrix and determined 
that for 2012 the structure and performance measures will be retained
in their current form for 2012. The performance targets have been
changed to maintain appropriate alignment with the Company’s 
current long-range plans and strategy as well as the Company’s
weighted average cost of capital and broker forecasts. The resulting
2012 performance matrix is set out below.

The Committee will continue to review annually whether the
performance matrix structure and performance targets described
above remain appropriate and challenging, taking into account, for
example, economic expectations, the industry’s outlook, strategic
objectives and shareholder interests.
For the purposes of the matrix, EBITDA growth is defined as the
compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of Non GAAP EBITDA, as
derived from the Group’s Non GAAP financial results included in its full
year earnings releases, over the three year vesting period. Adjusted ROIC
(reflects the definition used by the Company in its Corporate Scorecard.
This definition aims to measure true underlying economic performance 
of the Company, by making a number of adjustments to ROIC as
derived from the Company’s Non GAAP financial results including:
� adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses,
intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease costs
incurred in the period;
� capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historic, cumulative R&D,
In-Process Research and Development (“IPR&D”), intangible asset
impairment charges and operating lease costs which previously 
have been expensed;
� deducting from Non GAAP operating income an amortization charge
for the above capitalized costs, based on the estimated commercial
lives of the relevant products;
� excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of 
non-operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-strategic
investments); and
� taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying 
Non GAAP tax rate.
The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the matrix to
reflect significant one time items which occur during the vesting period.
The Committee will make full and clear disclosure of any such
adjustments in the remuneration report, together with the ROIC
performance as determined by the above definition, at the end of the
performance period.

The same matrix was operated for 2010 PSP awards.
Vesting of the 2009 awards
The 2009 PSP awards to the Executive Directors were subject 
to a performance condition based on relative Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) measured against two comparator groups, namely
FTSE 100 constituents (excluding financial institutions) and a group 
of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector. For these
awards which vested in February 2012, the Company’s TSR was
139.6% for the three-month averaging period, which placed it eighth
among the FTSE 100 (excluding financial institutions) and third among 
its international pharmaceutical group. This resulted in a vesting 
of 100% of the award, reflecting the strong share price performance 
of the Company over the period.
Vesting of the 2008 awards
As previously disclosed, for the 2008 PSP awards to Executive
Directors which vested in February 2011 and was subject to a similar
TSR performance condition, the Company’s TSR was 31.7% for 
the three-month averaging period, which placed it 20th among the 
FTSE 100 (excluding financial institutions) and fifth among its peer
group. This resulted in a vesting of 88% of the award.
Other outstanding long-term awards
The interests of each Director under the PSP and EAIP are set out 
on page 67 and under other long-term plans on page 68. 
Pensions and other benefits
The Company’s policy is to ensure that pension benefits are
competitive in the markets in which it operates.
Mr. Russell participates in the 401(k) Plan and the Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) in the US. The SERP is an
unfunded defined contribution scheme; the benefits are payable to
certain senior US employees as lump sums on leaving the Company’s
employment or in the event of death or disability. The amount of 
benefit is based on the value of notional contributions adjusted for
“earned” investment returns as if they were invested in investments 
of the employee’s choice. The Company contributes a total of 30% 
of Mr. Russell’s annual salary to these plans.

Governance
c Annual Report 2011
Mr. Hetherington participates in a UK HMRC registered defined
contribution plan, which the Company operates for UK employees. 
Mr. Hetherington receives a total contribution of 25% of annual salary
to a combination of this plan and/or by way of a cash allowance at his
election. This choice was put in place in 2011 in light of changes to the
taxation of members of UK registered pension plans from April 6, 2011.
In addition to pension benefits, the Executive Directors receive certain
benefits, principally a car allowance and private fuel, private medical
insurance, long-term disability insurance and personal financial
planning assistance. Executive Directors are also eligible to participate
in the Company’s UK HMRC-approved Sharesave scheme and 
the US ESPP , depending on their location, on the same basis 
as other eligible employees. These benefits are not pensionable.
Mr. Russell was no longer eligible to participate in the Sharesave
Scheme following his transfer to the US. As previously disclosed, the
Committee approved a cash payment for Mr. Russell, made in 2011,
equivalent to the amount of gain that he would have made had
he been permitted to remain in the scheme for the full five years. 
5 REMUNERATION OF OTHER EMPLOYEES
The remuneration policy applies the same overarching guiding
principles to all employees, including other members of the Leadership
Team. The exact structure and quantum of individual remuneration
packages varies by business, geography, role and level of responsibility
within the Company. In general, the proportion of variable remuneration
in the total remuneration package increases with level of responsibility
within the Company.
All employees’ base salaries are benchmarked against the appropriate
market and, in light of similar factors, as described for the Executive
Directors Retirement and other benefit arrangements are provided 
to employees with appropriate consideration of market practice and
geographical differences.
The aggregate level of annual incentive funding is determined by
reference to the same Corporate Scorecard as described for the
Executive Directors. This scorecard is cascaded to each business 
and corporate function to ensure alignment with corporate goals.
Scorecard targets are further cascaded to each employee through 
their performance objectives, with annual incentive awards strongly
differentiated based on individual performance through linkages with
the performance management system. Members of the Leadership
Team must defer a proportion of their annual incentive (one quarter 
of any EAIP award) into shares for a three-year period.
Discretionary annual equity awards are dependent on an employee’s
level of responsibility within the Company and individual performance.
Phased vesting occurs over a period of three years with the majority
vesting at the end of the three-year period, except for the Leadership
Team where all of the awards vest after a three-year period.

The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service contracts should provide for a notice period from the Company of twelve months. 
The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key individuals for the benefit 
of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of termination. Executive Directors’ contracts allow 
for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of payment in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. 
The contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, with an obligation on the individual to mitigate loss.
It is the Company’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the
event of gross misconduct. The Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual
circumstances including the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
Details of the Executive Directors’ contract terms are set out in the table below.
                                                                 Contract date                       Notice period           Potential compensation on termination

Remuneration for Directors on the US payroll is reported in US dollars.
1 Other benefits include car allowance and private fuel, personal financial planning assistance, long-term disability and private medical insurance.
2 As set out earlier in this report, Mr. Russell was no longer eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme following his transfer to the US. As previously disclosed, 
the Committee approved a cash payment for Mr. Russell, made in 2011, equivalent to the amount of gain that he would have made had he been permitted to remain 
in the plan for the full five years. The value of the payment was $77 ,256.39 and is in addition to the figures in the table above.
3 In 2010 Mr. Russell received a cash payment in lieu of a pension contribution of £17 ,050 (equal to $26,324 based on an exchange rate at the time of payment) which 
is included in his 2010 pension contribution.
4 The other benefits received by Mr. Russell and Mr. Hetherington in 2010 have been restated to include payments in relation to private fuel and, for Mr. Russell, in relation 
to personal financial planning assistance and long-term disability insurance, which should have been disclosed in 2010.
5 Mr. Hetherington’s pension contribution of 25% of base salary is made through a combination of payments into a Company defined contribution plan and a cash allowance.

Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ interests under current long-term plans continued
(1) Awards are over Ordinary Shares, except where the award type is marked as an ADS award. One ADS is equal to three Ordinary Shares.
(2) The maximum SAR and PSA awards are granted and, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, adjusted at the date of vesting.
(3) Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSA awards granted in 2010 and 2011 are Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA. Further information can be found 
on page 62.
(4) In accordance with the plan rules, the vested PSA awards have been increased to reflect the dividends paid by Shire in the period from the grant date to the vesting date.
(5) The exercise price for SAR awards granted in 2011 is equal to the three day average up to and including the date of award, of the closing mid-market price. The exercise
price for SAR awards granted prior to 2011 is the mid-market closing price on the date of award.
(6) Mr. Emmens’ awards were granted to him while he held the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
(7) The percentage of the awards granted in 2008 that vested, based on the performance conditions, was 88%. The remainder of these awards are shown in the table above 
as lapsed. The percentage of the awards granted in 2009 that vested, based on the performance conditions, was 100%. 
The 2008 and 2009 awards include a market condition based on relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measured against two comparator groups. In determining the
vesting percentage of a SAR award or PSA award granted to Executive Directors, 33% weighting depended upon the Company’s TSR performance relative to the
performance of FTSE 100 constituents, excluding financial institutions, and 67% weighting depended upon the Company’s TSR performance relative to the performance 
of a group of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector. Vesting was determined as follows:
% vesting TSR performance level achieved
0% vesting TSR performance below the median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 (excluding financial institutions).
33% vesting TSR performance at median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 (excluding financial institutions).
100% vesting TSR performance at or above upper quartile performance versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 (excluding financial institutions).
TSR performance between median and upper quartile versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100, excluding financial institutions, is calculated from 33% to 100%
on a straight-line basis.
The comparator group set at the time of award for the 2008 awards was Allergan, Inc., Atlana Aktiengesellschaft, Biovail Corporation, Cephalon Inc., Forest Laboratories Inc.,
King Pharmaceuticals Inc., KOS Pharmaceuticals Inc., H. Lundbeck A/S, Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, Novo Nordisk A/S, Schering AG, Sepracor Inc., 
Merck Serono S.A., UCB S.A., Valeant Pharmeuticals International Inc. and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The comparator group set at the time of award for the 2009 awards was Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Amgen Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., 
Biovail Corporation, Celgene Corporation, Cephalon Inc., Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Forest Laboratories Inc., Genzyme Corporation, Gilead Sciences Inc., 
Ipsen Ltd, King Pharmaceuticals Inc., H. Lundbeck A/S, Novo Nordisk A/S and UCB S.A.
Where a company de-lists during the performance period, the proceeds are treated as being re-invested in an index that tracks the TSR of the remaining companies.
TSR performance was measured using an averaging period of three months. In addition, the Committee had regard to the same calculation using an averaging period 
of six months as part of a fairness review to ensure that vesting properly reflected underlying performance.
(8) As previously disclosed, the Company moved to calculating the number of PSA and SAR Awards using an approach based on the average three-day share price at the 
time of grant for the awards made in 2010 and subsequently, rather than an average share price over the prior twelve month period which had historically been applied.

of reference give it authority to investigate any activity within its terms of
reference and to be responsible for the resolution of any disagreement
between management and the external auditor regarding the Group’s
financial reporting. The Committee is also authorized to seek any
information it requires from any employee of the Group in order for the
Committee to perform its duties.
Approval of audit and non-audit services provided 
by the external auditor
The Committee has adopted a formal policy in relation to the provision
of audit and non-audit services by the external auditor. The principal
purpose of the policy is to ensure that the independence of the external
auditor is not impaired. 
The policy, which is in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002,
prohibits the provision of certain non-audit services to the Group 
by the external auditor, including:
� bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records 
or financial statements of the Group;
� design and implementation of financial information systems;
� appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-
in-kind reports;
� actuarial services or internal audit out-sourcing services;
� legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit;
� management functions or human resources services;
� broker, dealer, investment advisor or investment banking 
services; and
� any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board determines is impermissible as a non-audit service.
All audit and permissible non-audit services may be provided by 
the external auditor if the work is either specifically pre-approved 
by the Committee or if the work falls within a schedule of services 
pre-approved by the Committee in accordance with the pre-approval
policy. The Committee’s pre-approval policy covers four categories 
of work—audit services, audit-related services, taxation services 
and other non-audit related services. If the services proposed to be
provided by the external auditor fall within a category of pre-approved
services and additionally the fee for those services is below pre-
approved annual and transactional limits, such services may be
provided by the external auditor without specific, individual approval 
of those services by the Committee, provided that management 
8446 Annual Report 2011_Annual Report 2011  15/03/2012  16:12  Page 71 Shire plc Annual Repo 72 Shire plc Annual Report 2011
does not need to exercise any discretion in determining whether 
a proposed service falls within one of the pre-approved categories. 
In all cases, the Committee is notified at the next Committee meeting
of any pre-approved service that is provided by the external auditor. 
Any audit or permissible non-audit services proposed to be provided
by the external auditor which is either not a pre-approved service, 
or is a pre-approved service for which fees are above the annual or
transactional limits, must be approved in advance by the Committee,
who will consider whether the independence, skills and experience of
the external auditor make it a suitable supplier of the proposed service.
Authority has been delegated to the Chairman of the Committee,
to approve such services in situations where the Company requires 
an expeditious decision. Any decision made under such delegation 
of authority is presented to the Committee at its subsequent 
scheduled meeting.
Committee activities
The Committee met on five occasions in 2011. The members of the
Committee attended all meetings they were eligible to attend with 
the exception of Mr. Langlois who was unable to attend one meeting
due to illness. At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial
Controller, the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, the Head of Internal
Audit, the Group’s external auditor and the Chairman of the Board
attended Committee meetings.
In addition, the Committee held a number of separate private meetings
during the course of the year with respectively, the Group’s external
auditor, the Head of Internal Audit and the Chief Compliance and Risk
Officer, without any executive member of the Board or other member of
management present. The purpose of these meetings was to facilitate
open discussions between Committee members and these persons.
During 2011, the Committee’s areas of review included:
1 Financial statements
� consideration of any key accounting judgments;
� the financial disclosures contained in the Group’s 2010 full year and
2011 quarterly results announcements and related financial reports;
� various accounting matters, including but not limited to: the
application of the Group’s critical accounting policies and US GAAP
in the context of the financial statement disclosures; accounting for
the acquisition of Advanced BioHealing Inc; accounting for sales
deductions; revenue recognition for royalty income receivable from
GSK; intangible asset impairment reviews; the accounting for various
tax matters; and the application of new accounting standards;
� review of the questions raised by the SEC concerning the Group’s
2010 Form 10-K filing and the approval of Shire’s responses. 
The SEC were satisfied with Shire’s responses; and
� quarterly audit reports from the external auditor were received 
by the Committee and discussed. The reports addressed the
following key areas:
—external auditor responsibility and independence;
—significant accounting estimates and judgments made by
management; and
—significant accounting policies and one off transactions. 
2 Internal financial control and risk management systems
� semi-annual review of the Group’s corporate risk schedule which
included the consideration of the key risks faced by the Group 
and review of the Group’s plans to mitigate such risks;
� review of the Group’s annual internal audit plan, compliance with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and the effectiveness
of the Group’s system of internal controls over financial reporting;
� quarterly review of the results of the Group’s internal audit program;
� annual review of the Group Treasury Policies and recommendation 
of proposed changes to the Board;
� quarterly reports on treasury activities and a review of the Group’s
foreign exchange exposure risk management strategy;
� annual review of the Group’s tax strategy and assessment of fiscal
risk; and
� review of the Group’s arrangements for the confidential, anonymous
submission by employees of concerns regarding matters which
could have a material impact on the Group.
3 Other matters
� compliance updates, including areas relating to bribery and
corruption;
� review the renewal terms of the Group’s Insurance Programme;
� review of the Committee’s terms of reference; and
� the evaluation of the Committee’s performance.
4 External auditor
� an initial review of the external auditor’s performance and
effectiveness during 2011 and a final review of the 2011 audit 
at the February 2012 Committee meeting; 
� review of the policy on the provision of audit and non-audit 
services by the external auditor;
� approval of the 2011 Audit Plan and fees; and 
� review of the objectivity and independence of the external auditor.
The Committee has remained satisfied that neither the level of non-
audit services nor the nature of the work performed by the external
auditor has in any way impaired their objectivity and independence.
Details of the fees paid to the external auditor are disclosed in
Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.
Following the review of the external auditor’s performance as regards
the 2011 financial year, the Committee recommend to the Board 
the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external auditor. 
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP will be put to shareholders 
at the 2012 AGM. 
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible
for the engagement every five years. At the conclusion of the 2011 
year end audit Paul Franek will be replaced by James Bates as the
audit partner. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the
Company’s choice of external auditor.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures

for which the Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
(In millions of US dollars, except where indicated)
1 DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS
Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either “Shire” 
or the “Company”) is a leading specialty biopharmaceutical company
that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician. 
The Company has grown through acquisition, completing a series 
of major mergers or acquisitions that have brought therapeutic,
geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. The Company will
continue to evaluate companies, products and pipeline opportunities
that offer a good strategic fit and enhance shareholder value.
Shire’s strategic goal is to become the world’s leading specialty
biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the
specialist physician. Shire focuses its business on attention deficit and
hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), gastrointestinal (“GI”) diseases, human
genetic therapies (“HGT”) and regenerative medicine (“RM”) as well as
opportunities in other therapeutic areas to the extent they arise through
acquisitions. Shire’s in-licensing and acquisition efforts are focused 
on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property
protection and global rights. Shire believes that a carefully selected 
and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned and
relatively small-scale sales forces will deliver strong results.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Shire plc, all of its subsidiary undertakings and the Income
Access Share trust, after elimination of inter company accounts and
transactions. Non controlling interests in the equity and earnings or
losses of a consolidated subsidiary are reflected in “non controlling
interest in subsidiaries” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
and consolidated statements of income. Non controlling interest
adjusts the Company’s consolidated results of operations to present
the net income or loss attributable to the Company exclusive of the
earnings or losses attributable to the non controlling interest.
(b) Use of estimates in consolidated financial statements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (“US GAAP”)
and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations, requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to 
the valuation of intangible assets, the valuation of equity investments,
sales deductions, income taxes (including provisions for uncertain 
tax positions and the realization of deferred tax assets), provisions 
for litigation and legal proceedings, and contingent consideration
receivable from product divestments. If actual results differ from the
Company’s estimates, or to the extent these estimates are adjusted 
in future periods, the Company’s results of operations could either
benefit from, or be adversely affected by, any such change in estimate.
(c) Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when:
� there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement;
� delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered;
� the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and
� collectability is reasonably assured.
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added 
and similar taxes, and trade discounts. No revenue is recognized 
for consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent 
on future events or future performance.
The Company’s principal revenue streams and their respective
accounting treatments are discussed below:
Product sales
Revenue for the sale of products is recognized upon shipment to
customers or at the time of delivery to the customer depending on the
terms of sale. Provisions for rebates, product returns and discounts 
to customers are provided for as reductions to revenue in the same
period as the related sales are recorded. The Company monitors and
tracks the amount of sales deductions based on historical experience
to estimate the reduction to revenues.
Royalty income
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognized when 
the licensee sells the underlying product, with the amount of royalty
income recorded based on sales information received from the relevant
licensee. The Company estimates sales amounts and related royalty
income based on the historical product information for any period 
that the sales information is not available from the relevant licensee.
Licensing revenues
Other revenue includes revenues derived from product out-licensing
arrangements, which typically consist of an initial upfront payment 
on inception of the license and subsequent milestone payments
contingent on the achievement of certain clinical and sales milestones.
Product out-licensing arrangements often require the Company to
provide multiple deliverables to the licensee.
Initial license fees received in connection with product out-licensing
agreements entered into prior to January 1, 2011 are deferred and
recognized over the period in which the Company has continuing
substantive performance obligations, typically the period over which
the Company participates in the development of the out-licensed
product, even where such fees are non-refundable and not creditable
against future royalty payments.
For product out-licensing arrangements entered into, or subject to
material modification, after January 1, 2011, consideration received is
allocated between each of the separable elements in the arrangement
using the relative selling price method. An element is considered
separable if it has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. The
selling price used for each separable element will be based on vendor
specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third party evidence 
if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE 
nor third party evidence is available. Revenue is then recognized 
as each of the separable elements to which the revenue has been
allocated is delivered.
Milestone payments which are non-refundable, non-creditable and
contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognized 
as revenues either on achievement of such milestones if the milestones
are considered substantive or over the period the Company has
continuing substantive performance obligations, if the milestones 
are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable 
against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred 
and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated 
to be paid.

(d) Sales deductions
(i) Rebates
Rebates primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid
agencies and contractual rebates with health-maintenance
organizations. These rebates are based on price differentials between 
a base price and the selling price. As a result, rebates generally
increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product
(as prices increase). Provisions for rebates are recorded as reductions
to revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded, 
with the amount of the rebate based on the Company’s best 
estimate if any uncertainty exists over the unit rebate amount, and 
with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends.
(ii) Returns
The Company estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that 
will result in a return, based on historical trends and when applicable,
specific factors affecting certain products at the balance sheet date.
The accrual is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period
as the related sales are recorded. 
(iii) Coupons 
The Company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive. An accrual 
is established based on the Company’s expectation of the level of
coupon redemption, estimated using historical trends. The accrual is
recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period as the related
sales are recorded or the date the coupon is offered, if later than the
date the related sales are recorded.
(iv) Discounts
The Company offers cash discounts to customers for the early payment
of receivables which are recorded as reductions to revenue and
accounts receivable in the same period as the related sale is recorded.
(v) Wholesaler charge-backs
The Company has contractual agreements whereby it supplies 
certain products to third parties at predetermined prices. Wholesalers
acting as intermediaries in these transactions are reimbursed by the
Company if the predetermined prices are less than the prices paid by
the wholesaler to the Company. Accruals for wholesaler charge-backs,
which are based on historical trends, are recorded as reductions 
to revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded.
(e) Collaborative arrangements
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements to develop and
commercialize drug candidates. These collaborative arrangements
often require up front, milestone, royalty or profit share payments, 
or a combination of these, with payments often contingent upon the
success of the related development and commercialization efforts.
Collaboration agreements entered into by the Company may also
include expense reimbursements or other such payments to the
collaborating partner.
The Company reports costs incurred and revenue generated 
from transactions with third parties as well as payments between 
parties to collaborative arrangements either on a gross or net basis, 
depending on the characteristics of the collaborative relationship.
(f) Cost of product sales
Cost of product sales includes the cost of purchasing finished 
product for sale, the cost of raw materials and manufacturing for 
those products that are manufactured by the Company, shipping 
and handling costs, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
in respect of favorable manufacturing contracts. Royalties payable 
on products to which the Company does not own the rights are also
included in Cost of product sales.
(g) Leased assets
The costs of operating leases are charged to operations on a straight-
line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are not made 
on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the consolidated
balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and are depreciated
over the shorter of the period of the lease or their useful lives. The capital
element of future lease payments is recorded as a liability, while the
interest element is charged to operations over the period of the lease 
to produce a level yield on the balance of the capital lease obligation.
(h) Advertising expense
The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. Advertising
costs amounted to $122.5 million, $93.3 million and $81.3 million for
the years to December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively and were
included within Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.
(i) Research and development (“R&D”) expense
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments
made to third parties for in-licensed products that have not yet received
marketing approval and for which no alternative future use has been
identified are also expensed as incurred.
Milestone payments made to third parties on and subsequent to
regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets, and amortized
over the remaining useful life of the related product.
(j) Valuation and impairment of long-lived assets other than
goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and investments
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets other
than goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets and investments for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amounts of the relevant assets may not be
recoverable. When such a determination is made, management’s
estimate of undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the use and
ultimate disposition of these assets is compared to the carrying value 
of the assets to determine whether the carrying value is recoverable. 
If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, the amount of
the impairment recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
is determined by estimating the fair value of the relevant assets and
recording an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the estimated fair value. This fair value is usually
determined based on estimated discounted cash flows.
(k) Finance costs of debt
Finance costs relating to debt issued are recorded as a deferred 
charge and amortized to the consolidated statements of income 
over the period to the earliest redemption date of the debt, using the
effective interest rate method. On extinguishment of the related 
debt, any unamortized deferred financing costs are written off and
charged to interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
continued
(l) Foreign currency
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into
the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary in which they arise 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions 
in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency
at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Transaction
gains and losses, other than those related to current and deferred 
tax assets and liabilities, are recognized in arriving at income from
continuing operations before income taxes, equity in earnings/(losses)
of equity method investees and discontinued operations. Transaction
gains and losses arising on foreign currency, denominated current 
and deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within income taxes
in the consolidated statements of income.
The results of operations for subsidiaries, whose functional currency is
not the US dollar, are translated into the US dollar at the average rates
of exchange during the period, with the subsidiaries’ balance sheets
translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The cumulative
effect of exchange rate movements is included in a separate
component of Other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency exchange transaction losses/gains included in
consolidated net income in the years to December 31, 2011, 2010 
and 2009 amounted to a loss of $2.1 million, a gain of $1.7 million 
and a gain of $2.3 million, respectively.
(m) Income taxes
Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated financial
statements for positions which are considered more likely than not 
of being sustained, based on the technical merits of the position 
on audit by the tax authorities. The measurement of the tax benefit
recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based upon 
the largest amount of tax benefit that, in management’s judgment, 
is greater than 50% likely of being realized based on a cumulative
probability assessment of the possible outcomes. The Company
recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties
within income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted
tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, 
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that 
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
(n) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is based upon net income attributable to
Shire plc divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is based
upon net income attributable to Shire plc adjusted for the impact of
interest expense on convertible debt on an “if-converted” basis (when
the effect is dilutive) divided by the weighted average number of
Ordinary Share equivalents outstanding during the period, adjusted for
the dilutive effect of all potential Ordinary Shares that were outstanding
during the year. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the
effect would be to increase diluted earnings per share or reduce the
diluted loss per share. 
(o) Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation represents the cost of share-based
awards granted to employees. The Company measures share-based
compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the grant date,
based on the estimated fair value of the award. Predominantly all of the
Company’s awards have service and/or performance conditions and
the fair values of these awards are estimated using a Black-Scholes
valuation model. 
For share-based compensation awards which cliff vest, the Company
recognizes the cost of the relevant share-based payment award 
as an expense on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) 
over the employee’s requisite service period. For those share-based
compensation awards with a graded vesting schedule, the Company
recognizes the cost of the relevant share-based payment award as an
expense on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the
requisite service period for the entire award (that is, over the requisite
service period for the last separately vesting portion of the award). 
The share-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost 
of product sales, R&D, and SG&A in the consolidated statements 
of income based on the employees’ respective functions.
The Company records deferred tax assets for awards that result 
in deductions on the Company’s income tax returns, based on 
the amount of compensation cost recognized and the Company’s 
statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will receive a deduction.
Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial
reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the
Company’s income tax return are recorded in additional paid-in 
capital (if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset) or 
in the consolidated statements of income (if the deferred tax asset
exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid-in capital exists 
from previous awards).
The Company’s share-based compensation plans are described 
more fully in Note 29.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. 
(q) Financial instruments—derivatives 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage 
its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with third party
transactions and inter company financing. These instruments consist 
of swap and forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company 
does not apply hedge accounting for these instruments. The fair 
values of these instruments are included on the balance sheet in
current assets/liabilities, with changes in the fair value recognized 
in the consolidated statements of income. The cash flows relating 
to these instruments are presented within net cash provided by
operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, 
unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging specific
investing or financing activities.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
continued
(r) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (including manufacturing
overheads, where appropriate) or market. Cost incurred in bringing
each product to its present location and condition is based on
purchase costs calculated on a first-in, first-out basis, including
transportation costs.
Inventories include costs relating to both marketed products and, for
certain products, cost incurred prior to regulatory approval. Inventories
are capitalized prior to regulatory approval if the Company considers
that it is probable that the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) 
or another regulatory body will grant commercial and manufacturing
approval for the relevant product, and it is probable that the value 
of capitalized inventories will be recovered through commercial sale.
Inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost 
of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those anticipated, inventory
adjustments may be required. 
(s) Assets held-for-sale
An asset is classified as held-for-sale when, amongst other things, the
Company has committed to a plan of disposition, the asset is available
for immediate sale, and the plan is not expected to change significantly.
Assets held-for-sale are carried at the lower of their carrying amount 
or fair value less cost to sell.
Assets acquired in a business combination that will be sold rather than
held and used are classified as held-for sale at the date of acquisition
when it is probable that the Company will dispose of the assets within
one year. Newly acquired assets held-for-sale are carried at their fair
value less cost to sell at the acquisition date. The Company does not
record depreciation or amortization on assets classified as held-for-sale.
(t) Investments
The Company has certain investments in pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies.
Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
if the investment gives the Company the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control over, the investee. Significant influence is
generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in
the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other
factors such as representation on the investee’s Board of Directors and
the nature of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining
whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the
equity method of accounting, the Company records its investments 
in equity method investees in the consolidated balance sheet under
Investments and its share of the investees’ earnings or losses together
with other than temporary impairments in value under equity in
earnings/(losses) of equity method investees in the consolidated
statements of income.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments for which 
the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence,
are accounted for under the cost method or at fair value. Investments 
in private companies are carried at cost, less provisions for other than
temporary impairment in value. For public companies that have readily
determinable fair values, the Company classifies its equity investments
as available for sale and, accordingly, records these investments at 
their fair values with unrealized holding gains and losses included in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net of any related 
tax effect. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value of available
for sale securities judged to be other than temporary, are included in
other income/(expense), net (see Note 26). The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on
securities classified as available for sale are included as interest income.
(u) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost reduced for impairment
losses, less accumulated depreciation. The cost of significant assets
includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction period.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated 
to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over 
its estimated useful life as follows:
� Buildings 15 to 50 years
� Office furniture, fittings and equipment 3 to 10 years
� Warehouse, laboratory and manufacturing
equipment 3 to 15 years
The cost of land is not depreciated. Assets under the course of
construction are not depreciated until the relevant assets are available
and ready for their intended use.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to the
consolidated statements of income as incurred. The costs of major
renewals and improvements are capitalized. At the time property, 
plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost 
and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and
accumulated depreciation accounts. The profit or loss on such
disposition is reflected in operating income.
(v) Goodwill and other intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
In business combinations completed subsequent to January 1, 2009,
goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration
given and the fair value of any non controlling interest in the acquiree
over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. For
business combinations completed prior to January 1, 2009 goodwill
represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment, at
least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of
assessing the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, goodwill has
been allocated to the Company’s three reporting units, being SP , HGT
and RM. Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an
impairment review include: significant underperformance of a reporting
unit relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;
significant changes in the manner of the Company’s use of acquired
assets or the strategy for the overall business; and significant negative
industry trends.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value 
of each reporting unit’s net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the
fair value of the reporting unit. If the reporting unit’s carrying amount 
is greater than its fair value, a second step is performed whereby the
portion of the reporting unit’s fair value relating to goodwill is compared
to the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The Company
recognizes a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which 
the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. 
The Company has determined that there are no impairment losses 
in respect of goodwill for any of the reporting periods covered 
by these consolidated financial statements.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
continued
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property 
rights for products with a defined revenue stream, acquired product
technology and IPR&D. Intellectual property rights for currently
marketed products and acquired product technology are recorded at
cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the related product,
which ranges from 1 to 20 years (weighted average 16.5 years). IPR&D
acquired through a business combination which completed subsequent
to January 1 , 2009 is capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset
until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts.
IPR&D is reviewed for impairment using a “one-step” approach which
compares the fair value of the IPR&D asset with its carrying amount. 
An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of the IPR&D asset. Once the R&D efforts are
completed the useful life of the relevant assets will be determined, and
the IPR&D asset amortized over this useful economic life. 
The following factors are considered in estimating the useful lives 
of Other intangible assets:
� expected use of the asset;
� regulatory, legal or contractual provisions, including the regulatory
approval and review process, patent issues and actions by
government agencies;
� the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing
products and other economic factors, including the stability of the
market, known technological advances, development of competing
drugs that are more effective clinically or economically; 
� actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies or others 
that may eliminate current competitive advantages; and
� historical experience of renewing or extending similar arrangements.
When a number of factors apply to an intangible asset, these factors
are considered in combination when determining the appropriate 
useful life for the relevant asset.
(w) Non-monetary transactions 
The Company enters into certain non-monetary transactions that
involve either the granting of a license over the Company’s patents 
or the disposal of an asset or group of assets in exchange for a non-
monetary asset, usually equity. The Company accounts for these
transactions at fair value if the Company is able to determine the fair
value within reasonable limits. To the extent the Company concludes
that it is unable to determine the fair value of a transaction that
transaction is accounted for at the recorded amounts of the assets
exchanged. Management is required to exercise its judgment 
in determining whether or not the fair value of the asset received 
or given up can be determined.
(x) New accounting pronouncements
Adopted during the period
Revenue recognition in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
On January 1, 2011 the Company adopted new guidance issued by the
Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) on revenue recognition
in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. This amends the existing
guidance on allocating consideration received between the elements
in a multiple deliverable arrangement and establishes a selling price
hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The selling
price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific
objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third party evidence if VSOE 
is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third party
evidence is available. It replaces the term “fair value” in the revenue
allocation with “selling price” to clarify that the allocation of revenue is
based on entity specific assumptions rather than the assumptions of a
market place participant. The guidance eliminates the residual method
of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated
using the relative selling price method. The guidance also significantly
expands the disclosures related to a vendor’s multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. The guidance has been adopted prospectively
from January 1, 2011 for new arrangements, or existing arrangements
which have been materially modified subsequent to the date of
adoption. The adoption of the guidance did not impact the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Effect of denominating the exercise price of a share-based
payment award in the currency of the market in which the
underlying equity security trades
On January 1, 2011 the Company adopted new guidance issued 
by the FASB on the effect of denominating the exercise price of 
a share-based payment award in the currency of the market in which 
the underlying equity security trades. This guidance clarifies that an
employee share-based payment award with an exercise price
denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion
of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to
contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service
condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a
liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. The Company has historically
accounted for share-based payment awards in a manner consistent
with the guidance, and therefore the adoption of this guidance did 
not impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
Milestone method of revenue recognition 
On January 1, 2011 the Company adopted new guidance issued 
by the FASB on defining a milestone and determining when it may 
be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition
for research or development transactions. This guidance clarifies that: 
(i) consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone 
in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which 
the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet 
certain criteria to be considered substantive; (ii) milestones should 
be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated;
(iii) an arrangement may contain both substantive and non-substantive
milestones; and (iv) each milestone should be evaluated individually 
to determine if it is substantive. The adoption of the guidance did 
not impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results 
of operations or cash flows.
Fees paid to federal government by pharmaceutical
manufacturers 
On January 1, 2011 the Company adopted new guidance issued by 
the FASB on the accounting for the annual fee paid by pharmaceutical
manufacturers to the US treasury in accordance with the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Healthcare and
Education Reconciliation Act for each calendar year beginning on or after
January 1 , 2011 . A portion of the fee will be allocated to individual entities
on the basis of the amount of their branded prescription drug sales to
certain US Government programs for the preceding year as a percentage
of the industry’ s branded prescription drug sales for the same period 
to these same programs. This guidance specifies that the liability for the
fee should be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale
with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using
a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates
the fee over the calendar year that it is payable. The adoption of the
guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’ s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
continued
Disclosure of supplementary pro-forma information
for business combinations 
On January 1, 2011 the Company adopted new guidance issued 
by the FASB which clarifies the acquisition date that should be used 
for reporting pro-forma financial information disclosures in a business
combination when comparative financial statements are presented.
The guidance specifies that the entity should disclose revenue and
earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination
that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning
of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The guidance 
also improves the usefulness of the pro-forma revenue and earnings
disclosures by requiring a description of the nature and amount 
of material, nonrecurring pro-forma adjustments that are directly
attributable to the business combination. The guidance is effective
prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date
is on or after January 1, 2011. The Company has historically presented
pro-forma business combination disclosures in accordance with 
the guidance, and therefore the adoption of guidance did not impact
the Company’s disclosures on business combinations.
To be adopted in future periods 
Amendments to achieve common fair value measurement
and disclosure requirements in US GAAP and International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
In May 2011 the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurement 
and disclosure, which both amends existing requirements and
improves the comparability of fair value measurement and disclosure
between US GAAP and IFRS. Some of the amendments clarify the
application of existing fair value measurement requirements and 
other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for
measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value
measurements. The guidance will be effective prospectively for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption
is not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 
Presentation of comprehensive income
In June 2011 the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of
comprehensive income which revises the manner in which entities
present comprehensive income in their financial statements. The
guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive
income in either: (i) a single, continuous statement of comprehensive
income; or (ii) two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance
does not change those items which must be reported in other
comprehensive income, and does not change the definition of net
income or the calculation of earnings per share. 
In December 2011 the FASB amended the guidance issued in June
2011 on the presentation of comprehensive income. The amendments
deferred the requirements to present on the face of the financial
statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other
comprehensive income on the components of net income and other
comprehensive income for all periods presented.
The guidance will be effective retrospectively for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations and cash flows.
Goodwill impairment testing
In September 2011 the FASB issued guidance on the testing of
goodwill for impairment. The guidance permits an entity to first assess
the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or
circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity
determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step
impairment test is unnecessary. The more-likely-than-not threshold 
is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%. An entity also has
the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit 
in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the
two-step goodwill impairment test and may resume performing the
qualitative assessment in any subsequent periods. The guidance will 
be effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption 
is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (“US GAAP”)
and SEC regulations, requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ,
potentially significantly, from amounts recorded, based on the
Company’s estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions
are primarily made in relation to the valuation of intangible assets, 
the valuation of equity investments, sales deductions, income taxes,
provisions for litigation and the measurement of contingent
consideration receivable from product divestments.
(i) Valuation of intangible assets
In accordance with US GAAP the Company classifies intangible 
assets into three categories: (i) finite lived intangible assets, which are
amortized over their estimated useful lives; (ii) intangible assets with
indefinite lives, which are not subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill. 
At December 31, 2011 the carrying value of the Company’s finite 
lived intangible assets was $2,373.2 million (2010: $1,839.2 million;
2009: $1,784.6 million), the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite
lived intangible assets was $119.8 million (2010: $139.7 million; 
2009: $6.1 million), and the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill
was $592.6 million (2010: $402.5 million; 2009: $384.7 million). 
The Company’s indefinite lived intangible assets relate solely to 
IPR&D assets acquired through business combinations, which are
either subject to amortization following completion, or impairment 
on abandonment, of the relevant development project.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES continued
(a) Initial valuation of intangible assets acquired through business
combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations (primarily the
acquisitions of TKT in 2005, New River in 2007 , Jerini in 2008, Movetis
in 2010 and ABH in 2011) using the acquisition method of accounting,
which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair
values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values
of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination of
estimated fair values of acquired intangible assets, as well as the useful
economic life ascribed to finite lived intangible assets, requires the use
of significant judgment. The use of different estimates and assumptions
to those used by the Company could result in a materially different
valuation of acquired intangible assets, which could have a material
effect on the Company’s results of operations. 
Initial valuation of finite lived intangible assets
At December 31, 2011 the carrying value of the Company’s finite 
lived intangible assets was $2,373.2 million (2010: $1,839.2 million;
2009: $1,784.6 million), primarily representing the following products:
DERMAGRAFT product technology ($690.3 million), FIRAZYR 
($222.0 million), REPLAGAL ($228.6 million), RESOLOR ($270.2
million), and VYVANSE ($824.0 million). 
The fair values of all finite lived identifiable intangible assets, 
for commercialized products and developed product technologies,
acquired through business combinations have been determined 
using an income approach on a project-by-project basis using the
multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess
earnings method starts with a forecast of all expected future net 
cash flows which a market participant could have either generated 
or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property, customer
relationships, product technologies and other intangible assets. These
cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying a market
participant discount rate that reflects the risk factors that a market
participant would associate with the cash flows (to the extent 
the underlying cash flows have not similarly been risk adjusted).
The forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions 
to be made, including:
(i) revenue that is reasonably likely to result from the sale of products
including the estimated number of units to be sold, estimated
selling prices, estimated market penetration and estimated market
share and year-over-year growth rates over the product lifecycles;
(ii) royalty or license fees saved by owning the intellectual property
associated with the products;
(iii) cost of sales for the products using historical data, industry data 
or other sources of market data;
(iv) sales and marketing expense using historical data, industry data 
or other sources of market data;
(v) general and administrative expenses;
(vi) R&D expenses;
(vii) the estimated life of the products; and
(viii) the tax amortization benefit available to a market participant
purchasing the relevant assets outside of a business combination.
The valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition 
of the identifiable intangible assets, and the expectations and
assumptions that (i) have been deemed reasonable by the Company’s
management and (ii) are based on information, expectations and
assumptions that would be available to, and made by, a market
participant. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying
assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as
projected. For these reasons, among others, the actual cash flows 
may vary from forecasts of future cash flows, and dependent on 
the outcome of future events or circumstances impairment losses 
(as outlined below) may result. The use of different estimates and
assumptions to those used by the Company could result in a materially
different valuation of finite lived intangible assets. However, as the
valuation process for intangible assets involves a number of inter-
relating assumptions, the Company does not consider it meaningful 
to quantify the sensitivity of the valuation of intangible assets to
changes in any individual assumption. 
Initial valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets (“IPR&D”)
IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to incomplete technologies
and development projects that the Company has acquired through
business combinations or asset acquisitions, which at the date of 
the relevant acquisition have not reached technological feasibility or
which have no alternative future use. The Company considers that 
a technology or development project has an alternative future use 
if it is probable that the Company will use the asset in its current,
incomplete state as it existed at the acquisition date, the asset will 
be used in another development project that has not yet commenced,
and future economic benefit is expected from that use. The Company
has determined that historically all such acquired development projects
did not have an alternative future use.
Prior to January 1, 2009 the fair value ascribed to such technologies or
development projects was immediately expensed to the consolidated
statements of income in the year of acquisition. The Company
recorded IPR&D expense on the following significant business
combinations that closed prior to January 1, 2009: $128 million 
on acquisition of Jerini in 2008, $1,866 million for New River in 2007
and $815 million for TKT in 2005. In 2008 the Company also recorded
IPR&D expense of $135 million in respect of the asset acquisition 
of METAZYM from Zymenex. Additionally, non-refundable fees paid 
on the in-licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory
approval and have no alternative future use have been expensed 
and presented within R&D in the consolidated statements of income.
For those business combinations which closed subsequent to January
1, 2009 IPR&D has been recorded as an indefinite lived intangible
asset. At the time of initial acquisition, the Company recorded indefinite
lived IPR&D assets of $139 million on acquisition of Movetis in 2010,
and $6 million on acquisition of EQUASYM from UCB in 2009.
The fair value of IPR&D assets is determined using the income
approach on a project-by-project basis using the multi-period excess
earnings method. The fair value of the acquired IPR&D assets has been
based on the present value of probability adjusted incremental cash
flows which a market participant would expect to be generated by the
IPR&D projects after the deduction of contributory asset charges for
other assets employed in these projects. This method incorporates an
evaluation of the risks associated with the development project, which
include applying an appropriate discount rate commensurate with the
project’s stage of completion, the nature of the product, the scientific
data associated with the technology, the current patent situation and
market competition.

Financial statements
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES continued
The forecast of future cash flows required the following assumptions 
to be made:
(i) revenue that is likely to result from specific IPR&D projects,
including the likelihood of approval of the product, estimated
number of units to be sold, estimated selling prices, estimated
market penetration, estimated market share and year-over-year
growth rates over the product lifecycles;
(ii) cost of sales related to the potential products using historical 
data, industry data or other sources of market data;
(iii) sales and marketing expense using historical data, industry 
data or other market data;
(iv) general and administrative expenses;
(v) R&D expenses to complete the development of the acquired
products, including the likelihood of the IPR&D project progressing
to the next development stage; and
(vi) the tax amortization benefit available to a market participant
purchasing the relevant assets outside of a business combination.
The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely completion
of the acquired IPR&D projects consist of the ability to confirm the
safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from ongoing
clinical trials, and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. 
The use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by 
the Company could result in a materially different valuation of IPR&D.
However, as the valuation process for IPR&D involves a number 
of inter-relating assumptions, the Company does not consider 
it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of the valuation of IPR&D 
to changes in any individual assumption. 
The valuation of IPR&D has been based on information that existed 
at the time of the acquisition of the relevant development project, 
and utilized expectations and assumptions that (i) have been deemed
reasonable by Shire’s management, and (ii) are based on information,
expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made 
by a market participant. However, no assurance can be given that
the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation 
of IPR&D will occur as projected. If certain of the IPR&D projects fail
during development, are abandoned, or do not receive the relevant
regulatory approvals, the Company may not realize the future cash
flows that it has estimated, nor recover the value of the R&D investment
made subsequent to acquisition of the relevant project. If such
circumstances occur, the Company’s future operating results could 
be materially adversely impacted.
(b) Subsequent measurement of intangible assets
Finite lived intangible assets—estimation of amortization 
charges and impairment losses
Management’s estimate of the useful life of its finite lived intangible
assets considers, inter alia, the following factors:
� the expected use of the finite lived intangible asset by the Company;
� any legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit 
or extend the useful life;
� the effects of demand and competition, including the launch 
of generic products; and 
� other general economic and/or industry specific factors (such 
as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, 
legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory
environment, and expected changes in distribution channels).
The Company reviews the useful life of its intangible assets subject to
amortization at each reporting period, and revises its estimate of the
useful life if warranted by events or circumstances. Any future changes
to the useful life of the Company’s finite lived intangible assets could
result in higher or lower amortization charges in future periods, which
could materially affect the Company’s operating results.
The Company reviews its finite lived intangible assets for impairment
using a “two-step” approach, whenever events or circumstances
suggest that the carrying value of these finite lived intangible assets
may not be recoverable. Under step one, if the undiscounted cash
flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the finite lived
intangible asset (based on entity specific assumptions) are less than its
carrying value, the intangible asset is considered not to be recoverable.
The impairment loss is determined under step two as the amount by
which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value
(based on market participant assumptions). 
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the Company’s finite
lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, and which would lead
to an evaluation of the recoverability of the relevant asset, include, but
are not limited to, the following:
� changes to a product’s commercialization strategy;
� the loss of patent protection, regulatory exclusivity or challenge 
or circumvention by competitors of the Company’s regulatory
exclusivity patents;
� the development and marketing of competitive products, 
including generic entrants into the market place;
� changes to the product labels, or other regulatory intervention;
� sustained government pressure on prices and, specifically,
competitive pricing; 
� the occurrence of significant adverse events in respect to the
Company’s products;
� a significant deterioration in a product’s operating performance
compared to expectations; and
� an expectation that the intangible asset will be divested before 
the end of its previously estimated useful life.
The occurrence of any such events or circumstances could adversely
affect the Company’s estimates of the future net cash flows generated
by its finite lived intangible assets. The Company has not recognized
any impairment losses in relation to finite lived intangible assets in the
year to December 31, 2011 (2010: $42.7 million which related to the
DAYTRANA intangible asset as a result of divestment to Noven; 2009:
$nil). Dependent on future events or circumstances, the Company’s
operating results could be materially and adversely affected by future
impairment losses relating to its finite lived intangible assets.
Indefinite lived intangible assets (“IPR&D”)—estimation
of impairment losses
The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangible assets (which
currently only relate to IPR&D assets) for impairment annually or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset
might be impaired. Indefinite lived assets are reviewed for impairment
using a “one-step” approach, which compares the fair value of the
indefinite lived asset (based on market participant assumptions) with 
its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent 
that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the relevant
indefinite lived intangible asset.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES continued
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the Company’s IPR&D
assets may not be recoverable, and which would lead to an evaluation
of the relevant asset for impairment, include those factors considered
for finite lived intangible assets (outlined above) as well as any adverse
changes to the technological or commercial viability of the IPR&D
projects, which could include abandonment of the relevant project. 
The occurrence of any such events or circumstances, could adversely
affect the Company’s estimates of the future net cash flows generated
by, and the fair value of, its indefinite lived intangible assets.
After the identification of such events, circumstances, and the resultant
impairment reviews, the Company recognized impairment losses of
$16.0 million in the year to December 31, 2011 (2010 and 2009: $nil) 
in respect of certain indefinite lived intangible assets. Dependent 
on future events or circumstances, the Company’s operating results 
could be materially and adversely affected by future impairment losses
relating to its indefinite lived intangible assets.
Goodwill—estimation of impairment losses
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, 
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill is reviewed for
impairment at the reporting unit level, which for the Company is at 
the same level as its operating segments, SP , HGT and subsequent 
to the acquisition of ABH in 2011, RM. 
At December 31, 2011 goodwill of $243.5 million (December 31, 2010:
$245.9 million) is held in the SP segment, $152.1 million (December 31,
2010: $156.6 million) in the HGT segment and $197 .0 million
(December 31, 2010: $nil) is held in the RM segment.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment using a “two-step”
approach. Step one requires a comparison of the fair value of the 
each of the Company’s reporting units with its carrying value, including
goodwill. If the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeds its
estimated fair value, goodwill included within that reporting unit is
deemed not to be recoverable, in which case Step two is performed.
Under Step two, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill
exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to that excess.
The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units 
(and if required in any Step two, the fair value of its goodwill) through 
a present value technique, principally using the income approach. The
determination of fair value of the Company’s reporting units requires the
use of significant judgment and assumptions, which include, inter alia,
the estimation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate to
determine the fair value of each reporting unit.
The Company’s annual goodwill impairment review performed as of
October 1, 2011, 2010 and 2009 indicated that the estimated fair value
of each of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying
values. Goodwill was, therefore, not considered impaired. However,
dependent on future events or circumstances, the Company’s
operating results could be materially and adversely affected by any
future impairment losses relating to its goodwill.
(ii) Valuation of equity investments 
At December 31, 2011 the carrying value of the Company’s
investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical 
and biotechnology companies amounted to $29.9 million 
(2010: $101.6 million; 2009: $105.7 million). The carrying values 
of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than 
temporary impairment, at least quarterly or more frequently 
if certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value 
of an investment exceeds its fair value. 
Indicators of other than temporary impairment which are considered 
by the Company, include:
(a) the market value of a quoted investment being below the cost 
of the investment;
(b) adverse news on an investee’s progress in scientific technology/
development of compounds; and
(c) recent stock issuances at a price below the Company’s 
investment price.
If the fair value appears to be below the cost of the investment, the
Company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there 
is an other than temporary impairment. This evidence would include,
but is not limited to:
� the length of time and/or the extent to which the market value 
of the investee is less than the cost of the investment;
� the level of progress in the investee’s scientific
technology/development of compounds;
� ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee;
� whether or not other substantial investee-specific adverse 
events have occurred which may cause a decline in value;
� analysis and valuation of comparable companies; and
� the overall financial condition and near-term prospects of the
investee, including its ability to obtain financing to progress
development of its compounds.
In instances when this review indicates that there is an other than
temporary impairment of the Company’s investment in private
companies, the Company records an other than temporary impairment
loss to record the investment at its then current fair value. For the
Company’s investments in public companies which are accounted 
for as available for sale securities, if these investments are deemed 
to be other than temporarily impaired, any unrealized holding loss 
is reclassified from other comprehensive income by recording 
an other than temporary impairment charge in the consolidated
statements of income. 
During 2011 Shire recorded impairment charges for its non-current
investments in private companies of $1.3 million (2010 and 2009: $nil).
During the year to December 31, 2011, the Company recorded other
than temporary impairment charges of $2.4 million for its available for
sale securities (2010: $1.5 million; 2009, $0.8 million). At December 31,
2011 the Company has a net unrealized holding loss of $1.1 million 
(net of taxes) (2010: a gain of $0.3 million, net).
The determination of the fair value of private company investments 
and the determination of whether an unrealized holding loss on a
publicly quoted investment is other than temporary requires significant
management judgment. Any future events or circumstances which
could lead to the recognition of other than temporary impairment
charges could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES continued
(iii) Sales deductions 
Sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid 
and other government agencies, contractual rebates with health-
maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), product returns, sales discounts
(including trade discounts and distribution service fees), wholesaler
charge-backs, and allowances for coupon sampling programs. These
deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period
as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from
historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors
that impact such reserves. On the balance sheet the Company records
wholesaler charge-backs and prompt payment discounts as a reserve
against accounts receivable, whereas all other sales deductions are
recorded within current liabilities.
The Company has the following significant categories of sales
deductions, all of which involve estimates and judgments which the
Company considers to be critical accounting estimates, and require 
the Company to use information from external sources:
Medicaid and managed care rebates
Statutory rebates to state Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates
to Managed Care Organizations (“MCO”) under managed care
programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling
price. Medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage of the
selling price over the life of the product (if prices increase faster than
inflation). 
As it can take up to six months for information to reach the Company
on actual usage of the Company’s products in managed care and
Medicaid programs and on the total rebates to be reimbursed, the
Company maintains reserves for amounts payable under these
programs relating to sold products.
The amount of the reserve is based on historical experience of rebates,
the timing of payments, the level of reimbursement claims, changes 
in prices (both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices),
changes in prescription demand patterns, projected product returns
and the levels of inventory in the distribution channel. Adjustments 
are made for known changes in these factors, such as how shipments
of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax should 
be included in the Medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to Medicaid
rebate legislation.
Shire’s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are
based on product-by-product inventory data provided by wholesalers
and results of independently commissioned retail inventory surveys. 
Revisions or clarification of guidelines from the CMS related to state
Medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices
with retroactive application can result in changes to management’s
estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods.
The accrual estimation process for Medicaid and managed care
rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions,
which vary for each combination of product and Medicaid agency or
MCO. Accordingly it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity
to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty. However, with
the exception of the estimation of the Medicaid unit rebate amount
(“URA”) for ADDERALL XR for the period prior to October 1, 2010 
(see below), Shire does not believe that the effect of these
uncertainties, taken as a whole, significantly impacts the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.
There are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments
of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax should be
included in the Medicaid rebate calculation. Since authorized generic
launch in 2009 the Company has recorded its accrual for Medicaid
rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable, consistent
with the Company’s interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation.
Shire believes that its interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation 
is reasonable and correct. In addition, from October 1, 2010, provisions
of the 2010 Affordable Care Act provide further clarity, in a manner
consistent with the Company’s interpretation, as to how shipments of
authorized generics from that date should be included in the Medicaid
rebate calculation. 
The CMS could disagree with Shire’s interpretation of the Medicaid
rebate legislation for shipments of authorized generic products prior 
to October 1, 2010. CMS could require Shire to apply an alternative
interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and request that Shire
pays up to $212 million above the recorded liability. However, Shire
believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its interpretation of the
Medicaid rebate legislation, and that there would be a strong basis to
limit any additional payment to a level approximating the full, unrebated
cost to the States of ADDERALL XR (equivalent to approximately 
$134 million above the recorded liability), and to initiate litigation to
recover any amount paid in excess of the recorded liability. The result 
of any such litigation cannot be predicted. 
Any future change in the Company’s best estimate of the ADDERALL
XR Medicaid rebate liability for the period prior to October 1, 2010 
could significantly decrease reported ADDERALL XR net product sales
and impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations
in the period in which any such change of estimate were to occur.
Aggregate accruals for Medicaid and MCO rebates at December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009 were $ 612.6 million, $549.9 million and 
$341.6 million, or 16%, 18% and 13% of net product sales. Historically,
actual rebates have not varied significantly from the reserves provided.
Product returns
The Company typically accepts customer product returns in the
following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life; (b) product damaged
while in the possession of Shire; (c) under sales terms that allow 
for unconditional return (guaranteed sales); or (d) following product
recalls or product withdrawals. Returns are generally accepted up 
to one year after expiration date of the relevant product. The Company
typically refunds the agreed proportion of the sales price by the
issuance of a credit, rather than cash refund or exchanges from
inventory, and the returned product is destroyed.
Shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result
in a return by considering relevant factors, including:
� past product returns activity;
� the duration of time taken for products to be returned;
� the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel;
� product recalls and discontinuances;
� the shelf life of products;
� the launch of new drugs or new formulations; and
� the loss of patent protection or new competition.
Shire’s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
are based on product-by-product inventory data provided by
wholesalers and results of independently commissioned third party
retail inventory surveys.

Shire plc Annual Repo
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES continued
Returns reserves for new products generally require a higher level 
of estimation than estimates for established products. For shipments
made to support the commercial launch of a new product (which can
include guaranteed sales) the Company’s policy is to defer recognition
of the sales revenue until there is evidence of end-patient acceptance
of the new product (primarily through third party prescription data). 
For shipments after launch under standard terms (i.e. not guaranteed
sales), the Company’s initial estimates of sales return accruals are
primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar
products shortly after launch. Once sufficient historical data on actual
returns of the product are available, the returns provision is based on
this data and any other relevant factors as noted above. 
The accrual estimation process for product returns involves in each
case a number of interrelating assumptions, which vary for each
combination of product and customer. Accordingly, it would not be
meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual
assumption or uncertainty. However, Shire does not believe that the
effect of uncertainties, as a whole, significantly impacts the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. 
At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, provisions for product returns
were $88.8 million, $69.8 million, and $62.7 million or 2%, 2% and 2%
respectively, of net product sales. Historically, actual returns have not
varied significantly from the reserves provided.
(iv) Income taxes
In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, management is required
to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should be recognized
in the consolidated financial statements, based on whether it is more
likely than not that the technical merits of the position will be sustained
based on audit by the tax authorities. The measurement of the tax
benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based
upon the largest amount of tax benefit that, in management’ s judgment,
is greater than 50% likely to be realized based on a cumulative
probability assessment of the possible outcomes. In accounting for
income tax uncertainties, management is required to make judgments
in the determination of the unit of account, the evaluation of the facts,
circumstances and information in respect of the tax position taken,
together with the estimates of amounts that the Company may be
required to pay in ultimate settlement with the tax authority.
Shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns 
are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities. As Shire
operates globally, the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often 
very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be
substantial. Shire develops its cumulative probability assessment to
measure uncertain tax positions using internal expertise, experience
and judgment, together with the assistance from professional advisors.
Original estimates are refined as additional information becomes
known. For example, in the year to December 31, 2011 the Company
released certain provisions for uncertain tax positions totaling 
$15.0 million, primarily following the conclusion of prior year audits:
these releases were partially offset by the recognition of additional
provisions for uncertain tax positions of $19.6 million in relation to
ongoing compliance management for current and prior years. In the
year to December 31, 2010 the Company recognized additional
provisions for uncertain tax positions in relation to ongoing compliance
management for prior years of $30.4 million, which were partially offset
by a release in provisions for uncertain tax positions of $11.4 million
primarily following conclusion of ongoing audits. In the year to
December 31, 2009 the Company recognized additional interest
expense of $21.3 million on its provision for uncertain tax positions
following the receipt of new information on the amount of interest 
that may be payable upon settlement of the relevant tax position. 
Any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded provision
for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially higher or lower 
tax expense in future periods, which could significantly impact the
Company’s results of operations or financial condition. However, we 
do not believe it possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact 
of any such change in assumptions, estimates or judgments and the
resultant change, if any, in the Company’s provision for uncertain tax
positions, as any such change is dependent on factors such as future
changes in tax law or administrative practice, the amount and nature 
of additional taxes which may be asserted by the taxation authorities,
and the willingness of the relevant tax authorities to negotiate a
settlement for any such position.
At December 31, 2011 the Company recognized a liability of 
$265.5 million for total unrecognized tax benefits (2010: $290.8 million)
and had accrued $114.5 million (2010: $110.5 million) for the payment
of interest and penalties. The Company is required in certain tax
jurisdictions to make advance deposits to tax authorities on receipt 
of a tax assessment. These payments are either offset against the
income tax liability or establish an income tax receivable but do not
reduce the provision for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company has significant deferred tax assets due to various tax
attributes, including Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”), tax credits (from
Research and Development, Investment Tax Credits and Alternative
Minimum Tax) principally in the Republic of Ireland, the US, Belgium,
Germany and the UK. At December 31, 2011 the Company had
deferred tax liabilities of $714 million (2010: $433 million; 2009: 
$448 million) and gross deferred tax assets of $667 million (2010: 
$569 million; 2009: $515 million), against which the Company had
recorded valuation allowances of $212 million (2010: $200 million;
2009: $149 million). 
The realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent 
on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods.
Management is required to exercise judgment in determining whether 
it is more likely than not that it would realize these deferred tax assets,
based upon estimates of future taxable income and the availability of
prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies in the various jurisdictions
in which these NOLs and other tax attributes exist. Where there 
is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not 
be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these tax attributes a valuation
allowance is held against these deferred tax assets. If actual events
differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent that these
estimates are adjusted in the future, any changes to the valuation
allowance could significantly impact the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES continued
(v) Litigation and legal proceedings
The Company has a number of lawsuits pending that relate to
intellectual property infringement claims, and in September 2009 the
Company received a subpoena from the US Department of Health and
Human Services Office of the Inspector General seeking production
of documents related to the sales and marketing of ADDERALL XR,
DAYTRANA and VYVANSE, (see Note 20 “Commitments and
contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for further
details). Shire records a loss contingency provision for probable losses
when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss. Where 
the estimated loss lies within a range, management records a loss
contingency provision based on its best estimate of the probable loss.
Where no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than
any other amount, the minimum amount is recorded. These estimates
are often developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is
known, so estimates are refined each accounting period, as additional
information becomes known. Best estimates are reviewed quarterly
and estimates are changed when expectations are revised. Any
outcome upon settlement that deviates from Shire’s best estimate may
result in an additional or lesser expense in a future accounting period,
which could materially impact the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations. 
(vi) Contingent consideration receivable from product divestments
Consideration receivable by the Company on the divestment of 
product rights typically includes up front receipts and/or milestones
and royalties which are contingent on the outcome of future events
(with such milestones and royalties being, for example, based upon 
the future sales performance of the divested product). Contingent
consideration occasionally represents a significant proportion of the
economic value receivable by the Company for a divested product. 
In these situations the Company initially recognizes this contingent
consideration as an asset at its divestment date fair value, 
with remeasurement of this asset to its then current fair value 
at subsequent balance sheet dates.
At December 31, 2011 the Company has contingent consideration
assets of $37 .8 million (2010: $61.0 million; 2009: $nil), related to the
divestment of DAYTRANA to Noven in October 2010. The fair value 
of the contingent consideration receivable has been estimated using
the income approach (using a discounted cash flow method). This
discounted cash flow approach uses significant unobservable Level 3
inputs (as defined in US GAAP) including: forecast future relevant sales
of the divested product; the number of years over which such sales 
will be generated; the relevant contractual royalty rates associated with
such sales; an appropriate discount rate to be applied in calculating 
the present value of forecast future cash inflows; and assumed
weightings applied to differing revenue scenarios used to derive a
probability weighted fair value. Significant judgment is employed by 
the Company in developing these estimates and assumptions, both 
at the date of divestment and in subsequent periods. If actual events
differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent that these
estimates are adjusted in the future, the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations could be affected in the period of any such
change of estimate. 
4 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
Acquisition of ABH
On May 17 , 2011 the Company announced that it had entered into 
an Agreement and Plan of Merger, (the “Agreement”) to acquire 100%
of the outstanding shares and other equity instruments of ABH. On
June 28, 2011, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, Shire
completed its acquisition of ABH. The fair value of cash consideration
paid by the Company is $739.6 million. The purchase price was funded
by a combination of Shire’s existing cash resources and $30.0 million
drawn down on Shire’s revolving credit facility. 
The acquisition of ABH adds the DERMAGRAFT product, a bio-
engineered skin substitute, to Shire’s portfolio. DERMAGRAFT is
marketed in the US for the treatment of DFU greater than six weeks 
in duration, and brings future growth prospects in other territories and
indications. The acquisition combines ABH’s expertise and commercial
capability in regenerative medicine with the Company’s strengths and
expertise in human cell biological manufacturing.
The acquisition of ABH has been accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
from ABH have been recorded at their preliminary fair values at the
date of acquisition, being June 28, 2011. The Company’s consolidated
financial statements and results of operations include the results 
of ABH from June 28, 2011. In the year to December 31, 2011 the
Company included revenues of $105.3 million (2010: $nil; 2009: $nil)
and pre tax losses of $15.3 million (2010: $nil; 2009: $nil) (after
intangible asset amortization of $20.0 million (2010: $nil; 2009: $nil) 
for ABH within its Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other intangible assets principally comprise $710.0 million relating
to DERMAGRAFT product technology, the product brand name and
related relationships. The fair value of this asset has been estimated
using an income approach, using the excess earnings method. The
estimated useful life of the technology is 18 years, and amortization
expense will be recorded on a straight-line basis.
Goodwill arising of $197 .0 million, which is not deductible for tax
purposes, has been assigned to the Regenerative Medicine (“RM”)
operating segment. Goodwill includes the values of tax synergies,
assembled workforce and future potential indications for
DERMAGRAFT which at the time of acquisition did not meet the 
criteria for recognition as separate intangible assets.
In the year to December 31, 2011 the Company incurred integration
and acquisition-related costs of $13.6 million (2010: $nil) in respect 
of the acquisition of ABH, which have been charged to Integration 
and acquisition costs in the Company’s income statement.
Acquisition of Movetis
On September 6, 2010 the Company launched a voluntary public
takeover offer for all the shares and warrants in Movetis, a Belgium-
based specialty GI company, at a price of €19 per share in cash.
On October 12, 2010 the Company’ s wholly owned subsidiary, Shire
Holdings Luxembourg S.a.r.l. acquired 99.21% of the shares of Movetis
as a result of the successful tender offer. By November 8, 2010, following
a statutory squeeze-out of the remaining shares and warrants not
tendered in the offer, the Company had acquired 100% of the shares and
warrants in Movetis for a total cash consideration of $592.0 million. The
acquisition of Movetis was funded from Shire’ s existing cash resources.
The acquisition significantly broadens Shire’s global GI portfolio 
and adds growing revenues from RESOLOR, a new chemical entity
indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in
women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. Movetis 
has the rights to RESOLOR in the European Union (“EU”), Iceland,
Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the “Movetis Territory”) and is
entitled to royalties on sales of RESOLOR outside Europe and the US
from Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”). The acquisition also brought to Shire
world-class R&D talent and a promising GI pipeline. On January 10,
2012 Shire also acquired the rights to RESOLOR in the US from J&J.
The acquisition of Movetis has been accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
from Movetis have been recorded at their fair value at October 12, 2010,
being the date of acquisition. The Company’ s consolidated financial
statements and results of operations include the results of Movetis from
October 12, 2010. The Company’ s allocation of the purchase price to
the Movetis assets acquired and liabilities assumed is outlined below:

4 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS continued
(a) Other intangible assets—currently marketed product
Other intangible assets include $317 .0 million relating to intellectual
property rights in the Movetis Territory for Movetis’ currently marketed
product, RESOLOR, for the treatment of chronic constipation 
in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. The fair 
value of RESOLOR for the treatment of chronic constipation in 
women in the Movetis Territory has been estimated using an income
approach, based on the present value of incremental after tax 
cash flows attributable to the asset after deduction of contributory
asset charges.
The estimated useful life of the RESOLOR currently marketed product
intangible asset is 14 years, with amortization being recorded on a
straight-line basis.
(b) Other intangible assets—IPR&D
IPR&D relates to development projects acquired with Movetis, that
have been initiated and have achieved material progress and whose
fair value is estimable with reasonable certainty but (i) have not yet
reached technological feasibility or have not yet received the relevant
regulatory approval and (ii) have no alternative future use.
IPR&D principally relates to RESOLOR for the treatment of chronic
constipation in men ($93 million) and children ($42 million) in the
Movetis Territory. The fair value of these IPR&D assets have been
estimated based on an income approach, using the present value of
incremental after tax cash flows expected to be generated by these
development projects after the deduction of contributory asset charges
for other assets employed in these projects. The estimated cash flows
have been probability-adjusted to take into account their stage of
completion and the remaining risks and uncertainties surrounding their
future development and commercialization. The estimated, probability
adjusted after tax cash flows have been discounted at rates between
12–14% to determine a present, or fair, value.
The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely completion
of the acquired IPR&D projects consist of the ability to confirm the
efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials, and
obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals. The valuation of IPR&D 
has been based on information available at the time of the acquisition
and on expectations and assumptions that (i) have been deemed
reasonable by the Company’s management and (ii) are based on
information, expectations and assumptions that would be available 
to a market participant. However, no assurance can be given that the
assumptions and events associated with such assets will occur as
projected. For these reasons, the actual cash flows may vary from
forecast future cash flows.
(c) Goodwill
Goodwill arising of $27 .9 million, which is not deductible for tax
purposes, has been assigned to the Specialty Pharmaceuticals
operating segment. 
In the year to December 31, 2010 the Company expensed transaction
costs of $6.9 million relating to the Movetis acquisition, which 
have been recorded within Integration and acquisition costs in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income.
The amounts of Movetis’s revenue and losses included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended
December 31, 2010 are $0.3 million of revenues and $17 .5 million 
of pre tax losses.
Acquisition of EQUASYM IR and XL
On March 31, 2009 the Company acquired the worldwide rights
(excluding the US, Canada and Barbados) to EQUASYM IR and XL 
for the treatment of ADHD from UCB Pharma Limited (“UCB”) for cash
consideration of $72.8 million. Included in the recognized purchase
price for the acquisition is further consideration of $18.2 million, of
which $12.0 million was paid to UCB in the year to December 31, 2010.
The remaining contingent consideration was not paid in 2011 as the
relevant sales target was not met. This acquisition broadened the
scope of Shire’s ADHD portfolio and facilitated immediate access to 
the European ADHD market as well as providing Shire the opportunity
to enter additional markets around the world.
The acquisition of EQUASYM IR and XL was accounted for as 
a business combination. The purchase price was allocated to the
currently marketed products ($73.0 million), IPR&D ($5.5 million), 
other liabilities ($0.7 million) and goodwill ($13.2 million).
Acquisition of Jerini
On July 3, 2008 the Company announced that it was launching 
a voluntary public takeover offer for all outstanding shares in Jerini, 
a German corporation, at a price of EUR 6.25 per share. By August 6,
2008 the Company had acquired 80.1% of the voting interests in Jerini
for a cash consideration of $456.3 million. In the year to December 31,
2008 the Company acquired 98.6% of the voting interests in Jerini 
for a cash consideration of $556.5 million, represented by Jerini 
shares, ($539.8 million), the cash cost of canceling Jerini stock options 
($9.4 million) and direct costs of acquisition ($7 .3 million). In the year to
December 31, 2009 the Company acquired the rights to the remaining
1 .4% of the voting interests in Jerini for additional cash consideration of
$10.5 million including direct acquisition costs, such that the Company
owned 100% of Jerini. The acquisition added Jerini’s Hereditary
Angioedema (“HAE”) product FIRAZYR to the Company’s portfolio. 
The acquisition of Jerini has been accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
from Jerini have been recorded at the date of acquisition at their fair
value. Between acquiring the Company’s controlling voting interest 
in early August 2008 and December 31, 2009, the Company acquired 
the remaining voting interests totaling 19.9% of Jerini’s issued 
share capital. The additional voting interests have been accounted 
for as step-acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting.

The unaudited pro-forma financial information above reflects the
following pro-forma adjustments:
ABH:
(i) an adjustment to net income of $49.9 million and $13.4 million for
the year to December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively, to eliminate
the income statement effect of changes in the fair value of ABH’s
preferred stock warrants (which were extinguished on acquisition 
of ABH); 
(ii) an adjustment to increase amortization expense by approximately
$20.0 million and $40.0 million for the year to December 31 , 2011
and 2010 respectively, to reflect amortization of intangible assets,
principally for DERMAGRAFT product technology, over their
estimated useful lives;
(iii) an adjustment to decrease net income by $13.6 million for the year
to December 31, 2010 to reflect acquisition and integration costs
incurred by Shire, and increase net income by $30.6 million for 
the year to December 31, 2011 to eliminate the acquisition and
integration costs incurred by ABH and Shire; 
(iv) an adjustment of $2.1 million and $2.7 million in the year to
December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 respectively to reflect
interest income foregone on the Company’s cash resources used
to fund the acquisition of ABH and interest expense incurred as
result of the partial funding of the acquisition of ABH through the
Company’s revolving credit facility; and
(v) adjustments to reflect the tax effects of the above adjustments,
where applicable.
Movetis
(i) an adjustment to decrease interest income/increase interest
expense by $2.7 million and $3.6 million in the year to December
31, 2010 and 2009 respectively, to reflect the interest foregone 
on the Company’s cash resources used to fund the acquisition 
of Movetis; and 
(ii) an adjustment to increase amortization expense by approximately
$17 .7 million and $23.6 million for the years to December 31, 2010
and 2009 respectively, to reflect amortization of intangible assets
relating to the currently marketed product, over the estimated
useful life of 14 years.
In addition, in the years to December 31, 2010 and 2009 the
calculations of pro-forma diluted earnings per share do not include the
effect of the Company’s convertible bond as it would be anti dilutive 
on a pro-forma basis.
5 TERMINATION OF DURAMED PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
(“DURAMED”) COLLABORATION AGREEMENT
In August 2006, Shire and Duramed, a subsidiary of Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, (“Teva”) entered into an agreement
related to SEASONIQUE, a number of products using Duramed’s
transvaginal ring technology and other oral products (the “Collaboration
Products”). Under this agreement, Shire was required to reimburse
Duramed for US development expenses incurred on Collaboration
Products up to a maximum of $140 million over eight years from
September 2006, and Shire had the right to commercialize these
products in a number of markets outside of North America, including
the larger European markets.
On February 24, 2009 Shire and Duramed amended this agreement
such that it terminated on December 31, 2009. Pursuant to this
amendment, Shire agreed to return to Duramed its rights under the
agreement effective February 24, 2009. Shire also agreed to reimburse
Duramed for incurred US development expenditures in 2009 up to a
maximum of $30.0 million. Shire has no rights with respect 
to the products on which such development expenditures are incurred.
In addition, Shire agreed to a one time payment to Duramed of 
$10.0 million, (which was paid during the first quarter of 2009), and 
to forego royalties receivable from Barr Laboratories, Inc. (“Barr”) 
(a subsidiary of Teva) and cost of goods otherwise payable by Barr 
to Shire in 2009 under the License Agreement between the parties 
for the supply of authorized generic ADDERALL XR, up to a maximum
of $25.0 million. During the year to December 31, 2009 the Company
recorded a charge of $62.9 million to research and development, 
within the Specialty Pharmaceuticals operating segment, to reflect 
the cash payment made in the first quarter of 2009 and other
termination related costs.

In the year to December 31, 2011 the Company recorded impairment
charges of $16.0 million (2010: $nil) in respect of certain IPR&D
intangible assets. The impairment charge has been recorded within

In the year to December 31, 2010 the Company divested DAYTRANA
to Noven. On approval of the divestment in the third quarter of 2010,
the held for sale criteria were met, and the Company recognized an
impairment loss of $42.7 million to record the DAYTRANA disposal
group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs 
to sell. The impairment loss was recorded to selling, general and
administrative expenses in the year to December 31, 2010. The
DAYTRANA disposal group formed part of the SP operating segment. 
Management estimates that the annual amortization charge in respect
of intangible assets held at December 31, 2011 will be approximately
$190 million for each of the five years to December 31, 2016. Estimated
amortization expense can be affected by various factors including
future acquisitions, disposals of product rights, regulatory approval 
and subsequent amortization of the acquired IPR&D projects, foreign
exchange movements and the technological advancement and
regulatory approval of competitor products.

There are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments 
of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax should be
included in the Medicaid rebate calculation. Since authorized generic
launch in 2009 the Company has recorded its accrual for Medicaid
rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable, consistent
with the Company’s interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation.
Shire believes that its interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation 
is reasonable and correct. In addition, from October 1, 2010, provisions
of the 2010 Affordable Care Act provide further clarity, in a manner
consistent with the Company’s interpretation, as to how shipments 
of authorized generics from that date should be included in the
Medicaid rebate calculation. 
However, the CMS could disagree with Shire’s interpretation of the
Medicaid rebate legislation for shipments of authorized generic
products prior to October 1, 2010. CMS could require Shire to apply 
an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and
request that Shire pays up to $212 million above the recorded liability.
However, Shire believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its
interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, and that there would
be a strong basis to limit any additional payment to a level
approximating the full, unrebated cost to the States of ADDERALL XR
(equivalent to approximately $134 million above the recorded liability),
and to initiate litigation to recover any amount paid in excess of the
recorded liability. The result of any such litigation cannot be predicted. 
16 CONVERTIBLE BONDS 
Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 
On May 9, 2007 Shire issued $1,100 million in principal amount of
2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 and convertible into fully paid
Ordinary Shares of Shire plc (the “Bonds”). The net proceeds of issuing
the Bonds, after deducting the commissions and other direct costs 
of issue, totaled $1,081.7 million. In connection with the Scheme the
Trust Deed was amended and restated in 2008 in order to provide 
that, following the substitution of Shire plc in place of Old Shire as 
the principal obligor and issuer of the Convertible Bonds, the Bonds
would be convertible into Ordinary Shares of Shire plc.
The Bonds were issued at 100% of their principal amount, and 
unless previously purchased and canceled, redeemed or converted,
will be redeemed on May 9, 2014 (the “Final Maturity Date”) at their
principal amount. 
The Bonds bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually 
in arrears on November 9 and May 9. The Bonds constitute direct,
unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the
Company, and rank pari passu and ratably, without any preference
amongst themselves, and equally with all other existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.
The Bonds may be redeemed at the option of the Company, at their
principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest if: (i) at any
time after May 23, 2012, if on no less than 20 dealing days in any
period of 30 consecutive dealing days the value of Shire’s Ordinary
Shares underlying each Bond in the principal amount of $100,000
would exceed $130,000; or (ii) at any time conversion rights have been
exercised, and/or purchases and corresponding cancelations, and/or
redemptions effected in respect of 85% or more in principal amount 
of Bonds originally issued. The Bonds may also be redeemed at the
option of the Bondholder at their principal amount including accrued
but unpaid interest on May 9, 2012 (the “Put Option”), or following the
occurrence of a change of control of Shire. The Bonds are repayable 
in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the Company to
settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the
Final Maturity Date and following exercise of the Put Option, by 
delivery of the underlying Ordinary Shares and a cash top-up amount.
In accordance with US GAAP , as the exercise of the Put Option 
could require the Company to redeem the Bonds within twelve 
months of the balance sheet date, the Bonds have been presented 
as a current liability at December 31, 2011.
The Bonds are convertible into Ordinary Shares during the conversion
period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier of: (i) the
close of business on the date falling 14 days prior to the Final Maturity
Date; (ii) if the Bonds have been called for redemption by the Company,
the close of business 14 days before the date fixed for redemption; 
(iii) the close of business on the day prior to a Bondholder giving notice
of redemption in accordance with the conditions; and (iv) the giving 
of notice by the trustee that the Bonds are accelerated by reason 
of the occurrence of an event of default.
Upon conversion, the Bondholder is entitled to receive Ordinary Shares
at the conversion price of $32.83 per Ordinary Share, (subject to
adjustment as outlined below).
The conversion price is subject to adjustment in respect of (i) any
dividend or distribution by the Company, (ii) a change of control 
and (iii) customary anti dilution adjustments for, inter alia, share
consolidations, share splits, spin-off events, rights issues, bonus 
issues and reorganizations. The initial conversion price of $33.5879
was adjusted to $33.17 with effect from March 11, 2009 as a result 
of cumulative dividend payments during the period from October 2007
to April 2009 inclusive and to $32.83 with effect from March 11, 2011
as a result of cumulative dividend payments during the period April
2009 to April 2011 inclusive. The Ordinary Shares issued on conversion
will be delivered credited as fully paid, and will rank pari passu in all
respects with all fully paid Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant
conversion date.

18 LONG-TERM DEBT
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
On November 23, 2010 the Company entered into a committed
multicurrency revolving and swingline facilities agreement with a
number of financial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury
Services Plc (trading as Santander Global Banking and Markets), 
Bank of America Securities Limited, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global
Markets Limited, Lloyds TSB Bank plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland
plc acted as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners (the “new
RCF”). The new RCF is for an aggregate amount of $1,200 million 
and canceled the Company’ s existing committed revolving credit facility
(the “old RCF”). The new RCF , which includes a $250 million swingline
facility , may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on
November 23, 2015. 
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the new RCF for each
interest period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate
of the applicable margin (ranging from 0.90 to 2.25% per annum) and
LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period. Shire also pays 
a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35% per annum of the
applicable margin.
Under the new RCF it is required that (i) Shire’s ratio of Net Debt to
EBITDA (as defined within the new RCF agreement) does not exceed
3.5 to 1 for either the twelve month period ending December 31, or
June 30, unless Shire has exercised its option (which is subject to
certain conditions) to increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive testing
dates; (ii) the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest (as defined in the new RCF
agreement) must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for either the twelve month
period ending December 31 or June 30, and (iii) additional limitations
on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness,
making of loans, giving of guarantees and granting security over
assets. These financial and operating covenants have not had, and are
not expected to have, an effect on the Company’s financial position
and liquidity.
On entering into the new RCF in November 2010 the Company 
paid arrangement costs of $8.0 million, which have been recorded 
as deferred charges and amortized over the contractual term 
of the new RCF . 
The availability of loans under the new RCF is subject to customary
conditions. 
Other long-term debt
During 2007 and 2009 Shire entered into certain multi-year leases for
its HGT business unit at North Reading and Lexington, Massachusetts.
For some of these leases Shire was considered the in-substance
owner of the related properties over their construction period and as a
result Shire recorded assets (being the fair value of the building element 
at inception of the relevant lease) within property, plant and equipment
and the corresponding building financing obligations were recorded
within other long-term debt. The land element of these leases was
accounted for as an operating lease.
In the year to December 31, 2009, on entering into certain of these
leases Shire extended the term of the existing leases at Lexington
Technology Park. This lease extension was accounted for as a
substantial modification of the existing building finance obligation,
whereby the existing liability was derecognized and a building financing
obligation based on the fair value of the liability under the revised lease
terms recorded in its place. The substantial modification resulted in a
non-cash gain of $5.7 million in the year to December 31, 2009 which
was recorded to other (expense)/income, net.
On June 30, 2010, as outlined in Note 12, Shire completed the
purchase of certain properties on the Lexington Technology Park
campus, including the properties held under building finance
obligations. Accordingly Shire applied $43.1 million of the purchase
price for the Lexington campus to extinguish the existing building
finance obligations, recognizing a loss of $3.6 million within other
(expense)/income, net in the year to December 31, 2010.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
(In millions of US dollars, except where indicated)
The Company leases land, facilities, motor vehicles and certain
equipment under operating leases expiring through 2021. Lease 
and rental expense amounted to $37 .6 million, $33.3 million and 
$35.5 million for the year to December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
respectively, which is predominately included in SG&A expenses 
in the consolidated statements of income.
(b) Letters of credit and guarantees
At December 31, 2011 the Company had irrevocable standby letters 
of credit and guarantees with various banks totaling $34.7 million,
providing security for the Company’s performance of various
obligations. These obligations are primarily in respect of the
recoverability of insurance claims, lease obligations and supply
commitments. The Company has restricted cash of $9.2 million, 
as required by these letters of credit.
(c) Collaborative arrangements
Details of significant collaborative arrangements are included below:
In-licensing arrangements
(i) Collaboration with Acceleron Pharma Inc. (“Acceleron”) 
for activin receptor type IIB (“ActRIIB”) class of molecules 
On September 9, 2010 Shire announced that it had expanded its
HGT pipeline by acquiring an exclusive license in markets outside 
of North America for the ActRIIB class of molecules being developed
by Acceleron. The collaboration will initially focus on further developing
HGT-4510 (also called ACE-031), the lead ActRIIB drug candidate,
which is in development for the treatment of patients with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (“DMD”). The Phase 2a trial is on hold and 
clinical safety is under review. HGT-4510 and the other ActRIIB class 
of molecules have the potential to be used in other muscular and
neuromuscular disorders with high unmet medical need.
In the year to December 31, 2010 Shire made an upfront payment 
of $45 million to Acceleron which has been expensed to R&D. 
In the year to December 31, 2011 Shire’s share of R&D costs under this
collaboration agreement were $10.1 million (2010: $2.7 million; 2009:
$nil) which were expensed to R&D. Shire will pay Acceleron up to a
further $165.0 million, subject to certain development, regulatory and
sales milestones being met for HGT-4510 in DMD, up to an additional
$288 million for successful commercialization of other indications and
molecules, and royalties on product sales.
Shire and Acceleron will conduct the collaboration through a joint
steering committee, with subcommittees including a joint manufacture
committee, and a joint patent committee to monitor the development
of HGT-4510 and other compounds. 
(ii) Research collaboration with Santaris Pharma A/S (“Santaris”)
on Locked Nucleic Acid (“LNA”) drug platform 
On August 24, 2009 Shire announced that it had entered into a
research collaboration with Santaris, to develop its proprietary LNA
technology in a range of rare diseases. LNA technology has the 
benefit of shortened target validation and proof of concept, potentially
increasing the speed and lowering the cost of development. As part 
of the joint research project Santaris will design, develop and deliver
preclinical LNA oligonucleotides for Shire-selected orphan disease
targets, and Shire will have the exclusive right to further develop and
commercialize these candidate compounds on a worldwide basis.
In the year to December 31, 2009 Shire made an upfront payment 
to Santaris of $6.5 million, for technology access and R&D funding,
which was expensed to R&D. 
In the year to December 31, 2011 Shire paid success milestones 
and other support costs of $2.5 million (2010: $4.0 million; 2009: $nil)
and $5.3 million (2010: $2.3 million; 2009: $0.1 million) to Santaris
respectively, which were expensed to R&D. Shire has remaining
obligations to pay Santaris $13.5 million subject to certain success
criteria, and development and sales milestones up to a maximum 
of $70.5 million for each indication. Shire will also pay single or 
double digit tiered royalties on net sales of the product.
Shire and Santaris have formed a joint research committee to monitor
R&D activities through preclinical lead candidate selection at which
point all development and commercialization costs will be the
responsibility of Shire.

20 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES continued
(iii) Collaboration and license agreement with Sangamo
BioSciences, Inc. (“Sangamo”) to develop therapeutics 
for hemophilia
On February 1, 2012 Shire and Sangamo announced that they have
entered into a collaboration and license agreement to develop
therapeutics for hemophilia and other monogenic diseases based 
on Sangamo’s ZFP technology. Shire will receive exclusive worldwide
rights to ZFP Therapeutics designed to target four genes in hemophilia
and will also receive the right to designate three additional gene
targets. Sangamo is responsible for all activities through submission 
of Investigational New Drug Applications and European Clinical Trial
Applications for each product and Shire will reimburse Sangamo 
for its internal and external research program-related costs. Shire
is responsible for clinical development and commercialization of
products arising from the alliance. Shire will pay Sangamo an upfront
fee followed by research, regulatory, development and commercial
milestone payments, and royalties on product sales.
(iv) JUVISTA
On June 19, 2007 Shire signed an agreement with Renovo Limited
(“Renovo”) to develop and commercialize JUVISTA. On February 11,
2011, Renovo announced its Phase 3 trial for JUVISTA in scar revision
surgery did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. On March 2,
2011, Shire terminated its agreement with Renovo.
Out-licensing arrangements
Shire has entered into various collaborative arrangements under which
the Company has out-licensed certain product or intellectual property
rights for consideration such as upfront payments, development
milestones, sales milestones and/or royalty payments. In certain of
these arrangements Shire and the licensee are both actively involved 
in the development and commercialization of the licensed product 
and have exposure to risks and rewards dependent on its commercial
success. Under the terms of these arrangements, the Company 
may receive development milestone payments up to an aggregate
amount of $39.0 million and sales milestones up to an aggregate
amount of $54.0 million. The receipt of these substantive milestones 
is uncertain and is contingent on the achievement of certain
development milestones or the achievement of a specified level 
of annual net sales by the licensee. In the year to December 31, 2011
Shire received milestone payments totaling $11.5 million (2010: $nil;
2009: $4.0 million). In the year to December 31, 2011 Shire 
recognized milestone income of $17 .5 million (2010: $8.4 million; 
2009: $8.8 million) in other revenues and $65.2 million (2010: 
$51.1 million; 2009: $29.4 million) in product sales for shipment 
of product to the relevant licensee.
(i) Collaboration with Shionogi & Co. Limited (“Shionogi”) 
for ADHD medicines in Japan
On November 18, 2011 Shire announced that it had entered into an
agreement with Shionogi to co-develop and co-commercialize certain 
of Shire’s ADHD medicines in Japan. Shionogi paid Shire an upfront 
fee and will share costs with Shire in exchange for rights to jointly 
co-develop and co-commercialize the products upon approval for the
Japanese market. Shionogi is a leading Japanese pharmaceutical
company with an expertise in developing medicines for the central
nervous system, among other therapeutic areas. Working together 
with the Shionogi team, Shire believes the path to regulatory approval,
market development and commercialization for ADHD medicines 
will be more effective and efficient. 
Co-promotion agreements—VYVANSE
Shire terminated its co-promotion agreement for VYVANSE with GSK 
in 2010. No termination payment or any other payments were made 
or are due to GSK. Following Shire’ s termination, GSK filed a lawsuit
against Shire in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas relating to 
the co-promotion agreement. GSK is seeking compensation despite 
the failure to achieve the required sales thresholds. Shire believes 
that the lawsuit is frivolous and without merit, and Shire is vigorously
defending itself.
(d) Commitments
(i) Clinical testing 
At December 31, 2011 the Company had committed to pay
approximately $358.6 million (December 31, 2010: $156.2 million) 
to contract vendors for administering and executing clinical trials. 
The timing of these payments is dependent upon actual services
performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrolment
levels and related activities.
(ii) Contract manufacturing
At December 31, 2011 the Company had committed to pay
approximately $86.4 million (December 31, 2010: $108.6 million) 
in respect of contract manufacturing. The Company expects 
to pay $86.4 million of these commitments in 2012. 
(iii) Other purchasing commitments
At December 31, 2011 the Company had committed to pay
approximately $190.1 million (December 31, 2010: $104.1 million) 
for future purchases of goods and services, predominantly relating 
to active pharmaceutical ingredients sourcing. The Company 
expects to pay $184.8 million of these commitments in 2012.
(iv) Investment commitments
At December 31, 2011 the Company had outstanding commitments 
to subscribe for interests in companies and partnerships for amounts
totaling $9.4 million (December 31, 2010: $5.7 million) which may all 
be payable in 2012, depending on the timing of capital calls.
(v) Capital commitments
At December 31, 2011 the Company had committed to spend 
$25.4 million (December 31, 2010: $76.0 million) on capital projects. 
(e) Legal and other proceedings
General
The Company expenses legal costs as they are incurred. The
Company recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable losses
when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss. Where 
the estimated loss lies within a range the Company records a loss
contingency provision, based on its best estimate of the probable loss.
Where no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than
any other amount, the minimum amount is recorded. These estimates
are often developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known, so
estimates are refined each accounting period, as additional information
becomes known. In instances where the Company is unable to
develop a reasonable estimate of loss, no litigation loss is recorded at
that time. As information becomes known a loss provision is set up
when a reasonable estimate can be made. The estimates are reviewed
quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are
revised. Any outcome upon settlement that deviates from the
Company’s estimate may result in an additional expense or release 
in a future accounting period. At December 31, 2011 provisions 
for litigation losses, insurance claims and other disputes totaled 
$36.9 million (December 31, 2010: $33.8 million).

20 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES continued
Specific
VYVANSE
In May and June 2011, Shire was notified that six separate Abbreviated
New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) were submitted under the Hatch-
Waxman Act seeking permission to market generic versions of all
approved strengths of VYVANSE. The notices were from Sandoz, Inc.
(“Sandoz”); Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Amneal”); Watson
Laboratories, Inc.; Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (“Roxane”); Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Actavis Elizabeth LLC and Actavis Inc.
(collectively, “Actavis”). Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed
lawsuits for infringement of certain of Shire’s VYVANSE patents in the
US District Court for the District of New Jersey against each of Sandoz,
Roxane, Amneal and Actavis; in the US District Court for the Central
District of California against Watson Laboratories, Inc.; and in the US
District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively “Mylan”). On
December 9, 2011, the District Court of New Jersey consolidated the
Sandoz, Roxane, Amneal and Actavis cases. On January 5, 2012, the
Watson case was transferred to the District Court of New Jersey and is
presently a separate action. The filing of the lawsuits triggered a stay of
approval of all six ANDAs for up to 30 months from the expiration of the
new chemical entity exclusivity. In December 2011 and February 2012,
Shire received additional notifications that Mylan had filed further
certifications challenging other VYVANSE patents listed in the Orange
Book. Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a new law suit
against Mylan, Johnson Matthey Pharmaceutical Materials and
Johnson Matthey Inc. in New Jersey. No trial dates have been set.
INTUNIV 
In March and April 2010, Shire was notified that three separate ANDAs
were submitted under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission 
to market generic versions of all approved strengths of INTUNIV . 
The notices were from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (collectively, “Teva”); Actavis; and
Anchen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Anchen, Inc. (collectively, “Anchen”).
Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed lawsuits in the US District
Court for the District of Delaware against each of Teva, Actavis and
Anchen for infringement of certain of Shire’ s INTUNIV patents. The filing
of the lawsuits triggered a stay of approval of these ANDAs for up 
to 30 months. These lawsuits have been consolidated. A Markman
hearing was held on February 14, 2012. A trial is scheduled to begin 
on September 17 , 2012.
In October 2010, Shire was notified that two separate ANDAs were
submitted under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market
generic versions of the 4mg strength of INTUNIV . The notices were
from Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and from Impax Laboratories, Inc.
(“Impax”). Shire was subsequently advised that Impax amended its
ANDA to include the 1mg, 2mg and 3mg strengths of INTUNIV . Within
the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the US District 
Court for the Northern District of California against each of Watson
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Watson Laboratories, Inc.-Florida, Watson
Pharma, Inc., ANDA, Inc. (collectively “Watson”) and Impax for
infringement of certain of Shire’s INTUNIV patents. The filing of the
lawsuit triggered a stay of approval of these ANDAs for up to 30
months. A Markman hearing has been scheduled for May 30, 2012. 
No trial date has been set.
In February 2011, Shire was notified that Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission
to market a generic version of the 4mg strength of INTUNIV . Within 
the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the US District Court 
for the Southern District of New York against Mylan for infringement 
of certain of Shire’s INTUNIV patents. In April 2011, Shire filed a lawsuit
against Mylan in the US District Court for the District of West Virginia
for infringement of certain of Shire’s INTUNIV patents and dismissed
the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York. The filing of the 
lawsuit in West Virginia did not trigger a stay of approval of this ANDA.
A Markman hearing has been scheduled for June 7 , 2012. A trial is
scheduled to start on September 16, 2013. Shire was subsequently
advised that Mylan amended its ANDA to include the 1mg, 2mg and
3mg strengths of INTUNIV and that Mylan is challenging one of Shire’s
INTUNIV patents that was not challenged as part of the originally filed
ANDA. Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed another lawsuit
against Mylan in the US District Court for the District of West Virginia.
The filing of the second lawsuit triggered a stay of approval of the
ANDA for up to 30 months. 
In March 2011, Shire was notified that Sandoz had submitted an 
ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
a generic version of the 4mg strength of INTUNIV . Within the requisite
45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the
District of Colorado against Sandoz for infringement of certain of Shire’s
INTUNIV patents. The filing of the lawsuit triggered a stay of approval 
of this ANDA for up to 30 months. Shire was subsequently advised 
that Sandoz amended its ANDA to include the 1mg, 2mg and 3mg
strengths of INTUNIV . Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed
another lawsuit against Sandoz in the US District Court for the District
of Colorado. The filing of the lawsuit triggered a stay of approval 
of the 1mg, 2mg and 3mg strengths for up to 30 months. No trial 
date has been set.
REPLAGAL
Mt. Sinai School of Medicine of New York University (“Mt. Sinai”)
initiated lawsuits against Shire in Sweden on April 14, 2010, and in
Germany on April 20, 2010, alleging that Shire’s enzyme replacement
therapy (“ERT”) for Fabry disease, REPLAGAL, infringes Mt. Sinai’s
European Patent No. 1 942 189, granted April 14, 2010. Mt. Sinai
sought injunctions against the use of REPLAGAL in these jurisdictions
until expiration of the patent. Mt. Sinai has been granted
Supplementary Protection Certificates (“SPC”) in respect of the 
patent in certain EU countries (including Sweden and Germany) 
which, where granted, extends the patent until August 2016. 
Where no SPC has been granted, the patent expires November 2013.
Shire filed an opposition against Mt. Sinai’s patent before the 
European Patent Office (“EPO”) on July 23, 2010, and commenced
invalidity proceedings in the UK on December 8, 2010. Mt. Sinai has
counterclaimed alleging infringement in the UK proceedings. A hearing
date has not been set for the Swedish law suit. The EPO opposition
hearing was originally scheduled for March 2012 and has been re-
scheduled for July 2012. The UK invalidity and infringement hearing
date is scheduled for May 2012.
On January 18, 2011, the German Court found that REPLAGAL
infringes Mt. Sinai’s patent, and granted Mt. Sinai’s request for an
injunction. Shire has appealed this decision, but no hearing date has
been set. As a result of the supply shortage for the only other ERT for
Fabry Disease, Mt. Sinai had undertaken not to enforce the injunction
in Germany prior to September 30, 2011. On June 30, 2011, Mt. Sinai
extended its undertaking until December 31, 2011. On October 4, 2011,
Mt. Sinai again extended its undertaking not to enforce the German
injunction until March 31, 2012 and on December 30, 2011, Mt. Sinai
further extended this undertaking not to enforce the German injunction
until June 30, 2012.

20 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES continued
FOSRENOL
In February 2009 Shire was notified that three separate ANDAs were
submitted under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market
generic versions of all approved strengths of FOSRENOL. The notices
were received from Barr Laboratories, Inc. (“Barr”); Mylan, Inc., Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Matrix Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, “Mylan-
Matrix”); and Natco Pharma Limited (“Natco”). In December 2010, 
Shire was notified that Alkem Laboratories Ltd. (“Alkem”) submitted 
an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market
generic versions of all approved strengths of FOSRENOL. Within the
requisite 45-day period, Shire filed lawsuits in the US District Court for
the Southern District of New York against each of Barr, Mylan-Matrix
and Natco and in both the US District Court for the Southern District 
of New York and the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
against Alkem for infringement of certain of Shire’s FOSRENOL patents.
In April 2011, Shire and Barr reached a settlement which provides 
Barr with a license to market its own generic version of FOSRENOL 
in the US but only after October 1, 2021, or earlier under certain
circumstances. No payments to Barr are involved with the settlement.
As a result of the settlement, the lawsuit against Barr was subsequently
dismissed. The lawsuits against both Mylan-Matrix and Alkem have
been dismissed, and consequently, each of Mylan-Matrix and Alkem
may enter the market upon FDA approval of their respective versions 
of generic FOSRENOL. No trial date has been set with respect to
Natco and a stay of approval of up to 30 months remains in effect.
LIALDA 
In May 2010 Shire was notified that Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.
(“Zydus”) submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking
permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite
45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the
District of Delaware against Zydus and Cadila Healthcare Limited,
doing business as Zydus Cadila. The filing of the lawsuit triggered a
stay of approval of the ANDA for up to 30 months. A Markman hearing
is scheduled for April 26, 2012. A trial is scheduled for October 8, 2012.
In February 2012, Shire received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter from
Osmotica Pharmaceutical Corporation (“Osmotica”) advising of the
filing of an ANDA for a generic version of LIALDA. Shire is currently
reviewing the details of Osmotica’s Paragraph IV Notice Letter. 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, Shire has 45 days from the receipt 
of the Notice Letter to determine if it will file a patent infringement 
suit. If Shire brings a suit pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman regulations, 
a stay of approval of up to 30-months will be imposed by the FDA 
on Osmotica’s ANDA.
ADDERALL XR
On November 1, 2010 Impax filed suit against Shire in the US District
Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that Shire is in
breach of its supply contract for the authorized generic version of
ADDERALL XR. Shire’s ability to supply this product is limited by quota
restrictions that the US Drug Enforcement Administration places on
amphetamine, which is the product’s active ingredient. Impax is
seeking specific performance, equitable relief and damages. Shire 
has filed a counterclaim against Impax seeking damages and a
declaratory judgment that Shire has satisfied its obligations under 
the supply contract. A trial is scheduled for April 10, 2012.
In February 2011, Shire was notified that Watson Laboratories, Inc.
(“Watson Laboratories”) submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman
Act seeking permission to market a generic version of all approved
strengths of ADDERALL XR. This new ANDA is not covered under 
the existing settlement agreements entered into in November 2007
between Shire and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Settlement
Agreements”). The Settlement Agreements cover a different ANDA and
do not provide any license for Watson Laboratories to sell the products
covered in Watson Laboratories’ new ANDA. Within the requisite 
45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
Watson Laboratories, Inc.-Florida, Watson Pharm, Inc., Andrx
Corporation, and Andrx Pharmaceuticals, L.L.C. for infringement 
of certain of Shire’s ADDERALL XR patents and also for breach of
contract in connection with the Settlement Agreements. The filing 
of the lawsuit triggered a stay of approval of this ANDA for up 
to 30 months. A Markman hearing is scheduled for June 7 , 2012. 
No trial date has been set.
Subpoena related to ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA and VYVANSE
On September 23, 2009 the Company received a civil subpoena from
the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector
General in coordination with the US Attorney for the Eastern District 
of Pennsylvania seeking production of documents related to the sales
and marketing of ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA and VYVANSE. The
investigation covers whether Shire engaged in off-label promotion 
and other conduct that may implicate the civil False Claims Act. 
Shire is co-operating fully with this investigation. At this time, Shire 
is unable to predict the outcome or duration of this investigation.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
(In millions of US dollars, except where indicated)
21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury operations are coordinated by its
corporate treasury function. All treasury operations are conducted
within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by
the Board. As a matter of policy, the Company does not undertake
speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest 
rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on restricted cash, cash
and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange contracts on which
interest is at floating rates. This exposure is primarily to US dollar,
Pounds sterling and Euro interest rates. As the Company maintains 
all of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on a
short-term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed.
In the year to December 31, 2011 the average interest rate received on
cash and liquid investments was less than 1% per annum. The largest
proportion of these cash and liquid investments was in US dollar
money market and liquidity funds.
The Company incurs interest at a fixed rate of 2.75% on $1,100 million
in principal amount convertible bonds, due 2014. 
No derivative instruments were entered into during the year to
December 31, 2011 to manage interest rate exposure. The Company
continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place to
manage the risk. 
Credit risk 
Financial instruments that potentially expose Shire to concentrations 
of credit risk consist primarily of short-term cash investments, trade
accounts receivable (from product sales and from third parties from
which the Company receives royalties) and derivative contracts. Cash
is invested in short-term money market instruments, including money
market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits. The money market
and liquidity funds in which Shire invests are all triple A rated by both
Standard and Poor’s and by Moody’s credit rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with
which it enters into derivative instruments. The Company limits this
exposure through a system of internal credit limits which require
counterparties to have a long-term credit rating of A-/A3 or better from
the major rating agencies. The internal credit limits are approved by the
Board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate
treasury function. The counterparties to these derivatives contracts 
are major international financial institutions. 
The Company’s revenues from product sales in the US are mainly
governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and
relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy
chains. For the year to December 31, 2011 there were three customers
in the US that accounted for 49% of the Company’s product sales.
However, such customers typically have significant cash resources and
as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered acceptable.
The Company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk
associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit
evaluation procedures. However, an inability of one or more of these
wholesalers to honor their debts to the Company could have an
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable in
countries outside of the US is derived from product sales to
government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers.
The Company’s recovery of these accounts receivable is therefore
dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of the
relevant governments. In 2011 the creditworthiness and general
economic condition of a number of Eurozone countries (including
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the “Relevant Countries”) 
has continued to deteriorate. As a result, in some of these 
countries the Company is experiencing delays in the remittance 
of receivables due from government-owned or government-supported
healthcare providers. 
The Company’s aggregate accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, in total and from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers in the Relevant Countries are as follows:

Accounts receivable due from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers in the Relevant Countries of 
$170 million (2010: $126 million) are split by country as follows: 
Greece $4 million (2010: $8 million); Ireland $1 million (2010: $1 million);
Italy $81 million (2010: $60 million); Portugal $14 million (2010: 
$5 million) and Spain $70 million (2010: $52 million).
In 2011 the Company received $193 million in settlement of accounts
receivable in the Relevant Countries—$11 million was from Greece
(including $2.1 million in the form of Greek Government Bonds
(“GGBs”)); $18 million from Ireland; $94 million from Italy; $5 million 
from Portugal and $65 million from Spain.
To date the Company has not incurred significant losses on the
accounts receivable in the Relevant Countries, and continues 
to consider that such accounts receivable are recoverable. 
Other than the GGBs (principal amount $2.1 million, carrying value
$0.7 million as at December 31, 2011) and accounts receivable from
government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers
outlined above, the Company does not hold any other government
debt from the Relevant Countries. Additionally the Company does 
not consider it is currently exposed to significant sovereign credit risk
outside of the Relevant Countries.
The Company continues to evaluate all its accounts receivable for
potential collection risks and has made provision for amounts where
collection is considered to be doubtful. If the financial condition of 
the Relevant Countries or other Eurozone countries suffer significant
deterioration, such that their ability to make payments becomes
uncertain, or if one or more Eurozone member countries withdraws
from the Euro, additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be
required, and losses may be incurred, in future periods. Any such loss
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition 
and results of operations.

21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous countries and as a consequence
has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies
different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. The main
trading currencies of the Company are the US dollar, Pounds sterling,
Swiss franc and the Euro. It is the Company’s policy that these
exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating
transactions in the subsidiary’s functional currency. 
Where significant exposures remain, the Company uses foreign
exchange contracts (being spot, forward and swap contracts) to
manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that are
denominated in currencies different to the functional currency of the
relevant subsidiary. These assets and liabilities relate predominantly 
to inter company financing, accruals for royalty receipts and specific
external receivables. The foreign exchange contracts have not been
designated as hedging instruments. Cash flows from derivative
instruments are presented within net cash provided by operating
activities in the consolidated cash flow statement, unless the 
derivative instruments are economically hedging specific investing 
or financing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation 
into US dollars of the financial statements of non-US dollar functional
subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2011 the Company had 20 swap and forward foreign
exchange contracts outstanding to manage currency risk. The swaps
and forward contracts mature within 90 days. The Company did not
have credit risk related contingent features or collateral linked to the
derivatives. At December 31, 2011 the fair value of these contracts 
was a net asset of $3.0 million. Further details are included below:

22 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT continued
Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair
value amounts. The fair value amounts shown above are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize
upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or ability 
to dispose of the financial instrument. 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the 
fair value of each material class of financial instrument:
� Available for sale securities—the fair values of available for sale
securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for those
investments. 
� Contingent consideration receivable—the fair value of the contingent
consideration receivable has been estimated using the income
approach (using a discounted cash flow method). This discounted
cash flow approach uses significant unobservable inputs, such 
as future sales of the divested product, relevant contractual royalty
rates, an appropriate discount rate and assumed weightings applied
to scenarios used in deriving a probability weighted fair value.
� Foreign exchange contracts—the fair values of the swap and
forward foreign exchange contracts have been determined using 
an income approach based on current market expectations about
the future cash flows.
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)

Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)
In the year to December 31, 2011 the Company reviewed certain of its indefinite lived IPR&D intangible assets (“IPR&D assets”) for impairment 
and recognized an impairment charge of $16.0 million, recorded within R&D in the consolidated income statement, to write down these IPR&D
assets to their fair value. The fair value of these IPR&D assets was determined using the income approach, which used significant unobservable
(Level 3) inputs. These unobservable inputs included, inter alia, risk-adjusted forecast future cash flows to be generated by these IPR&D assets,
contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these IPR&D projects and the determination of an appropriate discount rate to be applied
in calculating the present value of forecast future cash flows. The fair value of these IPR&D assets, determined at the time of the impairment
review, was $108.0 million. 
Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis

Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown above are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or ability to dispose of the
financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of financial instrument:
� Convertible bonds—the fair value of Shire’s $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 is determined by reference to the market price 
of the instrument as the convertible bonds are publicly traded.
� Building finance obligations—the fair value of building finance obligations are estimated based on the present value of future cash flows, and 
an estimate of the residual value of the underlying property at the end of the lease term, associated with these obligations.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses materially
approximate to fair value because of the short-term maturity of these amounts.

23 SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Authorized common stock
The authorized stock of Shire plc as at December 31, 2011 was
1,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares and two subscriber Ordinary Shares.
Dividends
Under Jersey law, Shire plc is entitled to make payments of dividends
from its accumulated profits and other distributable reserves. 
At December 31, 2011 Shire plc’s distributable reserves were
approximately $9.5 billion.
Treasury stock 
The Company records the purchase of its own shares by the ESOT 
as a reduction of shareholders’ equity based on the price paid for the
shares. At December 31, 2011, the ESOT held 4.6 million Ordinary
Shares (2010: 4.4 million; 2009: 5.8 million) and 2.4 million ADSs (2010:
3.2 million; 2009: 4.0 million). During the year to December 31, 2011 
a total of 2.7 million (2010: 0.02 million; 2009: 0.1 million) Ordinary
Shares and 0.8 million (2010: 0.02 million; 2009: 0.02 million) ADSs 
had been purchased for total consideration of $151.8 million (2010:
$1.7 million; 2009: $1.0 million), including stamp duty and broker
commission. 
Income Access Share Arrangements (“IAS Trust”)
Shire has put into place income access arrangements which 
enable Shire ordinary shareholders, other than Shire ADS holders, 
to choose whether they receive their dividends from Shire a company
resident for tax purposes in the Republic of Ireland or from Shire
Biopharmaceuticals Holdings (“Old Shire”), a Shire group company
resident for tax purposes in the UK. 
Old Shire has issued one income access share to the Income Access
Trust (the “IAS Trust”) which is held by the trustee of the IAS Trust 
(the “Trustee”). The mechanics of the arrangements are as follows:
� If a dividend is announced or declared by Shire plc on its Ordinary
Shares, an amount is paid by Old Shire by way of a dividend on the
income access share to the Trustee, and such amount is paid by the
Trustee to ordinary shareholders who have elected (or are deemed 
to have elected) to receive dividends under these arrangements. 
The dividend which would otherwise be payable by Shire plc to its
ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount equal to the
amount paid to its ordinary shareholders by the Trustee.
� If the dividend paid on the income access share and on-paid by the
Trustee to ordinary shareholders is less than the total amount of the
dividend announced or declared by Shire plc on its Ordinary Shares,
Shire plc will be obliged to pay a dividend on the relevant Ordinary
Shares equivalent to the amount of the shortfall. In such a case, any
dividend paid on the Ordinary Shares will generally be subject to 
Irish withholding tax at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may 
be applicable under exemptions from withholding tax contained 
in Irish law.
� An ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access share
election such that she/he will receive his/her dividends (which would
otherwise be payable by Shire plc) under these arrangements from
Old Shire.
� An ordinary shareholder who holds 25,000 or fewer Ordinary Shares
at the first record date after she/he first becomes an ordinary
shareholder, and who does not make a contrary election, will be
deemed to have made an election (pursuant to the Shire plc articles
of association) such that she/he will receive his/her dividends under
these arrangements from Old Shire.
The ADS Depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders 
of ADSs such that they will receive dividends from Old Shire under 
the income access share arrangements. Dividends paid by Old Shire
under the income access share arrangements will not, under current
legislation, be subject to any UK or Irish withholding taxes. If a holder
of ADSs does not wish to receive dividends from Old Shire under the
income access share arrangements, she/he must withdraw his/her
Ordinary Shares from the ADS program prior to the dividend record
date set by the Depositary and request delivery of the Shire plc
Ordinary Shares. This will enable him/her to receive dividends from
Shire plc (if necessary, by making an election to that effect).
It is the expectation, although there can be no certainty, that Old Shire
will distribute dividends on the income access share to the Trustee 
for the benefit of all ordinary shareholders who make (or are deemed 
to make) an income access share election in an amount equal to what
would have been such ordinary shareholders’ entitlement to dividends
from Shire plc in the absence of the income access share election. 
If any dividend paid on the income access share and or paid to the
ordinary shareholders is less than such ordinary shareholders’
entitlement to dividends from Shire plc in the absence of the income
access share election, the dividend on the income access share will 
be allocated pro rata among the ordinary shareholders and Shire plc
will pay the balance to these ordinary shareholders by way of dividend.
In such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by Shire plc in
respect of, and Old Shire and Shire plc will not compensate those
ordinary shareholders for, any adverse consequences including any
Irish withholding tax consequences. 
Shire will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements at 
any time, in which case the full Shire plc dividend will be paid directly 
by Shire plc to those ordinary shareholders (including the Depositary)
who have made (or are deemed to have made) an income access
share election. In such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by
Shire plc in respect of, and Old Shire and Shire plc will not compensate
those ordinary shareholders for, any adverse consequences including
any Irish withholding tax consequences.
In the year ended December 31, 2011 Old Shire paid dividends 
totaling $67 .6 million (2010: $58.3 million; 2009: $45.9 million) on 
the income access share to the Trustee in an amount equal to the
dividend ordinary shareholders would have received from Shire plc.

25 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Shire’s internal financial reporting is in line with its business unit and management reporting structure. In the year to December 31, 2011, following
the acquisition of ABH, an organizational realignment was carried out. Following this reorganization the Company now has three business units
and three segments: SP , HGT and RM. The RM segment currently comprises the ABH business. The SP , HGT and RM reportable segments
represent the Company’s revenues and costs for currently promoted and sold products, together with the costs of developing projects for future
commercialization. “All Other” has been included in the table below in order to reconcile the three segments to the total consolidated figures.
The Company evaluates performance based on revenue and operating income. The Company does not have inter-segment transactions. 
Assets that are directly attributable or allocable to the segments have been separately disclosed. 
                                                                                                                                             SP                           HGT                             RM                    All Other                           Total

(1) In addition to being subject to the Irish Corporation tax rate of 25%, in 2011 the Company is also subject to income tax in other territories in which the Company operates,
including: Canada (16.5%); France (33.3%); Germany (15%); Italy (27 .5%); Luxembourg (21.0%); Malta (35%); the Netherlands (25.5%); Belgium (33.99%); Spain (30%);
Sweden (26.3%); Switzerland (8.5%); United Kingdom (26.3%) and the US (35%). The rates quoted represent the headline federal income tax rates in each territory, 
and do not include any state taxes or equivalents or surtaxes or other taxes charged in individual territories, and do not purport to represent the effective tax rate for 
the Company in each territory.
(2) The permanent difference results from tax deductible amortization available following inter company asset transfers for which the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
is prohibited.
(3) Intra-group items principally relate to the effect of inter company dividends, capital receipts (either taxable or non-taxable) and other intra-territory eliminations, 
the pre tax effect of which has been eliminated in arriving at the Company’s consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes, non controlling 
interests and equity in earnings/(losses) of equity method investees.
(4) Certain of our activities operate under a tax holiday which is effective through December 2021. The impact of the tax holiday is to reduce the effective tax rate 
by 1.7% during 2011 (2010: increase in the effective tax rate by 0.2%; 2009: nil effect).
Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Company files income tax returns in the Republic of Ireland, the UK, the US (both federal and state) and various other jurisdictions 
(see footnote (1) to the table above for major jurisdictions). With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations 
by tax authorities for years before 1999. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions are in the process of auditing the Company’s tax returns for fiscal
periods from 1999; these tax audits cover a range of issues, including transfer pricing, potential restrictions on the utilization of net operating
losses, potential taxation of overseas dividends and controlled foreign companies’ rules.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
(In millions of US dollars, except where indicated)
28 TAXATION continued
The Company considers it reasonably possible that the total amount 
of unrecognized tax benefits recorded at December 31, 2011 will 
not materially decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the
conclusion of audits currently being conducted by various tax
authorities. While tax audits remain open, the Company also considers
it reasonably possible that issues may be raised by tax authorities
resulting in increases to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits,
however an estimate of such an increase cannot be made. 
At December 31, 2011, the Company had a valuation allowance of
$211.8 million (2010: $200.0 million) to reduce its deferred tax assets 
to estimated realizable value. These valuation allowances related
primarily to operating loss, capital loss and tax-credit carry-forwards 
in Ireland (2011: $68.5 million; 2010: $77 .2 million); the US (2011: 
$33.9 million; 2010: $44.5 million); Germany (2011: $80.7 million; 
2010: $49.0 million); and other foreign tax jurisdictions (2011: 
$28.7 million; 2010: $29.3 million).
The net increase in valuation allowances of $11.8 million is principally
due to increases of losses and other temporary differences in European
jurisdictions, as the Company’s management considers that there is
insufficient future taxable income, taxable temporary differences and
feasible tax-planning strategies to overcome cumulative losses and
therefore it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax assets
will not be realized in full.
At December 31, 2011, based upon a consideration in combination 
of the profit history of the relevant affiliates, projections of future 
taxable income over the periods in which temporary differences are
anticipated to reverse, any restrictions on uses of loss carry-forwards
and prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, management believes
it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of
these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances. However, 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could 
be adjusted in the future if these factors are revised in future periods.
The Company is required in certain tax jurisdictions to make advance
deposits to tax authorities on receipt of a tax assessment. These
payments have been offset against the income tax liability within the
balance sheet but have not reduced the provision for unrecognized 
tax benefits.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related 
to unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes. During the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized 
$4.0 million, $1.0 million and $21.3 million in interest and penalties 
and the Company had a liability of $114.5 million and $110.5 million 
for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at December 31,
2011 and 2010, respectively.

29 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS continued
Share-based compensation plans
The Company grants stock-settled share appreciation rights (“SARs”)
and performance share awards over Ordinary Shares and ADSs to
Executive Directors and employees under the Shire Portfolio Share
Plan (Parts A and B). In 2010 the Company amended the rules of the
Shire Portfolio Share Plan effective on a prospective basis for newly
granted awards (the “Amendment”). After the Amendment SARs 
and PSAs granted under the Shire Portfolio Share Plan (Part A & B) 
to Executive Directors are exercisable subject to performance and
service criteria.
The Amendments had the following principal effect on the terms and
conditions of SARs and PSAs: (i) the contractual life of SARs has been
extended from five to seven years, (ii) the vesting period of SARs and
PSAs granted to employees below the level of Executive Vice President
allows for graded vesting rather than mandatory cliff vesting, and (iii)
awards granted to Executive Directors contain performance conditions
based on growth in adjusted return on invested capital (“Adjusted ROIC”)
and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization 
as defined in the Amendments (“Non GAAP EBITDA”), rather than the
previous market based condition of total shareholder return. 
The Company also operates an Employee Share Purchase Plan and 
a Sharesave Scheme.
The following awards were outstanding as at December 31, 2011:
                                                                             Expiration

*Number of awards are stated in terms of Ordinary Share equivalents.
Stock-settled SARs and stock options
(a) Portfolio Share Plan—Part A
Stock-settled share appreciation rights granted under the Portfolio
Share Plan—Part A prior to the Amendments are exercisable, 
subject to certain market and service criteria. Stock-settled share
appreciation rights granted under the Portfolio Share Plan—Part A
subsequent to the Amendments are exercisable, subject to
performance and service criteria. 
In respect of any awards made to Executive Directors prior to the
Amendments, the market conditions are based on relative total
shareholder return. Vesting of awards granted to Executive Directors
will depend on relative total shareholder return performance against
two comparator groups. For one third of the award, the comparator
group will be the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 constituents
(excluding financial institutions) and for two thirds of the award the
comparator group will be a group of international companies from the
pharmaceutical sector. In addition, before awards granted to Executive
Directors will vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that
the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify this.
Where median performance is achieved, 33
1
⁄3% of stock-settled share
appreciation rights will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting
at upper quartile performance.
In respect of any award made to Executive Directors subsequent to
Amendments performance criteria are based on Non GAAP EBITDA
and Adjusted ROIC targets. These performance measures provide
increased alignment to the core activities and strategy of the Company. 
Awards granted to employees below Executive Director level are 
not subject to market or performance conditions and are only subject
to service conditions. 
Once awards have vested, participants will have until the fifth
anniversary (for awards granted prior to the Amendments) or seventh
anniversary (for awards granted subsequent to the Amendments) 
of the date of grant to exercise their awards.
(b) Shire Sharesave Scheme (“Sharesave Scheme”)
Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an
exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before
invitations are issued to employees. Employees may enter into three or
five-year savings contracts. No performance conditions apply.
(c) Shire Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“Stock Purchase Plan”)
Under the Stock Purchase Plan, options are granted with an exercise
price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the enrolment
date (the first day of the offering period) or the exercise date (the last
day of the offering period), whichever is the lower. Employees agree to
save for a period up to 27 months. No performance conditions apply.

(d) Legacy plans—Principally the Shire 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme 
Options granted under this scheme were subject to certain performance criteria, which were based on the Company’s share price or diluted EPS
growth compared to a fixed growth rate. At December 31, 2011 all stock options outstanding under this scheme had met the required conditions
and were exercisable.

Performance shares
Portfolio Share Plan—Part B
Performance share awards granted to Executive Directors under the
Portfolio Share Plan—Part B are exercisable subject to certain market,
performance and service criteria. 
In respect of any award granted to Executive Directors prior to the
Amendments the market conditions are based on relative total
shareholder return. Vesting will depend on relative total shareholder
return performance against two comparator groups. For one third 
of an award, the comparator group will be the Financial Times Stock
Exchange 100 constituents (excluding financial institutions) and 
for two thirds of the award the comparator group will be a group 
of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector. In addition,
before awards granted to Executive Directors will vest, the Committee
must be satisfied that the underlying performance of the Company 
is sufficient to justify this. Where median performance is achieved,
33
1
⁄3% of performance shares will vest, rising on a straight-line basis 
to full vesting at upper quartile performance.
In respect of any award granted to Executive Directors subsequent 
to the Amendments, the performance criteria are based on Non GAAP
EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC targets.
Awards granted to employees below Executive Director level are not
subject to market or performance conditions and are only subject 
to service conditions.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
(In millions of US dollars, except where indicated)
The following assumptions were used to value share-based awards:
� risk-free interest rate—For awards granted over ADSs, the US
Federal Reserve treasury constant maturities rate with a term
consistent with the expected life of the award is used. For awards
granted over Ordinary Shares, the yield on UK government bonds
with a term consistent with the expected life of the award is used;
� expected dividend yield—measured as the average annualized
dividend estimated to be paid by the Company over the expected life
of the award as a percentage of the share price at the grant date;
� expected life—estimated based on the contractual term of the
awards and the effects of employees’ expected exercise and post-
vesting employment termination behavior; 
� expected volatility—measured using historical daily price changes 
of the Company’s share price over the respective expected life of the 
share-based awards at the date of the award; and
� the forfeiture rate is estimated using historical trends of the number
of awards forfeited prior to vesting.
29 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS continued
The weighted average grant date fair value of performance share
awards granted in the year to December 31, 2011 is £18.04.
Exercises of employee share-based awards
The total intrinsic values of share-based awards exercised for the 
years to December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $189.3 million,
$70.3 million and $43.8 million, respectively. The total cash received
from employees as a result of employee share option exercises for 
the period to December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately
$13.4 million, $11.2 million and $14.6 million, respectively. In connection
with these exercises, the excess tax benefit credited to additional 
paid-in capital for the years to December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 
was $29.4 million, $2.9 million and $16.8 million respectively.
The Company will settle future employee share award exercises with
either newly listed common shares or with shares held in the ESOT. 
The number of shares to be purchased by the ESOT during 2012 will
be dependent on the number of employee share awards granted and
exercised during the year and Shire plc’s share price. At December 31,
2011 the ESOT held 4.6 million Ordinary Shares and 2.4 million ADSs.
Valuation methodologies
The Company estimates the fair value of its share-based awards using a
Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate
the fair value of share–based awards include the grant price of the
award, the expected stock-based award term, volatility of the
Company’ s share price, the risk-free rate and the Company’ s dividend
yield. The Company believes that the valuation technique and the
approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate
in estimating the fair values of Shire’ s stock-based awards. Estimates 
of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the 
value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards, 
and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the
original estimates of fair value made by the Company under guidance
issued by the FASB on share-based payment transactions.
The fair value of share awards granted was estimated using the following assumptions:

Non GAAP measures
These Non GAAP financial measures are used by Shire’s management
to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal
comparisons of Shire’s performance to historical results and to
competitors’ results. Shire’s Remuneration Committee uses certain 
key Non GAAP measures when assessing the performance and
compensation of employees, including Shire’s Executive Directors.
The Non GAAP measures are presented in this Annual Report, 
as Shire’s management believe that they will provide investors 
with a means of evaluating, and an understanding of how Shire’s
management evaluates, Shire’s performance and results on a
comparable basis that is not otherwise apparent on a US GAAP 
basis, since many non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items 
that Shire’s management believe are not indicative of the core
performance of the business may not be excluded when preparing
financial measures under US GAAP . 
These Non GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation 
from, as substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared 
in accordance with US GAAP .
Where applicable the following items, including their tax effect, have
been excluded from 2011, 2010 and 2009 Non GAAP earnings.
Amortization and asset impairments:
� intangible asset amortization and impairment charges; and
� other than temporary impairment of investments.
Acquisitions and integration activities:
� upfront payments and milestones in respect of in-licensed and
acquired products;
� costs associated with acquisitions, including transaction costs, 
fair value adjustments on contingent consideration and acquired
inventory; 
� costs associated with the integration of companies; and
� non controlling interests in consolidated variable interest entities.
Divestments, reorganizations and discontinued operations:
� gains and losses on the sale of non-core assets;
� costs associated with restructuring and reorganization activities;
� termination costs; and
� income/(losses) from discontinued operations.
Depreciation, which is included in Cost of product sales, R&D and
SG&A costs in our US GAAP results, has been separately disclosed 
for the presentation of 2011, 2010 and 2009 Non GAAP earnings. 
Cash generation represents net cash provided by operating activities,
excluding up front and milestone payments for in-licensed and acquired
products, tax and interest payments.
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities,
excluding up front and milestone payments for in-licensed and 
acquired products, but including capital expenditure in the ordinary
course of business.
Non GAAP EBITDA represents Non GAAP operating income before
depreciation.
Non GAAP ROIC aims to measure true underlying economic
performance of the Group, by making a number of adjustments to
ROIC as derived from Shire’s Non GAAP financial results including:
� adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses,
intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease costs
incurred in the period;
� capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historic, cumulative R&D,
IPR&D, intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease
costs which previously have been expensed;
� deducting from Non GAAP operating income an amortization charge
for the above capitalized costs, based on the estimated commercial
lives of the relevant products; 
� excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of non-
operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-strategic
investments); and
� taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying 
Non GAAP tax rate.

Shareholder information
Electronic communication
Shire will communicate with those shareholders who have elected or
who are deemed to have elected to receive documents electronically
by publishing documents on its website and will write to shareholders
to inform them of the availability of these documents on Shire’s website.
Alternatively, shareholders can elect to receive electronic notification 
of Company communications. Instead of a letter, an email will be 
sent to the shareholder’s email address with a link to the documents 
on Shire’s website. To effect this, you must register free of charge at
www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio by following the online instructions.
The advantages of electronic communication are:
� receiving shareholder information speedily and efficiently;
� reducing the demand on natural resources; and
� helping your Company reduce its costs.
Shareholders who do not elect to receive documents or notifications
electronically will receive paper copies of materials.
Shareholder security
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning
investment matters. These are typically from overseas based brokers
who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them, what often turn 
out to be worthless, or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice,
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. 
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
� make sure you get the name of the person and organization;
� check that they are properly authorized by the FSA before getting
involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register/; and
� report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 
or by completing an online form at:
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/form.shtml
If you deal with an unauthorized firm, you will not be eligible to receive
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses 
will be included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found 
on the FSA website.

Dividends
Shareholders are able to choose how they receive their dividends:
� directly into their bank account*; or 
� by cheque.
*Shire preferred option.
Shire preferred option
The quickest and most efficient way to receive your dividends is 
to have them paid directly into your bank account. Those selecting 
this payment method receive a tax voucher with each payment. 
To change how you receive your dividends, either log on to:
www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio or contact Equiniti. 
Income Access Share (“IAS”) arrangements
Shareholders who elect, or are deemed to have elected, to receive 
their dividends via the IAS arrangements will receive their dividends
from a UK source (rather than directly from the Company which 
is an Irish tax resident company) for UK tax purposes. 
Shareholders who hold 25,000 or fewer shares at the first dividend
record date after becoming a shareholder in the Company will be
deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the IAS
arrangements, unless they elect otherwise.
Shareholders who hold more than 25,000 shares and who wish to
receive their dividends from a UK source must make an IAS election. 
All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked.
Unless shareholders have made an IAS election, or are deemed to
have made an IAS election, dividends will be received from an Irish
source and will be taxed accordingly. 
ShareGift
Shareholders with a small number of shares, the value of which makes
it uneconomical to sell, may wish to consider donating them to the
charity ShareGift (registered charity no. 1052686). Donated shares 
are aggregated and sold by ShareGift, the proceeds being passed 
on to a wide range of charities. Find out more about ShareGift at:
www.sharegift.org or by telephoning ShareGift on +44 (0)20 7930 3737 .

The Directors present their Annual Report and the audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Principal activity and business review
Shire plc (the “Company”) is the parent company of the Shire Group
(the “Group” or “Shire”), the principal activity of which is the research
and development, manufacture, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical
products.
Shire’s strategic goal is to be the world’s leading specialty
biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of 
the specialist physician. Shire focuses its business on attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), human genetic therapies (“HGT”),
gastrointestinal (“GI”) diseases and regenerative medicine (“RM”), as
well as opportunities in other therapeutic areas to the extent they arise
through acquisitions. Shire’s in-licensing, merger and acquisition efforts
are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual
property protection and global rights. Shire believes that a carefully
selected and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned
and relatively small-scale sales forces will deliver strong results. 
The principal legislation under which the Company operates is
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and regulations made thereunder. 
The Ordinary Shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock
Exchange, and American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) representing three
Ordinary Shares of the Company, (evidenced by an American Depositary
Receipt issued by Shire’s Depositary, Citibank, N.A.) are listed on 
the NASDAQ Global Select Market in the United States of America.
Business review
The Business review of the Group can be found in the consolidated
financial statements and Annual Report and Accounts of the Company
for the year to December 31, 2011, prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Listing Authority requirements (the “Shire Annual Report”);
in the Chairman’s review on pages 6 and 7; the Chief Executive
Officer’s review on pages 8 to 11; and the Financial review on pages 
12 to 41. The Financial review also provides a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company and the Group 
as well as the Group’s risk management objectives and policies that 
are in place to assist in mitigating the potential impact. Details of the
Company’s financial risks can be found in Note M on page 146 to 
these financial statements.
During the year the Company continued in its capacity as the parent
company for the Group in the management of its subsidiaries.
The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland.
Key performance indicators 
The Company’s key performance indicators are the same as the
Group’s. For details of the Group’s key performance indicators see
page 22 in the Financial review included in the Shire Annual Report.
Income Access Share arrangements
In 2008 Shire put in place and continues to operate Income Access
Share (“IAS”) arrangements enabling shareholders to choose whether
they receive their dividends from a company tax resident in the
Republic of Ireland or from a company tax resident in the United
Kingdom (“UK”). Further details in respect of the IAS arrangements 
can be found in Note 23 of the Shire Annual Report.
Results and dividends
A loss on ordinary activities before taxation of $88.3 million was
recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended
December 31, 2010: $86.7 million).
The net assets of the Company decreased from $9,664.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2010 to $9,646.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily as a result of the loss the Company made
during 2011.
Dividends paid and dividend policy
The Company paid dividends amounting to $6.2 million in the year
(2010: $3.7 million). In accordance with IAS arrangements, the
Company directed Shire Biopharmaceuticals Holdings, which prior to
the Scheme of Arrangement in 2008 was the former parent company
of the Group, (“Old Shire”), to pay dividends totaling $67 .6 million 
2010: $58.3 million) to those shareholders who choose to receive their
dividends from a company tax resident in the UK.
A first interim dividend for the first half of 2011 of 2.48 US cents 
(1.52 pence) per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 7 .44 US cents per ADS,
was paid in October 2011. The Board has resolved to pay a second
interim dividend of 12.59 US cents (7 .96 pence) per Ordinary Share
equivalent to 37 .77 US cents per ADS for the six months to December
31, 2011.
This is consistent with Shire’s stated policy of paying a dividend semi-
annually, set in US cents per Ordinary Share. Typically, the first interim
payment each year will be higher than the previous year’s first interim
USD dividend. Dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by 
the Board when the second interim dividend is determined.
Liquidity, cash flow and going concern
The Company and the Group’s business activities, together with the
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position
are set out in the Chairman’s review, Chief Executive Officer’s review
and Financial review on pages 6 to 41 of the Shire Annual Report. 
The financial position of the Company and the Group, its cash flows,
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Liquidity
and capital resources section of the Financial review of the Shire Annual
Report. The Financial review also includes information in respect of the
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital; its
financial risk management objectives; details of its hedging activity; and
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. Details of the Company’s
financial instruments are disclosed in Note M on page 146 to these
financial statements.
The Group’s balance sheet includes $620.0 million of cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 2011. Substantially all of the Group’s debt
relates to its $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bond (the “Bonds”) which
matures in 2014, although these Bonds include a Put Option which
could require repayment of the Bonds in May 2012. In addition, the
Group has committed multicurrency revolving and swingline facilities 
of $1,200 million which mature in 2015 and are currently undrawn (the
“RCF”). At February 21, 2012 the Bonds were trading at above par, and
the Company does not currently consider it likely that the Put Option
will be exercised in 2012. However, if the Bonds were redeemed in
2012, the Group’s operating cash flow together with available cash,
cash equivalents and the RCF would be sufficient to enable repayment
of the Bonds. In lieu of settling any such redemption wholly in cash, the
terms of the Bonds also permit the Company to deliver the underlying
Ordinary Shares and, if necessary, a cash top up amount.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going
basis of accounting in preparing the report and financial statements.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). The financial statements are required by law to give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the
profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these 
parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
� state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements; and
� prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.

Other ﬁnancial information
c Annual Report 2011
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Shire plc
for the period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 which
comprises the profit and loss account, balance sheet and the related
Notes A to N. These parent company financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
We have reported separately on the consolidated financial statements
and Annual Report and Accounts of Shire plc for the year ended
December 31, 2011, prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom
Listing Authority requirements (the “Shire Annual Report”).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an Auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the parent company
financial statements are set out in the Statement of Directors’
responsibilities. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the parent company financial statements in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the United Kingdom Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
� give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs
as at December 31, 2011 and of the parent company’s loss for the
year then ended;
� have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
� have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
(Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
� proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent
company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
� the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting
records and returns; or
� we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended December 31, 2011
A PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Preparation of financial statements
These separate financial statements of the Company are prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (“UK GAAP”) as at December 31, 2011 and in accordance 
with the requirements of Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They have
been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
Consolidated accounts prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”), in which the financial results and cash flow statement of the
Company and its subsidiaries are included, can be found in the Shire
Annual Report.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
Company’s accounting policies described below, which have been
applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year and
have been approved by the Board.
B ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at historic cost less any
provision for impairment.
Dividends paid and received
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognized
as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period 
in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established. 
This occurs in the period in which the dividends are approved by the
Company’s shareholders, or in the case of an interim dividend, when
the dividend is paid.
Expenditure
Expenditure is recognized in respect of goods and services received
when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. Provision is made
when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event
and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Foreign currency transactions
Items included in the financial statements of the Company are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the Company operates (the functional currency). These financial
statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s
functional and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet dates are
reported at the rate of exchange prevailing at that date.
Share-based compensation
The Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation
plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for
the grant of the options has been valued using option-pricing models.
Options and performance share awards granted without market
conditions are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Options and performance share awards granted with market
conditions are valued using a binomial model. In accordance with 
FRS 20 “Share-based payment”, the resulting cost for the Company’s
employees is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period of the awards. The value of the charge is adjusted 
to reflect expected and actual levels of vesting. The cost for awards
granted to the Company’s subsidiaries’ employees represents
additional capital contributions by the Company in its subsidiaries. 
An additional investment in subsidiaries has been recorded in respect
of those awards granted to the Company’s subsidiaries’ employees,
with a corresponding increase in the Company’s shareholders’ equity. 
The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value at the 
grant date of the awards issued.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to 
the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between 
the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in 
tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognized in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore
recognized only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising on unremitted
earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment
to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Related party transactions
Under the provisions of FRS 8 “Related party disclosures”, as the
consolidated financial statements in which the Company’s results are
included have been made available to the public, the Company is not
required to separately disclose details of related party transactions 
with other Group undertakings in the financial statements.
Pensions
The Company contributes to personal defined contribution pension
plans of employees. Contributions are charged to the profit and loss
account as they become payable. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either
accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Convertible bonds
On issuance, or substitution from other Shire Group companies, of
convertible bonds the Company bifurcates these convertible bonds
into their debt and equity components. The fair value of the debt
component is estimated using the market interest rate for an equivalent
non-convertible bond. The amount allocated to the debt component 
is classified as a liability and subsequently measured on an amortized
cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption of the
bonds. The remainder of the proceeds from the issuance, or the fair
value on substitution from other Shire Group companies, of convertible
bonds is allocated to the equity component, (which represents the
embedded conversion option), and is classified in shareholders’ equity,
net of any income tax effects. The carrying amount of the equity
component is not remeasured in subsequent periods.

Shire 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 
On May 9, 2007 Shire issued $1,100 million in principal amount 
of 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 and convertible into fully paid
Ordinary Shares of Shire plc (the “Bonds”). The net proceeds of issuing
the Bonds, after deducting the commissions and other direct costs 
of issue, totaled $1,081.7 million. In connection with the Scheme the
Trust Deed was amended and restated in 2008 in order to provide 
that, following the substitution of Shire plc in place of Old Shire as 
the principal obligor and issuer of the Convertible Bonds, the Bonds 
would be convertible into Ordinary Shares of Shire plc.
The Bonds were issued at 100% of their principal amount, and unless
previously purchased and canceled, redeemed or converted, will be
redeemed on May 9, 2014 (the “Final Maturity Date”) at their principal
amount. 
The Bonds bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually 
in arrears on November 9 and May 9. The Bonds constitute direct,
unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the
Company, and rank pari passu and ratably, without any preference
amongst themselves, and equally with all other existing and future
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.
The Bonds may be redeemed at the option of the Company, at their
principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest if: (i) at any
time after May 23, 2012 if on no less than 20 dealing days in any period
of 30 consecutive dealing days the value of Shire’s Ordinary Shares
underlying each Bond in the principal amount of $100,000 would
exceed $130,000; or (ii) at any time conversion rights have been
exercised, and/or purchases and corresponding cancelations, and/or
redemptions effected in respect of 85% or more in principal amount 
of Bonds originally issued. The Bonds may also be redeemed at the
option of the Bondholder at their principal amount including accrued
but unpaid interest on May 9, 2012 (the “Put Option”), or following the
occurrence of a change of control of Shire. The Bonds are repayable 
in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the Company to
settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the
Final Maturity Date and following exercise of the Put Option, by 
delivery of the underlying Ordinary Shares and a cash top up amount.
In accordance with UK GAAP , as the exercise of the Put Option could
require the Company to redeem the Bonds within twelve months 
of the balance sheet date, the Bonds have been presented as a
current liability at December 31, 2011.
The Bonds are convertible into Ordinary Shares during the conversion
period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier of: 
(i) the close of business on the date falling 14 days prior to the Final
Maturity Date; (ii) if the Bonds have been called for redemption 
by the Company, the close of business 14 days before the 
date fixed for redemption; (iii) the close of business on the day prior 
to a Bondholder giving notice of redemption in accordance with the
conditions; and (iv) the giving of notice by the trustee that the Bonds
are accelerated by reason of the occurrence of an event of default.
Upon conversion, the Bondholder is entitled to receive Ordinary 
Shares at the conversion price of $32.83 per Ordinary Share, (subject
to adjustment as outlined below).
The conversion price is subject to adjustment in respect of 
(i) any dividend or distribution by the Company, (ii) a change of control
and (iii) customary anti dilution adjustments for, inter alia, share
consolidations, share splits, spin-off events, rights issues, bonus issues
and reorganizations. The initial conversion price of $33.5879 was
adjusted to $33.17 with effect from March 11, 2009 as a result of
cumulative dividend payments during the period from October 2007 
to April 2009 inclusive and to $32.83 with effect from March 11, 2011
as a result of cumulative dividend payments during the period 
April 2009 to April 2011 inclusive. The Ordinary Shares issued on
conversion will be delivered credited as fully paid, and will rank pari
passu in all respects with all fully paid Ordinary Shares in issue on 
the relevant conversion date.

M RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial risk factors
The Company’s risks are managed as part of the Shire Group’s risk
management strategy.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk;
liquidity risk; and market risk (including foreign currency exchange risk,
price risk and interest rate risk).
The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group 
uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group’s financial risk management and principal treasury
operations are coordinated by its corporate treasury function. All
treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and
procedures approved annually by the Board. As a matter of policy, 
the Company does not undertake speculative transactions that would
increase its currency or interest rate exposure.
For further details of Shire’s risk management policies see the Financial
review in the Shire Annual Report.
Credit risk
As at December 31, 2011 the Company had amounts due from 
Group undertakings and other debtors which in the aggregate totaled
$31.7 million. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk from
these amounts is $31.7 million. 
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient 
cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through an
adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Company finances its activities through debt securities and
committed bank facilities, borrowings and the repayment of loans from
Group companies and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals
and cash generated from private and public offerings of equity.
The Company anticipates that its funding sources will be sufficient 
to meet its anticipated future administrative expenses, debt principal
(including the repayment of the Bonds if the Put Option were exercised
in May 2012) and service costs and dividend obligations as they
become due over the next twelve months. In addition, if the Put Option
were exercised in 2012, in lieu of settling any such redemption wholly 
in cash, the terms of the Bonds also permit the Company to deliver the
underlying Ordinary Shares, and if necessary, a cash top up amount.

(i) Amounts owed to Group undertakings are short-term unsecured borrowings from Group undertakings and are repayable on demand.
(ii) Shire $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bonds are due 2014, although they contain a Put Option that could require repayment of these bonds in 2012, plus accrued interest.
Although at December 31, 2011 the Bonds have been included as a financial liability due between three and six months, at February 23, 2012 the Bonds were trading at
above par and the Company does not currently consider it likely that the Put Option will be exercised in 2012. For further details see Note I.
Market risk
Foreign currency exchange risk
As at December 31, 2011 substantially all of the Company’s financial
assets and financial liabilities were denominated in its functional
currency, the US dollar. The Company is not exposed to any significant
foreign exchange currency risk.
Price risk
As at December 31, 2011 the Company held no investments other 
than fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings which are held
at historic cost less any provision for impairment. The Company is not
exposed to any price risk.
Interest rate risk
As at December 31, 2011 the Company held no cash or cash
equivalents or had any trade debtors or creditors which were interest
bearing. The Company had a short-term borrowing of $170.3 million
from another Group company, which is repayable on demand and 
is interest bearing at 0.5% above the US Federal Funds Target Rate.
Interest on this borrowing in the period amounted to $1.1 million 
and the Directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses 
any significant risk to the Company given its size in relation to the
Company’s net assets. The Company had debt at a carrying value of
$1,086.3 million outstanding in respect of the liability component of the
Company’s $1,100.0 million in principal amount of 2.75% convertible
bonds, due 2014 which were issued in May 2007 . The Company incurs
interest at a fixed rate on the convertible bonds.

FRS 29 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” requires a market risk
sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair value of the Company’s financial
instruments and the impact on the Company’s profit and loss account
and shareholders’ equity of reasonably possible changes in selected
market risks. The Company has no financial assets or liabilities 
that expose it to market risk, other than amounts owed to Group
undertakings of $170.3 million. The Directors do not believe that 
a 1% movement in interest rates will have a material impact on 
the Company’s profit and loss account or shareholders’ equity.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended December 31, 2011
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the RCF for each interest
period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate 
of the applicable margin (ranging from 0.90 to 2.25% per annum) 
and LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period. Shire also
pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35% per annum 
of the applicable margin.
Under the RCF it is required that (i) Shire’s ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA
(as defined within the RCF agreement) does not exceed 3.5:1 for either
the twelve month period ending December 31, or June 30, unless 
Shire has exercised its option (which is subject to certain conditions) 
to increase it to 4.0:1 for two consecutive testing dates; (ii) the ratio 
of EBITDA to Net Interest (as defined in the RCF agreement) must not
be less than 4.0:1, for either the twelve month period ending December
31, or June 30,; and (iii) additional limitations on the creation of liens,
disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness, making of loans, giving
of guarantees and granting security over assets. The financial and
operating covenants have not had, and are not expected to have, 
an effect on the Company’s financial position and liquidity.
The availability of loans under the RCF is subject to customary
conditions.
Fees for the arrangement of the RCF and ongoing commitment 
fees are borne by another Group company.

represents the composite fair value for both the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds, whereas the carrying amount represents only the liability component.
Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, which includes
borrowings disclosed in Note I, issued capital, reserves and retained
earnings as disclosed in Note L. The Company manages its capital 
to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a 
going concern and to ensure the Group has sufficient capital available
to meet future funding requirements. The Group had net debt, as
determined under US GAAP , of $488.2 million at December 31, 2011
(2010: $557 .8 million), which is low relative to its market capitalization,
and positions the Group to take advantage of any opportunities that
might arise to develop the business. Details of funding requirements 
are explained in the Liquidity and capital resources section of the
Financial review in the Shire Annual Report.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital
requirements.

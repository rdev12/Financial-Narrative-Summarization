OUR 
KEY 
BRANDS
Wolseley is a brand-focused business.
Wolseley is an international business, operating 3,920 branches 
in 13 countries in Europe and North America and employing some
60,000 people. 
Although the Wolseley name is well-known amongst our investor
community, it is not universally familiar to all of our customers. That is
because our strength is to operate leading national businesses in home
markets, with strong local brands, and continually exceed customer
expectations through wider product ranges and superior service.
The brands you see here are all recognised and trusted in their 
home markets.

The figures you see in this Annual Report represent yet another excellent
performance. 2004/05 was a year to remember, one where we achieved
high levels of growth whilst also shaping the business for continued
success in the future.
Although we made many acquisitions during the year and the Board 
is delighted at the progress made in this regard, we are particularly
pleased with organic growth of 8.7% in sales.
In North America, our companies recorded remarkable achievements. 
We further enhanced our leading positions with skill and commitment in 
a positive market. The American businesses performed well in delivering
strong organic growth and Ferguson started the successful roll-out 
of the XpressNet branch concept and invested for future growth in
expanding our distribution network and new branches.
We are pleased with the performance in the UK and Ireland, where 
we again achieved double-digit growth. We completed the acquisition 
of Brooks Group Limited in Ireland and it has been good to see the
business integrating so well into the Wolseley family. In Continental
Europe, the operating companies generally performed well in flat 
market conditions.
Organisational changes
In recent months we have announced the establishment of the new 
North American organisation, under the leadership of Chip Hornsby. 
We now have two regional business structures, North America and
Europe, supported by Group management giving leadership in areas
such as strategy, mergers & acquisitions, finance and administration,
human resource management, purchasing, IT and legal. This is a Group
structure towards which we have been working for some time. It is a fine
platform for the future, enabling us to exploit opportunities and synergies
within each region as well as between regions, whilst still allowing
management to run their businesses locally and to recognise market
opportunities within their own geographies.
Dividend
With our earnings per share before goodwill amortisation rising 
14.8% to 85.93 pence, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 
17.6 pence, which represents a total dividend for the year of 26.4 pence.
This is an increase of 10.9% over the total dividend paid last year.
The Board
There have been three major changes to your Board during the year.
Early in the financial year, Jacques Descours stepped down from the
Board ahead of his retirement from Wolseley in 2005. Jacques brought
great knowledge and experience to the boardroom and I would like to
place on record our appreciation of his hard work. We wish him well.
Gérard Legtmann left the Group during the year to pursue other
interests, having laid the foundations for the European organisation.
He was succeeded by Robert Marchbank, a highly-qualified internal
candidate for the post of Chief Executive Europe. Rob has wide
experience of Wolseley, through his time at Ferguson and at Group level
in strategic and IT roles. Rob’s understanding of the different cultures
and businesses around the Group has enabled him to give immediate
leadership to the European organisation as it continues to evolve. I look
forward to working more closely with Rob as he takes his place on a
strong Board.
We have also announced a major change to your Board which will 
take effect next year. Charlie Banks will retire on 31 July 2006, after 
39 years with the Company and will be succeeded by Chip Hornsby,
Chief Executive North America. Charlie has made an outstanding
contribution to the Group during his many years of service and has 
led the Company through an extensive period of growth and change
since 2001.  
The Board is confident that Chip Hornsby will provide the Group 
with the continuity the Company requires over the next phase of its
development and will bring to the role clear leadership, vision and
commercial judgement.
I look forward to working with him in the coming years.
Corporate governance remains an issue for all organisations, none more
so than those like Wolseley which operate on more than one continent.
We have continued to make good progress with compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, one of the most significant recent changes to
American corporate law and we are on target for full implementation 
in the coming year.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their
support over the last year. We rely on the goodwill and commitment of
our suppliers, customers and investors as we continue to maintain our
record of double-digit growth. In particular, I give special thanks to our
60,000 people, each of whom has played their part in this rewarding year.
We face the future with confidence. Our proven strategy, strong local
businesses, supported by the North American, European and Group
organisations, will ensure that we continue to deliver growth and
improvement in the coming years.

year of record results
Group Chief Executive’s review
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  11:25 am  Page 08 Group Chief Executive’s review 09 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
One good year is an achievement and two is
impressive. But consistently delivering record
levels of growth in sales and profits over almost 
a decade is an accomplishment of some note 
and the cause of great pride for me and for my
management team.
As well as delivering this performance we have, at the same time, 
been building the foundations for continued growth and an improved
competitive position in the future.
We have invested and innovated, planned and executed, promised 
and delivered. And the result is a solid platform for sustained growth
across two continents.
Our efforts are increasingly gaining external recognition. We are currently
341 in the Fortune Global 500, are positioned in Forbes’ top 500 and
merit inclusion on their A-List of The World’s Best Big Companies. 
We were also ranked 14th in the European Business Week Fifty and
placed at Number 10 in the ‘Most Admired Companies’ league table 
in the UK’s Management Today magazine. All of this recognition is a 
fine tribute to our people and our companies. 
Our consistent performance has also led to a satisfying advance up 
the FTSE100, from being outside the Index in 2001 to Number 39 
as at 31 July 2005. We believe that this demonstrates the strength 
of our business model and our strategy, which we are continuing to
deploy in order to maintain that success and deliver continued growth
and constant improvement.
Proven strategic drivers
We believe our strategy is working and is
providing the right impetus for present and future
success. We see no point in simply changing
strategy mid-stream. Instead, we have continued
to focus on the six key strategic drivers that have
contributed so much to our success in recent
years: growing through acquisition and organic
growth; continuous improvement; leveraging our
international position; enhancing our business
diversity; developing our human resources; 
and creating innovative solutions to meet our
customers’ changing needs.
Double-digit growth, year after year, is challenging, yet as our
performance demonstrates, is also eminently achievable. We look for 
half of our growth to be delivered by bolt-on acquisitions and currently
aim to spend £225 –£250 million per year. Exactly how much varies 
from year to year, depending on the availability of suitable targets that
are aligned with our strategy and also meet our financial criteria. We 
are constantly looking for new opportunities to develop our business, 
both within our existing countries and elsewhere, as well as looking to
expand the range of products that we sell and the customer segments
that we serve.
The year ended 31 July 2005 saw 26 acquisitions completed for an
aggregate spend of £431 million, with the split of acquisition spend
slightly in favour of North America with 60% versus 40% in Europe. 
Each of these new businesses has real potential, offering substantial
opportunity for future organic growth.
We started the year with a flourish with the £137 million acquisition of
Brooks Group Limited. Brooks is the largest timber distributor and the
third largest builders’ merchant in the combined Republic of Ireland and
Northern Ireland markets. We have now owned Brooks for 12 months
and the integration is proceeding well, with business performance 
ahead of plan.
Then, after a steady year which saw a further nine acquisitions in
Europe, ten in our North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution
and five in our US Building Materials Distribution, we closed the year 
with another large acquisition: Vegas General Construction. This
company is a turnkey supplier of construction materials and services 
to the residential builder in the Las Vegas and Denver markets. In 2004 
it achieved sales of $231 million. Vegas General Construction is a fine
example of how Wolseley is responding to changing customer needs as
we increasingly offer a framing and installation service for housebuilders.
We look for our acquisitions to deliver product and geographic diversity.
In Ireland, for example, our purchase of Brooks means we can now
bring together their timber and building materials experience with
Heatmerchants’ expertise in plumbing and heating supplies so our Irish
customers can benefit from a broader Wolseley offering. We pursued 
a similar route in France, where our plumbing and heating distribution
business Brossette was complemented by the acquisition of building
supplies and timber specialist PBM a little over two years ago.
Sharing ideas across businesses
We continue to transfer the skills and knowledge
gained in one market to meet the challenges 
and opportunities encountered elsewhere. In
North America, for example, Ferguson has taken
the concept of multiple small branches that work
so successfully in the UK and is rolling out their
own version – XpressNet branches – to offer their
customers a new, more flexible service. Across
Europe, companies are expanding their traditional
product bases by learning from their counterparts
in other countries. PBM in France and ÖAG in
Austria, for example, have recently introduced a
tool hire offering to their markets which has been
directly replicated from the Hire Center operation
in the UK.
Continuous improvement is a way of life at Wolseley, as is working
together and sharing ideas for growth and success. We understand 
that there is always a better way to work and we invest time and
resources to identify opportunities for improvement.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:36 am  Page 09 10 Group Chief Executive’s review
Investing for the future
To meet our targets for growth and performance
we can never be complacent. We need to
constantly invest for our future and in this last 
year we have made many substantial business
improvement investments designed to lay 
the long-term foundations for an ever-sharper
competitive advantage. 
The supply chain is being radically transformed by an ongoing major
investment in Distribution Centres (“DCs”) which will allow us to better
serve our customers worldwide. We continue to expand our successful
network of DCs in the USA, and in Europe and Canada we are making
significant investments to adapt and tailor the DC concept to meet 
the specific needs of our customers in these very different markets. 
Back up the supply chain, our global sourcing programmes have already
generated considerable benefits and there is potential for much more.
There are currently around 30 co-ordinated programmes in Europe and
almost 70 in North America, with many more at the planning stage. 
We are also making significant investments in technology that will 
enable us to work faster and more efficiently. The financial management
system, which will generate consistent financial data across the Group,
is now live at Wolseley Canada, Wolseley UK and Stock Building Supply
(“Stock”), with the remaining companies scheduled to follow within the
next few months. We are currently piloting a warehouse management
system, developing a new HR system and are also considering other
software applications, including budgeting, business intelligence and
customer and employee portal software.
Our investment in people continues at a record pace. In 2005 we expect 
to recruit over 1,300 graduates, up from 754 in 2004/05 – these are the
talented, committed people who will underpin our future, ensuring that
the huge investments we are making in the business will have the right
leadership for the future.
Current employees are equally important and we invest to support 
the wealth of talent amongst our leaders and managers. In 2004/05 we
invested £12 million in training and, as part of this, doubled the number
of places available at the Wolseley programmes we run at Darden in 
the USA and IMD in Switzerland. Our objective is simple: to improve the
quality of our people in order to improve the service to our customers
and grow our business.
Our most recent Wolseley Cup – the internal Group-wide competition
that encourages innovation and best practice – focused on ‘Developing
our Human Resources’. What is clear to me from the entries this
competition attracts each year is the energy, expertise and sheer 
spirit that exists across all our businesses. The first three Wolseley Cup
competitions have concentrated on three of the most important aspects
of our business: on customers, on employees and, in the coming year,
‘Adding Value to Internal Communications’.
We aim to meet customer demands by providing
the products and services they need, when and
where they need them, at prices that help them
achieve their objectives. The Cup – and the range
of ongoing initiatives it has inspired – is a snapshot
of how we are continuing to improve what 
we believe to be an impressive track record 
of achievement.

Re-organising for the future
At a time when we delivered record performance
for the ninth year running, we also undertook
major organisational changes to position us well
for the future, demonstrating yet again our ability 
to achieve today, while investing for tomorrow. 
Wolseley UK reported excellent results, recording double-digit growth.
During the year the business continued a major re-branding and 
re-structuring programme, which included a transformation into one
cohesive organisation, with a new headquarters and national distribution
centre being built in Royal Leamington Spa. The re-organisation has
been carried out swiftly and efficiently and we expect it to have a very
positive impact on our future performance.
Early in 2005 I was pleased to welcome Rob Marchbank as CEO of
Wolseley Europe. I have worked with Rob for over 20 years and he has
been a key player in the development of the current Wolseley strategy. 
He knows the Group, he knows our objectives – and I know he will 
be able to work well with our European businesses. We have been
restructuring and reorganising across the region and we are pleased 
that, despite this and fairly flat market conditions, we have nevertheless
grown market share and most of our businesses have delivered improved
performance. I am confident that under Rob and his management team
we will see even stronger performance in the future.
In North America, our businesses have again achieved excellent results
and made big investments in process, distribution and supply chain
improvements. Ferguson aggressively outperformed in its markets, 
and delivered a stellar performance with exceptional organic growth.
Stock had a terrific year with double-digit growth and an expanded
market share. Wolseley Canada grew market share, and achieved yet
another year of growth in double digits – something they have done 
every year since they joined the Group.
The establishment of the new North American organisation at the 
end of the year was an important step to building even further on 
this success. I am very excited by the prospect of all three Wolseley
businesses on the continent – Ferguson and Stock in the USA together
with Wolseley Canada – working more closely than ever before to
accelerate growth and improve customer service. 
The new organisation will be led by Chip Hornsby
until early 2006 when he will begin preparations 
to succeed me as CEO of the Group. Chip is 
a man I have worked closely with for 24 years 
and in whom I have total confidence. In his 
North American role, Chip is able to draw on 
the experience and expertise of Fenton Hord,
President and CEO of Stock, and of Paul
Lachance, President and CEO of Wolseley
Canada, and their respective management teams. 
It is important to emphasise that the three
companies remain distinct businesses and retain
their individual strengths, cultures and identities,
but I know we will see definite benefits from the
new structure.

Achieving today while investing for tomorrow
We have recently announced that I will retire 
from the Company in July 2006, by which time 
I will have spent almost 40 years of my life with
Ferguson and Wolseley. During that time the
Company has gone from strength to strength
and I am really confident that under Chip’s
leadership we will see even further growth 
and greater success.
It is an honour to lead this fine Company and 
I am focused on ensuring that when I handover 
to Chip next year, he will have the strongest
platform from which to continue to build.
I am excited about the investments we are 
making and confident that we are positioned 
to be even more competitive in the years ahead. 
Doubtless there will be challenges, but I am upbeat
about our prospects, buoyed by the knowledge
that our European and new North American
organisations will continue to focus on our key
strategic drivers and strive for our constant 
pursuit of double-digit growth.
Our people are at the heart of everything that 
we do and it is their skill and enthusiasm that 
is behind our ability to sustain growth, year 
on year on year. I thank them for their support, 
their ability and above all for their commitment. 
I am proud of every one of them, proud of 
our businesses and immensely proud of our
achievements during the past year.
This has been a momentous year – and I am
confident that the investments we are making
today will ensure an even more successful future.

Investing in logistics management
We are continuing to evolve and develop the concept
of our Distribution Centres (“DCs”) being at the heart
of our integrated supply chain. We are now rolling
them out across the Group and they are integral to
our ability to improve service and reduce costs. During
the last year we completed work on four DCs in the
USA that provided a further 1.2 million sq ft of space.
In Waterloo, Iowa, USA, we have opened a £15 million
over 600,000 sq ft DC that is helping us improve
service to our branches – and therefore our customers.
With 225 employees and around 60 truck loads
coming in or going out each day, the DC is already
processing products worth some $40 million per
month and provides our branch network with access
to 77,000 different items. Our Front Royal, Virginia, DC
has been expanded and is now serving over 100
locations in the Eastern USA with more than 29,000
discrete items from 200 different suppliers. Over 25
trucks and 1,200 courier packages pass through its
doors daily. We generally achieve our 95% target for
on-time complete deliveries which gives us a real
competitive advantage.
Our Canadian business opened the first of three
planned Regional Supply Centres (“RSCs”) during 
the year. The 42,500 sq ft facility in Burlington, 
Ontario will be followed by a 61,715 sq ft RSC 
in Quebec in October 2005. Locations in 
Western Canada are currently under review.
In Europe we are implementing a logistics strategy that
will result in a more strategic approach to supply chain
management across the Continent. Wolseley UK has
begun work on a new £100 million distribution network
in the UK to complement our three large, existing DCs.
Investing in international synergies 
We search the world for the best products at the 
best prices.
As part of our global sourcing programme, we are
currently rolling out a Common Supplier Strategy 
for Europe to help standardise quality, lower costs 
and improve product availability and choice for our
customers. During 2004/05 we signed a number 
of international agreements with suppliers.
In tandem with this initiative, our European businesses
are working together to co-ordinate brands across
national boundaries. Increasingly, customers in
locations from Paisley to Paris will see similarities
amongst our family of low-cost, high-quality brands
– including Wolseley own-brand products on ranges
sourced from low-cost countries.
We are also looking at ways to leverage our global
buying power and expect to put in place an increasing
number of supply contracts on a global level.

Developing talent across boundaries
Across Wolseley, we currently have in excess of 1,500 people in leadership
and management positions who joined through graduate programmes.
Now moving into its second year, our European Graduate Programme
(“EGP”) is one of the Group’s initiatives to cross international boundaries.
Graduates, who are all multi-lingual, are recruited onto a two-year
programme, spending half their time in the UK and the remainder 
in another European operating company. The objective is to build 
an internationally-minded management cadre able to move effortlessly
between cultures as well as between languages.
The EGP complements a range of dedicated, successful and rapidly
expanding, business-specific graduate programmes. In 2004/05 
we welcomed 754 graduates to the Group, an increase of 228 on 
the previous year. In 2005/06 we expect to recruit over 1,300 graduates.
Encouraging talent across the Group
The 2005 Wolseley Cup focused on ‘Developing our Human Resources’,
reflecting the Group-wide commitment to people and HR-related issues.
The team from Stock took the trophy for its ‘Race for Excellence’ project,
against stiff competition from a further 41 entries. ‘Race for Excellence’ 
was developed to enhance employees’ understanding of their individual
role within the Stock business at 11 branches around Atlanta, Georgia. 
In second place, the team from Wolseley Austria used youth, enthusiasm
and their understanding of their peer group to create a new approach to
school leaver recruitment.
Investing in the talents of our 60,000 people
The Group has a strong commitment to training, with our operating
companies running programmes ranging from product knowledge 
to leadership development.
Sharing talent across companies
The International Assignment project is 
an important way in which expertise can
be shared across the business whilst also
providing individuals with the opportunity
to develop their careers. For example, 
the team responsible for Project SWIFT –
our Group-wide IT initiative – has included
a number of Europeans moving to the
project head office in Newport News,
Virginia, USA.

5.5% growth through acquisitions
During the year we invested a total of £431 million 
on 26 acquisitions. These acquisitions and those 
from last year contributed 5.5% of our sales growth 
in 2004/05.
In Ireland we completed the acquisition of Brooks for
£137 million. Brooks is the best-known timber and
builders’ merchant in Ireland and is a superb fit with
Heatmerchants, the leading Irish lightside distributor. 
In Italy, we purchased Iser Zauli, a long-established
family business in the Romagna and Marche regions
south of Venice. Iser Zauli is an excellent complement
to our Manzardo business and extends our footprint 
in Italy. 
Further notable acquisitions included Parnell-Martin, 
a plumbing distributor with 17 locations in the Eastern
USA, Record Supply Company of Nevada and
California and Duval Matériaux de Construction of
France. At the end of the year we acquired Vegas
General Construction, a turnkey supplier of construction
materials and services. This is Stock’s first entry into
the Las Vegas market – one of the largest and 
fastest-growing housing markets in the USA.
8.7% growth through organic means
More than 160 Wolseley locations were added in the
last 12 months, and around 10,000 new employees
have been welcomed into the Wolseley Group.
At the same time, our businesses have teamed,
shared and supported each other to expand product
ranges, learn new skills and meet customer needs in
new, different and better ways.
In Calais, PBM and Brossette have opened their first
joint branch, enabling customers to source building
materials and plumbing and heating supplies from a
single location. Wolseley UK is following a similar route
and has opened new ‘super sites’ in Middlesbrough
and in Highgate, London, where customers can
access all the company’s offerings, across all
operating brands, on one site.
In the USA, our Ferguson and Stock businesses are
increasingly sharing branch premises, benefiting from
lower costs and access to a broader customer base.
Since the Stock store in Little River, South Carolina,
incorporated a Ferguson Express counter in 2004, 
the location has experienced organic growth of 
18% driven by a 10% increase in walk-in traffic. 
Ferguson is making good progress with the roll-out 
of the XpressNet concept. 55 have come on stream
during 2004/05, with even more due next year.

The level of acquisition spend in each division will vary each year as
opportunities arise. The following chart shows the acquisition spend 
in each division over the last five years:
The Group’s current target remains to spend on average 
£225–£250 million per annum on bolt-on acquisitions. In addition, 
it is envisaged that, if opportunities present themselves, a larger
acquisition should arise every 2 –3 years.
Wolseley has invested significantly in recent years to extend its
geographic footprint, improve operational efficiency and provide a
platform for future growth. Through new branch openings, the Group
aims to bring its offering to new customers, while the extension of the
product range or the branch within a branch concept allows the Group
to extend its sales to existing customers.
FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES
Wolseley is committed to providing long-term value for its shareholders
by pursuing a strategy of competing internationally in the plumbing,
heating and building materials markets and growing through a combination
of organic growth including new branch openings and acquisitions.
The Group’s overall financial aim is to increase shareholder value by
achieving the following objectives:
> To achieve, on average, double-digit growth in sales through both
organic growth and through acquisitions. Over the past five years 
the Group has delivered average sales growth of 12.1% with 11.2% 
in the last year.
> To achieve a growth in profits higher than the growth in sales 
through year on year improvements in trading margin as a result of
continuous improvement in operations. Over the past five years the
Group’s trading margin has increased from 5.8% to 6.4%.
> To deliver an incremental return on gross capital employed at least 
4% in excess of the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. In 
2005 the Group’s return on capital was 19.1%, 7.2% ahead of 
our estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.9%.
> To generate sufficient free cashflow (as calculated on page 33) to 
fund normal “bolt on” acquisitions and expansion capital expenditure.
In the past year free cashflow was £324 million. Over the past five
years average free cash flow was £199 million.
> The Group also seeks to maintain a level of gearing, generally in the
range of 40% to 100%, to strike an appropriate balance between
maintaining an efficient capital structure and having sufficient flexibility
to fund further acquisitions.
The Group’s key performance indicators are as follows:

STRATEGY
Wolseley relies upon six strategic drivers to meet these objectives:
Growing through acquisition and organic growth 
Wolseley’s target is to grow revenues by approximately 10% per annum on
average, with 5% generally coming from acquisitions and 5% generated
organically through new branch openings and increased throughput.
In evaluating acquisition candidates, Wolseley targets businesses that
bring benefits through additional expansion of its branch network and
increased market share or through the addition of new products or
customers. Such acquisition candidates must generally offer the prospect
of sustainable growth in an existing or complementary market, or provide
Wolseley with a platform for expansion into new areas. The Group pays
particular attention to evidence of a sound financial position and the ability
of the target business to grow and produce an adequate return on capital.
After acquiring a new business, Wolseley concentrates on expanding 
the customer base and product lines at each location and improving 
its operational efficiency through purchasing economies, inventory
management and administrative savings.

Continuous improvement 
To achieve double-digit growth and improving margins requires
continuous improvement from all Wolseley businesses. Through
business change programmes such as organisational restructurings in
the USA, France and the UK, together with investment in the Distribution
Centre network, the Group looks to improve the performance of its
operations. In addition, the investment in the common IT platform is
intended to support these and other business initiatives, including global
sourcing, international procurement and supply chain efficiencies. 
Leveraging our international position 
With 3,920 branches in 13 countries, Wolseley has access to a wide
fund of experience and expertise and to the benefits of scale. The Group
seeks to leverage this knowledge by sharing the benefits across the
business. The Group is already establishing the synergies across 
the European and North American businesses in both international
purchasing and global sourcing and is also sharing expertise and
experience across businesses in logistics, showroom formats and
working capital management.
Enhancing our business diversity
The Group aims to widen the diversity of its business by the following
measures:
> Expanding its geographical coverage both in existing and 
new countries;
> Widening its lines of business by entry into new sectors or services;
> Seeking to expand the range of products or services it sells to 
existing customers by introducing them to the operations of other
Group companies;
> Expanding the customer base.
This diversity has enabled the Group to achieve a resilient business
performance over a variety of economic cycles. 
Developing human resources 
The Group relies on its people on the ground to drive sales. It continues 
to expand its commitment to developing human resources, ensuring that
Wolseley attracts and retains the best and the brightest people. Efforts
include the establishment of a programme of management development
at IMD in Switzerland and Darden School of Management in the USA, 
the introduction of a European Graduate Recruitment Programme and
the continued expansion of existing college leaver recruitment programmes.
Over the past three years the Group has invested substantial time and
resources in developing its Human Resource functions.
Creating innovative solutions to meet customers’ changing needs 
Wolseley invests significant resources in anticipating customers’ changing
needs and also in creating new and better ways of meeting those needs.
The Group encourages innovation within Wolseley and seeks to remain
flexible and open to new ideas at all levels of the business.
REVIEW OF RESULTS
Group results
The trading results for the year ended 31 July 2005 are a record for the
Group for a ninth consecutive year. These results reflect strong organic
growth, the additional contribution from acquisitions and increased
operational efficiency and have been achieved whilst also investing 
in people, facilities and technology to secure future growth.
On a constant currency basis, Group sales increased by 14.2% and
trading profit by 19.7%. Currency translation reduced Group sales by
£272.9 million (2.7%) and Group trading profit by £17.2 million (2.8%),
compared to the previous year. 
After taking account of currency translation, Group sales increased by
11.2% from £10,128.1 million to £11,257.7 million. Trading profit rose 
by 16.4% from £619.2 million to £720.8 million. After deducting goodwill
amortisation of £43.4 million (2004: £39.0 million), the reported sterling
operating profit increased by 16.8% from £580.2 million to £677.4 million.
In the North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution division,
Ferguson in the USA achieved organic sales growth of more than 
15% with trading profit up nearly 25% and Wolseley Canada contributed
a strong performance with double-digit sales and profit growth. The US
Building Materials Distribution division (“Stock”) also performed strongly
with an increase in organic sales of over 10% and trading profit up over
32%. Within the European Distribution division, the businesses in the UK,
the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland and Luxembourg also performed well
in their respective markets. 
Profit before tax and before goodwill amortisation increased by 15.6%
from £598.1 million to £691.2 million. Profit before tax increased by
15.9% to £647.8 million (2004: £559.1 million). The increase in earnings
per share before goodwill amortisation was 14.8%, from 74.84 pence to
85.93 pence. Basic earnings per share was up 15.2%, from 68.15 pence
to 78.53 pence.
Trading margin improvements were achieved in all three divisions, 
with the Group trading margin up from 6.1% in 2004 to 6.4% in this
financial year. 
The Group continues to seek acquisitions to expand all areas of its
activities. A total of 26 acquisitions were completed during the year.
Acquisition spend during the period, including any deferred consideration
and debt, amounted to £430.6 million (2004: £123.5 million). The
acquisitions within each division, together with their likely contribution 
to turnover in a full year, may be summarised as follows:
Full year 
Spend contribution 
£m £m
European Distribution 171.4 236.9
North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution 100.1 251.7
US Building Materials Distribution 159.1 283.3

Group outlook
Market conditions in North America are expected to remain favourable
for at least the remainder of this calendar year and should enable the
Group’s North American businesses to achieve further good progress.
It is expected that the US housing market will remain strong although 
the number of housing starts may reduce as a result of higher interest
rates. The positive repairs, maintenance and improvement (“RMI”)
market is expected to continue and the strong US economy should
present further opportunities for organic growth. The improvement in the
industrial and commercial sectors is expected to continue. The upward
trend in the performance of the US Building Materials business should
continue as further benefits of its market focus and restructuring are
realised, although some deterioration in lumber and structural panel
prices is anticipated. 
In Canada, the overall environment is expected to remain positive
although the new residential housing market may fall slightly from 
recent high levels.
In the UK, the private RMI and housing markets are expected to show
modest growth. Positive trends in government spending, particularly 
in social housing, health and education, are also anticipated. In view 
of current consumer caution, the year is likely to prove more challenging
but, overall, the UK business should show gains in market share and
growth for the year as a whole.
In France, growth in the RMI market is likely to remain modest. PBM
should continue its upward trend and both PBM and Brossette, following
recent initiatives to improve performance, should see some benefit from
the strong but slowing housing market and progress in the coming year.
Whilst the markets in the rest of Continental Europe are likely to remain
broadly flat, Wolseley’s operations are expected to continue the generally
good progress achieved this year. 
There are a number of business improvement initiatives in place relating
to supply chain, sourcing and procurement that should deliver increasing
benefits to the bottom line. The Group will continue to pursue its objective
of achieving, on average, double-digit sales and profit improvements
through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, in new and
existing countries. 
The Board expects another year of good progress.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Organisation structure
The Group is organised into three business segments:
> European Distribution
> North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution
> US Building Materials Distribution
With effect from 1 August 2005, the Group reorganised its operations 
in North America to create a North American management team
overseeing the businesses of Ferguson, Stock and Wolseley Canada. 
The aim of this new organisation is to leverage the asset base and to
accelerate organic growth. 
The performance of each of these three divisions during the last financial
year is reviewed below.
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
European Distribution
The division produced 41.2% (2004: 41.9%) of the Group’s turnover 
and 40.7% (2004: 42.5%) of the Group’s trading profit.
European Distribution 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001
Sales (£ million) 4,638 4,248 2,956 2,518 2,371
Trading profit (£ million) 293 263 193 171 158
Growth in sales 9.2% 43.7% 17.4% 6.2% 8.0%
Growth in trading profit 11.5% 36.2% 12.7% 8.3% 8.9%
Trading margin 6.3% 6.2% 6.5% 6.8% 6.7%
Return on gross capital employed 17.8% 17.5% 18.0% 17.6% 17.4%
The results in the European Distribution division benefited from strong profit
performances from Wolseley UK, PBM, Wasco and from acquisitions.
With the exception of Brossette, in France, which had marginally lower
sales, all of the Continental European operations increased sales and
most achieved trading profit improvements, in generally flat markets. 
Sales for this division, in sterling, increased by 9.2% from £4,248.0
million to £4,638.4 million, including £265.7 million (6.2%) which relates
to acquisitions, predominantly Brooks (Ireland) and Klöckner (Austria) in
August 2004 and Iser Zauli (Italy) in January 2005. The organic increase
in sales was 2.7%. Trading profit rose by 11.5% from £263.2 million to
£293.4 million.

The overall divisional trading margin, after the allocation of central costs,
improved from 6.2% to 6.3% of sales due to the achievement by PBM
(France) of a 6% margin for the first time and improvements at Tobler
(Switzerland), CFM (Luxembourg), Cesaro (Czech Republic), Electro Oil
(Denmark) and Wasco (Netherlands). 
In the year, a further net 93 branches were added to the European
network, giving a total of 2,486 locations (2004: 2,393). 
UK and Ireland
Wolseley UK performed strongly against a slowing UK market. Whilst the
fundamentals of the UK economy remained positive, in terms of relatively
low interest rates and low unemployment, RMI spending slowed in 
the second half of the financial year in response to weaker consumer
confidence. Government spending, feeding through into the construction
market, remains a bright spot and the industrial sector continues to improve. 
Against this more challenging background, Wolseley UK recorded an
11.7% increase in sales to £2,353.9 million (2004: £2,106.9 million).
Organic growth at more than 5% outperformed the market generally 
with the plumbing, heating, pipe and bathroom businesses performing
particularly well. 
Wolseley UK’s trading profit increased by more than 11% compared 
to the prior year after taking account of gains from sales of properties 
of £11 million (2004: £3 million). Trading margin fell slightly from 7.8% 
to 7.7%, reflecting the previously announced impact of including Brooks 
for the first time and the higher pension, restructuring and rebranding
costs in the UK business. In addition, there were some initial costs 
of the investment in the new national and regional distribution centres 
(“DC”). The new national DC in Leamington Spa, which is to be located
alongside Wolseley UK’s new headquarters, is expected to be
operational by Autumn 2006 and the regional distribution centre, in the
North West, should open around a year thereafter. These investments
and the current initiatives to centralise control of transport and branch
inventory management, should enhance customer service and support
continued growth in the business. Branch service levels continue to 
show improvements following the ongoing investment in the supply chain.
In Ireland, which again experienced strong growth in their economy,
Heatmerchants produced very strong organic growth of more than 
20% and Brooks, the timber and builders merchant, also traded well
ahead of expectations in its first year within Wolseley.
During the year, 57 net new locations were added in the UK and Ireland
taking the total number of branches for Wolseley UK to 1,570 (2004:
1,513), including 18 branches added as a result of the Brooks acquisition.
As a consequence of the step up in the implant programme, 20% of
locations now offer a broader product range through a multi-brand offer.
France
In France, government tax incentives continue to underpin growth 
in the new residential market, but RMI, the principal driver for both
Brossette and PBM, continue to show only marginal improvement
against the background of little growth in the overall economy, weak
consumer confidence and continued high levels of unemployment.
Wolseley’s French operations generated a 1.2% increase in sales to
12,401 million.
Local currency sales and trading profit in Brossette were marginally
down on the prior year. The results reflect the ongoing disruption 
as a result of the reorganisation of the district, branch and management
structures. During the period, Brossette made a significant number 
of management changes, has commenced the roll-out of its national
product range and is moving towards centralised purchasing. Plans 
for a new regional distribution centre network continue to be developed
to enhance customer service and facilitate future expansion. The first
customer delivery centre opened in June 2005 in the Alps region.
PBM performed above expectations held at the time of the acquisition
with local currency sales up 1.9% and trading profit up 13.8% and
achieved a 6% trading margin for the first time. PBM is continuing to
develop its tool hire business, with four locations having been opened, 
is expanding the number of joint sites with Brossette and seeking
opportunities to benefit from sharing of best practice and common
supplier arrangements. PBM has made further progress during the 
year in improving its working capital efficiency. 
Rest of Europe
The Group’s other Continental European operations enjoyed generally
good results despite broadly flat markets.
ÖAG in Austria, with its acquisition of Klöckner, achieved an increase 
in sales of 13.9% although trading profit fell due to competitive pressure
on prices, as a consequence of difficult housing and RMI markets. This
was further exacerbated by extremely poor weather conditions with very
cold temperatures preventing construction for several weeks early in
2005. In Hungary and the Czech Republic, local market conditions
remained difficult but both businesses improved sales, with Cesaro 
in the Czech Republic also increasing trading profit.
In Italy, despite a weak economy and a fall in the overall construction
and renovation markets, Manzardo’s branch opening programme helped
to achieve organic sales growth of almost 6%. Organic trading profit 
was up 7.5%. Iser Zauli, which was acquired in January 2005, traded in
line with expectations and this acquisition makes Manzardo one of the
largest companies in the Italian sanitary/heating market. During the year
the decision was taken to invest 120 million in a new central distribution
centre in northern Italy to support the growing business there. This
facility is expected to be completed around Autumn 2006.
The difficult economy in The Netherlands continued to affect the
construction and new housing markets but, despite this, Wasco made
good progress expanding its product range, developing its offering to the
more profitable RMI market and focusing on cost control. Wasco achieved
organic sales growth of almost 10% and trading profit was up even more.
In Luxembourg, CFM increased sales by more than 2% and trading
profits by more than 5% although the market has become more
competitive. Tobler, in Switzerland, which was acquired on 1 December
2003, performed ahead of expectations with organic sales up more than 
5% and organic trading profits up more than 17% on the prior year. 
The European Distribution division has made further progress during 
the year in implementing its strategy to manage the businesses in 
a more integrated way across Europe. A number of initiatives are
underway to share best practice across operating companies in areas
such as branch format and product/service offerings. Work began to
rationalise the number of suppliers across Europe and identify suppliers
who will work with Wolseley to remove costs from the supply chain.
Areas of focus include product rationalisation and standardisation and
logistics collaboration. Progress is also being made in sourcing from 
low-cost countries and around 30 product programmes are currently
underway. All of these initiatives are designed to enable the Group to
benefit from cross-border synergies and accelerate growth in Europe.

North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution
The division produced 38.8% (2004: 37.9%) of the Group’s turnover and
41.1% (2004: 40.7%) of the Group’s trading profit.

The North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution division performed
strongly with significant rises in sales and profits and the highest ever
trading margin, which increased from 6.6% to 6.8%, after the allocation 
of central costs. 
Reported sales of the division were up 13.9% from £3,836.4 million 
to £4,370.4 million despite the adverse impact of currency translation.
Trading profit, in sterling, increased by 17.7% from £252.0 million to
£296.5 million.
Currency translation reduced divisional sales by £172.5 million (4.5%) 
and trading profit by £11.6 million (4.6%). There was a net increase of 
171 branches in North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution to
1,179 locations (2004: 1,008).
Ferguson
In the USA, Ferguson produced an outstanding performance generating
strong organic growth from its focus on selected markets, from new branch
openings and driving further commercial advantage from its DC network.
These factors contributed to significant market outperformance in the year. 
Of the sectors in which Ferguson operates, housing-related activity
remained strong with the more positive economic environment benefiting
the RMI sector. RMI is becoming an increasingly important element of
overall construction spend in the USA and, with the new XpressNet
branch format being introduced and the emphasis being placed on
opening new specialist heating, ventilation and air-conditioning branches,
should lead to further growth opportunities. The commercial sector,
particularly smaller hotels, offices and support businesses for residential
construction, continues to improve and although the industrial segment
remains the weakest, it is gradually improving. 
Local currency sales in the US plumbing operations rose by 20.2% to
$7,143.7 million (2004: $5,941.1 million) with trading profit up by 24.8%.
Organic sales growth was 15.2%, including the beneficial effects of
commodity price inflation in products such as copper, steel and plastics 
in the first half although, as predicted, the commodity price inflation did not
continue in the second half. As previously reported, around $12–$15 million
of the organic increase in trading profit was commodity price driven in the
first half of this year, compared with around $30 million in the second half
of the prior year. The rest of the profit growth reflects an increase in the
gross margin as a result of continuing benefits from the distribution centre
network, a focus on organic growth and operational leverage. The trading
margin, at 7.1%, was ahead of the prior year’s margin of 6.8%. The
increased margin reflects the benefits of commodity price inflation, the
change in the treatment of the revenues of the Integrated Supply Division
referred to below partly offset by the additional costs of infrastructure
investment to support future growth. During the year, Ferguson added 
an additional 3,700 employees.
Further investment in the DCs continues and an additional 1.2 million 
sq ft of capacity has been added since August 2004. Two of Ferguson’s
existing DCs were expanded, one was relocated, two new ones were
opened, and one small DC in North Carolina was closed.
The new DCs are a 600,000 sq ft facility in Waterloo, Iowa which opened
in May 2005 and a 120,000 sq ft pipe yard in Stockton, California which
commenced operation in September 2005. Volumes through the DC
network grew by 36% in the year compared to the prior year and around
50% of branch sales now go through the DC network. Further expansion
of the DC network is planned in the current financial year to build on
Ferguson’s competitive advantage and Board approval has recently 
been given for new DCs in Florida and Northern California.
Following last year’s successful pilot of five small XpressNet branches,
the target roll-out programme of 50 new locations to be opened during
the year was exceeded, with 60 open by 31 July 2005. The target is to
open at least another 60 in the current financial year. 
Ferguson’s total branch numbers increased by 168 during the year to
941 locations (2004: 773).
As previously reported, the recorded sales value in Ferguson’s Integrated
Supply Division represents the gross profit rather than the gross sales
value which was recorded in the year to 31 July 2004. This change is 
the result of a review of revised contractual arrangements. The effect of
this change in the year to 31 July 2005, which has no impact on profit, 
is to reduce sales by $203 million. There is, consequently, a positive
impact on the trading margin of Ferguson for the period of 0.2%. 
Wolseley Canada
In Canada, the construction and housing markets continued to remain
strong with low interest rates supporting a strong residential market 
and the buoyant energy sector in Western Canada helping sales in 
the industrial and commercial business. 
Local currency sales increased by 12.5% to C$1,177.1 million (2004:
C$1,046.3 million). More than 10% of the sales growth was organic,
ahead of the market generally. Local currency trading profit rose by
11.8%. Gross margins were affected by competitive pricing pressure 
in some product areas and a change in business mix. 
Investment in Wolseley Canada continues in order to support a 
growing business. The costs of restructuring the Industrial Products
Group affected profits in that business during the year, although the
reorganisation and management changes resulted in an increase 
in sales. Across the company, more than 160 new posts were filled 
in order to sustain future growth.
Further investments were made in new mobile warehouses which are
used primarily to supply plumbing products to commercial projects and
the first of three regional supply centres for larger items was opened in
Burlington, Ontario. Further locations will be added in due course. These
regional supply centres should lead to lower inventory levels and enable
the branch footprint to be utilised more effectively. 
US Building Materials Distribution

18.2% (2004: 16.8%) of the Group’s trading profit.

The performance of Stock benefited from the improved market focus
which was brought about by the recent business restructuring and from
strong organic growth. However, the small benefit from higher average
lumber prices was more than offset by lower structural panel prices 
and the division was also negatively impacted by currency translation. 
Reported sales of the division, in sterling, grew by 10.0% to £2,248.9
million (2004: £2,043.7 million) despite an adverse currency impact of
£109.5 million (5.4%). The division’s trading profit was up by 25.9% 
at £130.9 million (2004: £104.0 million), after an adverse currency impact
of £5.9 million (5.7%). The divisional trading margin, after the allocation
of central costs, increased to 5.8%, from 5.1% in the prior year. The
trading margin for Stock, before the allocation of central costs, increased
from 5.4% to exceed its target of 6.0% and return on gross capital
employed was also substantially higher.
In local currency, sales were up 16.3% to $4,163.7 million (2004:
$3,581.0 million) with trading profit up by 32.4% before central costs.
Organic sales growth was 10.7%. Acquisitions added $199.3 million 
of sales. 
Commodity lumber prices, which directly affect approximately 33% 
of Stock’s product range, held up well. For the year, average lumber
prices of $400 per thousand board feet were 6% up on the prior year
average of $378 per thousand board feet. Structural panel prices,
however, which directly affect a further 13% of Stock’s product range,
decreased by 19% to $403 per thousand square feet (2004: $496).
Together, these commodity price movements had the effect of reducing
Stock’s local currency sales by $16.4 million (0.5%) in the year
compared to the prior year. Both lumber and structural panel prices are
expected to continue their recent trend downwards over the coming
year towards their long term averages of around $340 – $370 per
thousand board feet and $325 per thousand square feet, respectively.
New housing, which accounted for 84% (2004: 88%) of the activity 
in this division, has generally continued to be a bright spot in the 
US economy. Aggregate housing starts during the period continued 
at a high level of around two million. In addition, the inventory of unsold
new homes at four months in July 2005, compared to the longer term
average of around six months, further demonstrates the overall strength 
of the housing market. Market share was expanded or maintained 
in nearly all major cities. There continue to be significant variations in
regional housing markets where Stock operates. The markets in Florida,
the Carolinas, California, Washington DC and Boston have been strong,
whereas Texas, Colorado, and the Midwest have been more challenging.
Stock’s plans to increase the range of value-added products and
services being offered and to increase the penetration of the RMI
market, continue to be implemented. As well as achieving this through
its existing branch network, Stock’s acquisition of Vegas General
Construction (“Vegas”) also contributed. Vegas is a turnkey supplier of
construction materials and services to the residential builder in the large,
Las Vegas, housing market and gives Stock additional installed service
expertise. Overall, value-added sales in Stock were up 25% on the
previous year and, included within this figure, installed business sales
rose around 50%.
Stock’s branch numbers increased by 19 during the year to 255 locations
(2004: 236). Acquisitions provided entry to three states (Connecticut,
New Mexico and Nevada). Stock now operates in 30 states in total
(2004: 27).
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Turnover
After taking account of currency translation, Group sales increased 
by 11.2% from £10,128.1 million to £11,257.7 million.
Operating profit
Operating profit increased by 16.8% from £580.2 million to 
£677.4 million. Trading profit rose by 16.4% from £619.2 million to
£720.8 million, before deducting goodwill amortisation of £43.4 million
(2004: £39.0 million).
Currency translation
Currency translation reduced Group sales by £272.9 million (2.7%) and
Group trading profit by £17.2 million (2.8%). Over the past five years the
constant currency growth of the Group is as follows:
Annual growth in
constant currency 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001
Sales growth 14.2% 29.5% 8.5% 11.0% 6.4%
Trading profit growth 19.7% 37.2% 6.9% 12.6% 1.9%
The effect of US dollar depreciation has been to reduce translated 
US profits by £18.2 million (5.4%) compared to 2004. US dollar
denominated profits account for around 57% of the Group’s trading
profit. There has been little movement in the Euro translation rate. 
Euro denominated profits accounted for around 19% of Group trading
profit in 2005. If the results of the Group are translated into dollars at the
average rate for the respective year the results of the Group are as follows:
US$ million 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001
Sales in US$ 20,843 17,746 13,113 11,608 10,407
Trading profit in US$ 1,334 1,085 754 676 599
Operating profit in US$ 1,254 1,017 707 637 573
Further US$ figures can be found within the Information in US dollars
section on page 96.
Interest
Net interest payable of £29.6 million (2004: £21.1 million) reflects an
increase in Group debt as a result of acquisitions and an increase in
interest rates, partly offset by strong cashflow. Net interest receivable 
on construction loans amounted to £8.7 million (2004: £8.7 million).
Interest cover was 23 times (2004: 27 times).
Tax
The effective tax rate reduced marginally from 27.1% to 27.0%. 
On a UK GAAP basis, it is expected that this rate would have remained
unchanged the next financial year. However, the 2006 financial
statements will be reported in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Further guidance will be provided on the
likely tax rate on an IFRS basis at the announcement, referred to below,
on 22 November 2005.
Earnings per share
Before goodwill amortisation, earnings per share increased by 14.8%
from 74.84 pence to 85.93 pence. Basic (FRS 3) earnings per share
were up by 15.2% to 78.53 pence (2004: 68.15 pence). The average
number of shares in issue during the year was 587.2 million (2004: 
582.6 million).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 17.6 pence per share
(2004: 16.0 pence per share) to be paid on 30 November 2005 to
shareholders registered on 7 October 2005. The total dividend for 
the year of 26.4 pence per share is an increase of 10.9% on last 
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:17 am  Page 32 Operating and financial review 33 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
year’s 23.8 pence. Dividend cover is 2.9 times. The increase in dividend 
for the year reflects the Board’s confidence in the future prospects of the
Group and its strong financial position. The dividend reinvestment plan
will continue to be available to eligible shareholders.
Financial position
Shareholders’ funds increased by £405.0 million from £1,901.9 million 
to £2,306.9 million. The net increase comprised the following elements:
£m
Retained profits 305.5
New share capital subscribed (exercise of share options) 32.7
Purchase of own shares by ESOP trusts (18.6)
Exchange translation (net of tax) 85.4
Increase in shareholders’ funds 405.0
During the year the Group entered into certain foreign exchange
transactions to hedge the Group’s US dollar net assets. Gains and
losses on these transactions were taken to reserves. The gains and
losses are subject to taxation and accordingly the taxation arising has
been charged to reserves.
Net borrowings, excluding construction loan borrowings, at 31 July 2005
amounted to £1,143.5 million compared to £941.4 million at 31 July 2004,
giving gearing of 49.6% compared with 49.5% at the previous year-end
and down from 55.1% at the half year. The movement of sterling against
overseas currencies, particularly the US dollar, resulted in a translation
difference of £62.7 million which increased borrowings on the 
balance sheet
Construction loan receivables, financed by an equivalent amount 
of construction loan borrowings, were £263.9 million compared to
£187.7 million at 31 July 2004. The increase is due to an expanding loan
book partly offset by the weaker US dollar. New markets entered include
Fredericksburg, Virginia and San Antonio, Texas along with new locations
in Salt Lake City, Utah and Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina. 
The Group’s employee benefit trusts purchased two million shares for
£18.6 million, including dealing costs, during the period in order to allow
greater flexibility in the settlement of long-term employee incentives.
Return on gross capital employed increased strongly from 18.4% to
19.1% as a result of the significant organic growth in profit and the
improved working capital performance.
The unamortised balance of acquisition goodwill in the balance sheet as
at 31 July 2005 is £866.1 million (2004: £665.9 million) with the increase
being due to the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year.
Provisions for liabilities and charges (note 19) in the balance sheet 
include the estimated liability for asbestos claims on a discounted basis.
This liability has been determined as at 31 July 2005 by independent
professional actuarial advisors. The asbestos related litigation is fully
covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable
has been included in debtors. The level of insurance cover available
significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit 
or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable
future. There were 235 (2004: 308) claims outstanding at the year-end. 
Details of the pension schemes operated by the Group are set out in
note 33 to the accounts. Were FRS 17 to have been fully adopted in 
the accounts at 31 July 2005, shareholders’ funds of £2,306.9 million
would have been reduced by £97.4 million (4.2%).
Cash flow
The cash flow performance of the Group over the last five years is
summarised below.
2005 2004 2003 2002 2001

Maintenance capex is considered as equivalent to depreciation.
Net cash flow from operating activities increased from £325.2 million 
to £763.6 million, due to higher operating profit and an improved working
capital performance. 
Capital expenditure increased by £84.0 million (54.2% ) on the prior year
to £238.9 million (2004: £154.9 million) reflecting continued investment 
in the business. During the period the distribution centre and branch
network in the USA was expanded, investment continued in the new
head offices in the UK and France and further expenditure was incurred
on the common IT platform. 
Shareholder return
The Group monitors relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for incentive
purposes (as set out within the remuneration report on pages 56 and 57)
and for assessing relative financial performance.
For the year ended 31 July 2005, Wolseley achieved an annualised 
TSR of 40.6% based on the average closing price achieved during 
July 2005, which put it in 4th position against the monitored peer 
Group of 74 companies drawn from the FTSE 100 and the building
materials and construction sectors utilised for the latest award under 
the long-term incentive plan. Details of TSR performance since 2001 
and the composition of the peer group are set out in the remuneration
report. We continue to monitor return on capital including goodwill,
throughout the Group, as one of the key measures of business
performance. Return on gross capital employed (as defined in the Five
year summary on pages 94 to 95) was 19.1% (2004: 18.4%), well ahead
of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, thereby generating
additional shareholder value. At the close of business on the date of the
Report of the Directors, the value of an ordinary share as quoted in the
Financial Times was 1156.0 pence per share (2004: 928.0 pence), an
increase of 24.57%. The market capitalisation of the Group at that date
was £6,845 million (2004: £5,430 million). The total dividend of 26.4
pence per share in respect of the financial year gives a yield of 2.3%.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international
operations. The Group has well defined and consistently applied policies
for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
There has been no change since the year-end in the major financial risks
faced by the Group. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial
instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:48 pm  Page 33 34 Operating and financial review Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
The treasury committee of the Board reviews and agrees policies for
managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These
policies are regularly reviewed. The Group's financial instruments, other
than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and
various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise
directly from its operations. The Group also enters into derivative
transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency
contracts). The purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest
rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its
sources of finance.
Details of financial instruments are shown in notes 31 and 32 to 
the accounts.
Derivatives are also used to a limited extent to hedge movements in 
the price paid for lumber. These options and futures hedging contracts
mature within one year and all are with organised exchanges. The
Group’s policy is to control credit risk by only entering into financial
instruments with authorised counterparties after taking account of 
their credit rating. 
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s 
policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions
be undertaken.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits
and bank and other borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired
currencies principally at floating rates of interest and then uses interest
rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile, so managing 
the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
At the year-end approximately £680 million of the Group’s net borrowings
were at fixed rates for one year or more, after taking account of swaps. 
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at treasury
committee and Board meetings. The treasury committee gives prior
approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible,
cost-effective borrowings structure. The Group’s policy is to ensure 
that, as a minimum, all projected net borrowing needs are covered 
by committed facilities arranged and provided by the corporate office,
supplemented where appropriate by local facilities.
The Group’s strong earnings and low gearing are such that the ratio 
of net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortisation) for the year was 1.37:1 (2004: 1.29:1). This increase
on the prior year is principally due to the high level of acquisitions in 
the year. In the absence of significant acquisitions or exceptional organic
growth, the Group would anticipate having surplus funds within the
medium term. The Group does, however, actively seek opportunities 
to secure long-term funding at attractive rates.
The principal source of funds to the Group is committed bank debt. 
A mix of term loans and revolving credit facilities are used to obtain the
desired currency and maturity profile. During the year, the Group entered
into five new bilateral facilities, four of the facilities were denominated 
in Euros and one was denominated in US dollars; at the year-end
exchange rates, the sterling value of these facilities was £268 million. 
In addition, the Stock syndicated loan was increased by US$100 million
(£57 million) to US$500 million (£285 million), the principal purpose 
of this facility being to finance that company’s construction loan
receivables. This approach has enabled the Group to adjust its funding
profile to match more precisely its investment profile and strengthen 
its relationships with its core banks.
The year-end maturity profile of the Group’s centrally managed facilities
was as follows:
Facility
£m
Less than one year 277
1-2 years 709
2-3 years 378
3-4 years 72
4-5 years 396

Total 1,832
As at the year-end, undrawn committed facilities are as follows:
Facility

Less than one year 200
1-2 years 143
Over two years 48
Foreign currency risk
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are
mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the
operations are located. Approximately 54% of the Group’s sales are in 
US dollars. The Group does not have significant transactional foreign
currency cash flow exposure. However, those that do arise are generally
hedged with either forward contracts or currency options. The Group
does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges
have only temporary effect. Most of the foreign currency earnings
generated by the Group’s overseas operations are reinvested in the
business to fund growth in those territories. The Group’s policy is to
maintain the majority of its debt in the currencies of its operating companies
as this hedges both the net assets and cash flows of the Group.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas
earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of
overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the 
Group are shown in note 30 to the accounts. The net effect of currency
translation was to decrease turnover by £272.9 million (2.7%) and to
reduce trading profit by £17.2 million (2.8%).
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling
exchange rate against each of the major currencies with which the 
Group is involved as follows:
(Strengthening)/
weakening of sterling
US dollar (5.4)%
Euro 0.3%
Commodity risk
The Group’s operating performance is affected by price fluctuations in
stainless steel, nickel alloy, copper, aluminium, plastic, timber and other
commodities. The Group seeks to minimise the effects of changing
prices through economies of purchasing and inventory management,
resulting in cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as
price increases to maintain reasonable profit margins. With the exception
of lumber futures held to hedge future sales commitments, no trading
instruments are held in respect of these commodities. At 31 July 2005,
the Group held lumber futures contracts with a principal value of
$37,000.
Fair value of financial instruments
As set out in note 32 to the accounts, there is no significant difference
between the book value and fair value of financial instruments as at 
31 July 2005.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:17 am  Page 34 Operating and financial review 35 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Market price risk
The Group regularly monitors its interest rate and currency risk by
reviewing the effect on profit before tax over various periods of a range 
of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. On the basis 
of the Group’s analysis it is estimated that the maximum effect of a rise 
of one percentage point in the principal interest rates on the Group’s
continuing businesses would result in an increase in the interest charge 
of approximately £4.1 million. Similarly, it is estimated that a strengthening
of sterling by 10% against all the currencies in which the Group does
business would reduce profit before tax and goodwill amortisation by
approximately £56 million (8.1%) due to currency translation.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have an
impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The Group has an
extensive risk management structure in place which is designed to
identify, manage and mitigate business risk. Risk assessment and
evaluation is an essential part of the annual planning cycle and an
important aspect of the Group’s internal control system. The relevant
structures and processes across the Group are more fully described 
on page 51.
Market conditions in the commercial and residential 
construction and building materials industries
Wolseley’s products are distributed to professional contractors in
connection with commercial, industrial and residential construction
projects and the Group’s results are consequently dependent on the
levels of activity in their markets. The level of activity varies by market
depending on many factors including general economic conditions,
mortgage and other interest rates, inflation, unemployment, demographic
trends, weather, the price of oil and consumer confidence. 
The Group closely monitors both market and geographic trends so as 
to take timely actions to address issues affecting trading. The diversity 
of the Group’s operations and the nature of its customer base also
provide a degree of protection. The Group has a strong track record 
of performance over a number of different economic cycles over the 
past 20 years.
Product prices and availability
The market price and availability of products distributed by the Group,
such as lumber, gypsum, stainless steel, copper, plastic and other
products (or commodities used in such products), can fluctuate. These
fluctuations can affect the operating results. The Group’s businesses
actively review market prices for their supplies and take steps to protect
themselves or, indeed, maximise opportunities arising from significant
anticipated price rises. 
Product shortages may arise as a result of unexpected demand or
production difficulties and this could have an effect on the Group’s
operations. The Group does, however, source products from a wide
variety of manufacturers and suppliers with none of these accounting 
for more than 5% of its total material and supply purchases during the
2005 financial year. 
Competitive pressures
The Group operates in a number of different markets with differing
characteristics. The principal aspects of the Group’s offerings that have
an impact on its competitive position in a market are product availability,
supply chain efficiency, pricing customer service, branch location,
availability of credit, technical product knowledge with respect to
application and usage, and advisory and other service capabilities. 
In its markets, Wolseley competes with and is affected by the actions of
many local and regional distributors together with product manufacturers.
The Group actively works with its customers to find new and innovative
ways to meet their changing needs in order to remain at the forefront 
of its chosen markets. The Group also maintains tight control over its
underlying cost base in order to be able to continue to offer competitive
pricing. Continued investment in people, technology and logistics is
designed to support the Group’s competitive position.
Systems and infrastructure capabilities
Wolseley targets sustained double-digit expansion from acquisitions 
and organic growth. This growth places increasing demands on
Wolseley’s existing systems and on its supply chain and logistics
infrastructure. Additionally, to support and enable future growth, 
the Group is undertaking multiple business change initiatives.
Wolseley actively and carefully plans for its future systems and
infrastructure requirements. The Group continues to invest significantly 
in all aspects of these to support its short, medium and long-term growth
targets. An important component of this planning process is to ensure
that the risks of disruption to the business are controlled and monitored.
Identification and successful integration of acquisitions
Wolseley’s growth strategy is in part dependent on acquiring additional
plumbing and heating, building materials and complementary distribution
businesses. Market consolidation may, over a period of time, lead to
increased competition for targets and as a result higher acquisition
prices or fewer value creating prospects. 
The integration of acquisitions also involves a number of unique risks,
including diversion of management’s attention, failure to retain key
personnel of the acquired business and risks associated with
unanticipated events or liabilities. 
The Group continually reviews and looks for new acquisition targets
through established processes and searches. The status of targeting
and progress in making acquisitions is reported regularly to the Board
and the Executive. Care taken in the acquisition process and the steps
followed by Group businesses in integrating acquisitions has given the
Group a successful track record of integrating acquisitions and achieving
the expected results. The Group continues to expect to find sufficient,
suitably priced acquisitions, to enable it to meet its growth targets.
Governmental regulations
The Group’s operations are affected by various statutes, regulations 
and laws in the countries and markets in which it operates. While the
Group is not engaged in a “regulated” industry, it is subject to the laws
governing businesses generally, including laws affecting land usage,
zoning, environmental (including laws and regulations affecting the
supply of lumber), health and safety, transportation, labour and
employment practices (including pensions), competition and other
matters. In addition, building codes or particular tax treatments may
affect the products Wolseley’s customers are allowed to use, and
consequently, changes in these may affect the saleability of some
Wolseley products. 
The Group monitors regulations across its markets to ensure that the
effects of changes are minimised.
Litigation
The international nature of Wolseley’s operations exposes it to the potential
for litigation from third parties. In the US, the risk of litigation is generally
higher than that in Europe in such areas as workers’ compensation,
general employer liability and environmental and asbestos litigation.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:17 am  Page 35 In the case of asbestos litigation, Wolseley employs independent
professional advisers to actuarially determine the potential gross liability,
which necessitates the application of certain assumptions relating 
to claims development and the cost of settling such claims over the
remaining lifetime of the potential litigants, which is approximately 
50 years. There are a number of factors which could enable actual
experience to differ from the assumptions made. Actual experience is
reviewed against the assumptions each year and the liability adjusted 
in the financial statements.
Wolseley has insurance which significantly exceeds the current estimated
liability. Based on current estimates, no profit or cash flow impact is
therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future. In accordance with
UK GAAP , Wolseley has recognised a discounted liability of £31.7 million
in respect of asbestos litigation. An equal debtor amount of £31.7 million
is shown in other debtors reflecting the discounted sum recoverable from
insurers in respect of this liability.
Human resources
Wolseley’s ability to provide leadership and products and services to
customers is dependent on having sufficiently qualified and experienced
personnel. 
To achieve its growth strategy and increase productivity, Wolseley must
continue to employ, train, motivate and retain skilled personnel. It must
also develop the managers of the future.
Wolseley is committed to developing its employees and actively identifies
employees with high potential and rewards strong performance. The
Group continues to invest significant time and money in senior
management and graduate trainee development programmes. 
Risks related to international operations
Wolseley has its principal operations in North America and Europe and 
is therefore subject to the specific risks of conducting business in these
regions. In addition, there are particular risks arising from managing
operations internationally: 
> fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect Wolseley’s 
reported operating results and its financial position;
> changes in tax regulation and international tax treaties could affect 
the financial performance of Wolseley’s foreign operations; and
> changes in other regulations/treaties may also affect the ability 
of the Group to repatriate profits from its foreign operations.
The management of Wolseley’s businesses and personnel across 
13 countries can also present logistical and management challenges 
due to different business cultures, laws and languages.
Wolseley actively encourages business diversity and has programmes 
in place to share best practice. Increasingly, the Group’s businesses are
working together to meet customers’ needs and to ensure the Group
achieves international leverage.
The Group seeks to manage its foreign currency risk and the steps it
takes are described in the Financial risk management section on pages
33 to 35. The Group actively works with its taxation advisors to minimise
its tax exposure and risk. 
Credit risk
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers and
businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect
outstanding debts.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances with customers are
reviewed by management on a regular basis and resultant mitigating
actions are put in place on a timely basis.
Stock provides loans to finance the construction of properties. The loans
are secured on the properties and are managed by a dedicated lending
team within that business.
Appropriate provisions are made for bad and doubtful debts.
RESOURCES
Wolseley deploys significant resources to maintain, develop and expand
its business. Many of these resources have been built up over a number
of years and are intrinsic to the Group’s commercial strength and
potential for growth.
Employees
Wolseley’s most important resource is its people and their knowledge 
is central to meeting and exceeding customers’ needs. The retention of
key staff is critical to maintaining this customer service focus. Wolseley
invests significantly and increasingly in developing its employees and 
has extensive management and graduate trainee training programmes 
in place. Wolseley also believes it is imperative to reward strong
performance and as a consequence the incentive arrangements are
carefully considered.
The Group has developed a strong, independent and positive culture.
Wolseley employees are encouraged to challenge the status quo and 
to find innovative ways to improve the business and the Group actively
supports such initiatives.
Customer relationships
Wolseley’s relationship with its customers is the cornerstone of its
business. Customer surveys are conducted within each business to
determine the activities that are important to customers and to ensure
that actions are taken to address issues and maximise opportunities.
The Group’s customers range from individual professional contractors 
to major contractors/governmental agencies, all of whom rely on
Wolseley to provide excellent service and availability.
The Group actively works with its customers to find new ways to meet
their changing needs. Increasingly, the Group’s local companies are
working together to provide a seamless service to customers and
mechanisms are in place to share best practice across the Group.
Supplier relationships
Wolseley works closely with its suppliers to provide the products which
customers require on a timely basis and at a cost that is acceptable.
These relationships have been built up over time and the increasing
spend that the Group has with suppliers enables collaboration both to
reduce costs and improve the customer’s experience. It also allows
Wolseley to develop new products with suppliers which more closely
meet customers’ requirements. These relationships also allow the
Group’s new or existing suppliers access to bring their products to a
wider market through the Group’s extensive logistics and branch network.
36 Operating and financial review Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:17 am  Page 36 Market position and reputation
Wolseley is the largest company of its type in the world and occupies 
a leading position in the markets in which it operates. Through this
leadership, the Group can offer the market knowledge, coverage and
scale that enables Wolseley to operate at the best levels of efficiency 
and provide the level of service required by customers. In many
territories in which the Group operates, the definition of a market
comparable to its operations is difficult and reliable statistics as to the
true size of markets are difficult to obtain. However, the Group seeks its
best estimate of its position and its growth relative to the market so as 
to determine its relative market performance in the year. Based on the
Group’s current estimates, its market share is as follows:
Estimated
market
Market share
US (plumbing and heating) 8-9%
US (building materials) 2-3%
Canada (plumbing and heating) 29%
UK 19%
France (plumbing and heating) 16%
France (building materials) 10%
Ireland (plumbing and heating) 20%
Ireland (building materials) 7%
Austria (plumbing and heating) 28%
Czech Republic 8%
Hungary 10%
Luxembourg 30%
Netherlands 20%
Italy 2%
Switzerland (heating) 25%
Wolseley prides itself in the service it offers to customers and works 
hard to retain its reputation as a leading distributor of plumbing and
heating supplies and building materials.
Distribution network
Over the past 20 years Wolseley has established operations in 13 countries
where it now operates 3,920 branches. Distribution Centres, logistics
networks, vehicle fleets and management systems have been developed
and implemented to supply, support and administer these branches. The
Group continues to invest in its infrastructure and seeks ways to improve
existing systems.
Wolseley recognises that its existing network and systems are a substantial
asset that not only represents a competitive advantage but also one that
any new entrant to its markets would find challenging to create. The Group
also recognises that there are further opportunities to improve this
infrastructure with more cross-company/border cooperation and improved
supply chain efficiency, and is actively pursuing and investing in these.
OTHER FINANCIAL MATTERS
Financial reporting
The Group’s accounting policies fully reflect the requirements of the
Accounting Standards Board. There have been no new Financial
Reporting Standards issued in the period that are effective for the
Group’s financial year ending 31 July 2005.
Under the transitional arrangements contained within FRS 17,
(Retirement Benefits), the Group has continued to adopt the rules set out
in SSAP 24 for pensions accounting during the financial year. Note 33 to
the accounts includes the additional disclosures required by FRS 17. 
Full adoption of FRS 17 has now been superseded by the implementation
of International Accounting Standards.
The Group’s accounting policies set out on pages 65 to 66 of the
accounts relating to turnover have been updated to provide further 
clarity on the Group’s revenue recognition policy. There has been no
other amendment or change to the Group’s selected accounting policies.
International Accounting Standards
Under current European legislation the Group is required to adopt
International Financial Reporting Standards and International Accounting
Standards in the preparation of its financial statements from 1 August 2005
onwards. The announcement on 18 July 2005 restating the financial
results for six months to 31 January 2005 under IFRS (available on the
Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com), showed that there was no
significant impact on the Group’s financial position as a consequence 
of the accounting rule changes in relation to the half year. The results 
for the year ended 31 July 2005 will be restated under IFRS and released
on 22 November 2005.
Insurance
The insurance arrangements of the Group are reviewed annually. 
The Group has a captive insurance company which is registered and
operational in the Isle of Man. No policies are written for third parties.
The administration is undertaken by a specialist management company.
Going concern
The Directors are confident, on the basis of current financial projections
and facilities available, that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.
Cautionary statement
This operating and financial review and other sections of this report
contain forward looking statements that are subject to risk factors, which
are further explained inside the back cover of this Annual Report.

Corporate social responsibility report
Although the Board believes that the environmental impact of our
distribution activities is comparatively low, we are committed to sound
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) policies and practices for good
business reasons. Our commitment to CSR is not simply a response 
to increased market pressures in this area, but such issues reinforce 
the way that our various businesses operate.
We regard CSR as a sustainable approach to business that seeks
benefits for all of our stakeholders, be they customers, employees,
communities, the environment or the Company and its shareholders.
During the year we have continued our dialogue with stakeholders in this
important area. We are committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance and environmental as well as other CSR issues form part 
of the overall internal control process. The Board believes that the
businesses are best served by creating a safe working environment,
which encourages and supports high levels of business performance.
We focus on issues such as safety, training, behaviour based
performance and the provision of opportunities for our employees’ career
growth and development. Local community initiatives are considered 
to be investments providing support that will assist those communities,
complement the aspirations of our customers, give our employees
opportunities for professional development and help us to achieve our
business objectives. The Board believes that the progressive integration
of CSR throughout the business and the incorporation of broader social
and environmental issues into day-to-day decision making will better
enable us to achieve our goals. 
Health, safety and environment
A key driver of the Group’s success has been the high degree of
autonomy which has been afforded to local managements, allowing 
them to serve local markets in the most appropriate manner. Within this
decentralised structure, the Board has set down a number of health,
safety and environment principles with which all businesses are required
to comply. The principles relating to environment cover: the integration 
of environmental management into business operations; a commitment 
to the adoption and achievement of best practice wherever this is
practicable; a commitment to prevent pollution; compliance with local
environmental legislation; the adoption where practicable of local formal
environmental management systems; a commitment to strive for
continual improvement; and a commitment to ensure proper
communication with employees on environmental matters.
Timber
PB & M (formerly Pinault Bois et Matériaux) (“PBM”), the French
heavyside business that was acquired in July 2003, purchased some
907,000m
3
of timber in the year ended 31 December 2003, 856,000m
3
of timber in the financial year ended 31 July 2004 and 940,000m
3
in the
financial year ended 31 July 2005. More than 85% in the calendar year
2003, 86% in the financial year ended 31 July 2004 and 88% in the
financial year ended 31 July 2005 of such timber was softwood, mainly
sourced from countries such as Russia, Finland, France and Sweden. 
A little over 5% of the timber purchased in the year to 31 July 2005 was
hardwood, sourced from suppliers who have not been censured by the
United Nations as part of resolution number 2001/1343.
PBM has been working with its suppliers since 2000 with a view to ensuring
that timber is sourced from forests which have been certified by recognised
forestry associations which promote sustainable forestry management.
Some 48% (2004: 46%) of the timber purchased in the year ended 
31 July 2005 was sourced from certified suppliers.
PBM, like Build Center and Stock Building Supply (“Stock”), has
engaged with its suppliers of Indonesian plywood with a view to ensuring
that any illegal logging is excluded from the supply chain. Imports of
Indonesian plywood accounted for 2% of all timber purchased by PBM
in each of the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005.
Build Center’s purchases of Indonesian plywood amounted to less than
1.5% of its timber purchases in the year ended 31 July 2003 and this
reduced to 0.2% in the year ended 31 July 2004 following Build Center’s
decision to cease sales of such plywood from September 2003.
Stock’s purchases of Lauan plywood reduced from 0.09% of its timber
purchases in the year ended 31 July 2003 to 0.07% in the year ended 
31 July 2004 and to 0.03% in the year ended 31 July 2005. None of
Build Center, PBM or Stock purchase without appropriate permits any
species of timber included in any of the Appendices to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
which, inter alia, identify threatened species of trees.
PBM, which is a member of Le Commerce du Bois, the French timber
trade federation, will become a signatory to a code of practice being
drawn up by that federation working jointly with importers and
distributors which is intended to set the standards for timber sourcing,
purchasing and distribution in France based on both French domestic
and internationally recognised standards. The code of practice was
submitted to the French environment ministry in June 2005 and is
expected to be signed in the Autumn of 2005.
Further progress has been made during the year at Build Center with
regard to the responsible sourcing of timber and the elimination of 
illegal timber from the supply chain. Build Center purchased 247,000m
3
of timber in the year ended 31 July 2003, 273,000m
3
in the financial 
year ended 31 July 2004 and 350,000m
3
in the financial year ended 
31 July 2005. More than 97% in each of 2003 and 2004 and a little 
over 90% in 2005 of such timber was sourced from Finland, Sweden,
Germany, Latvia, the UK and other European countries. Less than 
1.5% in 2003, 1.2% in 2004 and 0.9% in 2005 of such purchases 
were of hardwood. Some 67% of the raw material purchases made in
the year ended 31 July 2005 (2004: 40%) were from certified sources.
Throughout 2004 Build Center trialled a responsible purchasing policy 
in conjunction with the Timber Trade Federation (“TTF”). The policy was
formulated by the TTF to meet the requirements of the UK Government’s
own timber procurement policy. The policy was developed with the benefit
of input from principal suppliers, with a view to ensuring that increasing
volumes of sustainable timber are progressively being made available to
the business, especially where timber is sourced from forests where
certification schemes are not widely in place. The TTF has now endorsed
the policy and its Governing Board will consider at its next meeting in
January 2006 whether to make adoption of the policy compulsory for 
all its members.

Wolseley UK is currently developing a web-based interface onto which
suppliers can log their responses to specific questions which will also
capture documentary evidence in support of their claims, such as chain 
of custody certificates. Wolseley UK aims to have the system fully
operational before the end of 2005.
Stock purchased some 3,750,000m
3
of timber in the year ended 31 July
2003, 4,400,000m
3
in the year ended 31 July 2004 and 4,580,000m
3
in
the year ended 31 July 2005 of which 1,380,000m
3
were of structural
panels. Almost all of such purchases in the financial years 2003, 2004
and 2005 were sourced from the USA and Canada, with less than
100,000m
3
being sourced from Europe. Some 90% in the year ended 
31 July 2005 (2004: 90%; 2003: 85%) of such purchases were made
from suppliers who hold certifications from recognised forestry
sustainability agencies, such as the American Forest Products
Association and the Canadian Standards Association.
The American Forest Products Association’s Sustainable Forest Initiative
programme requires participants to meet an exacting standard of
environmental principles, objectives and performance measures. The
standard integrates the perpetual growing and harvesting of trees with
the protection of wildlife, plants, soil and water quality, together with 
a wide range of conservation goals. Stock maintains a constant dialogue
with its suppliers, reviewing their environmental practices and policies,
encouraging sustainable forestry management practices and seeking
opportunities to improve the use of natural resources.
Sales of engineered wood products, which are substitutes for wide
dimension solid-sawn timber, increased by over 21% in the year 
ended 31 July 2005 (2004: 35%). Such substitutes improve structural
performance, thereby reducing the need to harvest as many larger, 
older trees.
Chain of custody
It is well recognised that whilst sustainable sourcing is vital, it is also 
key that illegal timber is eliminated from the supply chain, from the 
forest of origin to the end user. Build Center began work in 2003 on 
a chain of custody project that initially saw the implementation of new
procedures in five branches with 16 products within scope, all of which
had been independently audited and approved by, or on behalf of, 
both the Forest Stewardship Council and the Programme for the
Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”).
The project required Build Center to identify certified sources for these
initial 16 products, adapt management systems to identify and capture
relevant data, undertake on-site training, create a dialogue with
suppliers, and create new documentation to ensure that despatch 
notes and invoices contain chain of custody certification numbers 
and references to the certified status of the product. Internal and
independent third party audits have also had to be conducted.
From the original 16 products, the number of products within the chain
of custody scheme now exceeds 16,000 and certification was achieved
by the end of the year at a further 15 sites. Wolseley UK intends to
further increase the number of branches which have secured accreditation
within its chain of custody scheme to include all Build Center timber
branches (40 in total) by 31 July 2006 and by the same date to increase
the number of products within the scheme to around 18,000. The
volume of timber controlled within the chain of custody scheme in the
year ended 31 July 2005 was 30,000m
3
, some 8.6% of total timber
purchased. The target for the year ending 31 July 2006 is 75,000m
3
.
PBM’s hardwood business achieved certification for its chain of custody
procedures in November 2003. Cerland, PBM’s garden products
business, also achieved certification for its chain of custody procedures
during 2003. Significant progress has been made during the year 
to achieve the same recognition in PBM’s softwood import business, 
with the requisite pre-audit report having been completed in March 2004.
PBM is currently planning to have achieved PEFC certification for the
import business by the end of 2005.
Stock does not have a formal chain of custody procedure for its timber
as it relies upon the chain of custody procedures in place within its
suppliers. As noted above, the vast majority of purchases made by
Stock are from suppliers who hold recognised certifications and the
company maintains an extensive dialogue with them on sustainability
issues including chain of custody.
Waste management
All of the European companies comply with EU and domestic waste
management regulations. In Ireland, Heatmerchants continues to reduce
compliance costs by back-loading secondary waste paper, cardboard,
wood pallets and plastic from branches to the main distribution centre
for recycling. In the year ended 31 July 2005, over 800 tonnes of such
material was recycled and thus saved from landfill, resulting in cost
savings of 1124,000.
Brossette in France has installed containers at each of its branches for
the collection of plastic, paper, wood and metal for recycling. ÖAG in
Austria continues to operate its waste management strategy that has
been in place since 1994 and which streams waste for collection 
and reprocessing by specialist contractors.
Stock has optimised the use of off-cuts in its truss manufacturing
facilities and, where possible, off-cuts which cannot otherwise be used
are recycled by wood products manufacturers in order to minimise
waste, reduce the need to use landfill sites and to reduce costs. 
Stock estimates that more than 4,800 tonnes of landfill has been
avoided in the year ended 31 July 2005 which has resulted in savings of
more than $290,000 in waste management costs alone. Equipment has
been installed at distribution warehouses in the UK to bale and recycle
cardboard and hard plastic. Recycling programmes operate in all of the
businesses’ corporate offices.
Environment
Wolseley UK has formed an environmental steering group comprising
senior managers and local board directors. The group identifies ways 
in which environmental issues can be captured and improvements
made. Wolseley UK has agreed an environmental policy, which sets out
the company’s position to customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.
Commitment has been made to continuous improvement in environmental
performance, the prevention of pollution and to improving efficiency 
in the use of resources including energy, water, packaging and other 
raw materials.
During the year, Wolseley UK has worked actively with the Energy 
Saving Trust to promote the use of energy efficient products in the 
boiler market. This has focussed on a number of high efficiency heating
schemes and home insulation products. Since 2002, sales of high
efficiency boilers have saved over 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions.
Just six months after the establishment of an Environmental 
Management System, Wolseley UK was able to announce in May 2005
that it had attained ISO 14001 accreditation for three of its branches. 
The Environmental Management System structures Wolseley UK’s
approach to environmental matters and is now being trialled across 
the whole of its business.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:18 am  Page 42 Corporate social responsibility report 43 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
As part of the development of Wolseley UK’s new head office 
in Leamington Spa, the company introduced a ‘Green Travel’ plan to
encourage employees and visitors to use more environmentally friendly
and sustainable modes of transport than the car. As transport is a key
area for Wolseley UK, tight controls are enforced to ensure that the
minimum number of vehicles operate out of each Wolseley UK site and
emphasis is placed upon route planning to minimise delivery journeys
and the number of miles travelled. Progress continues to be made
across the whole UK transport fleet to improve this utilisation.
The introduction of further high capacity trailers has reduced the number
of vehicles operating between each of the UK distribution centres and
there has been a substantial increase in the volume of back-hauling 
from suppliers, thereby enhancing the efficient use of the fleet. As can 
be seen from page 17, significant investment has been made in, and 
has been committed to, distribution warehousing. Multiple stock
replenishment deliveries to branches from suppliers have been reduced
as loads are consolidated in Wolseley UK’s own distribution warehouses
for onward delivery. Consolidating loads reduces the number of supplier
vehicles on the road while minimising the local impact around branches.
There is a continued focus on pooling branch vehicles across each 
of the Wolseley UK brands, which will ensure that the fleet eliminates
wasteful multiple deliveries and reduces the number of miles travelled.
A major project is underway at Wolseley UK to improve fuel consumption
across its primary distribution fleet. This is being achieved through
individual vehicle monitoring, combined with driver training initiatives 
and the replacement of older, less fuel efficient vehicles. Some 216 
(2004: 200) vehicles were replaced over the last year. A number of fleet
vehicles have also been trialled with particulate filtration, allowing them 
to gain ‘reduced pollution’ certificates.
Wolseley UK’s transport group also pays continuous attention to
servicing programmes which include regular emissions checks to 
ensure vehicle efficiency and has adopted a reduced emissions and 
tyre pressure management system for optimal fleet use. Ferguson in the 
USA has been using a transportation management system for its 1,200
plus diesel powered delivery vehicles. The system optimises the delivery 
of goods from distribution centres to branches as well as directly to
customers, thereby reducing handling and transport costs together with
vehicle emissions. The new system has been implemented at a branch
level and significant savings are expected to be achieved.
Ferguson has a policy of sourcing vehicles from a supplier with a leading
reputation in environmentally friendly diesel technology. The engines for 
all replacement vehicles are certified to meet the US Government’s 2007
standard for particulate emissions. Approximately 350 (12% of the fleet)
(2004: 175 or 7% of the fleet) new vehicles were acquired during the
year and each was equipped with emissions technology that meets this
standard. Ferguson is also seeking to take full advantage of new digital
valve technology to improve air quality and fuel economy throughout its
entire distribution network.
During the year Ferguson also purchased a hybrid electric/petrol 
vehicle to evaluate the benefits of improved fuel economy and reduced
emissions which such vehicles may be able to offer compared to
conventional vehicles.
As part of Stock’s transport management programme, many suppliers
back-load their delivery vehicles to avoid wasteful return journeys. 
This initiative is part of a programme that also includes investment in a
national fleet management, fuel and servicing system aimed at achieving
optimal fleet efficiency and curbing excessive emissions.
An extensive programme of education has ensured that an appropriate
level of capital expenditure is invested in new environmentally friendly
vehicles. These vehicles incorporate emission and fuel economy
technologies which already comply with, or exceed, forthcoming 
US Government standards. During the year ended 31 July 2005, 
over 300 such vehicles were replaced (a little over 8% of such vehicles)
(2004: 265 or a little over 6% of such vehicles). These new vehicles 
are approximately 70% more fuel efficient than the ones they replaced.
In common with other Wolseley companies, Stock’s maintenance
programme seeks to improve both safety and fuel efficiency by
increasing reliability through the direct purchase of spare parts and 
also by rigorous tyre management. In 2004 Stock successfully tested 
a GPS (Global Positioning System) pilot programme, which indicated
that further efficiencies could be achieved and would allow the company
to plan more efficient delivery routes to enhance customer service and
further reduce the number of miles driven. The pilot also demonstrated
that safety could also be improved as drivers’ speed can be monitored.
Stock has now rolled out the initiative such that more than 225 vehicles
now benefit from the GPS service. Stock intends to double this number
in the next year.
Stock’s regional distribution centres were designed to facilitate product
delivery by rail. More than 55% (2004: more than 50%) of deliveries to
the distribution centres are made in this way, with over 15,000 wagon
loads (equivalent to some 60,000 (2004: 56,000) truck loads) received
during the last year alone. Delivery by rail continues to be encouraged
and is expected to continue to grow, with our investment in distribution
centres designed to receive more product in this way.
Brossette in France has implemented a reorganisation programme to
reduce the number of warehouses and to regroup branches in order 
to improve productivity and customer service while at the same time
reducing the number of delivery journeys and transport costs.
Brossette has a national fleet maintenance programme in place, which
seeks to secure optimal use of its delivery vehicles while minimising 
the impact on the environment. Brossette seeks to take advantage 
of technological improvements when renewing its fleet to both reduce
emissions and to optimise fuel consumption. All new vehicles are fitted
with the latest software technology to improve efficiency and to reduce
the number of miles driven. Some 102 vehicles (approximately 10% of
such vehicles) (2004: 31 or approximately 10% of such vehicles) were
replaced during the year.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:18 am  Page 43 44 Corporate social responsibility report Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
PBM is engaged in a fleet renewal programme to increase fuel efficiency,
improve safety and reduce both emissions and transport costs. 
In the year ended 31 July 2005, 91 vehicles were replaced (2004: 80)
representing a little over 10% of PBM’s fleet (2004: 9%). Fleet efficiency 
is underpinned by a national fleet management programme, which
ensures uniform operating standards. PBM ensures that its drivers’
training is maintained and seeks ways of encouraging good driving. 
Health and safety
The Company has developed a health and safety framework which
requires local management to have suitable procedures in place to
ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, wherever
possible, to employ best practice. One of the key issues for the Group 
is the creation of a work environment free from injury and illness and how
we go about improving our health and safety performance. This is driven 
not only by legal responsibility, but also by the ethical desire to protect 
our employees.
Wolseley UK has a health and safety committee, supported by the health
and safety department. This comprises senior managers and local board
directors. The committee reviews the UK businesses’ performance 
in health and safety matters, promotes good practice and ensures
appropriate consultation on any intended changes to its health and
safety management systems. All branch and area managers are trained
in this area and all employees are trained to complete their daily tasks 
in a safe manner.
Brossette has a central health and safety committee which oversees 
the work carried out by the health and safety committees in individual
branches. Representatives of the company and employees sit on each
local committee, together with an occupational health doctor. All new
employees and managers receive appropriate induction and training
which includes matters related to health and safety.
PBM seeks to increase awareness of the importance of health and
safety matters throughout the business using a programme that
reinforces the fact that each person throughout the company has both 
a responsibility and a part to play in maintaining and improving health
and safety standards.
Stock has a safety committee with responsibility for developing,
introducing and monitoring the effectiveness of the company’s overall
safety programme and objectives. The committee comprises employees
with different perspectives and from varied disciplines. Each branch
manager is responsible and accountable for health and safety at his or
her branch, including compliance with regulations, safety awareness and
accident prevention. All new employees are given induction training
relating to safe working practices and hazards present in the workplace.
Training is also provided when an employee is requested to handle 
new processes, procedures or equipment. Monthly mandatory safety
meetings are held at each branch during which, as a minimum, topics
designated by the safety committee must be discussed. Safety issues
within each branch are dealt with by a safety coordinator or local safety
committee consisting of a cross-section of employees. 
Stock and Ferguson have been working together over the last 24 months
to improve their performance in the areas of both health and safety and
traffic accidents. The joint initiative has been driven not only by the costs
to the business of soaring medical and other expenses associated with
claims for workers’ compensation but also the desire to reduce the
incidence of injury and to reduce the consequential effect that such
incidences have on other employees and the business.
Both companies have set targets during the year to reduce the
frequency and cost of both workers’ compensation and traffic incidents,
enhance their programmes to help employees to return to work even if
this is on modified duty, improve the reporting of claims to ensure that
prompt action is taken and increase measures to ensure that employees
are able to seek any required medical attention. This joint initiative has
resulted in a significant improvement in both companies’ health and
safety records.
Stock achieved a 21% reduction in the number of work related injuries
during the six months to 31 March 2005 with Ferguson achieving a 
near 14% reduction. Both companies have achieved a 100% rate of
returning injured employees to work either on modified duty or to their
original jobs.
Both companies have also made improvements in reducing vehicle
accidents over the last year with Stock achieving a 17% reduction in
accidents in the six months to 31 March 2005 and Ferguson holding 
its accident frequency rate. These improvements are all the more
impressive as they have been achieved during a period of significant
growth for both companies.
In May 2005, Stock introduced its ‘Driven to Safety’ programme, a
proactive safe driver training programme. Since then, every delivery
driver has been trained in a variety of ways to recognise hazardous
conditions, plan the appropriate response and take decisive action.
Every new driver joining the company will also receive such bespoke
training. Each driver’s knowledge and ability to practice safe driving
techniques will be assessed.
During the year Ferguson introduced its Customer “CARE” (Customers
and Associates Require Excellence) programme which is intended to
symbolise Ferguson’s determination to achieve a culture of excellence
throughout the organisation. The programme includes two goals aimed 
at communicating the importance of safety and quality and to promote 
a safe working environment for all of its employees.
Cesaro in the Czech Republic also demonstrated its commitment to
customer care during the year by achieving ISO 9001 accreditation 
in June 2005 for its quality management processes. The accreditation
acknowledges the company’s ability to fulfil its customers’ quality
requirements and applicable regulatory requirements while aiming to
enhance customer satisfaction and achieve continual improvement 
of its performance in pursuit of these objectives.
Acquisitions
A great deal of importance is placed on environmental matters during
the due diligence process for acquisitions. External environmental
consultants review and assess environmental risks to which the 
Group could potentially become exposed. Depending upon the type 
of proposed acquisition, this assessment could include reviews of
environmental management systems, compliance with laws and
regulations and the respect and care shown for the environment. 
Health and safety compliance and processes are also considered 
as part of the process. Appropriate dialogue with, and indemnities 
from, the proposed vendors are sought where appropriate.
Code of Ethics
A Group-wide Code of Ethics has been in place since 2003. This sets
out a number of fundamental principles which all our companies and
employees are required to follow. In keeping with our decentralised
approach, businesses are required to adopt their own codes which
respect local cultures and businesses but which also set standards that
are still no less exacting than those detailed in the Group-wide Code. 
To a large extent, these individual codes simply underpin and endorse
existing practices.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_01-45  7/10/05  12:18 am  Page 44 Corporate social responsibility report 45 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
New companies joining the Group are required to adopt codes of ethics
on the same basis as existing businesses. The Group-wide Code covers
many areas including fair competition, compliance with laws, including
anti-trust laws, maintenance of the Group’s reputation for integrity
(including a prohibition on bribery and general principles for dealing with
suppliers and authorities) and can be viewed on the Company’s website
at www.wolseley.com or a printed copy is available from the Group
Company Secretary. Wolseley UK, for example, has incorporated the
Code of Ethics into a wider document which sets out the principles on
which business is transacted. This includes principles related to diversity,
safety, inducements, communication, the environment and human rights.
The human rights policies and procedures are based on the principles 
set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
The workplace
One of the Board’s objectives is to ensure that we provide a workplace
environment that encourages and supports our employees in achieving
their best personal performance. Further work was undertaken during
the year in this area coordinated by the Group-wide human resource
function that resides in Theale. The development of leadership skills of
senior managers is also a key objective and further progress has been
made to enable more participants than ever before to attend programmes
at Darden and IMD. Training and development programmes for all
employees are crucial to the ability of the business to achieve its goals.
The businesses continue to devote significant attention and resource to
this issue, recently aided by the recruitment of more human resource
leaders across the businesses. More than £12 million (2004: £11 million)
was spent on training of employees during the year, with over 75,250
(2004: 64,500) days of training provided.
Whilst Wolseley is committed to promoting equal opportunities for all, 
it is believed that, overall, women and minorities are under-represented.
We believe that we have the right policies in place to meet or exceed
legal requirements in this area but we also recognise the need to better
understand the factors that are critical to achieving greater diversity.
Further work continues to be undertaken in this area.
Community relations
Notwithstanding the international nature of the business, the Group
continues to operate with a high degree of autonomy, working in and 
with our local communities. We recognise our responsibility to invest 
in the communities in which our businesses operate and to act as 
a good corporate citizen. The Company is a member of Business 
in the Community in the UK and has worked with that organisation 
to help develop our approach and practice.
The Group’s businesses are involved in a wide range of initiatives for the
benefit of local communities, of which the following are representative:
Stock led a team of local businesses in Montana, USA to donate
materials for and help to construct a storage office and shop facility at
John’s Golf Course. The course was developed by a customer of Stock
for his son, who wanted to take up the game despite living with the
effects of Cornelia DeLange Syndrome, a form of Down’s syndrome that
affects mental and physical development. The course is now enjoyed by
many local people – able bodied and disabled alike – and a fundraising
golf tournament was recently hosted by the course to help enable the
customer’s son to attend the World Special Olympics. 
Over the last year Stock responded to six challenges from California to
Florida initiated by the television series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition
to help reconstruct homes to improve the lives of families who have had
to cope with severe personal difficulties. This was in addition to the
company’s ongoing support for diverse Habitat for Humanity projects
across the USA. Stock has also entered into commitments of more than
$50,000 per annum to fund educational, arts and children’s programmes
in the Raleigh area.
Wolseley UK operates a local community donation scheme in the UK for
a wide range of good causes for sports, education and health schemes 
in local communities. Wolseley UK has continued its support for
children’s charity NCH and is also raising funds to buy an inshore lifeboat
for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Wolseley employees have
raised funds for many local and national charities, helped by generous
support from customers and suppliers alike. PBM works with a company
dedicated to the employment of disabled people throughout Western
France. They are mainly involved in the assembly of products sold by
PBM under its garden products brand, Cerland. Tobler, our Swiss
business, works with a similar company dedicated to the employment 
of disabled people in Switzerland.
During the year Ferguson’s employees once again actively involved
themselves in community fundraising activities, helping to raise funds 
in Virginia for cancer research by taking part in the largest half marathon
in the USA. A Relay for Life team from Ferguson’s corporate offices
participated in this year’s event for the eighth consecutive year and raised
$30,000. Excess stock valued at nearly $113,000 from the closure of a
distribution centre in North Carolina was donated to Habitat for Humanity,
the non-profit organisation which seeks to eliminate substandard housing
and homelessness from the world.
Employees made themselves available around the clock in support 
of the American Red Cross relief effort after the devastation caused 
by hurricane Charley in September 2004. Stock also contributed to 
the American Red Cross relief effort. Supplies donated by Ferguson’s 
Ft Myers Waterworks’ branch helped emergency roads to be built 
and enabled the Red Cross to convert a fire hydrant into showers for
residents who were left homeless. In Denver, Ferguson’s Beautyware
Plumbing Supply donated products and services to the Colorado
Coalition for the Homeless. Homes built through this community effort
are designed to help families affected by redundancy.
Wolseley Canada and its employees are committed to supporting 
Special Olympics Canada, the national not-for-profit organisation
dedicated to enriching the lives of Canadians with an intellectual disability
through sport. The organisation provides sport training and competition
opportunities for 30,000 athletes of all ages and abilities and Wolseley
Canada committed C$250,000 in funding in the year ended 31 July 2005 
as well as providing employees with paid days off to allow them to
volunteer at the Ontario Games held in July 2005.
Donations
Following the Tsunami in December 2004 that devastated areas of 
south east Asia, businesses and employees throughout the Group pulled
together to offer help. The Group pledged in excess of £200,000 to the
disaster relief fund. Ferguson also allocated $50,000 to match employee
donations. In France, PBM and Brossette joined forces to create
initiatives to raise funds from customers, suppliers and employees 
alike. This culminated in some 1460,000 being presented in June 2005 
to Plan France, the international humanitarian organisation, which will
use the funds to co-finance their rehabilitation and reconstruction
programme in Sri Lanka, which is specifically aimed at providing 1,200
permanent homes in 11 locations together with new community facilities.
In addition to these initiatives, the Group supports charities relevant 
to the countries and to the locations in which its businesses operate. 
These are wide-ranging and cover health, welfare, education, civic and
community projects as well as culture and the arts. Each year, several
hundred donations are made. In the USA, many of our employees make
regular contributions to the United Way, an organisation which distributes
funds to charities. In the UK, a Give as You Earn Scheme operates with
the assistance of the Charities Aid Foundation which distributes funds 
to UK charities. Further details of the donations made during the year 
are set out on page 52.

The Directors submit their annual report and the audited consolidated
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 
31 July 2005.
Principal activities and business review
Wolseley plc is a holding company; its subsidiaries are organised into three
divisions which are set out on pages 29 to 32. The principal activities of 
the Group are the distribution of plumbing and bathroom materials, central
heating equipment and pipes, valves and fittings within Europe, the USA
and Canada. Additionally in the UK, Ireland and France, it distributes
heavyside building materials, whilst in the USA, the Group distributes
timber and other building materials. In the UK, it operates tool hire centres
which have also been introduced into France and Austria. Details of the
development of the Group’s businesses during the year are given in the
operating and financial review on pages 26 to 37 and in the Group Chief
Executive’s review on pages 8 to 25.
Results and dividends
The Group’s consolidated profit and loss account, set out on page 62,
shows an increase of 16.8% in Group operating profit from £580.2 million 
in 2004 to £677.4 million. An analysis of turnover and operating profit is
given on page 67 in note 1 to the accounts. There have been no significant
post balance sheet events. Shareholders were paid the 2005 interim
dividend of 8.8 pence per share (2004: 7.8 pence) on 31 May 2005. 
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 17.6 pence per share (2004:
16.0 pence) making a total dividend for the year of 26.4 pence per ordinary
share, an increase of 10.9% on the 23.8 pence paid in respect of last year.
Payment of the recommended final dividend, if approved at the Annual
General Meeting, will be made on 30 November 2005 to shareholders
registered at the close of business on 7 October 2005. 
The Wolseley plc 2004 Overseas Employees Benefit Trust, the Wolseley
plc 2004 Employee Benefit Trust and the Wolseley plc 2004 Directors
Benefit Trust were established on 5 October 2004 in connection with the
Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term
Incentive Scheme details of which are set out in the remuneration report
on pages 56 to 58. The trustees of each of the trusts have waived their
rights to receive dividends on any shares held by them. Following three
purchases of shares in the capital of the Company made in November
2004 the trustees of the Wolseley plc 2004 Overseas Employees Benefit
Trust hold 2,000,000 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. 
The average purchase price was 925p per share excluding dealing costs.
The amount of dividends waived in respect of the year ended 31 July 2005
was £176,000. The Directors of Wolseley QUEST Limited have also waived
their right to receive dividends on any shares held by that company under
the Wolseley Savings Related Share Option Scheme. For the year ended
31 July 2005, Wolseley QUEST Limited held no shares and no such
dividend waiver was required (2004: £0). 
The Company’s dividend reinvestment plan will continue to be available 
to shareholders. Shareholders who do not currently participate in the plan
and wish to do so can obtain an application form and explanatory booklet
from the Company’s registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars. Contact details 
for the Registrars are shown on page 98. The latest date for receipt of 
new applications to participate in respect of the 2005 final dividend is 
9 November 2005.
Acquisitions and disposals
Details of acquisitions and disposals made during the year are contained in
the operating and financial review on page 27 and in note 23 on page 76.
Future development
It remains your Board’s intention to develop the Group through organic
growth and by selective acquisitions.
Share capital
At the date of this report, 592,150,054 ordinary shares of 25 pence each
have been issued and are fully paid up and are quoted on the London
Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company has entered into a level II
American Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of New York,
under which the Company’s shares are traded in the form of American
Depository Shares on the New York Stock Exchange. During the year
ended 31 July 2005, options were exercised pursuant to the Company’s
share option schemes, resulting in the allotment of 7,060,566 new ordinary
shares. A further 7,623 new ordinary shares have been allotted under
these schemes since the end of the financial year to the date of this report.
Details of these issues including, where appropriate, the amounts subscribed
for new shares are set out in note 20 to the accounts on page 75, which
also contains details of options granted over unissued capital. 
The Directors propose (Resolution 10 in the Notice of Meeting which
accompanies this report) to renew the authority granted to them at the
Annual General Meeting held in 2004 to allot equity shares up to an
aggregate nominal value of £50,000,000 (representing approximately one
third of the ordinary shares issued at the date of this report) (the “section 
80 authority”). If approved at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, 
the authority will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which 
the resolution is passed, or at the conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting to be held in 2006, whichever is the sooner.
The limited power granted to the Directors at last year’s Annual General
Meeting to allot equity shares for cash other than pro rata to existing
shareholders expires no later than 21 February 2006. Subject to the terms
of the section 80 authority, your Directors recommend (Resolution 11 in 
the Notice of Meeting) that this authority should be renewed so as to give
them the ability (until the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2006) to
issue ordinary shares for cash, other than pro rata to existing shareholders,
in connection with a rights issue or up to a limit of 5% of the ordinary
share capital issued at the date of this report. Your Directors have no
present intention to issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant to the
Company’s employee share schemes and any share dividend alternatives.
The Directors recommend that you vote in favour of Resolutions 10 and 11 
to maintain the Company’s flexibility in relation to future share issues, 
including any issues to finance business opportunities should appropriate
circumstances arise.
A Special Resolution will also be proposed (Resolution 12 in the Notice of
Meeting) to renew the Directors’ limited authority last granted in 2004 to
repurchase ordinary shares in the market. The authority will be limited to 
a maximum of 59,215,005 ordinary shares (being 10% of the Company’s
issued share capital at the date of this report) and also sets the minimum
and maximum prices which may be paid. This authority will enable your
Directors to continue to respond promptly should circumstances arise 
in which they consider such a purchase would result in an increase in
earnings per share and would be in the best interests of the Company.

The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations
2003 allow shares repurchased by the Company to be held as treasury
shares that may be cancelled, sold for cash or used for the purpose 
of employee share schemes. The Company holds no shares in treasury
but the Directors currently intend that any shares which are repurchased
will be held in treasury. The authorities to be sought by each of Resolutions
11 and 12 are intended to apply equally to shares to be held by the
Company as treasury shares and to the sale of treasury shares. The
Directors consider it desirable for these general authorisations to be available
to provide flexibility in the management of the Company’s capital resources.

Directors’ interests in shares
The register kept by the Company pursuant to section 325 of the
Companies Act 1985 shows that the Directors in office at 31 July 2005

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial
statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss for
that period.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, appropriate
accounting policies have been used and applied consistently, supported 
by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and that applicable
UK accounting standards have also been applied.
The Directors are also responsible for maintaining adequate accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position 
of the Company and the Group, which enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 1985. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
wolseley.com website. The work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to 
the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
the financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud or other irregularities. The Directors,
having prepared the financial statements, have permitted the auditors to
take whatever steps and undertake whatever inspections they consider to
be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit opinion.

Corporate governance
Including the report of the audit committee
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance
set out in the Combined Code on corporate governance published by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (“the Code”) for financial periods
beginning on or after 1 November 2003. The Board is accountable to the
Company’s shareholders for good governance and this report describes
how the Board applied the principles of good governance set out in the
Code during the year under review.
The Board
As at 31 July 2005, the Board of Directors was made up of 11 members
comprising the Chairman, five Executive Directors and five Non Executive
Directors. The Non Executive Directors are considered by the Board to 
be independent of management and free of any relationship which could
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The
Board considers that each of the Non Executive Directors brings his own
senior level of experience, gained in their own fields of mainly international
operations. Jacques Descours left the Board on 7 October 2004 and
Gérard Legtmann left the Board on 24 January 2005. Robert Marchbank
was appointed to the Board with effect from 24 January 2005. Biographical
details of the Directors currently in office are shown on pages 38 and 39.
The Company’s policy relating to the terms of appointment and the
remuneration of both the Executive and Non Executive Directors is 
detailed in the remuneration report on pages 54 to 61.
The Board meets regularly during the year as well as on an ad hoc basis, 
as required by time critical business needs. The Board has a formal
schedule of matters reserved to it for its decision, which was reviewed
during the year, although its primary role is to provide entrepreneurial
leadership and to review the overall strategic development of the Group as
a whole. Day-to-day operational decisions are delegated to the executive
committee referred to on page 51. The Board met eight times during the
year and Director attendance for each meeting is shown in the table on
page 50. The Board has established a procedure for Directors, if deemed
necessary, to take independent professional advice at the Company’s
expense in the furtherance of their duties. This is in addition to the access
that every Director has to the Company Secretary, who is charged with
ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that good corporate
governance and compliance is implemented within the Group. Board
papers and other information are delivered at times to allow Directors to be
properly briefed in advance of meetings. In accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association, Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company
to the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of
their office. The indemnity would not provide any coverage to the extent that
a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company
has also arranged appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal action
against its Directors and officers. The differing roles of Chairman and Group
Chief Executive are acknowledged and set out in writing. The Chairman
has confirmed that he would not chair any other major company’s Board.
The Chairman has addressed the developmental needs of the Board as 
a whole, with a view to developing its effectiveness as a team and assists
in the development of individual skills, knowledge and expertise. During 
the year, the Board continued its ongoing evaluation processes to assess
its performance and that of its committees and to identify areas in which 
its effectiveness, policies and processes might be enhanced, utilising both
a questionnaire and discussion with Board members.
Performance evaluations have been carried out for each member of 
the Board. Executive Directors’ performance has been assessed by 
the Chairman and Mr Banks, Mr Banks’ performance by the Chairman
and the Non Executive Directors, the Chairman’s performance by the 
Non Executive Directors and Mr Banks, and the Non Executive Directors’
performance by Mr Banks and the Chairman. The evaluation of the
personal performance of the Executive Directors was also supported by 
a 360 degree appraisal process which included a peer group review where
performance was assessed against set criteria, including the skills brought
to the Board and the contributions each Executive Director made to it.
Meetings between the Non Executive Directors, both with and without 
the presence of the Chairman and Mr Banks, are scheduled in the Board’s
annual timetable. The Board has also arranged to hold two Board
meetings each year at divisional locations to help all Board members 
gain a deeper understanding of the business.
As part of their ongoing development, the Executive Directors are 
encouraged to take up an external non executive position on a non-
competitor board, for which they may retain payments received in respect
of the appointment. In order to avoid any conflict of interest, all appointments
are subject to the Board’s approval. Generally outside appointments for
Executive Directors are limited to one company board only, although Mr
Banks, by exception, serves on two outside boards. The Board is satisfied
that these appointments do not conflict with his duties to the Company.
The Board monitors the extent of Directors’ other interests to ensure that
the effectiveness of the Board is not compromised. Succession planning 
is considered to be a matter for the whole Board rather than for a
committee. During the year, the Board considered succession issues
arising out of Mr Hornsby’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of
Wolseley North America, which became effective on 1 August 2005 and
established a working party, which met on a number of occasions during
the year, to consider the issues arising out of Mr Banks’ prospective
retirement as Group Chief Executive. As announced on 26 September 2005,
Mr Banks will retire on 31 July 2006 and will be succeeded by Mr Hornsby.
The Board will announce a successor to Mr Hornsby as Chief Executive
Officer of Wolseley North America in due course.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that one third of the
Directors retire by rotation each year and that each Director will seek 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting every three years. Additionally,
new Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity
after their appointment. It is Board policy that Non Executive Directors are
normally appointed for an initial term of three years, which is then reviewed
and extended for a further three-year period. It is also Board policy that
Non Executive Directors should not generally serve on the Board for more
than nine years and that, in cases where it is proposed to exceed this
period, the Director concerned will retire annually and offer himself for 
re-election. Following their appointment, formal comprehensive and
tailored induction is offered to all Non Executive Directors, supplemented
by visits to key locations within the Group and meetings with members 
of the executive committee and other key senior executives. All of the
Directors being proposed for re-election have been subject to a
performance evaluation during the year ended 31 July 2005.
Although the Non Executive Directors are not asked, at present, to meet
the shareholders of the Company, their attendance at presentations of 
the annual results is encouraged. The Chairman ensures that the Board
maintains an appropriate dialogue with shareholders. Gareth Davis is the
Company’s Senior Independent Non Executive Director.
The formal terms of reference for the main Board committees, approved 
by the Board and complying with the Code to assist in the discharge 
of its duties, are available from the Company Secretary and can also 
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_46-66.qxd  6/10/05  11:47 pm  Page 48 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Corporate governance 49
be found on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com. Membership 
of the various committees is shown on page 98. The Company Secretary
acts as secretary to all Board committees.
Nominations committee
The nominations committee meets on an as needed basis and is
comprised of Mr Whybrow (Chairman), Mr Banks, Mr Davis, Mr Duff and 
Mr Walker. Mr Whybrow would not chair the committee when it considers
the appointment of a successor chairman. The committee reviews the
structure, size and composition of the Board and its committees and 
makes recommendations with regard to any changes that are considered
necessary, both in the identification and nomination of new Directors 
and the continuation of existing Directors in office. The committee retains
external search consultants as appropriate. The committee also advises
the Board on succession planning for executive board appointments
although the Board itself is responsible for succession generally. The
committee met twice during the year and director attendance for each
meeting is shown in the table on page 50.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises Messrs Davis, Stein and Murray (who
chairs the committee). The committee’s membership is reviewed by the
nominations committee and by Mr Murray at regular intervals. Members of
the committee are appointed by the Board following recommendations by
the nominations committee. The committee is normally comprised of three
independent Non Executive Directors. Two members constitute a quorum. 
Each member of the committee brings relevant financial experience from
senior executive levels. The expertise and experience of the members of
the committee are summarised on pages 38 and 39. The Board considers
that each member of the committee is independent within the definition 
set out in the Code. Mr Stein is considered to have significant, recent and
relevant financial experience, as he is currently Finance Director of GKN plc.
All members of the committee receive appropriate induction, which is in
addition to the induction which all new Directors receive and includes an
overview of the business, its financial dynamics and risks. Audit committee
members are expected to have an understanding of the following areas:
the principles of, contents of, and developments in, financial reporting,
including the applicable accounting standards and statements of
recommended practice; key aspects of the Company’s approach, including
corporate policies; Company financing; systems of internal control; matters
that require the use of judgement in the presentation of accounts and key
figures as well as the role of internal and external auditors. Members of 
the committee undertake ongoing training as required.
The committee meets regularly throughout the year and its agenda is
linked to events in the Company’s financial calendar. The agenda is mostly
cyclical such that the committee Chairman approves the agenda on behalf
of all members of the committee; each member of the committee may
require reports on matters of interest in addition to the regular items.
Members’ attendance at the meetings held during the year is set out 
in the table on page 50.
The committee invites the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the
Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller and the Head of
Internal Audit together with senior representatives of the external auditors
to attend each meeting although it reserves part of each meeting for
discussions without the invitees being present. Other senior management
are invited to present such reports as are required for the committee to
discharge its duties. 
The Chairman of the audit committee attends the Annual General Meeting
to respond to any shareholder questions that might be raised on the
committee’s activities. The remuneration of the members of the committee
is set out on page 55 and the policy with regard to the remuneration of 
Non Executive Directors is set out on page 61.
The committee is required to assist the Board to fulfil their responsibilities
related to external financial reporting and associated announcements.
During the year, the committee reviewed the interim and annual financial
statements, the restatement of the interim statement under International
Financial Reporting Standards for the six months to 31 January 2005 
and the interim and preliminary announcements made to the London 
and New York Stock Exchanges and the Form 20-F , which is filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission in the USA, having received the
appropriate information on the accounting principles, policies and practices
adopted in the preparation of the accounts; changes proposed to those
principles; policies and practices; significant accounting issues; litigation
and contingent liabilities and tax matters, including contingencies against
tax liabilities together with compliance with statutory tax obligations. 
The committee is also responsible for the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the Company’s policy on external audit. The committee
reserves oversight responsibility for monitoring the independence, objectivity
and compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements. The committee
recommends the appointment and reappointment of the Company’s
external auditors. The committee reviews the scope, results (including
schedules of unadjusted errors and representation letters) and cost
effectiveness of the audit as well as the auditors’ remuneration and
performance. The committee also ensures that key partners within the
external auditors are rotated from time to time in accordance with both 
UK and US rules. It also monitors the extent of non-audit work which the
external auditors can perform, to ensure that the provision of those non-
audit services that can be undertaken by the external auditors falls within
the agreed policy and does not impair their objectivity or independence.
Under the policy, the external auditors cannot be engaged to perform any
of the following services: 
> Bookkeeping services related to accounting records or financial
statements;
> Financial information systems’ design and implementation;
> Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions and contributions 
in kind reports;
> Actuarial services;
> Internal audit outsourcing services;
> Management functions including human resources;
> Broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services; and
> Legal and other services unrelated to the audit.
The policy requires pre-confirmation by the committee of any non-audit work
subject to de minimis levels. The external auditors provide audit related
services such as regulatory and statutory reporting as well as formalities
relating to shareholder or other circulars. The external auditors report to
the committee any material departures from Group accounting policies
and procedures that they identify during the course of their audit work.
Within the constraints of applicable US and UK rules, the external auditors
undertake due diligence reviews and provide assistance on tax matters given
their in-depth knowledge of the Group’s business. The provision of non-
audit services within such constraints and the agreed policy is assessed
on a case-by-case basis so that the best-placed adviser is retained.
During the year the committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external
auditors and considered whether the agreed plan had been fulfilled and
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_46-66.qxd  6/10/05  11:47 pm  Page 49 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 50 Corporate governance
Corporate governance continued
the reasons for any variation from the plan. The committee also considered
the external auditors’ robustness and the degree to which the external
auditors were able to assess key accounting and audit judgements and
the context of the management letter.
The committee reviews annually a formal letter provided by the external
auditors confirming their independence and objectivity within the context 
of applicable regulatory requirements and professional standards. 
The committee also reviewed the terms, areas of responsibility and scope
of the audit as set out in the external auditors’ engagement letter; the
overall work plan for the forthcoming year, together with the associated fee
proposal; any major issues which arose during the course of the audit and
their resolution; key accounting and audit judgements; the level of errors
identified during the audit; the recommendations made to management 
by the auditors and management’s response.
The total fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the year ended 
31 July 2005 were £7.2 million (2004: £5.6 million) of which £4.7 million
(2004: £3.5 million) related to non-audit work. 
The committee also reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit
function and its relationship with the external auditors, including internal 
audit plans and performance. Throughout the year, the committee reviewed
the internal audit function’s plans and its achievements against plans. The
committee considered the results of the audits undertaken by the internal
audit function and considered the adequacy of management’s response 
to matters raised, including the time taken to resolve any such matters. 
The committee reviewed the internal audit functions effectiveness, oversaw
the continued development of the function during the year and considered
the need to continue to outsource to KPMG LLP some elements of 
internal audit’s work to provide support as the function further develops. 
The committee has also monitored the policy which it approved on the
recruitment of staff from both the external auditors and from KPMG LLP . 
The committee also reviews, where practicable, all proposed
announcements to be made by the Company to the extent that they contain
material financial information. It also reviews disclosures made by the
Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director during the certification
process for the Form 20-F concerning the design and operation of internal
controls or material weaknesses in the controls, including any fraud involving
management or other employees involved in the Group’s financial controls.
The committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal control systems, accounting policies and practices, risk management
procedures and compliance controls as well as the Company’s statements
on internal controls before they are agreed by the Board for each year’s
annual report. The committee has also monitored the Company’s response
to the requirements of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act as they apply to foreign
private issuers with particular focus on the progress made in evaluating
internal controls as required by Section 404 of that Act. The Board 
retains overall responsibility for internal control and the identification 
and management of business risk. During the year, the committee also
reviewed the progress of the Group’s preparation for reporting under the
new International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the processes
which are being embedded throughout the Group to implement them. 
The committee also reviewed the impact of adopting IFRS on the opening
balance sheet at 1 August 2004 and was satisfied that suitable policies
were being applied and were appropriate. The committee also approved
the publication on 18 July 2005 of the restatement of the Group’s interim
results for the six months to 31 January 2005 as prepared under IFRS.
The Company’s whistleblowing policy (which is an extension of the
Groupwide Code of Ethics) sets out arrangements for the Company
Secretary to receive, in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues,
internal controls, auditing issues and related matters which would, 
as appropriate, be reported to the committee. A copy of the Code of
Ethics is available on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.
Each year the committee critically reviews its own performance and terms 
of reference and considers where improvements can be made. 
Remuneration committee
The committee comprises Messrs Davis, Duff and Walker (who chairs 
the committee), all of whom are independent within the definition set out 
in the Code. The committee met six times during the year and Director
attendance for each meeting is shown in the table on page 50. The
committee is responsible for making recommendations on remuneration to
the Board. The Board’s remuneration report is set out on pages 54 to 61.
During the year the committee reviewed its terms of reference, which 
had been approved in July 2004. It was agreed that no amendments 
were required. Copies of these terms of reference are available from the
Company Secretary or on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.
The Chairman of the remuneration committee attends the Annual General
Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions that might be raised 
on the committee’s activities. On 26 September 2005, the Company
announced that Mr Duff will succeed Mr Walker as Chairman of the
committee with effect from 1 November 2005. Mr Walker will remain 
a member of the committee.

consider treasury policy, tax matters and certain transactions on behalf 
of the Group within a framework delegated by the Board.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_46-66.qxd  6/10/05  11:47 pm  Page 50 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Corporate governance 51
Executive committee
The Executive Directors of the Company together with Mr Barden, 
who has been responsible for Wolseley UK Limited since 1 August 2003, 
meet at least eight times each year, often on the day before formal Board
meetings. The committee addresses operational business issues and
shares best practice, thereby allowing the Directors more time at Board
meetings to focus on strategy.
Internal audit
The discrete internal audit function, which was established within the 
Group during 2003, continued to expand its scope of work and to recruit
further members during the year. The Head of Internal Audit is based at
the Company’s head office in Theale. The internal audit function is involved
in the assessment of the quality of risk management and internal control
and helps to promote effective risk management within the businesses.
Certain internal audit assignments (such as those requiring specialist
expertise) continue to be outsourced by the Head of Internal Audit to
KPMG LLP as required. The audit committee reviews internal audit reports
and considers the effectiveness of the function.
Internal control
In a highly decentralised Group, where local management has considerable
autonomy to run and develop their businesses, a well designed system of
internal control is necessary to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the
Company’s assets. The Directors acknowledge that they have overall
responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and for reviewing
their effectiveness. In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull
Report “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code”,
an ongoing process had been established for identifying, managing and
evaluating the risks faced by the Group. This process has been in place 
for the full financial year and up to the date on which the financial statements
were approved.
The systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve the Group’s objectives, safeguard the Group’s assets
against material loss, fairly report the Group’s performance and position
and to ensure compliance with relevant legislation, regulation and best
practice including that related to social, environmental and ethical matters.
The systems provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss. Such systems are regularly reviewed by the Board 
to deal with changing circumstances. A summary of the key financial 
risks inherent in the Group’s business is given on pages 33 to 36. 
Risk assessment and evaluation is an integral part of the annual 
planning cycle. Each business documents the strategic objectives and 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control. As part of 
this review, each business area and function has been required to identify
and document each significant risk, together with the mitigating actions
implemented to manage, monitor and report to management on the
effectiveness of these controls. Senior managers are also required to sign
bi-annual confirmations of compliance with key procedures and to report
any breakdowns in, or exceptions to, these procedures. Summarised
results have been presented to senior management and to the audit
committee. The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal control for the year under review. A summary of the
principal control structures and processes in place across the Group is 
set out below.
Control structures
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, it has delegated
responsibility for the internal control and risk management programme to
the Group Finance Director. The detailed review of internal control and risk
management has been delegated to the audit committee. The management
of each Group company is responsible for internal control and risk
management within its own business, and for ensuring compliance with
the Group’s policies and procedures. Each Group company has appointed
a risk director whose primary role in such capacity is to ensure compliance
by local management with the Group’s risk management and internal
control programme. Both the internal and external auditors have reviewed
the overall approach adopted by the Group towards its risk management
activities so as to reinforce these internal control requirements.
Control processes
The Board reviews its strategic plans and objectives on an annual basis,
and approves Group company budgets and strategies in light of these.
Control is exercised at both Group and subsidiary Board level through
monthly monitoring of performance by comparison to budgets, forecasts
and cash targets, and by regular visits to Group companies by the Group
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. Group companies approve
and submit risk reports to the audit committee, summarising the key risks
facing their businesses and the controls in place to manage those risks.
These reports, together with reports on internal control and departures, 
if any, from established Group procedures prepared by the external
auditors, are reviewed by the Group Finance Director and the audit
committee. Group companies submit annual risk and internal control
representation letters to the Group Finance Director on internal control 
and risk management issues, with comments on the control environment
within their operations. The Group Finance Director summarises these
submissions for the audit committee and the Chairman of the audit
committee reports to the Board on any matters which have arisen from 
the committee’s review of the way in which the risk management and
internal control processes have been applied. 
The Board has formal procedures in place for the approval of investment
and acquisition projects, with designated levels of authority, supported by
post investment review processes for selected acquisitions and major
capital expenditure. The Board considers social, environmental and ethical
matters in relation to the Group’s businesses and assesses these when
reviewing the risks faced by the Group. The Board is conscious of the
effect such matters may have on the short and long-term value of the
Company. The external auditors of the Company and the Head of Internal
Audit attend audit committee meetings and receive its papers. The report
of the audit committee is set out on pages 49 to 50 and the audit
committee members regularly meet the external auditors without the
presence of executive management.
As noted on page 46, the Company has entered into a level II American
Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of New York and has
securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(“the Commission”). The Company is required to comply with applicable
US regulations including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, insofar as it applies 
to foreign private issuers. In accordance with the Commission’s
recommendations, the Company has established a disclosure committee
comprising the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group
Financial Controller and the Group Company Secretary and Counsel.
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_46-66.qxd  6/10/05  11:47 pm  Page 51 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 52 Corporate governance
Corporate governance continued
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director will also provide
the certificates required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when the Form 20-F
for 2005 is filed. During the year work necessary to achieve compliance
with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act related to internal
controls has continued and the Board is confident of meeting the 
revised deadline imposed by the Commission.
Compliance statement
The Company applied all of the principles set out in section 1 of the Code
for the period under review and has, throughout the year, complied with 
the detailed provisions set out therein, save that, following the introduction
of a new Directors’ bonus scheme in 2000, the pensionable salary of one
Executive Director includes his bonus capped at a fixed amount.
The Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , are required to
review whether the above statement reflects the Company’s compliance
with the nine provisions of the Code specified for its review by the Listing
Rules and to report if it does not reflect such compliance. No such report
has been made.
New York Stock Exchange
Corporate governance requirements
Whilst the Company is not required to comply with the measures set by 
the board of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. to strengthen corporate
accountability as it is a private foreign issuer, it does comply in all material
respects with those standards. Those standards state that companies
should have a nominating /corporate governance committee composed
entirely of independent Directors with written terms of reference, which
develops and recommends to the Board a set of corporate governance
principles for the Company. Details of the Company’s nominations
committee are set out on page 49. The nominations committee does 
not develop corporate governance principles for the Board to approve.
The Board itself approves the Group’s overall system of internal controls,
governance and authority limits. A majority of the members of the
nominations committee are independent Non Executive Directors and all
such Directors sit on the Board. The Company’s practice, in accordance
with the UK Companies Act and Code in relation to the appointment and
termination of the external auditors, is that a recommendation is made by
the audit committee to the Board, which will then make a recommendation
to shareholders in general meeting. This differs from the procedure in the
USA, where the external auditors are accountable to the audit committee,
which has the authority to appoint or dismiss the external auditors without
reference to shareholders. 
Communications with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on communication with 
its shareholders, including its employee shareholders. The Group Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director are closely involved in investor
relations and a senior executive has day-to-day responsibility for such
matters. The views of our major shareholders are reported to the Board 
by the Group Finance Director and by the Chairman and discussed at its
meetings. The Annual Report and Accounts are available to all shareholders
either in paper form or electronically and can be accessed via the
Company’s website or via Shareview, an Internet service offered by 
the Company’s registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars, detailed on page 99. 
There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and this has been
extended to include private shareholders through the Annual General
Meeting and meetings with shareholder representatives. Contact is also
maintained, when appropriate, with shareholders to discuss overall
remuneration plans and policies. The Group’s preliminary and interim
results, as well as all announcements issued to the London and 
New York Stock Exchanges, are published on the Company’s website,
www.wolseley.com. The Company issues regular trading updates to the
market and these, together with copies of presentations to analysts and
interviews with the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, 
are also posted on the website. Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
is circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before such
meeting. It is Company policy not to combine resolutions to be proposed
at general meetings. All shareholders are invited to the Company’s Annual
General Meeting at which they have the opportunity to put questions to
the Board and it is standard practice to have the chairmen of the audit,
nominations and remuneration committees available to answer questions.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as abstentions,
are counted before the Annual General Meeting and the results will be
made available at the meeting after shareholders have voted on each
resolution on a show of hands. The results will also be announced to 
the London and New York Stock Exchanges and are published on the
Company’s website shortly after the meeting.
Donations
The Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Report is set out on 
pages 40 to 45. The Group’s charitable donations in 2005 totalled
£2,020,711 (2004: £3,839,000), which includes donations of more than
£200,000 made on behalf of the Group as a specific response to the
Tsunami earthquake disaster.
At each of the Annual General Meetings held in 2002, 2003 and 2004,
shareholders passed a resolution, on a precautionary basis, to approve
donations to EU political organisations and EU political expenditure (as
such terms are defined in section 347A of the Companies Act 1985 (as
amended)) not exceeding £125,000 per annum. The Board has repeatedly
confirmed that it operates a policy of not giving any cash contribution to
any political party in the ordinary meaning of those words and that it has 
no intention of changing that policy. The Directors, however, propose to
seek once more, authority for the Group to make donations and incur
expenditure of not more than £125,000 in total until the Company’s next
Annual General Meeting, which they might be prohibited from making 
or incurring under the terms of the Act and which would not amount to
“donations” in the ordinary sense of the word. The authority sought by
Resolution 13 in the Notice of Meeting will last until the Company’s 
next Annual General Meeting.
Awards under employee share schemes
Options were granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan in 
April 2005 to 9,036 US-based employees (2004: 6,944) and 941
Canadian-based employees (2004: 953) in respect of a maximum of
2,780,555 ordinary shares (2004: 2,986,840) exercisable at 935.85 pence
per share. Options were granted under the UK Employees Savings Related
Share Option Scheme in June 2005 to 2,246 employees (2004: 2,448) 
in respect of a maximum of 582,757 ordinary shares (2004: 738,662)
exercisable at 881 pence per share. Options were granted under the Irish

Sharesave Scheme in June 2005 to 145 employees (2004: 101) in respect
of a maximum of 70,878 ordinary shares (2004: 43,875) exercisable at
881 pence per share. In November 2004 options were granted under 
the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 over 4,081,340 ordinary shares
(2004: 3,570,423 ) to senior employees of the Group at an option price 
of 949 pence per share. A further award of 50,000 options was granted
under the 2003 Plan in March 2005 at an option price of 1100 pence per
share. These schemes are described in more detail on pages 56 to 59.
Details of the total options outstanding at 31 July 2005 are set out in 
note 20 to the financial statements. Details of the cash awards under the
2001 Long Term Performance Related Incentive Scheme for Mr Banks
and the cash and share awards under the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term
Incentive Scheme are set out on page 56.
Employee policies and involvement
The Group places particular importance on the involvement of its
employees, keeping them regularly informed through informal bulletins, 
such as ‘Directions’ and other in-house publications, meetings and the
Company’s internal website, on matters affecting them as employees and
on the issues affecting their performance. A European Works Council has
been operating since 1996 to provide a forum for dialogue and consultation
with employees on significant developments in the Group’s operations,
management’s plans and expectations, organisational changes within the
Group and for employee representatives to consult management about
concerns over any aspect of the Group’s operations. At the date of this
report, there are 25 members comprising 14 employee representatives
nominated from among employees from each European company.
Permanent UK employees are usually invited to join the Company’s
pension arrangements including the defined benefit pension scheme,
which has one corporate and two individual trustees. The Chairman of the
trustees is David Tucker and, save for an independent trustee, all of the
other trustees are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group.
Permanent employees outside the UK are usually offered membership of
their employing companies’ pension arrangements. Employees are offered
a range of benefits depending on the local environment, such as private
medical cover. Employees are encouraged to become shareholders in 
the Company, where possible, through participation in the Company’s
share schemes. Priority is given to the training of employees, and the
development of their skills is of prime importance. Employment of disabled
people is considered on merit with regard only to the ability of any applicant
to carry out the function required. Arrangements to enable disabled people
to carry out the function required will be made if it is reasonable to do so.
An employee becoming disabled would, where appropriate, be offered
retraining. The Group continues to operate on a highly decentralised basis.
This provides the maximum encouragement for the development of
entrepreneurial flair, balanced by a rigorous control framework exercised 
by a small head office team. Local managements are responsible for
maintaining high standards of health and safety and for ensuring that 
there is appropriate employee involvement in decision-making.
Creditor payment policy
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms and conditions
of trading with their suppliers. It is the Group’s policy that payments 
to suppliers are made within agreed terms and are where applicable,
consistent with the UK Government-backed Better Payment Practice
Code. Copies of this Code can be obtained from the Group Company
Secretary at the Company’s registered office. At 31 July 2005 the Company
had no trade creditors (2004: nil). The amount of trade creditors for the
Group as at 31 July 2005 was equivalent to 55 days (2004: 52 days) of
trade purchases.
Shareholder services
Shareview is a service offered by our registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars,
which allows shareholders on-line access to a range of shareholder
information. Shareview provides access to details of shareholdings 
in the Company and practical help on transferring shares or updating
personal details. It also allows shareholders to choose to receive shareholder
communications electronically, rather than by post. To register, shareholders
simply need to log on to www.shareview.co.uk with their shareholder
reference number, which is shown on the form of proxy sent to all
shareholders with this report. First time users will need to enter certain
information and choose a Personal Identification Number before they are
able to access their shareholding details.
Shareview dealing is also available to UK-based shareholders. This is 
a simple and convenient telephone and Internet share purchase and sale
service offered by the Registrars. For telephone purchases and sales 
call 0870 850 0852 between 8.30am and 4.30pm, Monday to Friday. 
For Internet purchases and sales, log on to www.shareview.co.uk/dealing.
A postal dealing service is also available from Lloyds TSB Registrars and 
a form, together with terms and conditions, can be obtained by calling
0870 242 4244.
CREST
The Company’s ordinary shares are in CREST, the settlement system for
stocks and shares.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are willing to continue as auditors of 
the Company and Resolution 8 in the Notice of Meeting concerning their
re-appointment and Resolution 9 in the Notice of Meeting, concerning 
the determination of their remuneration are to be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting resolutions
The resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held
on 17 November 2005, together with explanatory notes, appear in the

Remuneration report
Including the statement of remuneration policy for the year ended 31 July 2005
The Board presents the remuneration report for the year ended 
31 July 2005.
The Board sets the Company’s remuneration policy. The remuneration
committee (“the Committee”) makes recommendations to the Board, 
within its agreed terms of reference (available on the Company’s 
website, www.wolseley.com) on the Company’s framework of executive
remuneration and its cost. It also determines, on behalf of the Board,
specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and for
the Chairman. The Committee administers the Company’s share incentive
schemes for employees and recommends and monitors the level and
structure of remuneration for senior management who report to the Group
Chief Executive. The Board itself determines the remuneration of the Non
Executive Directors. The current members of the Committee, all of whom
are independent Non Executive Directors within the definition set out in 
the Code, are set out on page 50 and the Company Secretary acts as 
its secretary. The Committee has access to detailed external research on
market data and trends from independent and experienced consultants.
The Committee has, since March 2003, sought external advice from 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , who also provide certain pensions
advice to the Company. In May 2005, the Committee also sought advice
from Mercer Human Resource Consulting in the USA. The Group 
Chief Executive, the Chairman and the Director of Human Resources,
Peter Buckingham, are normally invited to attend the meetings of the
Committee to respond to specific questions raised by members of the
Committee. This specifically excludes such matters concerning the details
of their own personal remuneration.
The Company has followed the provisions of Schedules A and B 
of the Code and has complied with the relevant provisions of the
Companies Act 1985, as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2002.
The Directors’ report on remuneration was approved by shareholders 
at each of the Annual General Meetings held in 2003 and 2004.
Shareholders will again be invited to approve this report at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 November 2005.
With the exception of the description of the performance bonus
arrangements, service agreement details, performance graph, executive
share ownership and external directorships, the information set out on
pages 55 to 61 of this report represents the auditable disclosures referred
to in the Auditors’ report on page 91 as specified by the UK Listing
Authority and under Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors
The Company’s policy now, and for the future, is to provide remuneration
packages that fairly reward executives for the contribution they make 
to the business, having regard to the size and complexity of the Group’s
operations and the need to attract, retain and motivate executives of the
highest quality. Remuneration packages comprise salary, performance
bonuses, share options, long-term incentives, benefits in kind and
pensions. The Company takes a total approach to remuneration, which
includes all these elements. The packages are designed to be broadly
comparable with those offered by other similar international businesses
and reflect competitive practices in the countries and markets in which 
the Executive Directors operate. The policy is designed to incentivise 
the Executive Directors to meet the Company’s financial and strategic
objectives such that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance
related. The Committee considers that the targets set for the different
elements of performance related remuneration are appropriate and
demanding in the context of the Company’s trading environment and 
the business challenges it faces.
Salaries
Basic salaries are determined having regard to competitive market data,
the degree of individual responsibility and individual performance. Market
data is derived from a group of companies selected on the basis of
comparable size, geographic spread and business focus. Due consideration
is also given to the wider economic and employment backdrop, including
general pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group. The
target salary is at the median with the opportunity to go above this level,
subject to sustained individual performance. The Committee reviewed the
salaries of the Executive Directors with effect from 1 August 2004, having
sought the views of both the Chairman and (other than in the case of his
own salary) the Group Chief Executive. As a US national, forty per cent 
of Mr Banks’ salary is currency protected, based on an exchange rate 
of £1: $1.50.
Benefits in kind
These principally comprise car benefits, life assurance, healthcare
insurance and, in the case of Messrs Banks, Marchbank and Webster,
relocation and housing allowances following their relocations from the 
USA to the UK (Messrs Banks and Marchbank) and from Droitwich 
to Theale (Mr Webster), where the Company’s head office is located.

Performance bonuses
Performance bonus arrangements are designed to encourage individual
performance, corporate operating efficiencies and profitable growth. 
The annual bonus awards are based on a mix of demanding financial
targets, derived from the Company’s historic performance, annual 
long-term strategic business plan and annual budget, as well as market
expectations and will depend on performance against annual targets of
return on capital employed, working capital, Group profit before tax and,
where relevant, profit before tax for the appropriate division (which, in
aggregate, account for 85% of the bonus, the majority of which relate to
the profit before tax targets). The balance of 15% of the bonus depends
on specific personal objectives set for each Executive Director. 
The following percentages of base salary, which vary between Executive
Directors depending on their particular responsibilities and spheres of
influence, will be paid in bonus for the year ended 31 July 2005, subject 
to the achievement of the minimum, on-target and maximum levels 
of performance (with the percentages increasing on a linear basis for
achievement between each level):
Percentage of base salary payable on achievement of:
Bonus awards
Maximum for the year
Name Minimum target On-target target (% of salary)
C A Banks 60 100 150 131
F N Hord 80 120 160 156
C A S Hornsby 80 120 160 156
R H Marchbank 30 50 75 51
S P Webster 40 60 100 84
Stretching targets are set for each element of the bonus, determined by
the Committee each year, which also considers the levels of performance
targets to be achieved for bonus payments to be made in the succeeding
year. For the year ending 31 July 2006, the Committee has determined
that the minimum, on-target and maximum targets will be 60/120/170%
of base salary for Mr Banks, 80/130/180% for Mr Hornsby, 80/120/160%
for Mr Hord and 40/70/100% for Mr Marchbank and Mr Webster.
The increases in potential bonuses for Messrs Hornsby and Marchbank
reflect their promotions and for Messrs Banks and Webster the objective 
of increasing the proportion of their remuneration package that is varied
based on performance. This reflects the growth of the Company over
recent years.

Service agreements
All service agreements with Executive Directors are subject to a maximum
of 12 months’ notice of termination if given by the Company and six months’
notice of termination if given by the Executive Director. Such notice periods
reflect current market practice and the balance that should be struck
between providing contractual protection to the Directors that is fair and
the interests of our shareholders. The date of each service agreement and
the year in which each Director was last elected or re-elected are noted in
the table below. There are no provisions in any service agreement for early
termination payments and, in the event of early termination of any service
agreement, the Committee will take a robust view of the mitigation, which
should be taken into account when computing any compensation payable.

Long-term incentives
The Company currently operates a long-term incentive plan which provides
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, conditional upon the
Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over single three year periods.
All awards are made subject to the achievement of stretching performance
conditions and TSR has been selected as the performance measure 
to more closely align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior
executives with those of shareholders over the long-term. The plan rewards
the relative out-performance of the Company against a defined list of
comparator companies. Calculations are performed independently and 
are approved by the Committee.
The long-term incentive plan is discretionary. The Committee’s current
policy is to make annual awards to the Group Chief Executive, Executive
Directors and other senior executives under the Wolseley plc 2002 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (“2002 Scheme”), which was approved 
by shareholders in November 2002 and amended at the Annual General
Meeting held on 18 November 2004. Prior to this date only cash awards
were made. Since 2004, awards will normally be made in shares, save
where there are material securities or tax law constraints in overseas
jurisdictions where the scheme is to be operated, in which case
conditional awards in cash would continue to be made. 
The maximum amount that can be granted under the amended 2002
Scheme for each award is 200% of base salary per annum; however
awards made to date have not exceeded 100% (or 125% in the case of
the Group Chief Executive) of base salary. Each year the Committee will
assess the proportion of awards that should be made up of both share
options and long-term incentive awards. It is the Committee’s intention 
that for the year ending 31 July 2006, awards are made to the Group Chief
Executive over 150% of salary with lower award levels for other Executive
Directors. The vesting level for a maximum award under the amended
2002 Scheme requires performance to be in the upper decile. To better
reflect market practice, shareholder approval was sought and received 
on 18 November 2004 so that 25% of awards made from that date would
vest for achievement of performance at the median (with a straight line
percentage to vest between median and upper decile). Extant awards
remain subject to the achievement of performance conditions following 
a participant’s retirement and vesting is determined at the end of the
performance period.
Details of the awards conditionally made to the Executive Directors in office during the year under the amended 2002 scheme and outstanding 
at 31 July 2005, as well as at the date of this report, are shown in the table below.

The Committee has considered whether future grants under the amended
2002 Scheme should be subject to a financial performance underpin, in
addition to the satisfaction of a TSR performance target. The Committee
concluded that the continuing use of EPS as a performance target under
the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the use of financial measures 
for the annual bonus plan provide an appropriate balance to the use of
TSR within the amended 2002 Scheme, such that the introduction of a
further financial underpin was not felt appropriate. This will be kept under
review by the Committee.
The lists of comparator companies for awards made since 2001 under the
2001 cash plan (a plan introduced to facilitate Mr Banks’ recruitment which
is similar in structure to the 2002 Scheme) and since 2002 under the 2002
Scheme are based upon the constituent members of the FTSE 100 as at
the respective dates of grant, excluding banks, telecommunications, IT and
utility companies but together with CRH plc and Travis Perkins plc, which
compete in the same sector as the Company. A similar group of companies
will be selected for the 2005 awards under the amended 2002 Scheme.
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s TSR performance against 
the performance of the FTSE 100 Index over the five-year period to 
31 July 2005. The FTSE 100 Index has been chosen as being a broad
equity market index consisting of companies of comparable size and
complexity to Wolseley.

Share options
The Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (“2003 Plan”) received shareholder
approval at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003.
Consequently, no further options will be granted under the Executive Share
Option Scheme 1984 (“1984 Scheme”) nor under the Executive Share
Option Scheme 1989 (“1989 Scheme”) which are now closed. No options
under any such scheme have or will be granted at a discount to the relevant
middle market price at the time of grant and no option under any such
scheme can be exercised unless a performance test has been satisfied.
All employees and Executive Directors of the Company, its subsidiaries 
and joint ventures, save for those within six months of their anticipated
retirement (other than US executives), are eligible to participate in the 
2003 Plan. Participants will be selected by the Committee at its discretion. 
The Committee considers annually the levels of grant, which are phased
over time and they determine the size of each award at the time of grant
based on individual performance and market levels of remuneration.
Awards may not exceed an amount equal to three times base salary 
for UK and other European-based executives and five times salary for 
US-based executives. The Committee may also use the higher limit in
exceptional circumstances as it determines. However, awards made to
date have not exceeded 200% of base salary (or 250% in the case of 
the US Executive Directors). It is the Committee’s intention that for the 
year ending 31 July 2006, awards will not exceed 225% of base salary 
(or 300% in the case of the US Executive Directors).
No options may be granted more than 10 years after the date on 
which the Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders and the
Committee will formally review the Plan by no later than November 2008. 
The Company monitors the awards of shares made under the various
employee and discretionary share plans which it operates in relation to 
their effect on dilution limits. Options are either satisfied by the issue of 
new shares or shares purchased in the market (including treasury shares).
The number of new shares, as recommended by the Association of British
Insurers (“ABI”), that may be issued to satisfy options granted under the
Plan or any other employee share scheme is restricted to 10% of the
issued ordinary share capital of the Company over any rolling 10 financial
years. Further, as set out in the ABI guidelines, the number of new shares
that may be issued to satisfy options granted under the Plan or any other
executive-only share scheme is restricted to 5% of the issued ordinary
share capital of the Company over any rolling 10 years. In addition, 
for US-based participants, the Plan will be restricted such that the
aggregate number of shares for which options may be granted to such
participants during the life of the Plan will not exceed 5% of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company as at the date the Plan was
approved by shareholders. 
By 31 July 2005, awards had been granted resulting in shares being 
issued or capable of being issued during the preceding 10 financial years
under all of the Company’s employee share plans representing some
5.99% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date (2.8% of the issued
ordinary share capital under the Company’s executive only share plans). 
Remuneration report 57
WO40004_Wolseley R&A_46-66.qxd  6/10/05  11:47 pm  Page 57 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 58 Remuneration report
Remuneration report continued
During the year, an employee trust purchased shares in the market in 
order to meet some of the Company’s liability for grants made under the
2003 Plan and the amended 2002 Scheme. Details of the shares held 
in the employee trusts and the price paid for them are set out in note 20
on page 75. 
The extent to which the options will be capable of exercise depends on 
the satisfaction of a performance condition. The performance condition 
is based on the growth above UK inflation of the Company’s earnings 
per share (“EPS”), before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
measured from the year ended immediately prior to grant. 
For all grants made under the 2003 Plan on or after 25 November 2004
there will be a single 3-year performance period and, in the event that the
performance criteria are not fully met on the third anniversary of the date 
of grant, the options will lapse. 
The performance condition for options now granted under the 2003 Plan
operates on the following sliding scale:
Multiple of salary worth of shares under option Total margin over UK inflation after 3 years
First 100% of salary 9%
Second 100% of salary 12%
Next 50% of salary 15% 
Greater than 250% of salary 15% to 21% 
The performance of the Company is initially measured over three financial
years, starting with the financial year in which the option grant takes place.
For awards granted in 2003, to the extent that the performance target is
not fully met at the end of the initial three-year period, a subsequent retest
on the fourth anniversary of grant can be undertaken, but from the same
performance related base prevailing at the time the awards were made 
and with pro-rated targets for EPS growth. Should the performance target
not be met on this subsequent date, the option will lapse.
Provided the performance test has been satisfied, an option may be
exercised at any time until it lapses, 10 years from the date of grant. 
No amount is payable on the award of an option. 
The Committee can set different EPS targets from those described above
for future options, provided that the new conditions are no less challenging
in the circumstances than the initial ones. Similarly, the Committee can 
vary the terms of existing options to take account of technical changes, 
for example, changes in accounting standards. The amended target will 
be materially no less challenging as a result of the change. The Committee
believes that the EPS condition is appropriate for share options as it
requires substantial improvement in the Company’s underlying financial
performance and complements the inherent requirement for share price
growth for an option to have value.
The table below shows the number of share options held by Directors 
in office during the year under the executive share option schemes as

Notes:
(a) The following exercises of options took place during the year:
(i) by Mr Banks of executive share options on 7 October 2004 in respect of 12,385 ordinary shares at an
option price of 483.50 pence and 15,765 ordinary shares at an option price of 381.00 pence (closing
middle market price 941.50 pence); on 1 April 2005 in respect of 15,185 ordinary shares at an option
price of 397.00 pence and 19,689 ordinary shares at an option price of 349.75 pence (closing middle
market price 1118 pence) and on 27 July 2005 in respect of 30,311 ordinary shares at an option price 
of 349.75 pence and 14,600 ordinary shares at an option price of 467 pence (closing middle market 
price 1180 pence);
(ii) by Mr Descours of executive share options on 19 October 2004 in respect of 8,000 ordinary shares 
at an option price of 388.75 pence (closing middle market price 930.50 pence);
(iii) by Mr Hord of executive share options on 25 October 2004 in respect of 10,000 ordinary shares 
at an option price of 456.50 pence, 10,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 483.50 pence, 
10,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 381.00 pence and 12,000 ordinary shares at an option 
price of 397.00 pence (closing middle market price 913 pence); 
(iv) by Mr Hornsby of executive share options on 17 December 2004 in respect of 8,000 ordinary shares 
at an option price of 483.50 pence, 8,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 381.00 pence and
10,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 397.00 pence (closing middle market price 948.50 pence),
on 10 January 2005 in respect of 15,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 349.75 pence (closing
middle market price 983.50 pence), on 5 April 2005 in respect of 60,400 ordinary shares at an option
price of 467.00 pence (closing middle market price 1116 pence), and on 29 April 2005 in respect of
85,238 ordinary shares at an option price of 485.00 pence (closing middle market price 1048
pence); and
(v) by Mr Webster of executive share options on 7 October 2004 in respect of 16,800 ordinary shares at an
option price of 433.00 pence (closing middle market price 941.50 pence) and on 8 June 2005 in respect
of 21,021 ordinary shares at an option price of 483.50 pence (closing middle market price 1133 pence); 
(b) Options granted to Mr Legtmann in 2003 (161,238) and 2004 (38,461) lapsed on 24 January 2005 upon 
his ceasing to be a Director;
(c) The highest mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year was 1202 pence and the
lowest was 822 pence. The year-end price was 1186 pence; 
(d) The performance conditions for options granted under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes between May 1994 
and December 1996 are that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings per share over a
period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK retail price index over the same
period by at least 6%. Options granted in, and subsequent to, December 1997 may not be exercised unless
growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK
retail price index over the same period by at least 9%. The number of options exercisable for Executive
Directors under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes are, in addition, determined by the return on capital employed
achieved over the same rolling three-year period.For options granted in 1997 and 1998, achieving a return 
on capital employed of 15% per annum will enable 50% of options granted to become exercisable, rising on
a sliding scale to 100% for achieving a return on capital employed of 20% or more. With effect from October
1999 the return on capital employed required to permit exercise of 100% of options granted was reduced
from 20% to 17.5% and the sliding scale was adjusted accordingly; and
(e) Performance targets not yet met.
Savings related share option schemes
The UK- and US-based Executive Directors may also participate in the 
UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”) and the Employee
Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) respectively. Under the SRSOS, participants
who enter into a savings contract, to a maximum level of £250 per month,
are granted options to subscribe for shares in the Company. Under the
ESPP , a US Code 423 Plan, US participants may enter into a savings
contract to a maximum level of $400 per month. The Board may
determine that the options granted under either scheme may be granted
at a discount. The maximum discount is 20% for the SRSOS and 15% 
for the ESPP of the average market prices used to determine the price of 
the award. The following table sets out the number of share options held
under the SRSOS and ESPP by the Executive Directors.

Messrs Banks, Hord, Hornsby and Marchbank each exercised 358
options (a reduction of 14 options (which lapsed) from the total of 372
options listed at 1 August 2004 due to exchange rate fluctuations) under
the Group’s ESPP on 26 April 2005. The closing middle market price 
on 26 April 2005 was 1099 pence. Messrs Banks and Webster both
exercised options on 8 June 2005 under the SRSOS. Mr Banks exercised
1,690 options and Mr Webster exercised 1,014 options at a price of
562.00 pence. The closing middle market price on 8 June 2005 was 
1133 pence.
Pensions
Mr Webster, as a UK Executive Director, participates in the Wolseley Group
Retirement Benefits Plan (“the Plan”). The Plan is a defined benefit scheme
and provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries. The Company
makes contributions to the Plan based on the recommendation of the Plan
actuary. Bonuses payable to UK Executive Directors are not pensionable. 
Mr Webster currently contributes 6% per annum of his pensionable salary 
to the Plan.
The Finance Act 1989 introduced an earnings cap (“the Cap”) for
employees joining the Plan after 31 May 1989. This has the effect of
limiting the amount of an employee’s salary that can be pensioned through
a tax approved pension scheme. The current limit, to which Mr Webster 
is subject, is £105,600 per annum. The Company has agreed to provide 
Mr Webster with benefits which are broadly comparable with those that
would have applied under the Plan had the Cap not been introduced. 
This is currently provided for by payments into a Funded Unapproved
Retirement Benefits Scheme. Additionally, the Finance Act 1989 capped
life assurance payable through an approved pension scheme in respect 
of such executives. The Company has taken out an insurance policy to
cover that part of the life assurance for Mr Webster which is in excess 
of the Cap.

Remuneration report continued
The amount charged to the profit and loss account during the year in
respect of his future obligation was £66,812 (including £2,496 in respect 
of life insurance) (2004: £35,712).
The Committee has agreed the Company’s approach in response to the 
UK pensions simplification, which will become effective in April 2006 for
those Executive Directors who are, or will become, members of the UK
approved pension plan. Such Directors will be given the option of either: 
> maintaining the existing pension promise, in which case the executive
would be responsible for any additional taxation arising; or 
> ceasing to accrue pension benefit in respect of service after April 2006
and instead, receiving a cash retirement benefit allowance, subject to
income taxation consistent with the Company’s cost neutral objective.
Past service benefit would remain linked to future salary increases 
subject to a cap similar to the existing Cap.
Messrs Banks, Hornsby and Marchbank, who are US citizens, participate 
in the defined contribution pension arrangements of Ferguson Enterprises,
Inc. In line with US practice, Messrs Banks, Hornsby and Marchbank
receive contributions at the level of 15% of their earnings (for this purpose
$420,000 for Mr Banks and $400,000 for Messrs Hornsby and Marchbank
of bonus respectively is included with base salary). Mr Hord, also a US
citizen, participates in the defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
of Stock Building Supply, Inc. Mr Hord’s pensionable earnings include his
bonus up to a maximum of $742,400 as agreed when the bonus scheme
was introduced in order to preserve his pension entitlement at that time. 
Mr Hord is also a member of a US non-qualified plan, which will provide 
a benefit for 20 years after retirement at age 60 of 40% of final pensionable
salary. At Mr Hord’s choice, and with Company consent, the benefit can 
be paid over a period of 1, 5, 10 or 15 years with the total amount of the
benefit, in cash terms, being the same.

A US subsidiary undertaking has a commitment to a former Director, who 
is a US citizen, to pay a joint survivor pension of $300,000 per annum for 
15 years from 1 August 1993. The net present value of the future obligation
at 31 July 2005 was £460,110 (2004: £570,000), which has been charged
in prior years’ accounts.
Additionally, Brossette, a French subsidiary undertaking, has a commitment
to a former Director, who is a French citizen, to pay an annual pension 
of 1215,392 (2004: 1211,212), with a widow’s entitlement of 60%, subject 
to an annual increase based on the agreed French pension index. The full
actuarial cost of this arrangement was provided in previous years as part 
of Brossette’s ongoing pension obligations. The Company is guarantor of
this future pension commitment which at 31 July 2005 was approximately
£1.9 million (2004: £2.1 million).

1. Mr Webster is also entitled to benefits under a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme. The last row of figures in the above table relates to the benefits payable under such scheme.
Note: Mr Legtmann received a refund of his contributions consequent on his ceasing to be a Director on 24 January 2005. No further pension benefits accrue to Mr Legtmann.
The table below shows the Executive Directors in office on 31 July 2005 who participated during the year in the Group’s defined benefits plans and 
the amounts of benefit accrued at the end of the year as if the Director had left service on 31 July 2005, the change in accrued benefit over the year, 
the transfer value at both the beginning and end of the year as well as the change in the transfer value over the year as required by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The increase in transfer value figures represents an obligation on the pension fund or the Company – 
they are not sums due or paid to the Director. The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require additional disclosure of the change in accrued 
benefit net of inflation and the transfer value of this change. These pension liabilities are calculated using the cash equivalent transfer value method
prescribed in the Listing Rules.

Policy on remuneration of Non Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non Executive Directors during the year under review
was made up of a basic fee and an additional fee where a Non Executive
Director acts as Chairman of either the audit or remuneration committees
and for the Director nominated as Senior Independent Non Executive
Director. Fees are reviewed from time to time by the Board. The Non
Executive Directors have letters of engagement rather than service
contracts and do not participate in any incentive plan, nor is any pension
payable in respect of their services as Non Executive Directors. The Board’s
policy is that Non Executive Directors are normally appointed for an initial
term of three years, which is then reviewed and extended for a further
three-year period. Appointments may, however, be terminated upon six
months’ notice. There are no provisions for compensation in the event of
termination. The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non Executive
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office
during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Board of Directors of Wolseley plc has approved this 
remuneration report.
On behalf of the Board
Robert M Walker
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
26 September 2005
External directorships
Executive Directors are encouraged to take on not more than one external
non executive directorship on a non-competitor board, as the Committee
believes there are significant benefits to be achieved to both the Company
and the individual. In order to avoid any conflict of interest, all appointments
are subject to the Board’s approval. Executive Directors may retain
payments received in respect of these appointments. Mr Banks is a 
Non Executive Director of Bunzl plc and of TowneBank/Peninsula (formerly
Harbor Bank), for which the annual rate of his fees is respectively £56,500
and $600 per meeting attended (2005: $0). Mr Hord is a Non Executive
Director of Investors Management Corporation for which the annual rate 
of his fees is $18,000. He resigned from the board of Reeds Jewelers, Inc
on 1 June 2005 in respect of which the annual rate of his fees was
$12,000. Mr Webster is a Non Executive Director of Bradford and 
Bingley plc, for which the annual rate of his fees is £60,000.
Executive share ownership
A share ownership programme was introduced with effect from 1 August
2004. It is designed to encourage all Directors and members of the
Executive Committee to build up a shareholding with a value of 1.5 times
annual base salary for the Group Chief Executive; 1 times annual base
salary for all Executive Directors; 1 times annual fees for all Non Executive
Directors, including the Chairman; and 0.5 times annual base salary for 
all Executive Committee members. For Executive Directors and members
of the Executive Committee this may be achieved by retaining shares
received as a result of participating in a Company employee share plan
(other than the shares sold to finance option exercises, or to pay a
National Insurance or income tax liability or overseas equivalent). The
programme specifically excludes the need for executives to make a
personal investment should awards not vest. Normally these levels of
shareholding should be expected to be achieved within three to five years
from the time the individual is included in the programme.

Basis of accounting
These consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting
standards. The principal accounting policies, as set out below, have 
been applied consistently throughout the year.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts include the results of the parent Company and its
subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 July 2005.
The trading results of businesses acquired, sold or discontinued during 
the year are included in profit on ordinary activities from the date of
effective acquisition or up to the date of sale or discontinuance, unless
provision therefore has been made in earlier years.
Foreign currencies
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated 
into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant 
financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 31 July. Exchange 
differences arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets 
of these subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the beginning and end 
of the year are dealt with through reserves as are exchange differences 
on foreign currency borrowings raised to finance overseas assets.
Exchange differences on financial instruments entered into for foreign
currency net assets hedging purposes are dealt with through reserves.
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary
undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date 
of investment.
All other foreign currency assets and liabilities of the Company and its
United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at 
the rate ruling at 31 July except in those instances where forward cover
has been arranged, in which case this forward rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions during the year are translated into sterling 
at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction except when
forward exchange contracts are in place, when the forward contract rate 
is used. Any exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and
loss account.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiary undertakings and
businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets acquired.
Prior to 1 August 1998, goodwill arising on consolidation and purchased
goodwill was written off to reserves. Following publication of FRS 10, 
a revised policy for accounting for goodwill was adopted with effect from 
1 August 1998. Goodwill arising from acquisitions completed on or after
that date is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over a 
period of not more than 20 years. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior 
to 1 August 1998 has not been reinstated on the balance sheet.
The net assets of businesses acquired are incorporated in the consolidated
accounts at their fair value to the Group. Fair value adjustments principally
relate to adjustments necessary to bring the accounting policies of
acquired businesses into line with those of the Wolseley Group but may
also include other adjustments necessary to restate assets and liabilities 
at their fair values at the date of acquisition. All businesses acquired are
consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting.
Turnover
Turnover is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services
falling within the Group's ordinary activities, excluding intra-Group sales,
estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts,
value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Turnover from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and
rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the customer.
The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have 
been transferred when the goods are shipped to, or are picked up by, 
the customer.
Turnover from services, other than those that arise from construction
service contracts (see below), are recognised when the service provided 
to the customer has been completed.
Turnover in respect of construction service contracts, where the Group 
is providing framing lumber installation services to residential property
companies, is recognised using the percentage of completion method,
with the percentage complete being determined by comparing the
percentage of costs incurred to date with the estimated total costs of the
contract. Losses on these contracts, if any, are recognised in the period
when such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Turnover from the provision of goods and all services is only recognised
when the amounts to be recognised are fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured.

Accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 July 2005
Leased assets
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements which give rights
approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been
purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments is included
in borrowings. The rentals payable are apportioned between interest,
which is charged to the profit and loss account, and capital, which
reduces the outstanding obligation. The cost of operating leases is
charged on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Costs in respect of computer systems
Costs in respect of developing and implementing significant computer
systems are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives of
typically 3 to 5 years. Costs include: computer and network hardware;
software licences; consulting costs attributable to the development, design
and implementation of the system; and internal costs directly attributable
to the development, design and implementation of the system. Costs in
respect of training and data conversion are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets (except freehold land)
mainly on a straight line basis to write off the cost of those assets, less
their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. The principal rates 
of depreciation are: freehold buildings and long leaseholds, 2-3%; short
leaseholds, over the term of the lease; plant and machinery, 10-15%;
fixtures and fittings, 15%; computers, 20-100% and motor vehicles, 25%.
Real property awaiting disposal
Real property awaiting disposal is transferred to current assets at the 
lower of book written down value and estimated net realisable value.
Depreciation is not applied to real property awaiting disposal, but the
carrying value is reviewed annually and written down through the profit 
and loss account to current estimated net realisable value if lower.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of Group cost and net realisable value, due
allowance being made for obsolete or slow moving items. Raw materials,
bought out components and goods purchased for resale are stated at
cost on a first in, first out basis.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or asset has
arisen as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance sheet
date and have given rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or
the right to pay less tax in the future. An asset has not been recognised to
the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
Provision is made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the distribution to
the UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where
dividends have been recognised as receivable.
Derivatives and financial instruments
Financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and currency
swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business
activities of the Group and the financing of those activities. There is no
trading activity in financial instruments. A discussion of how the financial
risks are managed is included in the operating and financial review on
pages 33 to 35. Financial instruments are accounted for as follows:
> Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the Group’s exposure to
movements in interest rates. The interest payable or receivable on 
such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits
or borrowings. Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior 
to maturity.
> Cross-currency interest rate swaps (currency swaps) are used to hedge
foreign currency assets and borrowings. The future currency exchange
within such contracts is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance
sheet date and any unrealised gain or loss is matched with that on the
underlying asset or liability in reserves. The interest coupon on such
swaps is accrued in the same way as that on borrowings and deposits.
Pensions and post retirement benefits
The expected costs of providing retirement pensions under defined benefit
plans and other post retirement benefits are charged to the profit and loss
account over the periods benefiting from the employees’ services in
accordance with the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.
Variations from expected cost are normally spread over the average
remaining service lives of current employees.
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post
retirement benefits are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

Other timing differences 34.5 (5.7)
Deferred tax liability/(asset) 44.9 (3.0)
The movements in the deferred tax balance were as follows:

Acquisitions 1.2 1.7
Transfers (0.1) (0.1)
Exchange 2.0 (0.5)
Liability/(asset) at end of year 44.9 (3.0)
The closing balance is made up of:
Deferred tax asset (25.5) (34.0)
Deferred tax liability 70.4 31.0
44.9 (3.0)
There are other deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £29.7 million (2004: £31.4 million) that have not been recognised on the basis that 
their future economic benefit is uncertain.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value or on the sale of properties where potentially
taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets. Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible 
to claim rollover relief. The total amount unprovided for is £16.6 million (2004: £16.8 million). At present, it is not anticipated that any tax will become
payable in the foreseeable future.

7. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 78.53 pence (2004: 68.15 pence) is calculated on the profit of £461.2 million (2004: £397.0 million) accruing to ordinary share
capital and on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 587.2 million (2004: 582.6 million). The impact of all potentially
dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 593.4 million and to reduce basic
earnings per share to 77.71 pence. The earnings per share before goodwill amortisation of 85.93 pence (2004: 74.84 pence) is calculated on the profit 
of £504.6 million (2004: £436.0 million) accruing to ordinary share capital.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding and potential claims.
Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is probable that 
a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated. Included in this provision is an amount of £31.7 million (2004:
£27.9 million) related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies. This liability is fully covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent
insurance receivable has been recorded in ‘Other debtors’ (note 13) in line with FRS 12 ‘Provisions, contingencies and contingent assets’. The liability 
has been determined as at 31 July 2005 based on advice from independent professional actuarial advisors. The provision and the related receivable 
have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term US treasury rate of 4.5% (2004: 5%). The level of insurance cover available significantly 
exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Other provisions principally comprise provisions for terminal dilapidations on property leases and provisions for future rents payable net of rents receivable
on onerous and vacant property leases.
At 31 July 2005 the Company had provisions of £ nil (2004: £ nil).

Incentive Scheme. During the year one of these trusts purchased 2,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company, with a nominal value of £0.5 million, 
for a cash consideration of £18.6 million. The market value of these shares at 31 July 2005 was £23.7 million and none of them had been allocated 
to employees or Directors at that date. Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the provisions 
of the trust deeds.

The accounting policy adjustments to tangible fixed assets reflect their restatement at depreciated replacement cost with useful lives determined in
accordance with Group accounting policies. The book value of stocks has been adjusted to write down slow moving and obsolete stocks to their 
estimated net realisable values in accordance with the Group accounting policy. Adjustments to debtors comprise provisions for bad and doubtful debts 
in accordance with the Group accounting policy. The fair value adjustments shown above for the year ended 31 July 2005 are provisional figures, being 
the best estimates currently available.

Financial instruments held to manage the Group’s interest rate and currency profile
Interest rate swaps – 0.2 – (1.0)
Short-term currency swaps – (11.1) – 0.4
For the purpose of the above table, the fair values of short-term borrowings, cash and deposits, construction loans payable and current asset investments,
approximate book value due to their short maturities. The loans and other borrowings payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based
on 6 month LIBOR. Thus the fair value of these instruments as at 31 July 2005 also approximates to their book value. The fair value of construction loans
receivable approximates to book value as the interest rates attaching to these loans reflect a market risk premium. Sterling cash and deposits are utilised 
to reduce currency borrowings through the use of short-term currency swaps.
To determine the fair value of currency and interest rate swaps for inclusion in the above table, a calculation was made of the net gain or loss which 
would have arisen if these contracts had been terminated on 31 July 2005.
An analysis of the unrecognised gains and losses on the Group’s hedges at 31 July 2005 is set out below:
Gains Losses Total

Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at beginning of the year 0.7 (1.3) (0.6)

Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at the end of the year 3.3 (14.2) (10.9)
Of which:
Gains and losses expected to be recognised within one year 1.4 (12.2) (10.8)
Gains and losses expected to be recognised after one year 1.9 (2.0) (0.1)
The Group’s policies in respect of foreign currency and interest risk management and the related use of financial instruments are set out in the treasury
section of the operating and financial review on pages 33 to 35 and form part of these financial statements.
Short-term debtors and creditors arising directly from the Group’s operations are excluded from the above disclosures other than those relating to assets
and liabilities by currency.

33. Pensions and other post retirement benefits
United Kingdom
The principal plan operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The plan’s retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees with the balance
being paid by Group companies. The contribution rates paid by employees at 31 July 2005 are either 5% or 6% of earnings depending upon the level 
of benefits they were accruing at that date. The Group and employee contribution rates are calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with 
an independent consulting actuary.
An independent actuarial valuation was last carried out on 1 May 2004. On that date the market value of the plan’s assets was £334.3 million. The market
value of the assets was 74% of accrued benefits, after allowing for increases in earnings and pensions in payment. The normal cost to the Company and
the contribution rate for the year ending 31 July 2006 is 17.2% of pensionable earnings in respect of those employees accruing benefits based on 60ths.
The financial assumptions used were based on gilt and bond yields as at the valuation date. The principal actuarial assumptions used were an investment
return of 6.5% per annum before retirement, an investment return of 5.25% per annum after retirement, future salary increases of 4% per annum plus 
an additional promotional salary scale, and increases to pensions in payment of 2.25% per annum. The actuarial valuation also assumes that mortality 
will be in line with nationally published PMA92 and PFA92 mortality tables incorporating projected improvements to life expectancy to 2010 (current
pensioners) and 2020 (non-retired members). The total charge to the profit and loss account for UK companies was £17.0 million (2004: £13.5 million).
North America
The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, details of which are set out below. In addition, the Group operates 
three defined benefit schemes in the United States. In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated. The majority 
of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are established in accordance with US 401(k) rules. Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit
sharing plans. Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they fall due. In the year to 31 July 2005 the cost of defined
contribution plans charged to the profit and loss account was £17.7 million (2004: £14.3 million).
Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans are operated by three US subsidiary undertakings and Wolseley Canada. Two of the US plans and the Canadian plan are funded. 
Two plans are closed to new entrants. The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan. 
No further funding by Group companies is required. The remaining plans provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries. The contribution rate is
calculated on the Projected Unit (Credit) Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries. The independent actuaries have reported on the assets
and liabilities of the plans at 31 July 2004. The principal actuarial assumptions were based upon investment returns of 7.7% and future salary increases 
of 2%. The obligations are discounted at 6.4%. The fair value of the assets of the funded plans amounted to £52.5 million. The market value of the assets
was 87.5% of the accrued benefits. Surpluses and deficits revealed by the valuation are being amortised over the expected remaining service lives of
members. The total profit and loss account charge for North American schemes was £1.8 million (2004: £3.1 million).
Other territories
Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with
actuarial advice. Full provision is made for such liabilities in these accounts. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period 
in which they fall due.
The cost of other defined contribution and defined benefit schemes charged to the profit and loss account was £6.4 million (2004: £4.5 million).
Post retirement health care
There are no material obligations to provide post retirement health care benefits.

33. Pensions and other post retirement benefits continued
FRS 17 retirement benefits
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures with respect to the UK scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 May 2004 and
updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 July 2005. Scheme
assets are stated at their market value at 31 July 2005. Non-UK schemes have been aggregated and weighted averages applied.
The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are:

Salary increases *3.25% 2.50% *3.50% 3.16% 4.65% 3.41%
*In addition, a promotional salary scale has been added to the salary increase assumption at 31 July 2004 and 31 July 2005. At 31 July 2005 this was
equivalent to an overall increase of 1.5% per annum.

36. Contingent liabilities
The Group experiences legal claims in the normal course of its business. Provision is made in note 19 for such legal claims where it is probable that a
payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated.
Wolseley plc and the Group have the undermentioned quantifiable contingent liabilities which arose in the ordinary course of business and which have 
not been provided in these accounts since no actual liability is expected to arise:

An amount of £401.5 million (2004: £139.7 million) is expected to be received from counterparties in respect of the obligations under forward foreign
exchange contracts detailed above.
In addition, Wolseley plc has given its principal UK bank authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against or towards satisfaction 
of the liability to the bank of certain subsidiary undertakings.
As of 31 July 2005, cash deposits of Wolseley Insurance Limited amounting to £40.8 million (2004: £32.7 million) were charged in favour of Lloyds TSB
Bank plc to secure letters of credit provided by that bank.
The Company acts as guarantor or surety for various subsidiary undertakings in leasing and other agreements entered into by them in the normal course 
of business and has given indemnities and warranties to the purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group companies in respect of
which no material liabilities are expected to arise. Additionally, the Company has guaranteed the pension payable by Brossette BTI to Mr. G. Pinault, 
a former director.
37. Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant post balance sheet events.

38. Summary of significant differences between accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and the
United States
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom 
(“UK GAAP”), which differ in certain significant respects from generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“US GAAP”). Such
differences involve methods for measuring the amounts shown in the
financial statements, as well as additional disclosures required by US GAAP .
A summary of the principal differences applicable to the Group are set 
out below:
(i) Purchase accounting adjustments
Under UK GAAP the purchase price of a business is assigned first to the
separable tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis 
of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of cost over the
fair value of net tangible assets is then allocated to identifiable intangible
assets to the extent that their value can be measured reliably on initial
recognition, the asset can be separately disposed of and the asset is
controlled through custody or legal right. Any remaining excess should
then be recorded as goodwill. Under US GAAP , the purchase cost of an
investment is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill.
The purchase accounting differences specifically related to the Group are
as follows:
Goodwill
Prior to 1 August 1998, purchased goodwill was written off to reserves in
the year of acquisition as permitted under UK GAAP . Since 1 August 1998,
all acquired goodwill has been capitalised and amortised over a period not
exceeding 20 years. If a subsidiary or a business is subsequently sold or
closed, previously written off goodwill which was the result of the initial
acquisition is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale 
or closure.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, goodwill arising on acquisitions
prior to 1 July 2001 was capitalised and amortised over its estimated
useful life, not exceeding 40 years. Under the transition provisions of 
SFAS 142 “Goodwill and other intangible assets”, goodwill which arose
during the period subsequent to 1 July 2001 has not been amortised.
From 1 August 2002, goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed 
at least annually for impairment. The Group completed the required
impairment tests during 2005 which indicated no impairment charge 
was required.
Intangible assets
Under UK GAAP specific criteria apply in recognising intangible assets.
None of the Group’s intangible assets meet these criteria and accordingly
intangible assets have not been separately recorded. Under US GAAP ,
intangible assets acquired are recorded at their fair value. Intangible assets
are comprised of covenants not to compete, trademarks, customer
contracts and supply and distribution agreements. Intangible assets 
are being amortised over their useful lives which range from one to 
twenty five years.
Inventory
Under UK GAAP , the fair value of inventories acquired is generally taken 
to be the cost of the inventory to the acquired company. Under US GAAP
the fair value of purchased work in process and finished goods is based
on estimated selling prices less costs to complete and sell the inventory,
less a reasonable profit allowance for the completing and selling effort.
Contingent purchase consideration
Under UK GAAP contingent purchase consideration is generally included
as part of the purchase cost at the date of acquisition. Under US GAAP
this cost is not recognised until the contingency is resolved and the
amount determinable.
(ii) Tangible fixed asset amortisation
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the lesser of the life of the
asset or lease term. The lease term under UK GAAP includes the period
the lessee has contracted to lease the asset plus any further terms for
which the lessee has the option to continue to lease the asset which
option it is reasonably certain at the inception of the lease that the lessee
will exercise. In determining this life the Company considers the plans of
the business, the nature of the property leased and the experience of the
company in respect of similar properties. Under US GAAP the lease term
is determined as the non cancellable lease term and any option renewal
period where failure to exercise such an option would result in an economic
penalty in such amount that renewal appears at the inception of the lease
to be reasonably assured. Under US GAAP the historical experience of 
the Company is not considered, and as a result, under US GAAP the lease
term for certain leases is shorter than that applying under UK GAAP and 
a higher depreciation charge reported. The US GAAP adjustment in 2005
represents a revision of the Group’s treatment for this item and includes 
an immaterial amount in respect of prior years.
(iii) Committed rental increases
Under UK GAAP , committed rental increases, which could be considered
in the same way as inflationary increases and increases due to market
comparables, are generally recognised as they arise. Under US GAAP ,
committed rental increases are required to be spread over the entire 
lease term. The US GAAP adjustment in 2005 represents a revision of 
the Group’s treatment for this item and includes an immaterial amount 
in respect of prior years.

Year ended 31 July 2005
(iv) Pensions
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in the UK, Ireland, USA,
Canada, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland.
The most significant plan is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan
in the UK, which after stock market falls is in a deficit position.
Under UK GAAP , the cost of providing pension benefits is expensed over
the average expected service lives of eligible employees in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (“SSAP”)
24, Accounting for Pension Costs. SSAP 24 aims to produce an estimate
of cost based on long-term actuarial assumptions. Variations from the
regular pension cost arising from, for example, experience deficiencies 
or surpluses, are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over
the expected average remaining service lives of current employees in 
the schemes.
Under US GAAP , the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of
benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with SFAS 87,
“Employers Accounting for Pensions”. SFAS 87 requires the use of the
projected unit credit actuarial method for determining defined benefit
pension costs and provides for the deferral of actuarial gains and losses 
(in excess of a specified corridor) that result from changes in assumptions
or actual experience. SFAS 132, “Employers Disclosure about Pensions and
Other Post-Retirement Benefits”, requires disclosure of the components 
of net periodic pension cost and the funded status of the pension plans.
(v) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP , provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability 
or asset arose as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance
sheet date and gave rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, 
or a right to pay less tax in the future. An asset has not been recognised
to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
Provision is made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the distribution 
to the UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where
dividends have been recognised as receivable.
Under US GAAP , deferred taxation is provided for on a full liability basis.
Under the full liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised
for differences between the accounting and taxation basis of assets and
liabilities and for tax loss carry forwards at the statutory rate at each reporting
date. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
The recognised deferred tax asset is based upon the expected future
utilisation of tax loss carry forwards and the reversal of other temporary
differences. The tax loss carry forwards do not expire and there are no
current restrictions on their utilisation. For financial reporting purposes, 
the Group has recognised a valuation allowance for those benefits for
which realisation does not meet the “more likely than not” criterion. 
No provision has been made in respect of unremitted foreign earnings
because they are intended to be permanently reinvested. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be 
payable on these other foreign earnings.
(vi) Share compensation
The Company operates seven share option plans: the 1984 Executive
Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme and 
the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (collectively, the “Executive Option
Schemes”); the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share Option
Scheme 1981 and Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2001 (collectively, 
the “Employees Savings Option Schemes”); the Wolseley Employee Share
Purchase Plan 2001 (the “Employee Share Purchase Plan”); and the
Wolseley Employees International Stock Appreciation Plan (the “SAP”).
Under UK GAAP , no compensation expense is required to be recognised
for any of these option plans. Under US GAAP , stock based compensation
for the Executive Option Schemes, the Employees Savings Option Schemes
and the Employee Share Purchase Plan is accounted for based on the fair
value of the award on the date of grant following SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation. Awards granted under the Employee
Savings Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven
years. Awards granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan vest 
over one year.
The SAP is treated as a variable plan since the award to be received by
the employees is indeterminate at the date of grant. As a variable plan, 
the compensation cost is determined each year with reference to the
period-end quoted market price of the stock and the charge is only
actually fixed once the award to the employee is known. Awards granted
under the SAP vest over a period of five years.
The Company has operated a Long Term Incentive Scheme since
November 2002. Until 2004 only cash awards were made. Following 
an amendment to the Scheme in November 2004 awards will normally 
be made in shares, save where there are material securities or tax law
constraints in overseas jurisdictions where the scheme is to be operated,
in which case conditional awards in cash would continue to be made.
Under UK GAAP , the awards settled in shares are accounted for on 
the basis of the intrinsic value of the award on the date of grant. Under  
US GAAP , the awards settled in shares are accounted for on the basis of
the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Awards granted under the
Long Term Incentive Scheme vest over three years.
11134_Wolseley.qxd  6/10/05  11:35 pm  Page 88 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Notes to the accounts 89
(vii) Ordinary dividend
Under UK GAAP , ordinary dividends proposed are provided for in the 
year in respect of which they are recommended by the Board of Directors
although approval of the final dividend will not take place until the Company’s
Annual General Meeting subsequent to the year-end. Under US GAAP ,
such dividends are provided for in the year in which they are declared 
and approved by the Board of Directors.
(viii) Other US GAAP adjustments
Restructuring costs
Under UK GAAP , a provision for restructuring costs is recognised only
when a present obligation (legal or constructive) exists as a result of a past
event; it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount
of the obligation.
Under US GAAP , for restructuring plans initiated after 1 January 2003, 
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity can only be
recognised when the liability is incurred. An entity’s commitment to a plan,
by itself, does not create a present obligation to others that meets the
definition of a liability. The timing of recognition and related measurement
of a liability for one-time termination benefits in relation to employees who
are to be involuntarily terminated depends on whether the employees are
required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the
termination benefits and, if so, whether employees will be retained to
render service beyond the minimum retention period.
Sale and leaseback accounting
Under UK GAAP , gains on sale and leaseback transactions where the
subsequent lease is an operating lease are recognised immediately if the
transactions are established at fair value. Differences between the sale
price and fair value are generally deferred and amortised over the period
for which the assets are expected to be used. Under US GAAP , such
gains are deferred and amortised over the term of the lease.
Compensated short-term absences
Under UK GAAP , in line with common practice, the Group generally does
not account for holiday pay accruals unless legally obliged to make cash
settlement. Under US GAAP the expected cost of compensated short-term
absences (e.g. holidays) should be recognised when employees render the
service that increases their entitlement.
Capitalised interest
Under UK GAAP , the Group does not capitalise interest on specific or
general borrowings to finance the construction of certain tangible fixed
assets. Under US GAAP , this interest is capitalised. The amount of interest
capitalised is based on a weighted average method considering the general
borrowings outstanding during the period. Capitalised interest is then
depreciated as a component of the underlying asset.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities
Under UK GAAP , derivative financial instruments that reduce exposures 
on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge
accounting. Under US GAAP all derivatives are recorded at fair value. 
If certain conditions and criteria set out in FAS 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” are met, hedge accounting
would apply. Wolseley has designated the majority of its derivative financial
instruments as qualifying hedge instruments under US GAAP and as such,
these instruments are carried at fair value with valuation adjustments
recorded through other comprehensive income.
(ix) Presentation of earnings per share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted net
income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares and potentially dilutive ordinary shares,
which includes the dilutive effect of stock options. Dilutive potential
ordinary shares for all periods presented are computed utilising the
treasury stock method.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise the profit and
loss account, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, the statement 
of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes which have
been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting
policies set out in the statement of accounting policies. We have also
audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 contained in the Directors’ remuneration report 
(“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
Accounts and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the
statement of Directors’ responsibilities. The Directors are also 
responsible for preparing the Directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part
of the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has
been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, 
in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and
Accounts and consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, the
Chairman’s statement, the Group Chief Executive’s review, the operating
and financial review and the corporate governance statement. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group at 31 July 2005 and of the profit and
cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
> the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
> those parts of the Directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased that with 
the newly refreshed 
Board, we have a strong 
and experienced team 
to support and guide 
the Group.”
John Nicholas, Chairman
I was delighted to be appointed Chairman of 
your Company in January of this year , following 
the retirement of John Rennocks from the 
Board. During his ten years as Chairman, John 
guided the Company through an extended 
period of strong and sustained growth which 
delivered excellent returns to shareholders. I 
hope that in the years ahead I will be able to 
maintain this performance through executing 
the Group’s strategy which is designed to 
deliver strong, double-digit growth in earnings 
and shareholder value over the economic cycle.
Shortly after my appointment, in June of this 
year, the Board met at the facility of Kubo, our 
newly acquired Seals business in Switzerland, 
to review the Group’s strategy and to set 
targets and objectives for each of the Group’s 
Sectors to be delivered over the next three 
years. After a number of presentations 
and thorough and challenging reviews 
with Executive management, the Board 
was unanimous in supporting the Group’s 
existing strategy of building larger, broader 
based businesses in our three Sectors. This 
strategy aims to generate stable “GDP plus” 
organic revenue growth over the business 
cycle, sustainable attractive margins and 
strong cash flow. The Board also confirmed 
the ambition of accelerating growth through 
an active acquisition programme, utilising 
the Group’s strong cash resources and 
experienced management to enhance value. 
In September , Iain Henderson informed us of 
his decision to step down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the AGM in January 2016 and 
after an orderly handover of responsibilities, to 
retire from the Company on 31 March 2016. Iain 
has been a key member of the Board since 
1998 and as Chief Operating Officer since 2005, 
has played a significant role in developing and 
implementing the strategy of the Group and in 
particular , the Seals and Controls Sector 
businesses. The Board will miss Iain’s wise 
counsel and robust approach to the day-to-day 
operational challenges that face all businesses. 
All of us in the Group wish him a long, healthy 
and well-earned retirement.
The Board is very supportive of the decision by 
our CEO, Bruce Thompson to establish over 
the coming year , a formal Executive 
Management Group (“EMG”) which will report 
to him. The EMG will comprise the key senior 
managers of the main business clusters and 
certain Group functions. Good progress has 
already been achieved with this development 
and two senior level recruits have recently 
joined the Group to strengthen management 
in key areas. The Board remains confident that 
the formation of this EMG over the course of 
2016 will provide Diploma PLC with a strong 
and experienced group of senior business and 
financial managers who have the potential to 
provide leadership in the coming years. 
 
Results
Group revenues increased in 2015 by 9% to 
£333.8m (2014: £305.8m), with acquisitions 
completed during the year contributing 
£24.2m and adverse currency movements 
reducing the results of the overseas 
businesses when translated into UK sterling 
by £8. 1m, when compared with last year. After 
adjusting for the contribution from these and 
prior year acquisitions and for currency effects 
on translation, Group revenues increased by 
1% on an underlying basis. Steady underlying 
revenue growth of ca.4% in both the Life 
Sciences and Seals Sectors more than offset a 
weaker performance from the Controls Sector 
where underlying revenues declined by 5% 
against a strong prior year comparative.
 
Adjusted operating margins remained robust 
at 18. 1% (2014: 18.5%) and adjusted operating 
profit increased by 6% to £60.3m (2014: 
£56.7m). Gross margins in the Canadian and 
Australian Healthcare businesses were again 
impacted by transactional currency effects, 
but this was partly mitigated by a more 
favourable product mix and strong control 
over operating costs. Adjusted profit before 
tax increased by 6% to £59 .6m (2014: £56.2m) 
and adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) also 
increased by 6% to 38.2p (2014: 36. 1p).
The Group generated strong free cash 
flow of £40.3m (2014: £37 .8m), with tighter 
control over working capital providing record 
operating cash flow of £62. 1m (2014: £55.0m). 
Capital expenditure increased to £4.3m 
(2014: £2.2m) with increased investment in 
productive capital represented by facilities, 
healthcare field equipment and seal cutting 
machinery and tooling.  03

It was a much stronger year for acquisition 
activity with the Group investing £37 .8m 
(2014: £16.5m) in new businesses during the 
financial year, extending the Group’s activities 
into new products and geographies in line 
with the Group’s strategic objectives. Shortly 
after the year end the Group completed the 
acquisition of WCIS, an established supplier 
of sealing products and services in Australia 
for a maximum consideration of £9 .8m. The 
WCIS acquisition is another example of how 
the Group uses acquisitions to extend and 
broaden its activities into new markets and 
geographies. 
The much higher spend on acquisitions in this 
financial year, together with distributions of 
£19 .7m (2014: £18.2m) to shareholders during 
the year, contributed to a reduction in net cash 
funds of £18.3m in the year to £3.0m at 30 
September 2015 (2014: £21.3m). 
Dividends
The robust balance sheet and strong free 
cash flow, together with a more favourable 
acquisition environment, has led the Board to 
recommend an increase in the final dividend 
of 7% to 12.4p per share (2014: 11.6p). Subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, this dividend will be paid on 27 
January 2016 to shareholders on the register 
at 27 November 2015.
The total dividend per share for the year will  
be 18.2p (2014: 17 .0p) which represents a 7% 
increase on 2014. The dividend is well covered 
by adjusted EPS at 2. 1 times, in line with the 
Board’s objective of targeting towards a two 
times level of cover.
Governance
We have this year completed the process of 
developing and refreshing the Board started  
by my predecessor in 2013. In February we 
strengthened the Board’s resources with 
the appointment of Andy Smith as a non-
Executive Director. Andy brings excellent 
experience to the Company having previously 
held Group HR roles at Severn T rent PLC and 
The Boots Company PLC. 
I was also pleased that Anne Thorburn 
accepted our invitation to join the Board in 
September. Anne brings to the Company 
many years of experience gained from Board 
level finance roles in listed international 
industrial companies. Anne will replace Marie-
Louise Clayton as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, when she retires from the Board 
this month at the end of her term of office. I 
wish to thank Marie-Louise for the support 
and guidance she has provided to the Board 
during the past three years.
I am pleased that with the newly refreshed 
Board, we have a strong and experienced 
team to support and guide the Group as it 
pursues the successful implementation of the 
Group’s growth strategy . 
 
Employees
Since being appointed Chairman earlier this 
year, I have endeavoured to visit the Group’s 
businesses and meet our employees who 
are so important to the success of the Group. 
I have been impressed by the hard work and 
loyalty that our employees demonstrate to 
each of their businesses and I wish to thank 
them for their efforts this year to deliver a high 
level of service as they strive to meet targets 
in the face of challenging markets.
Outlook
The Group’s strong and proven business model 
delivered robust growth this year , benefitting 
from a good contribution from acquisitions and 
despite adverse exchange rate movements. 
This balance is expected to continue into 
the coming financial year as the economic 
headwinds continue to constrain organic 
growth in the Group’s principal markets in 
North America and Europe, but prospects for 
further acquisitions remain promising.
While the Board remains cautious on the 
current macroeconomic backdrop, we remain 
confident that the Group’s resilient business 
model with a diverse geographic spread 
of activities and strong financial position, 
together with a more favourable environment 
for acquisitions will provide a good platform to 
deliver further growth in the coming year.

What we put in What we get out
Essential Products
Our businesses focus on supplying essential products 
and services funded by customers’ operating rather than 
capital budgets and supplied across a range of specialised 
industry segments.
The majority of the Group’s revenues are generated from 
consumable products. In many cases, the products will  
be used in repair and maintenance applications and 
refurbishment and upgrade programmes, rather than 
supplied to original equipment manufacturers.
Recurring income and stable revenue growth
Our focus on essential products and services contributes 
to the Group’s record of stable revenue growth over the 
business cycle.
Our businesses target organic revenue growth, over the 
economic cycle, at a rate of 5–6% p.a. (“GDP plus” growth), 
with higher growth rates achieved at the Group level 
through carefully selected value enhancing acquisitions.
Essential Solutions
Our businesses design their individual business models to 
provide solutions which closely meet the requirements of 
their customers.
The solutions can be in the form of:
• Highly responsive customer service, such as the next 
day delivery from stock of essential, but low value items;
• Deep technical support, where we work closely with our 
customers in designing our products into their specific 
applications;
• Added value services which, if we did not provide these 
services, customers would have to pay others to provide 
them or would require them to invest in additional 
resources of their own.
Sustainable and attractive margins
By supplying solutions, not just products, we build strong 
long term relationships with our customers and suppliers, 
supporting sustainable and attractive margins.
Our businesses achieve sustainable and attractive gross 
margins by offering strongly differentiated products and 
customer focused solutions within specialised market 
segments. By running efficient operations, these gross 
margins are converted into healthy operating margins.
Essential Values
We encourage an entrepreneurial culture across our 
businesses, through a decentralised management 
structure. 
We want the managers to feel that they have the freedom 
to run their own businesses, while being able to draw 
upon the support and resources of a larger group where 
this is beneficial.
Within our businesses we have strong, self-standing 
management teams who are committed to and rewarded 
according to the success of their businesses.
Agility and responsiveness
Our decentralised organisational model ensures that 
decisions are made close to the customer and that the 
businesses are agile and responsive to changes in the 
market and the competitive environment.   Essential Products                                       Essential Solutions

Growth Strategy
Acquire
Clear business criteria have been established to guide the 
Group’s acquisition programme:
• Fit with the Group’s business model.
• Marketing led with strong customer relationships.
•  Secure supply of high quality , differentiated products.
•  C a p a b le m a n a g e me n t .
The principal financial criteria are: 
• T rack record of stable, profitable growth and 
cash generation.
•  Exceed IRR threshold of 13% to ensure 
20%+ pre-tax return on investment.
Build
Acquisitions are intended to give entry into new but 
related markets and thereby extend the reach of the 
existing businesses and bring new growth opportunities. 
The acquisitions we make are of companies which are 
already successful and with a good track record. However, 
these businesses have typically reached the point where 
additional resources are needed to take them to the 
next level of growth.
Working with the management, we provide the 
investment required to build a solid foundation to allow 
the company to move to a new level of growth. The 
investment will normally be in new facilities and IT 
systems, increased but better managed working capital 
and additional management resource.
Grow
Once the acquisition is integrated into the Group, with a 
solid platform established, the focus is on delivering 
stable, profitable growth.
Except in the case of smaller, bolt-on acquisitions, the 
acquisitions will maintain their distinct sales and marketing 
identity and will be managed as independent business 
units. However, where there are opportunities for 
synergies with other Group businesses, these will be 
managed within larger business clusters.
Typically synergies come in the following areas:
 
 
Cross-selling between the businesses.
 
 
 
Joint purchasing between the businesses.
   Shared back-office functions for finance 
and administration. 10

The businesses target organic revenue 
growth, over the economic cycle, at a rate of 
5–6% p.a. (“GDP plus” growth), with higher 
growth rates achieved at the Group level 
through carefully selected value enhancing 
acquisitions. 
Underlying (organic) revenue is after adjusting 
for the impact from acquisitions and 
divestments and for currency movements on 
the translation of overseas results.
Maintain stable

Adjusted operating margin is an important 
measure of the success of the businesses in 
achieving superior margins by offering

Chief Executive’s Review
The Group delivered 
a robust performance 
with a good 
contribution from 
acquisitions”
 Bruce Thompson, CEO
Business model and growth strategy
The Group’s strategy is designed to generate 
strong, double-digit growth in earnings and 
shareholder value over the business cycle, by 
building larger, broader-based businesses in 
the three Group Sectors of Life Sciences, Seals 
and Controls. 
Our businesses target “GDP plus” levels of 
organic revenue growth over the business 
cycle. Stable and resilient revenue growth is 
achieved through our focus on essential 
products and services funded by customers’ 
operating rather than capital budgets and 
supplied across a range of specialised industry 
segments. By supplying essential solutions, 
not just products, we build strong long term 
relationships with our customers and 
suppliers, which support sustainable and 
attractive margins. Finally we encourage an 
entrepreneurial culture in our businesses 
through our decentralised management 
structure and these essential values ensure 
that decisions are made close to the customer 
and that the businesses are agile and 
responsive to changes in the market and the 
competitive environment.
Overall growth is accelerated from the 
underlying GDP plus levels to the corporate 
target of strong, double-digit growth, 
through carefully selected, value-enhancing 
acquisitions which fit the business model and 
offer entry into new strategic markets. 
Acquisitions are not made just to add revenue 
and profit, but rather to bring into the Group 
successful businesses which have growth 
potential, capable management and a good 
track record of profitable growth and cash 
generation. As part of our Acquire, Build, Grow 
strategy , we invest in the businesses post 
acquisition to build a firm foundation to allow 
them to move to a new level of growth. These 
acquisitions form a critical part of our Sector 
growth strategies and are designed to generate 
a pre-tax return on investment of at least 20% 
and hence support our Group objective of 
consistently exceeding 20% ROA TCE.
In 2015, the Group has delivered a robust 
performance with a good contribution 
from acquisitions completed during the last 
eighteen months. The Group’s revenues 
increased by 9% with the acquired businesses 
adding 11% to revenues, but with adverse 
currency movements reducing revenues 
by 3% on translation to UK sterling. After 
adjusting for acquisitions and currency , 
underlying revenues increased by 1%. 
Adjusted operating margins decreased 
by 40bps to 18. 1% of revenue, reflecting 
transactional currency effects in the 
Healthcare businesses and initial dilution 
from the acquired businesses. Free cash flow 
increased by 7% to £40.3m and return on 
adjusted trading capital employed (“ROA TCE”) 
remained comfortably above the 20% 
threshold at 23.9%.  13

Performance against objectives and KPIs
The Group’s principal corporate objectives  
are to achieve double digit growth in adjusted 
earnings per share (“EPS”) over the business 
cycle, to generate total shareholder return 
(“TSR”) growth in the upper quartile of the 
FTSE 250 and to deliver progressive dividend 
growth with two times dividend cover.  
The compound growth in adjusted EPS has 
been 15% p.a. over the last five years, with  
growth this year at the more modest level of 
6%. Over the last five years, the compound 
growth in TSR has been 22% p.a. This year , 
TSR has been broadly flat after a number of 
years of very strong growth. Dividends have 
increased progressively in each of the last 
16 years and this year the dividend has 
increased by 7%. Over the last five years, 
the compound growth in dividends has 
been 15% p.a. 
Underpinning the principal corporate 
objectives are a set of further objectives, with 
related key performance indicators (“KPIs”) 
which are used to measure performance at 
the Group level, but also to drill down through 
the operating businesses. 
The first of these next level objectives is to 
generate stable “GDP plus” levels of organic 
revenue growth over the business cycle. This

year, challenging markets within the three 
Sectors meant that organic growth has been 
hard won. In Life Sciences, underlying 
revenues increased by 4% despite the 
pressure on budgets throughout the 
Healthcare system driven by the tougher 
economic environments in Canada and 
Australia. In Seals, underlying revenues 
increased by 4% as trading activity in North 
America slowed in the second half of the year, 
impacted indirectly by cutbacks in the Oil & 
Gas sector and lower demand for natural 
resources. Controls revenues decreased by 
5% on an underlying basis, reflecting softer 
European industrial markets and strong prior 
year comparatives.
The objective for adjusted operating margins 
is to maintain stable attractive margins which 
reflect the focus on specialised segments, 
strongly differentiated products and customer 
focused solutions, combined with efficiently 
run operations. This year, adjusted operating 
margins were 18. 1% which is at the lower end 
of the five year average range of 18–19%. 
As always there were a number of moving 
parts, with margins negatively impacted by 
the reduced gross margins in the Healthcare 
businesses, initial dilution from acquired 
businesses and one-off facility restructuring 
costs in the US. However, the impact on 
Group operating margins was limited to 
40bps by Sector mix and by tight control of 
operating costs across the businesses. 
The Group continues to focus strongly on free 
cash flow, which funds the growth strategy 
and gives the resources to provide healthy 
dividends to shareholders. In 2015, free cash 
flow was £40.3m, compared with a five year 
average of £33m p.a. and was equivalent to a 
conversion rate of over 90% of adjusted after 
tax earnings. 
The principal determinant of free cash flow 
conversion is the effective management of 
working capital and the KPI used to measure 
and monitor this performance is working 
capital as a percentage of revenue. In 2015 
this KPI remained stable at 17 .0% comparing 
well with the five year average level of 16–17% 
which is also the longer term target.
ROATCE is the final indicator of the overall 
performance of the Group and very 
importantly of its success in creating value 
for shareholders. ROA TCE is measured as 
the pre-tax return on total Group investment 
excluding net cash, but including all goodwill 
and acquired intangible assets. ROA TCE has 
comfortably exceeded the 20% target in each 
of the last five years and this year was 23.9%.

of Ireland and the UK. In addition, TPD brings 
important new products and suppliers to 
the DHG group in the areas of rapid hygiene 
testing in Food, Dairy and Pharmaceutical 
industries as well as Digestive Health.
In Seals, the Group acquired Kubo, a leading 
supplier of seals, ‘O’ rings, gaskets and 
moulded rubber parts serving a diverse base 
of industrial customers in Switzerland and 
Austria. This acquisition opens up further 
opportunities for cross-selling of products 
with the Group’s other Industrial OEM Seals 
businesses, giving them access to Kubo’s 
high precision manufactured parts.  In the 
UK, FPE Seals acquired Swan Seals, a small 
specialised supplier of machined seals based in 
Aberdeen and serving customers’ operational 
requirements.
The Group also acquired a further 10% 
shareholding in Kentek, taking our ownership 
to 90% with the balance held by the Managing 
Director of the business. In October 2015, 
shortly after the year end, the Group 
acquired WCIS, a supplier of gaskets, seals 
and associated products and services, with 
operations in Australia and New Caledonia.
Management development
Iain Henderson, our Chief Operating Officer 
(“COO”), decided during the year that he 
would like to retire from the Group. Iain will 
stand down from the Board at the January 
2016 AGM but will stay fully involved with the 
Group until the end of March 2016 to ensure a 
smooth handover of responsibilities. Iain has 
“ C a re ful l y s e l e c t e d , 
value enhancing 
acquisitions 
accelerate growth 
and facilitate entry  
to related markets.”
Acquisitions 
Acquisitions are an integral part of the Group’s 
strategy , designed to accelerate growth and to 
facilitate entry into related strategic markets. 
T o achieve the Group’s objective of strong 
double-digit growth, acquisition spend at the 
level of £25–30m p.a. is targeted. This year, 
the Group continued to benefit from a positive 
acquisition environment and invested £37 .8m 
in acquisitions, which was well above the 
target annual level and was more than double 
the level of expenditure in the prior year. 
The acquisitions which have been completed 
are natural extensions of the Group’s existing 
businesses and have extended the scope of 
the businesses into new product and market 
segments and geographies. 
In Life Sciences, DHG acquired 80% of 
T echnopath Distribution (“TPD”), an 
established supplier to the Biotechnology , 
Clinical Laboratory and Medical markets in 
Ireland and the UK. The acquisition of TPD 
represents an important first step in extending 
the scope of DHG’s business into the markets 
worked alongside me for 17 years at Diploma 
and he has been a key driver of the growth and 
development of the Group over this period. 
We will all miss his insightful contributions on 
strategy , keen business judgement and dry 
humour, but at the same time we all wish him 
well in his future endeavours. 
Over the last few years, we have strengthened 
the senior management team by giving 
increased responsibility to existing managers 
and through selective external recruitment. 
We are intending to continue this process over 
the coming year with the establishment of a 
formal Executive Management Group (“EMG”) 
reporting in to me. We will be retiring Iain’s 
COO shirt and his responsibilities will be re-
allocated across this broader leadership team. 
The introduction of the EMG will ensure that 
we have a strong and broad based team in 
place to support the next stage of our growth 
strategy . Since the year end, we have made 
good progress in building bench strength 
in this evolving EMG, with the recruitment 
of two experienced senior managers to 
take leadership roles in North American 
Industrial Distribution and in our International 
Healthcare business.

Performance in the year
Reported revenues of the Life Sciences 
businesses increased by 13% to £103. 1m.  
The acquisitions of TPD in October 2014 and 
Chemzyme in July 2014 added 15% to Sector 
revenues but this was partly offset by a 
reduction of ca.6% in revenues from  
currency translation to a strong UK sterling. 
On a constant currency basis, underlying 
revenues increased by 4%.
Gross margins in the Healthcare businesses 
continued to be impacted significantly by 
transactional currency effects. During the 
financial year, the Canadian and Australian 
businesses experienced further depreciation 
in their domestic currencies of 20% and 25% 
respectively relative to the US dollar, which  
is the principal currency in which these 
businesses mostly purchase their products. 
The TPD business in Ireland and the UK has 
not been impacted in the same way by 
transactional currency effects, but joined the 
Group with slightly lower operating margins. 
Currency hedging contracts and supplier price 
concessions have provided some mitigation, 
but Healthcare gross margins have reduced by 
370bps compared with the prior year. 
Environmental gross margins improved and 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue 
reduced across the Life Sciences businesses; 
Sector adjusted operating margins therefore 
reduced by only 120bps to 20.4%. On a 
reported basis, adjusted operating profit 
increased in UK sterling terms by 7% to 
£21.0m. 
Free cash flow increased by 5% to £15.6m 
reflecting a combination of the increased 
operating profit and reduced cash flows into 
working capital, offset by an increase in  
capital expenditure. 
Strategy development
The DHG group of Healthcare businesses 
account for 85% of Life Sciences revenues. 
The DHG model is to build strong market 
positions in growing niche Healthcare 
markets. Products are sourced from high 
quality medical device manufacturers under 
the terms of long term exclusive distribution 
agreements. Full service solutions are 
provided by highly qualified technical sales 
and product application staff, working closely 
with surgeons, operating room nurses and 
laboratory technologists. A large proportion of 
revenues are secured under multi-year 
customer contracts.
In Canada, the three principal businesses 
delivered good revenue growth, despite 
the softer economic environment putting 
pressure on budgets throughout the 
Healthcare system. There have been various 
initiatives by the Provinces and regions to 
restructure functions and these constrained 
purchasing in the first half of the year; the 
businesses had a stronger second half as 
delayed capital equipment orders were 
released. Somagen continued to grow in 
the core areas of HbA1c diabetes testing, 
electrophoresis, colorectal cancer screening 
and assisted reproductive technology (“ ART”), 
while adding new suppliers in quality control 
products and automation in microbiology 
and theranostics. Revenue growth in AMT’s 
core electrosurgery business was constrained 
by Provincial and buying group tendering 
processes, but further progress was made in 
developing AMT’s minimally invasive surgery 
business. Vantage delivered good double-
digit growth across its principal product lines 
including endoscopes, reprocessors, argon 
plasma and GI endoscopy accessories. 
In Australia, the economies have faced  
similar economic challenges to those 
experienced in Canada and again Healthcare 
budgets have come under pressure. Against 
this background, the DHG businesses have 
delivered a creditable double-digit growth in 
revenues, with particularly strong growth in 
smoke evacuation. BGS and DSL operate as 
distinct sales and marketing businesses  
under a single strong leadership team and 
shared operations and back-office systems. 
Chemzyme, acquired in July 2014, was fully 
integrated into DHG’s operations in 
Melbourne during the year. 
In early October 2014, DHG acquired 80%  
of TPD, an established supplier to the 
Biotechnology , Clinical Laboratory and Medical 
markets in Ireland and the UK. TPD is an 
important first step in extending the scope of 
DHG’s business into Europe and adding new 
products and suppliers in the Food, Dairy and 
Pharmaceutical industries as well as Digestive 
Health. TPD has performed very well since 
acquisition, delivering strong double-digit 
revenue growth on a like-for-like basis. 
The a1-group of Environmental businesses 
account for ca. 15% of Sector revenues  
and supply a range of products used in 
Environmental testing and Health & Safety 
applications. The a1-group businesses have 
maintained underlying revenues in challenging 
European markets and finished the year with  
a solid order book. The a1-envirosciences 
business saw strong demand for high-end 
elemental and mercury analysers supplied to 
the Petrochemical industry and Environmental 
laboratories. The a1-CBISS business is 
benefiting from supplying to the new Biomass 
and Energy from Waste plants which are 
forming an increasingly important part of the 
UK’s energy portfolio.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Performance in the year
Reported revenues of the Seals businesses 
increased by 17% to £139 .6m. These revenues 
included contributions from Kubo, Kentek, 
and four smaller bolt-on acquisitions in the 
UK completed during the last 18 months. 
After adjusting for these acquisitions and for 
currency translation, underlying revenues 
increased by 4%. 
Good progress has been made during the year 
in establishing a more substantial presence 
outside North America through a combination 
of organic growth and acquisition. The 
businesses based in the EMEA region 
contributed £47 .3m to Seals revenues in the 
year and now account for 34% of Sector 
revenues. In October 2015, shortly after the 
year end, the acquisition was completed 
of WCIS, a supplier of gaskets, seals and 
associated products and services with 
operations in Australia and New Caledonia.
Across the Seals businesses, gross margins 
continued to be resilient, underpinned by the 
business model of superior product availability 
and added value technical services. Adjusted 
operating margins reduced by 30bps to 17 .8% 
as Kubo joined the Group with lower initial 
operating margins and there were several 
one-off costs in the reorganisation of facilities 
in the US, including the relocation of the 
Bulldog facility . Adjusted operating profits 
increased by 14% to £24.8m. 
Free cash flow increased by £1.4m to £17 .8m, 
benefiting from the increase in operating profit 
and tight control of working capital, partially 
offset by an increase in capital expenditure. 
Strategy development
The Aftermarket Seals businesses account 
for ca.55% of Sector revenues and supply 
own-branded sealing products used in a 
broad range of heavy mobile machinery 
applications. The products are generally 
supplied from inventory on a next day delivery 
basis and are typically used in the repair 
and maintenance of equipment after it has 
completed its initial warranty or lease term. 
Our businesses act as a one-stop source of 
replacement components for all main brands 
of machinery and compared to the OEM dealer 
networks, offer higher levels of customer 
service and more competitive pricing.
In North America, HFPG delivered a solid 
performance in most territories, offset 
by substantial declines in the resource 
dependent States in the second half of the 
year. Further progress was made in electronic 
trading and two new seal machining centres 
were added during the year. The Bulldog 
operations in Reno were relocated to a new 
facility in T ampa, close to the core Hercules 
Clearwater site. HFPG revenues were also 
impacted this year by a significant reduction 
in demand for HKX’s attachment kits against 
a very strong prior year comparative. HKX has 
responded by introducing lower cost, entry 
level kits which are upgradeable as required to 
provide a fuller range of capabilities.
In Europe, FPE Seals increased revenues 
strongly , benefiting from a full year of AB 
Seals and the transfer from HFPG of sales 
responsibility for the Bulldog range of 
products in the EMEA region. Swan Seals, a 
small specialised supplier of machined seals 
based in Aberdeen, was acquired in July 
2015. During the year, FPE Seals relocated its 
principal UK operations to a new, purpose 
built facility which will be the core Aftermarket 
Seals hub for further expansion in the EMEA 
region. Kentek delivered strong revenue 
growth despite the significant economic and 
market challenges in Russia, Finland and the 
Baltic States.
The Industrial OEM businesses account for 
ca.45% of Seals revenues and supply seals, 
O-rings and custom moulded and machined 
parts used in a range of specialised industrial 
equipment. The businesses work closely with 
their Industrial OEM customers to specify the 
most appropriate sealing material and design 
for the customer’s application and to select 
the most suitable seal manufacturer from 
which to source the parts. Once the part is 
designed into the application, the businesses 
provide the necessary logistical and technical 
support, in most cases for the lifetime of the 
OEM’s product.
In North America, the businesses delivered 
solid GDP plus growth for the year, though 
trading activity again slowed in the second 
half, impacted indirectly by cutbacks in the 
Oil & Gas and Mining sectors. During the 
year a new branch operation was opened by 
All Seals in Houston and J Royal strengthened 
its operations by integrating its Rhode Island 
operations into the main facility in North 
Carolina. 
In Europe, the Group completed the 
acquisition of Kubo, a leading supplier of seals, 
O-rings, gaskets and moulded rubber parts 
to a diverse base of industrial customers in 
Switzerland and Austria. M Seals delivered 
solid underlying growth in Denmark, Sweden, 
China and the UK.

Performance in the year
Reported revenues of the Controls businesses 
decreased by 4% to £91. 1m, after including 
a full year contribution from SFC, acquired in 
July 2014. After adjusting for this acquisition 
and for currency translation, underlying 
revenues decreased by 5%. The Controls 
businesses faced challenging industrial 
markets in the UK and Continental Europe 
and strong comparatives for the Specialty 
Fasteners business in the Civil Aerospace and 
Motorsport sectors. 
Overall gross margins remained resilient in 
the Controls businesses due to their focus on 
specialised markets and added value services. 
However, operating costs as a percentage of 
revenue increased due to reverse operating 
leverage and adjusted operating margins 
reduced by 30bps to 15.9%. Adjusted 
operating profits decreased by 5% to £14.5m.
Free cash flow remained unchanged at 
£11.4m, with reduced cash flows into 
working capital and lower capital expenditure 
offsetting the impact of lower operating profit. 
Strategy development
The Interconnect businesses account for 
ca.75% of Controls revenues and supply 
a range of high performance wiring, 
connectors, harness components, fasteners 
and control devices. These products are 
used in technically demanding applications, 
often in harsh environments in a range of 
industries including Aerospace, Defence, 
Motorsport, Energy and Medical as well as 
in other specialised Industrial applications. 
The businesses act as a single source for a 
wide range of products, have strong technical 
knowledge to specify products for customer 
applications and offer ex-stock availability 
and a full range of value-added services. A 
high proportion of the products are used in 
refurbishment, upgrade and maintenance 
programmes for equipment in service.
The core Industrial markets in the UK have 
been challenging, with demand from industrial 
end-users muted and with a significant 
reduction in the sales to other distributors in 
the UK and in Eurozone countries which the 
IS-Group serves as a Master distributor for 
certain key suppliers. In Germany , again the 
general industrial sector has suffered in the 
wake of Russian sanctions and the slowing 
Chinese manufacturing sector. In addition, 
a number of IS-Sommer’s customers have 
relocated all or part of their manufacturing to 
lower cost regions outside Germany .
T o offset the declines in the broader Industrial 
markets, the Interconnect businesses have 
focused on more specialised market sectors 
which continue to show growth potential. In 
the Energy sector, IS-Sommer has delivered 
a strong increase in revenues from products 
used in the repair and maintenance of 
the medium-voltage infrastructure of the 
Electricity distribution network. Filcon has also 
had success supplying a focused portfolio 
of specialised connectors to the developing 
Space satellite segment. 
A key element of the growth strategy within 
Interconnect is also to broaden the range of 
high performance products and added value 
services offered. As part of this strategy , the 
Specialty Fasteners group of businesses has 
been formed and was strengthened through 
the acquisition of SFC, which delivered an 
excellent performance in its first full year with 
the Group. Clarendon this year strengthened 
its partnership with its major aircraft seating 
customer, with the installation of an innovative 
VMI (vendor managed inventory) solution 
that utilises bespoke dispensing racks located 
within the customer’s production cells. 
Clarendon also consolidated its position with 
the same customer by extending its supply 
contract to an additional manufacturing site. 
While these projects constrained revenue this 
year during the implementation phases, they 
will secure longer term growth in revenues.
The Fluid Controls businesses account for 
ca.25% of Controls revenues and supply a 
range of fluid control products used broadly 
across the Food & Beverage industry . Products 
are used in a range of applications including 
food retailing and transportation, catering 
equipment, vending machines, coffee 
brewing, pure water and water cooling 
systems.
Hawco has had to respond to significant 
structural changes in food retailing, where 
the traditional UK majors have reduced 
substantially their fit-outs of new stores 
and Hawco’s immediate customers, the 
commercial refrigeration manufacturers, 
have now begun to win new business from 
the European discount retailers. Hawco also 
continues to leverage its expertise and access 
to smaller, more efficient compressors and 
ancillary components to penetrate the wider 
Brewing and Catering sectors.
There are also significant changes taking place 
in the hot drinks dispensing market where key 
players are re-positioning their businesses 
from “vending companies” to “coffee 
specialists” . Abbeychart has responded by 
building a portfolio of essential parts to service 
the broad range of espresso-type machines 
installed in an increasing number of outlets 
from garages to high end restaurants.

Finance Review
The Group generated 
strong free cash flow 
helped by a good 
contribution from the 
acquired businesses 
and tight control of 
working capital.”
Nigel Lingwood, Group Finance Director
Gross margins in the Healthcare businesses, 
which represent ca.25% of Group revenues, 
continued to be impacted on a transactional 
basis by the continuing depreciation of the 
Canadian and Australian dollars. These two 
currencies have now depreciated in excess of 
30% over the past two years against the 
currencies in which they purchase their 
products, predominantly the US dollar (see 
chart on page 19). 
Currency hedging contracts and supplier price 
concessions have provided some mitigation, 
but transactional currency effects reduced 
Healthcare gross margins by 280bps in 2015. 
With further depreciation of these two 
currencies continuing through 2015, the 
forward currency hedge contracts are being 
replaced at more unfavourable exchange rates 
which will maintain pressure on Healthcare 
gross margins well into 2016. T ransactional 
currency exposures in the rest of the Group’s 
businesses were not significant.
Results in 2015
Diploma achieved a creditable performance 
this year with revenues increasing by 9% to 
£333.8m and adjusted operating profit 
increasing by 6% to £60.3m, bolstered by good 
contributions from acquisitions completed 
both this year and last year . Weaker industrial 
markets, particularly in the second half of the 
financial year , led to underlying revenues and 
adjusted operating profits increasing by only 
1% this year . However free cash flow was again 
very strong at £40.3m and helped to finance 
£37 .8m of acquisition investment which should 
provide a good base for earnings growth in 
future years.
Underlying revenues and adjusted operating 
profits are after adjusting for the contribution 
from businesses acquired during the year and 
for the impact on the translation of the results 
of the overseas businesses from the significant 
strengthening of UK sterling, against most of 
the currencies in which the Group operates.
With ca.75% of the Group’s businesses based 
overseas, the impact on headline results from 
currency translation has led to a reduction in 
revenues and adjusted operating profits of 
£8. 1m and £1.6m respectively , when 
compared with last year’s exchange rates. The 
contributions from acquisitions completed in 
the year were £24.2m to revenue and £3.4m 
to adjusted operating profit, before £0.3m of 
internal management charges.
The weaker gross margins in the Healthcare 
businesses were largely mitigated by a 
combination of stronger margin mix of 
revenues across the Group’s businesses and 
by operational leverage from continuing tight 
control over operating costs. However, with 
the businesses acquired during the past two 
years joining the Group with initial operating 
margins which are lower than the Group’s 
average and with £0.8m being incurred on 
one-off facility restructuring costs in the US 
Seals businesses, the adjusted operating 
margin declined by 40bps to 18. 1% this year, 
compared with 18.5% for the full year in 2014. 
Adjusted profit before tax, earnings per 
share and dividends
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 6% to 
£59 .6m (2014: £56.2m). There was a finance 
expense this year of £0.7m (2014: net £0.5m) 
which included £0.3m of interest costs on 
borrowings drawn down during the year to help 
finance acquisitions (2014: £Nil). The notional

strong free cash flow provides the Directors 
with confidence to recommend an increase in 
the final dividend of 7% to 12.4p per share 
(2014: 1 1.6p). This gives a total dividend per 
share for the year of 18.2p per share which 
represents a 7% increase on the prior year 
dividend of 17 .0p. The dividend remains 2. 1 
times covered by adjusted EPS as reported  
last year.
Free cash flow
The Group generated strong free cash flow  
in 2015 of £40.3m (2014: £37 .8m), helped  
by a good contribution from the acquired 
businesses and tight control of working capital. 
Free cash flow represents cash available to 
invest in acquisitions or return to shareholders 
and represented a cash conversion of adjusted 
earnings of 93% (2014: 93%).
The Group’s businesses worked hard in the 
second half of the year to reduce working 
capital and the cash outflow into working 
capital was reduced from £6.8m at 31 March 
2015 to £1. 9m at 30 September 2015; this 
compared with £4.6m in the last financial year . 
The efforts to reduce working capital were 
generally focused on inventory levels which 
resulted in no cash outflow. 
During the year , the DHG group of Healthcare 
businesses represented by DHG reclassified 
£1.2m of inventory as plant and equipment 
within fixed tangible assets. These assets 
interest expense on the Group’s defined 
pension liabilities remained unchanged at 
£0.2m and £0.2m (2014: £0.4m) was paid on 
bank facility and commitment fees. Statutory 
profit before tax was £51.8m (2014: £49 .8m), 
after acquisition related charges of £7 .4m (2014: 
£6.4m) and fair value remeasurements of 
£0.4m (2014: £Nil) in respect of the put options 
held over minority interests.
The Group’s adjusted effective accounting tax 
charge in 2015 remained unchanged from the 
previous year at 26.3% of adjusted profit before 
tax. The charge this year benefited from a 
further reduction in UK corporation tax rates to 
20.5% (2014: 22.0%) and from lower tax rates 
applied to some of the businesses acquired 
during the past two years; however the 
effective tax rate in the US increased slightly 
this year to 36% (2014: 35%) after the catch up 
in prior year manufacturing tax relief claims 
received last year .
Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) increased 
by 6% to 38.2p, compared with 36. 1p last year 
and statutory basic earnings per share 
increased to 32.5p (2014: 31.4p).
The Board’s policy is to increase dividends 
to shareholders each year , while targeting 
towards two times dividend cover (defined as 
the ratio of adjusted EPS to total dividends paid 
and proposed for the year). A combination of a 
robust Group balance sheet and continuing 
comprise instruments used for demonstration 
and for lending to hospitals while the existing 
instruments are being serviced at DHG  
service centres. 
The combination of this adjustment and 
reduced cash outflow in working capital has led 
to the Group’s KPI metric of working capital as a 
proportion of revenue reducing to 1 7 .0% at 30 
September 2015 from 1 7 .2% reported last year 
(16.8% when calculated on a comparable basis).
Group tax payments increased by £2.4m to 
£15.4m (2014: £1 3.0m) and included £0.7m of 
pre-acquisition tax liabilities from Kubo and TPD 
and £0.4m of payments relating to prior year 
liabilities. On an underlying basis and before 
the currency effects of translation, cash tax 
payments increased by £1.3m and represented 
ca.24% of adjusted profit before tax compared 
with an underlying rate of ca.23% last year . 
 
Capital expenditure increased by £2. 1m to 
£4.3m compared with £2.2m last year . The 
increase in capital expenditure was shared 
equally between the Life Sciences and Seals 
businesses. In Life Sciences, Vantage increased 
its funding of equipment contracts on a cost 
per procedure (“CPP”) basis to £1.0m (2014: 
£0.4m) following the successful release of a 
new version of endoscopes. A further £0. 9m 
(2014: £0.2m) of field equipment was also 
acquired in support of customer contracts  
with hospitals. 
In Seals, £0.4m was spent on new seal and 
gasket cutting machinery in the HFPG and 
Kubo businesses and a further £0.5m was 
invested in completing new vertical carousels 
in the Hercules Bulldog facility in Clearwater 
and in adding new tooling across the Seals 
businesses. The relocation of the Bulldog 
business from Reno to a new large leasehold 
facility in T ampa was completed in September 
and £0.4m was invested in refurbishing and 
fitting out this facility . 
Capital expenditure in the Controls businesses 
was a modest £0.3m and related to tooling and 
line-side equipment to support a supply project 
in the Specialty Fasteners business. The 
balance of capital expenditure in the year of 
£0.8m was largely invested in supporting the IT 
infrastructure across the Group. 
In addition to the capital expenditure described 
above, the Group also financed the 
construction of a new purpose built facility for 
FPE Seals in Darlington, UK. The construction 
of the facility was completed in September 
2015 and cost £2. 9m, including fitting-out and 
professional costs. At completion, the facility 
was sold to an investment company and

Liabilities to minority shareholders
The Group’s liability to purchase outstanding 
minority shareholdings at 30 September 2015 
increased to £5.7m (2014: £3.5m), following 
the purchase of 80% of TPD in October 2014. 
This acquisition included put/call options 
over the outstanding 20% of share capital 
which were valued at £3.2m. During the 
year, a further 10% shareholding in Kentek 
was acquired from the previous vendor for 
consideration of £1.4m, of which £0.6m was 
paid during the year, leaving £0.8m to be 
paid in December 2015. The remaining 10% 
minority shareholding in Kentek is held by the 
Managing Director of this business. 
At 30 September 2015, the put options over 
the outstanding minority interests held in  
M Seals, Kentek and TPD were valued at 
£5.7m, based on the Directors’ latest estimate 
of the Earnings before Interest and T ax (“EBIT”) 
of these businesses when these options 
crystallise. 
In addition to the liability to minority 
shareholders, the Group also has a liability at 
30 September 2015 for deferred consideration 
of up to £0.9m (2014: £0.5m) which includes 
£0.8m owing to the former minority 
shareholder in Kentek.
Return on adjusted trading capital 
employed and capital management
A key metric that the Group uses to provide an 
indication of the overall profitability of the 
Group and its success in creating value for 
shareholders is the Return on Adjusted T rading 
Capital Employed (“ROA TCE”). At a Group level, 
this is a pre-tax measure which is applied 
against the fixed and working capital of the 
Group, together with all gross intangible assets 
and goodwill. At 30 September 2015, the Group 
ROA TCE had reduced to 23. 9% (2014: 25.8%) 
which in part reflected the impact of acquiring a 
freehold property valued at £7 .2m, as part of 
the acquisition of Kubo. Adjusted trading 
capital employed is defined in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Group continues to maintain a strong 
balance sheet with net cash funds of £3.0m 
(2014: £21.3m) at 30 September 2015, 
comprising bank borrowings of £20.0m offset 
by cash funds of £23.0m. These cash funds 
were largely utilised shortly after the year end in 
completing the purchase of WCIS and in 
repaying some of the bank borrowings. Surplus 
cash funds are generally repatriated to the UK, 
unless they are required locally to meet certain 
commitments, including acquisitions.
On 11 March 2015, the Group exercised part 
of the accordion option within its existing 
revolving multi-currency credit facility and 
leased back on a 15 year full repairing lease. 
After providing for the potential costs of 
disposing of the previous long leasehold facility , 
no gain or loss was made on the disposal.
The Company paid the PA YE income tax 
liability of £1.0m (2014: £1.8m) arising on the 
exercise of L TIP share awards, in exchange for 
reduced share awards to participants; the 
Employee Benefit T rust also purchased a 
further 100,000 shares in the Company during 
the year at a cost of £0.7m in order to have 
sufficient shares to meet future L TIP awards. 
The Group spent £37 .8m of the free cash flow 
on acquisitions, as described below, and 
£19 .9m (2014: £18.4m) on paying dividends to 
both Company and minority shareholders.
Acquisitions completed during the year
The Group invested a record £37 .8m in 
acquired businesses this year (2014: £16.5m), 
including £0.6m on acquiring outstanding 
minority interests and £0.6m of deferred 
consideration. 
The largest investment was £22.9m paid in 
March 2015 to acquire Kubo, a leading supplier 
of seals and related products, largely based in 
Switzerland, but with a small business 
operating in Austria. A further £11.2m was 
invested in October 2014 to acquire 80% of 
T echnopath Distribution (“TPD”), an 
established supplier of products to the Life 
Sciences market and based in Ireland. In July 
2015, the Group also acquired Swan Seals for 
£2.5m, a small Seals Aftermarket business 
based in Aberdeen to be managed by FPE 
Seals in the UK. 
These acquisitions added £19 .8m to the 
Group’s acquired intangible assets, 
comprising a valuation of customer and 
supplier relationships which will be amortised 
over periods ranging from 5–10 years. At 30 
September 2015, intangible assets were 
£40.2m. Goodwill increased by £13.7m to 
£89 .3m at 30 September 2015, after making 
fair value adjustments to the assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised but is assessed 
each year at a Sector level to determine 
whether there has been any impairment in  
the carrying value of goodwill acquired. The 
exercise to assess whether goodwill has  
been impaired is described in note 10 to  
the consolidated financial statements and 
concluded that there has been no impairment 
in the value of goodwill at the year end. 
 
Shortly after the year end, the Group 
completed the acquisition of WCIS, an 
established supplier of sealing products and 
services for maximum consideration of £9 .8m.
increased its committed bank facilities to 
£40m; there remains a further £10m in the 
accordion option for the Group to extend this 
facility to £50m, subject to market pricing. 
These additional funds were provided at 
a cost of 50bps and were used to assist in 
financing the acquisition of Kubo. These bank 
facilities are committed until June 2017 and will 
continue to be utilised to meet any shortfall in 
cash to fund acquisitions. 
Employee pension obligations
Pension benefits to existing employees, both 
in the UK and overseas, are provided through 
defined contribution schemes at an aggregate 
cost in 2015 of £2. 1m (2014: £1.7m). 
The Group also maintains a small closed 
defined benefit pension scheme in the 
UK which at 30 September 2013 had a 
funding deficit of £2.7m. The next funding 
actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 
30 September 2016. The Group continues 
to make regular cash contributions to the 
scheme at an annual rate of £0.3m, as  
agreed with the actuary , with the objective  
of eliminating the funding deficit over  
seven years. 
Following the acquisition of Kubo in March 
2015, the Group has also been required to 
account for Kubo’s pension scheme in 
accordance with IAS19 (Revised). In 
accordance with Swiss law, Kubo is required to 
provide a contribution based pension for all 
employees. The pension liability for these 
employees is funded by employer and 
employee contributions which are managed 
by a large multi-employer fund manager, with 
the underfunding risk insured with a major 
global insurance company . Although this 
scheme is a contribution based scheme, 
certain technical factors relating to the funding 
of the scheme determines that it must be 
accounted for as a defined benefit pension 
scheme under IAS19 (Revised). 
The addition of the Kubo pension scheme 
this year has led to the aggregate pension 
deficit held in the Group’s balance sheet 
at 30 September 2015 increasing to £9 .8m 
from £4.3m last year. The actuarial pension 
deficit under IAS19 (Revised) in the Kubo 
scheme is £3.7m and the pension deficit 
in the UK scheme increased by £1.8m to 
£6. 1m. The increase in the UK pension 
deficit arose because of a further reduction 
of 30bps in bond yields to 3.8% since last 
year, together with weaker equity returns 
during the year. The gross aggregate pension 
liability in respect of these two schemes at 
30 September 2015 is now £44.5m which is 
funded by £34.7m of assets. 21

Healthcare
The Diploma Healthcare Group (“DHG”) in Canada comprises three 
principal operating businesses which supply to the ca.600 public 
hospitals across the country as well as to private clinics and laboratories. 
Somagen Diagnostics (“Somagen”) supplies a range of consumables 
and instruments used in the diagnostic testing of blood, tissue and 
other samples in hospital pathology laboratories. It is also a leading 
supplier to the growing assisted reproductive technology (“ ART”) 
market. AMT Surgical (“ AMT”) supplies specialised electrosurgery 
equipment and consumables for use in hospital operating rooms.  
AMT is also building a portfolio of specialised surgical instruments  
and devices used in minimally invasive (“MI”) Surgery . Vantage 
Endoscopy (“Vantage”) supplies endoscopes, reprocessors and  
related consumables and services to GI Endoscopy suites in hospitals 
and private clinics. 
DHG also operates in Australia and New Zealand through Diagnostic 
Solutions (“DSL ”) and Big Green Surgical (“BGS”) which are both located in 
Melbourne. BGS and DSL focus on similar markets respectively to the AMT 
and Somagen businesses and share a number of common suppliers.
In October 2014, DHG extended its operations into Europe with the 
acquisition of T echnopath Distribution (“TPD”), an established supplier 
of products to the Biotechnology , Clinical Laboratory and Medical 
markets in Ireland and the UK.
Environmental
The a1-group is a supplier to Environmental testing laboratories and to 
Health & Safety engineers. The a1-envirosciences business, based in 
Germany , supplies a range of specialised environmental analysers and a 
range of containment enclosures for potent powder handling. The 
a1-CBISS business, based in the UK, supplies equipment and services 
for the monitoring and control of environmental emissions, as well as a 
range of gas detection devices.

Market drivers
The DHG businesses in Canada supply into areas of Healthcare which 
are predominantly public sector funded. Private sector funding in 
Canada is mostly focused on areas where DHG do not participate, 
including dental, cosmetic and eye surgery and pharmaceuticals. The 
principal demand driver for DHG is therefore the level of healthcare 
spending funded by the Canadian Government.
The Canadian Healthcare industry is a proven, long term growth 
environment for medical device distribution. A growing, aging and well 
educated population demands high standards of service delivery , 
helping to ensure ongoing growing demand; per capita healthcare 
spending in Canada is in the top 20% of OECD countries. The Canadian 
Health Act (“the Act”) ensures universal coverage for all insured persons 
for all medically necessary services provided by hospitals, physicians 
and other healthcare providers. The Provinces are responsible for the 
delivery of the healthcare services, but the Federal Government 
controls delivery through Federal Provincial transfer payments, which 
represent the largest source of revenues for the Provinces.
The relative stability and consistency in funding by each of the 
Provinces, guaranteed through the Act, ensures that the market 
remains well funded through the economic cycle. Over many years, 
healthcare expenditure has grown steadily with annual variations 
mostly dependent on the periodic additional tranches of funding 
provided by individual Provinces. In periods when the economy is 
slower, as has been the case in 2014 and 2015, healthcare funding may 
be constrained. The funding constraints can be experienced through 
targeted controls imposed on the number of laboratory tests and 
operating procedures as well as more rigorous tendering processes for 
expenditure on capital equipment. Even during such periods, however, 
healthcare funding has shown positive growth, albeit at reduced levels.
The Healthcare market in Australia shares with Canada many of the 
same attractive characteristics for specialised distribution. While 
privately funded healthcare is more prevalent in areas such as surgery 
and laboratory testing, public sector healthcare funding is still large  
and supported by a stable, resource based economy . As with Canada, 
there is a large geography to be covered, low population density and 
purchasing processes that vary by State. These characteristics 
necessarily demand a significant investment by manufacturers in 
technical sales and service resource which makes the specialised 
distribution model more attractive as an efficient way to serve the 
market. Over the last two years, the Canadian and Australian 
economies have come under significant pressure from the falling oil 
price and reduced demand for the countries’ natural resources. This 
tougher economic environment has resulted in greater pressure on 
budgets throughout the Healthcare systems in Canada and Australia.
The market drivers for the TPD business are Healthcare funding in 
Ireland and the UK and activity levels in the Food, Dairy , Water and 
Pharmaceutical industries in Ireland.
The a1-group supplies to customers in the Environmental industry in 
the UK, Germany and France. The market demand is largely driven by 
Environmental and Health & Safety regulations and growth in recent 
years has been driven by the need to be compliant with a range of EU 
regulations. Since market demand is driven by regulation, this ensures 
reasonably steady demand for essential consumable products and 
services, though customers may defer capital expenditure during 
significant downturns in the economy .

Free cash flow £15.6m £14.9m
ROATCE 21.1% 21.9%
Reported revenues of the Life Sciences businesses increased by 13% to 
£103. 1m (2014: £91.4m). The acquisitions of TPD in October 2014 and 
Chemzyme in July 2014 added £13.3m, or 15%, to Sector revenues but 
this was partly offset by a reduction of ca.6% in revenues from the 
translational currency impact from the continued weakening in the 
Canadian and Australian dollars and the Euro relative to UK sterling.  
On a constant currency basis, underlying revenues increased by 4%.
Gross margins in the Healthcare businesses continued to be impacted 
significantly by transactional currency effects. During the financial year, 
the Canadian and Australian businesses experienced further 
depreciation in their domestic currencies of 20% and 25% respectively 
relative to the US dollar, which is the principal currency in which these 
businesses mostly purchase their products. The TPD business in Ireland 
and the UK has not been impacted in the same way by transactional 
currency effects, but joined the Group with slightly lower operating 
margins. Currency hedging contracts and supplier price concessions 
have provided some mitigation, but Healthcare gross margins have 
reduced by 370bps compared with the prior year. Environmental gross 
margins improved and operating costs as a percentage of revenue 
reduced across the Life Sciences businesses; Sector adjusted operating 
margins therefore reduced by only 120bps to 20.4% (2014: 21.6%). On a 
reported basis, adjusted operating profit increased in UK sterling terms 
by 7% to £21.0m (2014: £19 .7m).
Capital expenditure in the Sector increased to £2.5m (2014: £1.2m), 
which included £1.9m invested in field equipment for placement in 
hospitals and clinics by the Canadian Healthcare businesses and  
£0.4m invested in IT infrastructure, including £0. 1m in a new ERP  
system in Vantage which completed its installation in November 2015. 
Free cash flow increased to £15.6m (2014: £14.9m), reflecting a 
combination of the increased operating profit and reduced cash flows 
into working capital, offset by the increase in capital expenditure. 
Healthcare
Revenues from the DHG group of Healthcare businesses increased by 
5% after adjusting for the acquisitions of TPD and Chemzyme and for 
translational currency effects. 
The Canadian Healthcare businesses increased revenues by 5% in  
local currency , with consumable and service revenues accounting for 
ca.90% of revenues. The tougher economic environment in Canada, 
caused largely by the falling oil prices and reduced demand for the 
country’s natural resources, has put greater pressure on budgets 
throughout the Healthcare system. There have also been various 
initiatives to restructure functions within several Provinces and  
regions, which have constrained purchasing and slowed down capital 
purchases. In particular there has been a freeze in capital spending  
in Quebec, while the Province completes the centralisation of its  
Health regions. 
Against this background, Somagen achieved good growth in sales of 
consumable products across its key suppliers, in particular HbA1c 
diabetes testing and electrophoresis, colorectal cancer screening and 
assisted reproductive technology (“ ART”). Capital equipment sales in 
the first half of the year were slow due to the reorganisation of testing 
services in certain Provinces; however a number of the delayed orders 
were released in the second half of the year with sales of histology 
instrumentation finishing strongly . Investments have been made during 
the year in establishing new suppliers in the areas of quality control 
products and automation in microbiology and theranostics, which 
focuses on the patient’s response to specific biotherapeutic drugs.
AMT’s core electrosurgery business has continued to grow unit 
volumes with increasing smoke evacuation compliance in existing 
accounts and penetration into new accounts. However, tender and 
evaluation processes introduced by the Provincial SSOs (shared services 
organisations) and the GPOs (general purchasing organisations) have 
put pressure on unit prices and constrained revenue growth. AMT  
has responded by introducing lower cost product options alongside 
premium products to ensure competitive pricing in major tenders.  
AMT has continued to make progress in its supply of specialised surgical 
instruments and devices used in laparoscopic and other MI (minimally 
invasive) Surgery procedures. 
Vantage posted a very strong second half to the year and delivered 
double-digit growth in revenues for the full year. In the first half of the 
year, the main consumable product lines performed to expectation 
with modest growth in revenues from argon plasma probes, 
endoscope reprocessor chemicals and other accessories including 
specialist retrieval devices. Capital equipment revenues however were 
underperforming due to delayed budget approvals. In the second half, 
consumable and service revenues continued to grow steadily and 
results were boosted by strong capital equipment sales as the delayed 
orders were released and by new CPP (cost per procedure) placements. 
By the end of the year, Vantage was able to deliver double-digit growth 
across all of its principal capital product lines including endoscopes, 
reprocessors and argon plasma units.  25

In Australia and New Zealand, the economies have faced similar 
challenges to those experienced in Canada and Healthcare budgets 
have come under the same pressures. Against this background, 
revenues from DSL and BGS increased by a creditable 11% in local 
currency terms (7% growth after adjusting for the acquisition of 
Chemzyme). BGS continued to grow revenues strongly , with smoke 
evacuation programmes in existing and new accounts providing the 
main driver for growth and with steady growth in sales of electrosurgical 
grounding pads and laparoscopic electrodes. DSL consumable and 
service revenues trended in line with expectations and delivered 
modest growth, but capital equipment sales were slower due to budget 
pressures and delayed projects. DSL and BGS operate as distinct sales 
and marketing businesses, benefiting from a single leadership group 
and shared operations and back office systems in Melbourne, giving  
the efficiencies and critical mass of a shared services group. The 
Chemzyme business, acquired in July 2014, was fully integrated into 
DHG’s Melbourne operations during the year. 
In early October 2014, DHG acquired 80% of TPD, an established 
supplier to the Biotechnology , Clinical Laboratory and Medical markets 
in Ireland and the UK. The acquisition of TPD represents an important 
first step in extending the scope of the Group’s Healthcare businesses 
into these new markets in Europe. In addition, TPD brings important 
new products and suppliers to the DHG group in the areas of rapid 
hygiene testing in Food, Dairy and Pharmaceutical industries as well as 
Digestive Health. TPD has performed very well since acquisition, 
delivering strong double-digit revenue growth on a like-for-like basis.
Environmental
Revenues from the Environmental businesses in Europe increased by 
1% in constant currency terms. The a1-envirosciences business based 
in Germany increased revenues by 6% in Euro terms and ended the year 
with an encouraging book-to bill ratio. There was strong demand for 
high-end elemental analysers supplied to Petrochemical industry 
customers and Environmental laboratories. There was also 
considerable customer interest in the range of recently introduced 
mercury analysers for fuel analysis. The a1-CBISS business based in the 
UK saw revenues reduce by 4% against a very strong prior year 
comparative. Reduced revenues from CEMS (continuous emissions 
monitoring systems) were against very strong comparatives (20% 
growth in 2014) and the sector remains buoyant with new Biomass and 
Energy from Waste plants forming an important part of the UK’s energy 
portfolio with the reduction in coal fired power stations. A solid order 
book is carried into the new fiscal year including the completion of a 
large order from Drax related to the conversion of its plant to biofuels. 
The gas detection sector had a strong first half but was then impacted 
by the slowdown in sales to Oil & Gas customers. Across both 
Environmental businesses, there was strong double-digit growth in 
revenues from Service programmes, which now represent ca.35% of 
combined revenues.
Highlights from the Y ear
• Sector revenue growth of 13%; underlying growth 
of 4% after adjusting for currency and TPD 
acquisition
• Good revenue growth in DHG’s Canadian and 
Australian businesses despite pressure on 
Healthcare budgets
• Stronger second half of year as delayed capital 
equipment orders released; significant pressure 
on margins from 20-25% depreciation of 
Canadian and Australian dollars against US dollar
• TPD acquisition extends DHG into Ireland and 
the UK; strong double-digit growth in first year
• Environmental businesses maintained underlying 
revenues and finished the year with solid order 
book
Potential for Growth
• Increase share of specialised segments of 
Healthcare markets in Canada and Australia
• Build presence in the UK and Ireland from TPD 
base and explore opportunities more broadly 
in Europe
• Extend into other specialised medical disciplines 
with new products and technologies
• Continue to develop product and geographic 
spread of Environmental businesses 26

Aftermarket
The Aftermarket businesses supply sealing and associated products to 
support a broad range of mobile machinery in applications including 
heavy construction, logging, mining, agriculture, material handling (lift 
trucks, fork lifts and dump trucks) and refuse collection. The products 
are generally supplied on a next day delivery basis and are used in the 
repair and maintenance of equipment after it has completed its initial 
warranty period or lease term, or has been sold on in the pre-used 
market. The main customers are machinery and cylinder repair shops, 
engine and transmission rebuilders and other heavy equipment parts 
distributors. The Aftermarket businesses also supply products to end 
users operating process plants within the Pharmaceutical, Chemical, 
Food and Energy sectors.
Industrial OEM
The Industrial OEM businesses supply seals, gaskets, O-rings and 
custom moulded and machined parts to a range of Industrial OEM 
customers. The businesses work closely with customers to select the 
most appropriate seal material and manufacturer for the application, 
provide technical support and guidance during the product 
development process and provide the logistics capabilities to supply 
from inventory for small to medium sized production runs.

Market drivers
In North America (where ca.65% of Sector revenues are generated), the 
principal market drivers for both the Aftermarket and Industrial OEM Seals 
businesses is the growth rate in the general industrial economy . In 2015, 
the US economy is forecast to show annual GDP growth of 2.5% (2014: 
2.4%), driven primarily by strong consumer spending. The US economy 
and industrial production contracted in the first quarter which was in 
part attributable to port closures, but in the second quarter GDP growth 
resumed as house prices increased and customer confidence returned. 
However , the significant reduction in oil price and lower demand for 
natural resources weighed down the resource dependent States.
In Canada, 2015 GDP growth is forecast to decline to 1.5% (2014: 2.4%) 
due again to the dependence of the Canadian economy on the Oil & 
Gas and Mining sectors. In general, the economic conditions in the 
principal South and Central American economies served by the North 
American Aftermarket businesses have remained challenging.
For the Aftermarket businesses, activity and spending levels in the US 
Construction sector are important, since this market accounts for over 
50% of Aftermarket Seals revenues. Statistics on total US Construction 
Spend include non-residential and infrastructure spend, as well as 
residential housing activity . Overall US Construction Spend has risen 
steadily during 2014 and 2015 as contractors completed the build-out 
phases of construction projects. However, these phases generally 
require lower usage of heavy mobile equipment than the ground 
clearance and preparation phases and there has been a reduction in 
activity in the States most impacted by the slowdown in the Oil & Gas 
and Mining sectors.
 
Unit sales in the US of Construction Equipment (defined as heavy 
mobile equipment including excavators above 14 tonnes, crawler 
dozers and wheeled loaders) is an important short term indicator for the 
HKX attachment kit business. It is also important as a medium term 
indicator for Hercules’ replacement hydraulic seals activities, as the  
new heavy equipment will move out of the dealer warranty period in 
the following years. Unit sales grew strongly in 2014 as dealers, 
contractors and rental fleets bought ahead of the introduction of tighter 
emissions standards. During the first half of 2015, the demand for new 
equipment declined sharply as the general machine population is 
relatively new and equipment, previously used in the Oil & Gas and 
Mining sectors, was released back through auction houses into the  
Heavy Construction sector.
 
For the Industrial OEM Seals businesses, the most appropriate indicator 
is the Industrial Production Index, which moved ahead strongly in 2014 
when the US enjoyed a strong oil price and a more competitive 
exchange rate for its exports. The Index has been essentially flat during 
2015 as the stronger dollar and a significant slowdown in the natural 
resources sector offset stronger domestic consumer demand. 
In Europe, the economies have been highly variable in 2014 and 2015, 
driven by a number of contributing economic and geopolitical factors. 
Although overall GDP growth in Europe is forecast to recover modestly 
to 1.5% (2014: 0.8%), the economies have been negatively impacted by 
the Greek debt crisis, the EU and US sanctions against Russia as well as 
reductions in exports as a result of the global economic slowdown. The 
UK and German economies have remained more buoyant than other 
European countries, but growth is forecast to slow to 2.4% (2014: 2.9%) 
in the UK and to remain broadly flat at 1.7% (2014: 1.6%) in Germany . 
The Industrial Production indices in these countries have generally 
lagged the overall economic growth.  28

Adjusted operating margin 17.8% 18.1%
Free cash flow £17.8m £16.4m
ROATCE 23.7% 26.0%
Reported revenues of the Seals businesses increased by 17% to 
£139 .6m (2014: £119 .8m). These revenues included contributions from 
Kubo (acquired in March 2015), Kentek (acquired in January 2014) and 
four smaller bolt-on acquisitions in the UK completed during the last  
18 months. After adjusting for these acquisitions and for currency 
translation, underlying revenues increased by 4%. 
Good progress has been made during the year in establishing a more 
substantial presence outside North America through a combination of 
organic growth and acquisition. The businesses based in the EMEA 
region contributed £47 .3m to Seals revenues in the year (2014: £29 .9m) 
and now account for 34% of Sector revenues. In October 2015, shortly 
after the year end, the acquisition was completed of WCIS, a supplier of 
gaskets, seals and associated products and services with operations in 
Australia and New Caledonia.
Across the Seals businesses, gross margins continued to be resilient, 
underpinned by the business model of superior product availability and 
added value technical services. Adjusted operating margins reduced 
by 30bps to 17 .8% (2014: 18. 1%) as Kubo joined the Group with lower 
initial operating margins and there were several one-off costs in the 
reorganisation of facilities in the US, including the relocation of the 
Bulldog facility , which added incremental costs of ca.£0.8m. Adjusted 
operating profits increased by 14% to £24.8m (2014: £21.7m).
Free cash flow increased by £1.4m to £17 .8m (2014: £16.4m), benefiting 
from the increase in operating profit and tight control of working capital. 
Capital expenditure increased to £1.5m (2014: £0.5m), which included 
£0.4m expenditure on leasehold improvements for the new Bulldog 
facility and further investment of £0.6m in seal manufacturing 
equipment and new vertical storage carousels. In Europe, Kubo 
invested £0.2m in additional gasket cutting equipment in Switzerland 
and Austria. FPE Seals also completed the move to a new leasehold 
facility , which was constructed to our specifications and then sold and 
leased back shortly before the year end.
Aftermarket
The Aftermarket businesses, which account for ca.55% of Sector 
revenues, reported a 4% increase in overall revenues. After adjusting for 
currency translation and the acquisitions of Kentek, AB Seals and Swan 
Seals, underlying revenues increased by 2%.
In the US, Hercules Bulldog grew domestic sales by 1% on a like-for-like 
basis, as a generally solid performance in most territories was offset by 
substantial declines in the resource dependent States including T exas, 
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Montana. Further progress was 
made in electronic trading and the number of sales orders processed 
online now accounts for 21% of Hercules Bulldog orders in the US. The 
seal machining centres also continued to deliver good growth, with a 
fourth machine added during the year. Revenues from exports outside 
the US, which account for 15% of Hercules Bulldog sales, increased by 
2% with good growth rates in Mexico and Central America more than 
offsetting reductions in other South American markets. In September 
2015, the Bulldog gasket manufacturing and kit assembly operations 
in Reno were relocated to a new facility in T ampa, close to the core 
Hercules Clearwater site. The new facility has improved international 
port and air carrier links and is expected to deliver ca.£0.2m p.a. in 
annual cost savings. 
Hercules Canada increased revenues by 10% in local currency terms, 
with solid sales to the traditional mobile equipment repair sector 
boosted by the installation of an additional seal making machine. There 
were also increased sales to Canadian cylinder manufacturers, serving 
US equipment OEM customers and benefiting from the weak Canadian 
dollar. Hercules Canada has its principal distribution centres in Ontario 
and Quebec and has limited direct exposure to the depressed Oil & Gas 
sector in Western Canada. 
HKX’s revenues decreased by ca.20% from its record performance 
in 2014, when there was strong demand from rental fleets for new 
excavators and OEM engineering resources were focused on the 
transition to new Tier 4 Final emissions regulations. In 2015, the higher 
pricing of the new Tier 4 Final machines has dampened demand for 
new excavators and excavator OEMs have been supplying a higher 
proportion with factory-fitted attachment kits. HKX has also been 
negatively impacted by the downturn in the Oil & Gas and Mining 
industries in Western Canada. HKX has responded by targeting sales 
of attachment kits for used machines and introducing lower cost, entry 
level kits which are upgradeable as required to provide a fuller range of 
capabilities. HKX has trimmed its operating costs to match the reduced 
revenues and still maintains a healthy operating profit margin.
In Europe, FPE Seals increased reported revenues by ca.50% with solid 
underlying growth boosted by the transfer from Hercules Bulldog to FPE 
Seals of responsibility for the sale of Bulldog products in the wider EMEA 
region. FPE Seals also benefited from two small acquisitions which 
provide it with excellent geographical coverage of the UK. AB Seals in 
Kent was acquired in February 2014 and Swan Seals, a small specialised 
supplier of machined seals based in Aberdeen, was acquired in July 2015. 
During the year , FPE Seals relocated its principal operations in the UK to a 
new, purpose built 34,000 square foot building in Darlington, which 
consolidates smaller less efficient facilities and will be the core Seals 
Aftermarket hub for further expansion into the EMEA region. 
Kentek has faced significant economic and political challenges since its 
acquisition in January 2014, with the Russian economy (and those of 
Finland and the Baltic States) significantly impacted by lower Oil & Gas 
prices, the downturn in Mining industries and the sanctions imposed 
following the conflicts in Ukraine and the Crimea. Kentek has responded 
well to these challenges and delivered a strong increase in underlying 
revenues in 2015. Diploma acquired a further 10% shareholding in 
Kentek, taking our ownership to 90% and with the continuing 10% 
minority shareholder now appointed as Managing Director. In Russia, 
the Saint Petersburg operation now acts as the sole Russian corporate 
entity and the sales team has been reorganised to focus on specific 
geographical territories and market sectors.  29
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Industrial OEM
The Industrial OEM businesses, which account for ca.45% of Sector 
revenues, reported a 35% increase in revenues. After adjusting for 
currency translation and the acquisitions of Kubo, Ramsay Services and 
Maxwell Seals, underlying revenue growth was 6%. 
In North America, the Industrial OEM businesses delivered underlying 
revenue growth of 6% in an economy that showed signs of flattening 
off in the second half of the year. RT Dygert delivered another year of 
solid growth in its core industrial customer base as it continued to 
benefit from its development of regulatory-compliant elastomer 
compounds for the Pharmaceutical and Water industries and for fuel 
dispensing applications. During the year, RT Dygert also successfully 
launched a new online Webstore which acts as a B2B portal for  
existing distribution customers. In July 2014, RT Dygert acquired the 
outstanding 49% shareholding in the HPS business in Seattle. The HPS 
back office and logistics processes have been successfully integrated 
into RT Dygert and the business delivered another record sales year. 
All Seals delivered more modest growth in 2015, as demand flattened 
out in the Water, Military Aerospace and Industrial sectors. All Seals 
opened a small branch operation in Houston in November 2014 and 
while sales to the Oil & Gas sector increased, further gains were held 
back by the downturn in this sector. J Royal delivered another year of 
excellent growth in 2015 with strong demand from its water meter and 
gas boiler customers more than offsetting lower sales to manufacturers 
of swimming pool equipment. J Royal continued to strengthen its 
operations by closing its Rhode Island facility and relocating key 
development resources to its main facility in North Carolina.
In Europe, the expanded M Seals group reported increased revenues  
of 4%, with solid underlying growth boosted by the bolt-on acquisition 
in the UK of Ramsay Services in December 2013. There was solid 
organic growth in Denmark with steady demand from the traditional 
pump and valve manufacturers and from wind turbine customers and 
the Swedish operation delivered another year of strong double-digit 
growth. The Chinese operation also saw a rebound in revenues after a 
softer prior year, as confidence returned to the Wind Power sector in 
China. In the UK, M Seals delivered a solid performance despite the 
slowdown in the Oil & Gas sector in which the acquired companies had 
traditionally specialised. 
In March 2015, the Group completed the acquisition of Kubo, a leading 
supplier of seals, O-rings, gaskets and moulded rubber parts to a 
diverse base of industrial customers in Switzerland and Austria. The 
Swiss franc strengthened during the year following its de-coupling from 
the Euro and this has made it more difficult for Swiss OEMs to export 
their products. However, most of Kubo’s purchases are from outside 
Switzerland allowing price reductions to customers without impacting 
margins. The trading environment for Kubo in Switzerland is now 
stabilising although growth has been constrained. The Austrian 
operation was not impacted by the currency issue and performed well 
during the year. In August 2015, the previous owner of Kubo stepped 
down as planned and a new Managing Director with significant 
industrial experience has been appointed.

Market drivers
Industrial economic background
The Controls businesses focus on specialised, technical applications in a 
range of industries, with over 90% of Sector revenues generated in the 
UK and Continental Europe (principally Germany). The background 
market drivers are therefore the growth of the industrial economies in 
the UK and Germany .
A good indicator of the health of the UK industrial economy is the UK 
Index of Production. This index tracks a short period of growth in 2010, 
followed by a steady decline through 2011 and 2012. T owards the end of 
2012, the index returned to growth and increased steadily through 2014. 
This reflects increased confidence in the UK economy in general, 
although the economic growth is more driven by the Services and Retail 
sectors and industrial activity remains below pre-recession levels.
Similarly , the German Production Sector Output index tracks a good 
period of recovery through 2010 and 2011, before stabilising and slowly 
moving towards pre-recession levels by early 2015. 
Specific industry drivers – Interconnect
Although influenced by the general industrial economic cycles, there 
are also more specific drivers within the main market segments served 
by the Interconnect businesses.
The Civil Aerospace market continued to grow steadily with growth in 
World Passenger T raffic averaging 5–6% p.a. and with strong order 
books at Boeing, Airbus and the manufacturers of smaller, regional 
aircraft. There is a trend towards replacing ageing fleets with more fuel 
efficient wider bodied aircraft and there is increased activity in the cabin 
interiors market where the wide range of complex seating and 
entertainment systems is driving growth. The Defence markets in the 
UK and Germany remain subdued. However, the continuing activity in 
Syria and Iraq and an increase in other perceived threats may prompt a 
review of defence spending. 
In Motorsport, following the introduction of the new 1.6 litre V6 turbo 
engine and the new ERS (Energy Recovery System) technology in 2013 
and 2014, there were no major technology changes or upgrades to 
the series during the current Formula 1 season. The Formula E series 
continues to gain momentum but the relative spend in this series 
is low compared to Formula 1. In Energy , electricity generation and 
distribution in Germany remains a positive sector as the responsibility 
for the local supply of electricity continues to be returned to cities 
and towns. 
Specific industry drivers – Fluid Controls
The Fluid Controls businesses generate almost 70% of their revenues 
from the Food & Beverage sector in the UK. In Food Retailing, there 
continue to be significant structural changes which are impacting 
segment growth rates including the trend away from major out-of-town 
stores to convenience stores and the increase in home delivery . These 
trends are driving demand for smaller, more energy efficient 
components as supplied by Hawco. 
The coffee market sector continues to grow and the UK retail coffee 
market has reached over £1 billion p.a. Abbeychart supplies both the 
coffee machine manufacturers and the aftermarket sector, 
predominately in the UK but also in Europe.  32

Reported revenues of the Controls businesses decreased by 4% to 
£91. 1m (2014: £94.6m), after including a full year contribution from SFC, 
acquired in July 2014. After adjusting for this acquisition and for currency 
translation, underlying revenues decreased by 5%. 
Overall gross margins remained resilient in the Controls businesses 
due to their focus on specialised markets and added value services. 
However, operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased due to 
reverse operating leverage and adjusted operating margins reduced by 
30bps to 15.9% (2014: 16.2%). Adjusted operating profits decreased by 
5% to £14.5m (2014: £15.3m). 
Free cash flow remained unchanged at £11.4m, with reduced cash flows 
into working capital and lower capital expenditure offsetting the impact 
of lower operating profit. Capital expenditure reduced to £0.3m (2014: 
£0.5m) with the largest expenditure during the year being ca.£0. 1m 
on customised bins for the Specialty Fasteners business to support 
production in a major customer facility . 
Interconnect
The Interconnect businesses, which account for ca.75% of Sector 
revenues, reported a revenue decrease of 3% in UK sterling terms; after 
adjusting for the acquisition of SFC and for currency effects, underlying 
revenues decreased by 5%. The revenue reduction reflects a 
combination of weak overall activity levels in UK and European industrial 
markets and strong comparatives for the Specialty Fasteners business 
in the Motorsport and Civil Aerospace sectors. 
In the IS-Group businesses in the UK, revenues decreased by 9%, 
with challenging industrial markets in the UK and also in the Eurozone 
countries which the IS-Group serves as a Master Distributor for certain 
key suppliers. Sales direct to industrial end-users in the UK were 
generally muted, but the most significant reductions were in sales to 
other distributors in the UK and Continental Europe. Management 
remains confident that these revenues were not lost to competitors 
since the IS-Group companies are often the single source for several 
key products. The lower demand from both broad range catalogue 
distributors and the smaller, more specialised distributors suggests 
that both smaller and larger OEMs have been impacted by slower 
order books and some de-stocking.
In Defence & Aerospace, revenues reduced as several major projects 
had been completed in 2014, including the build phase of the 
Astute class submarines and there were no major projects to replace 
this demand. The IS-Group, because of its experience and buying 
power, is also a key supplier to other sub-distributors in Europe that 
support military programmes. However, the demand from these 
sub-distributors also fell sharply as programmes in other territories 
were completed or delayed. Beyond the large equipment programmes, 
there are still many successful UK manufacturers continuing to build 
highly specialised control and monitoring sub-systems for defence use. 
While major programme expenditure may be lower, the number of 
more focused projects and operators combine to produce a sustainable 
customer base for the IS-Group in the UK.
In Motorsport, there was reduced demand from Formula 1 (“F1”), where 
two teams exited the competition and there were fewer technological 
changes than last year, when the new V6 turbo engine was introduced, 
along with upgraded energy recovery systems. However, the growth 
of supercars for road use, the Formula E series and the resurgence of 
high performance motorbikes in Japan have all provided new growth 
opportunities. Less conventionally , the growing sophistication of sensor 
control systems on racing yachts has provided the opportunity to 
supply components to the Americas Cup teams.
In the Energy industry in the UK, IS-Group serves an attractive but 
narrow customer base comprising sub-sea cable manufacturers for the 
Oil & Gas industry , specialised manufacturers of portable generators 
and manufacturers of batteries for use in UPS (Uninterrupted Power 
Supplies) applications. The demand from these customers has always 
been somewhat cyclical and in 2015 each segment was down.
In Germany , IS-Sommer and Filcon reported flat revenues in Euro 
terms (9% reduction in UK sterling terms) with a significant reduction 
in revenues from general Industrial customers offset by growth in 
more specialised sectors. In the Industrial sector, revenues reduced as 
industrial output in Germany remained volatile from one month to the 
next and exports suffered in the wake of the Russian sanctions and the 
slowing Chinese manufacturing sector. During the year, revenues were 
also impacted by certain IS-Sommer customers relocating all or part  
of their manufacturing to lower cost regions outside of Germany .  
In the final quarter, the industrial economy stabilised somewhat and 
IS-Sommer also found new business in the Construction industry  
to partly offset the downturn in its more traditional industrial  
customer base. 
In Defence & Aerospace, revenues were broadly flat, although activity 
on Military Aerospace projects has picked up pace following several 
years of cautious production levels and with the growing pressure on 
Germany to upgrade its military capabilities. Uncertainty over various 
tank programmes to be built for the US Army dampened demand from 
the specialist engine manufacturers, but the decision to upgrade the 
electronics on the German Leopard II tank and to develop the next 
generation Leopard III tank has now been confirmed. Filcon also had 
success in the developing Space satellite niche where it has built a 
focused portfolio of the specialised connectors that have been qualified 
for use on satellites.
In the Energy sector, IS-Sommer delivered a strong increase in revenues 
from products used in the repair and maintenance of the medium-
voltage infrastructure of the Electricity distribution network. IS-Sommer 
has been appointed a Master Distributor for these specialised products 
by its principal supplier and has steadily built its reputation with 
the public authorities and utilities that are responsible for the local 
distribution networks. In the Medical sector, IS-Sommer primarily serves 
German and Swiss medical equipment manufacturers and delivered 
revenues comparable to the prior year. 
The Specialty Fasteners business (Clarendon and SFC) increased 
revenues by 16% over the prior year; after adjusting for the acquisition 
of SFC, underlying revenues decreased by 7%.  33
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Although overall revenues in Aerospace reduced, this was against 
a very strong comparative with record prior year sales in the aircraft 
seating segment. This year, customer changes to aircraft seat 
designs and delays to build schedules impacted demand. In addition, 
Clarendon’s deliveries to its largest customer were reduced during the 
implementation of a large new lineside supply project. This project 
involves the installation of an innovative VMI (vendor managed 
inventory) solution that utilises bespoke dispensing racks that are 
located within the customer’s production cells and equipped with RFID 
(radio frequency identification) technology . In the UK, the company also 
consolidated its position with the same customer by extending its 
supply contract to an additional manufacturing site. The requirement 
for aircraft seating remains exceptionally high with demand continuing 
to outstrip short term capacity and Clarendon broadened its business 
with new customers across the EMEA region.
In Motorsport, a combination of reduced engine development budgets, 
some changes in purchasing practices and a reduction in the number 
of F1 teams, all contributed to reduced revenues against a strong prior 
year comparative. However, SFC’s portfolio of own-brand fastener 
products for the wider racing fraternity in the UK and the US brought 
increased penetration of several lower-tier racing series. The lead product 
is the proprietary “ Aerocatch” bonnet fastener used to secure bodywork 
panels on high performance race cars. More broadly , SFC delivered 
an excellent performance in the supply of standard and own-brand 
fastening solutions to a wide range of smaller , niche UK manufacturers.
Fluid Controls
The Hawco group of Fluid Controls businesses, which account for 
ca.25% of Sector revenues, reported a 6% reduction in revenues. The 
greater part of the shortfall was attributable to just two customers that 
had been heavily involved in new build programmes for major food 
retailers in the prior year. As has been widely reported, the traditional 
UK food retailers have reduced substantially their fit-outs of new stores. 
In response to this, Hawco’s immediate customers, the commercial 
refrigeration manufacturers, have now begun to win new business from 
the discount retailers that had previously sourced their refrigeration 
needs in Continental Europe. Hawco also continues to leverage its 
expertise and access to smaller, more efficient compressors and 
ancillary components to penetrate the wider Brewing and Catering 
sectors. As pubs continue to expand their food offerings and a 
greater variety of convenience foods are served by retailers, there 
are challenges to keep drinks and food cool in more confined spaces. 
Hawco is well positioned to support these retailers with Greenhouse 
Gas compliant, low energy solutions. 
Abbeychart began a measured realignment of its business to match 
the significant changes taking place in the UK hot drinks dispensing 
market. Key players are repositioning their businesses from “vending 
companies” to “coffee specialists” , with a broad range of espresso-type 
machines being installed in an increasing number of outlets from 
garages to top class restaurants. Abbeychart recently completed an 
exercise to map the components used in the broad range of espresso 
machines to build a portfolio of essential parts. The change in customer 
focus from traditional bulk coffee brewers to users of the newer 
equipment led to a decline in revenues during the first half of the year, 
but sales volumes in recent months have recovered. There was a 
further reduction in the demand for components used in the installation 
of plumbed water dispensers in offices which are now favouring 
individual bottled water. This was mostly offset by increased revenues 
from the repair and rebuilding of bar guns for soft drinks and funnel 
units used to dispense more solid slush-type drinks.
Highlights from the Y ear
• Sector revenue reduced by 4%; underlying 
reduction of 5% after adjusting for currency  
and acquisitions
• Interconnect businesses faced challenging 
industrial markets in the UK and Continental 
Europe and strong comparatives in Civil 
Aerospace and Motorsport
• Continued growth in specialised segments in 
Germany, including the Energy and the Space 
satellite sectors
• In Specialty Fasteners, lineside supply projects  
for aircraft seat manufacturer constrained 
business this year but will deliver longer term 
revenue growth; excellent performance from  
SFC in first full year
• Fluid Controls businesses repositioned towards 
growing segments of the Food & Beverage 
market in the UK, with smaller more energy 
efficient products   
Potential for Growth
• Extend Interconnect product line and further 
penetrate specialised markets in Europe
• In Specialty Fasteners, build on strong positions 
in Civil Aerospace and Motorsport and expand in 
niche industrial markets
• Continue to reposition Fluid Controls business 
towards growth segments of the Food & 
Beverage industry
• Expand geographic reach outside UK and 
Northern Continental Europe 34
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Board is committed to protecting and enhancing Diploma’s 
reputation and assets, while safeguarding the interests of shareholders. 
It has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of risk management 
and internal control. 
Diploma’s businesses are affected by a number of risks and 
uncertainties. These may be impacted by internal and external factors, 
some of which we cannot control. Many of the risks are similar to those 
found by comparable companies in terms of scale and operations. 
Our approach
Risk management and maintenance of appropriate systems of control 
to manage risk is the responsibility of the Board and is integral to the 
ability of the Group to deliver on its strategic priorities. The Board has 
developed a framework of risk management which is used to establish 
the culture of effective risk management throughout the business by 
identifying and monitoring the material risks, setting risk appetite and 
determining the overall risk tolerance of the Group. This framework of 
risk management has been substantially enhanced this year and 
additional processes have been developed which will assist the Board to 
monitor and assess the principal risks throughout the year. 
The Group’s risk management systems are monitored by the Audit 
Committee, under delegation from the Board. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of the internal control 
environment of the Group. An internal audit function has been 
established for many years to provide independent assurance that the 
Group’s risk management, governance and internal control processes 
are operating effectively .
Identifying and monitoring material risks
Material risks are identified through a detailed analysis of individual 
processes and procedures (bottom up approach) and a consideration  
of the strategy and operating environment of the Group (top down 
approach). 
The detailed risk evaluation process begins in the operating  
businesses with an annual exercise undertaken by management to 
identify and document the significant strategic, operational, financial 
and accounting risks facing the businesses. This process is both robust 
and challenging and ensures risks are identified and monitored and 
management controls are embedded in the business’ operations.
This year the Group has developed a quantitative method to  
determine a Risk Score for each risk which is based on both the 
likelihood of each identified risk occurring and the consequence of an 
adverse outcome and its impact on the business. Each business will 
then identify processes established to control each risk and minimise  
its potential impact.
 
The risk assessments from each of the operating businesses are then 
considered by the Board who evaluate the principal risks of the Group 
with reference to the Group’s strategy and operating environment.  
Our principal risks and uncertainties
Set out in this section of the Strategic Report are the principal risks and 
uncertainties affecting the Group which have been determined by the 
Board, based on the robust risk evaluation process described above, to 
have the potential to have the greatest impact on the Group’s future 
viability . These risks are similar to those reported last year, although 
with some movement on the relative ranking of these risks and one 
new risk added relating to supplier strategy change. 
The risks are each classified as strategic, operational and financial or 
accounting. The Group’s decentralised operations with different sectors 
and geographical spread reduces the impact of these principal risks. 
Viability Statement – Diploma PLC
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, for 
the next three years to September 2018. The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference to the resilience of the Group and its strong 
financial position, the Group’s current strategy , the Board’s risk appetite and the Group’s principal risks and how these are managed, as described 
in the Strategic Report. 
The Group has a broad spread of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and independent market sectors, often secured with 
longer term agreements. The Group is supported by a robust Balance Sheet and strong operational cash flows. 
The assessment period of three years has been chosen as it is consistent with the Board’s triennial review of the Group’s strategy at which the 
prospects of each business are discussed; assumptions are made regarding entering into new markets and geographies, about future growth 
rates of the existing businesses and about the acceptable performance of existing businesses. A robust financial model of the Group is built on a 
business by business basis and the metrics for the Group’s KPIs are reviewed for the assessment period. These metrics are also subject to 
sensitivity analysis which includes flexing a number of the main assumptions, namely , future revenue growth, gross margins, operating costs and 
working capital management. The results of flexing these assumptions, both individually and in aggregate, are used to determine whether 
additional bank facilities will be required during this period. 
This review and analysis also considers the principal risks facing the Group, as described on pages 35 to 37 and the potential impacts these risks 
would have on the Group’s business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity over the assessment period. The Board considers that the 
diverse nature of the Sectors and geographies in which the Group operates acts significantly to mitigate the impact any of these risks might have 
on the Group.

 Downturn in major markets
Increased
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
Adverse changes in the major markets in which the businesses operate can 
have a significant impact on performance. The effects will either be seen in 
terms of slowing revenue growth, due to reduced or delayed demand for 
products and services, or margin pressures due to increased competition.
A number of characteristics of the Group’s businesses moderate the impact of 
economic and business cycles on the Group as a whole:
• The Group’s businesses operate in three differing Sectors with different 
cyclical characteristics and across a number of geographic markets.
• The businesses offer specialised products and services; this offers a degree 
of protection against customers quickly switching business to achieve a 
better price.
• A high proportion of the Group’s revenues comprise consumable products 
which are purchased as part of customers’ operating expenditure, rather 
than through capital budgets.
• In many cases the products are used in repair, maintenance and 
refurbishment applications, rather than original equipment manufacture.
The businesses identify key market drivers and monitor the 
trends and forecasts, as well as maintaining close 
relationships with key customers who may give an early 
warning of slowing demand.
Changes to cost levels and inventories can then be made in a 
measured way to mitigate the effects.
Significant global events are closely monitored to determine 
any potential impact on key markets.

 Loss of key suppliers
Unchanged
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
For manufacturer-branded products, there are risks to the business if a major 
supplier decides to cancel a distribution agreement or if the supplier is 
acquired by a company which has its own distribution channels in the relevant 
market. There is also the risk of a supplier taking away exclusivity and either 
setting up direct operations or appointing another distributor.
In times of rapid economic expansion in activity, such as after a global 
recession, there is also a risk that the lead times to supply key products can 
become very long. Currently no single supplier represents more than 10% of 
Group revenue and only seven single suppliers represent more than 2% each 
of Group revenue.
Relationships with suppliers have normally been built up over many years and 
a strong degree of interdependence has been established. The average length 
of the principal supplier relationships in each of the Sectors is over ten years.
The strength of the relationship with each supplier and the volume of activity 
generally ensures continuity of supply, when there is shortage of product.
Long term, multi-year exclusive contracts signed with 
suppliers with change of control clauses, where possible, 
included in contracts for protection or compensation in the 
event of acquisition.
Collaborative projects and relationships maintained with 
individuals at many levels of the supplier organisation, 
together with regular review meetings and adherence to 
contractual terms.
Regular review of inventory levels.
Bundling and kitting of products and provision of added value 
services.
Periodic research of alternative suppliers as part of 
contingency planning.

 Loss of key customer(s)
Unchanged
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
The loss of one or more major customers can be a material risk.
The nature of the Group’s businesses is such that there is not a high level of 
dependence on any individual customer and no single customer represents 
more than 5% of Sector revenue or more than 2% of Group revenue.
Specific large customers are important to individual operating 
businesses and a high level of effort invested in ensuring that 
these customers are retained and encouraged not to switch 
to another supplier. However, although important to 
individual operating businesses, loss of any single customer 
does not present a material risk to the Group. 
In addition to providing high levels of customer service and 
value added activities, close integration is established where 
possible with customers’ systems and processes. 36

 Supplier strategy change
New
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
The success of the businesses depends significantly on representing suppliers 
whose products are recognised in the marketplace as the leading competitive 
brand. If suppliers fail to support these products with new development and 
technologies, then our businesses will suffer from reduced demand for their 
products and services. 
Each of the Group’s businesses supply established and leading products and 
related services to customers operating in specialised markets. 
The businesses work very closely with each of their suppliers 
and regularly attend industry exhibitions to keep abreast of 
the latest technology and market requirements/trends. The 
businesses also meet with key customers on a regular basis to 
gain insight into their product requirements and market 
developments. 
Operational Risk Relative movement within Group principal risks

 Product liability
Unchanged
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
There is a risk that products supplied by a Group business may fail in service, 
which could lead to a claim under product liability. The businesses, in their 
T erms and Conditions of sale with customers, will typically mirror the T erms 
and Conditions of purchase from the suppliers. In this way the liability can be 
limited and subrogated to the supplier.
However, if a legal claim is made it will typically draw in our business as a party 
to the claim and the business may be exposed to legal costs and potential 
damages if the claim succeeds and the supplier fails to meet its liabilities for 
whatever reason. Product liability insurance can be limited in terms of its 
scope of insurable events, such as product recall. 
T echnically qualified personnel and control systems are in 
place to ensure products meet quality requirements. The 
Group’s businesses are required to undertake Product Risk 
assessments and comprehensive Supplier Quality Assurance 
assessments. The Group has also established Group-wide 
product liability insurance which provides worldwide umbrella 
insurance cover of £20m in all Sectors. 
The Group’s businesses may also elect not to supply products 
if they are not fully confident that the products will meet the 
demands of the operating environment.
The Group’s businesses have undergone further product 
liability training during the year and are continually reviewed to 
demonstrate compliance with Group policies and procedures 
relating to product liability.
Operational Risk Relative movement within Group principal risks

 Loss of key personnel 
Unchanged
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
The success of the Group is built upon strong, self-standing management 
teams in the operating businesses, committed to the success of their 
respective businesses. As a result, the loss of key personnel can have a 
significant impact on performance, for a limited time period. 
As set out on page 38, the average length of service for all personnel in the 
Group is consistently over six years.
Contractual terms such as notice periods and non-compete 
clauses can mitigate the risk in the short term. However, more 
successful initiatives focus on ensuring a challenging work 
environment with appropriate reward systems. The Group 
places very high importance on planning the development, 
motivation and reward for key managers in the operating 
businesses including:
• Ensuring a challenging working environment where 
managers feel they have control over, and responsibility for 
their businesses. 
• Establishing management development programmes to 
ensure a broad base of talented managers.
• Offering a balanced and competitive compensation 
package with a combination of salary, annual bonus and 
long term cash incentive plans targeted at the individual 
business level.
• Giving the freedom, encouragement, financial resources 
and strategic support for managers to pursue ambitious 
growth plans. 37

 Foreign currency – Translational exposure 
Increased
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in currency rates will affect the 
Group’s results. The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign 
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Euro. The net 
assets of the Group’s operations outside the UK are also exposed to foreign 
currency translation risk.
During the year ended 30 September 2015, ca.75% of the Group’s revenue and 
adjusted operating profits were earned in currencies other than UK sterling. In 
comparison to the prior year, the net effect of currency translation was to 
decrease revenue by £8.1m and decrease adjusted operating profit by £1.6m. It 
is estimated that a further strengthening of UK sterling by 10% against all the 
currencies in which the Group does business, would reduce adjusted 
operating profit before tax by approximately £4.6m (8%), due to currency 
translation.
Currency exposures also arise from the net assets of the Group’s foreign 
operations. At 30 September 2015, the Group’s non-UK sterling trading capital 
employed in overseas businesses was £171.4m (2014: £137 .9m), which 
represented 80% of the Group’s trading capital employed. It is estimated that 
a further strengthening of UK sterling of 10% against all the non-UK sterling 
capital employed would reduce shareholders’ funds by £15.6m.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings 
and of year end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance 
sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in note 28 to 
the consolidated financial statements.
The Group operates across a number of diverse geographies 
but does not hedge translational exposure.

 Foreign currency – Transactional exposure 
Increased
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
The Group’s UK businesses are exposed to foreign currency risk on those 
purchases that are denominated in a currency other than their local currency, 
principally US dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. The Group’s Canadian and 
Australian businesses are also exposed to a similar risk as the majority of their 
purchases are denominated in US dollars and Euros. The Group’s US 
businesses do not have any material foreign currency transactional risk.
The Group’s businesses may hedge up to 80% of forecast
(being a maximum of 18 months) foreign currency
exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group finance department monitors rolling monthly
forecasts of currency exposures.
The Group classifies its forward foreign exchange contracts,
which hedge forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges and
state them at fair value at each reporting period.
Accounting Risk Relative movement within Group principal risks

 Inventory obsolescence
Unchanged
Risk description & assessment Mitigation
Working capital management is critical to success in specialised industrial 
businesses as this has a major impact on cash flow. The principal risk to 
working capital is in inventory obsolescence and write-off.
The charge against operating profit in respect of old or surplus inventory in the 
year was £1.5m but inventories are generally not subject to technological 
obsolescence.
Inventory write-offs are controlled and minimised by active 
management of inventory levels based on sales forecasts and 
regular cycle counts.
Where necessary, a provision is made to cover both excess 
inventory and potential obsolescence. 38
Corporate Responsibility
Employees
Building and developing the skills, competencies, motivation and 
teamwork of employees is recognised by the Board as being key to 
achieving the Group’s business objectives. The stability and 
commitment of the employees is demonstrated by the average length 
of service which has remained high. In addition, the number of working 
days lost to sickness is ca. 1% a year. These measures remain consistent 
across each of the Group’s Sectors.

The similar level of sick days lost per person in 2015 is heavily influenced 
by a small number of employees who are on long term sick leave.
Set out below is an analysis of the number of employees by gender at 
the year end.

The Group values the commitment of its employees and recognises the 
importance of communication to good working relationships. The Group 
keeps employees informed on matters relating to their employment, on 
business developments and on financial and economic factors affecting 
the Group. This is achieved through management briefings, internal 
announcements, the Group’s website and by the distribution of 
Preliminary and Interim Announcements and press releases.
Copies of the Annual Review and Annual Report & Accounts are also made 
available in the operating businesses. This communication programme 
enables employees to gain a better understanding of the Group’s business 
objectives and their roles in achieving them. Both employment policy and 
practice in the Group are based on non-discrimination and equal 
opportunities. Ability and aptitude are the determining factors in the 
selection, training, career development and promotion of all employees.
The Group remains supportive of the employment and advancement of 
disabled persons. Applications for employment by disabled persons are 
always fully considered, bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and 
abilities of the applicants concerned. If an employee is, or becomes 
disabled during their period of employment, the Group will, if necessary 
and to the extent possible, adapt the work environment to enable the 
employee to continue in their current position or retrain the employee 
for duties suited to their abilities following disablement. At 30 
September 2015 the Group employed four disabled employees.
Employment policies throughout the Group have been established to 
comply with relevant legislation and codes of practice relating to 
employment, Health & Safety and equal opportunities. The Group 
provides good quality working environments and facilities for employees 
and training and development appropriate to each of their roles.
Some of the Group’s operating companies have structured 
apprenticeship schemes for technical staff and the Group provides 
sponsorship for high potential employees for higher education courses 
where appropriate. Vocational training is also provided and some staff 
are enrolled on National Vocational Qualification (“NVQ”) or similar level 
courses. Employees are actively encouraged to undertake Continuing 
Professional Development (“CPD”) to maintain any relevant 
professional accreditations.
In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority , 
employees are required to seek approval of the Company before 
dealing in its shares.
Health & Safety
The Group is fully committed to ensuring clean, safe and healthy 
working conditions. The Group actively promotes a strong safety 
culture and ensures a collective responsibility for ensuring Health & 
Safety standards are continually improved.
The Group Chief Operating Officer, Iain Henderson, has overall 
responsibility for Health & Safety policies and procedures across the 
Group. However, in line with the Group’s decentralised management 
approach, accountability for Health & Safety is with local management 
to match local regulatory requirements, culture and specific business 
needs. The Group requires that each operating business conducts 
Health & Safety reviews against its specific operational risk profile and 
local regulatory requirements.

The overall level of minor injuries has remained broadly constant, but when 
normalised to a rate per 1,000 employees there is a marked decrease in the 
overall number of minor injuries. The absolute number of reportable lost 
time incidents has reduced slightly with only one of the injuries resulting in 
greater than five days’ lost time. Again, when normalised to a rate per 
1,000 employees, the reportable lost time incidents have reduced in 2015. 
Owing to the nature of the Group’s operations, the most common types 
of injury relate to minor cuts, slips/trips or lifting injuries.
All injuries are fully investigated and corrective actions and preventative 
measures put in place to ensure that the injury does not reoccur and 
future risks are mitigated.
Health & Safety forms part of the induction process for new employees 
and where relevant, more specialist training is provided for specific 
functions. The Group has good coverage of employees who have 
formal Health & Safety training and/or qualifications and this has 
continued to increase during 2015.
Human rights
The Group’s activities are substantially carried out in developed 
countries that have strong legislation governing human rights.
The Group complies fully with appropriate legislation in the countries in 
which it operates.
Environmental
The Group comprises sales and marketing focused businesses 
which essentially receive products from suppliers and despatch them to 
customers. The Group’s businesses do not operate delivery fleets; they  39
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
use third party carriers to deliver their products to customers and to 
provide much of their packaging requirements. The Group’s ability to 
control the environmental impact of its logistics partners is therefore 
limited. The primary impact on the environment, which is entirely in the 
Group’s control, is consumption of the normal business energy sources 
such as heating and power, which the Group aims to minimise.
The Group ensures it minimises its impact on the environment through 
compliance with relevant environmental legislation. The Group is 
committed to identifying and assessing environmental risks, such as 
packaging waste, arising from its operations.
Waste management initiatives are encouraged and supported by 
the Group and materials are recycled where practical.
Local management are committed to good environmental 
management practices throughout our operations. The Managing 
Directors have responsibility for environmental performance of their 
operating businesses and each subsidiary is required to implement 
initiatives to meet their responsibilities. 
Each facility participates in recycling paper, plastic, cardboard, and wood 
from pallets and continues to focus on minimising energy consumption 
through the efficient use of heating and lighting. In addition a number of 
the businesses now use fully recycled and biodegradable filler materials 
for packaging.
Greenhouse gas emissions
In 2014, the UK Government introduced a requirement that UK 
listed companies should report their global levels of Greenhouse Gas 
emissions in their Annual Report & Accounts. The mandatory 
requirement is for disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 only (direct emissions, 
e.g. heating, cooling, transport fuel and indirect emissions, e.g. from 
purchased electricity) and only to the extent that such emissions are the 
responsibility of the Company .
The Group has considered the six main Greenhouse Gases (“GHGs”) 
and report emissions in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (CO
2
e) for Scope 1 
(direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions. These emissions are calculated 
following the GHG Protocol and UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines. The Group has used DEFRA UK GHG Conversion 
Factors, US Environmental Protection Agency Emission Factors and 
International Energy Agency Factors.
As a distributor with no owned logistics or freight, the Group’s primary 
direct energy usage and related CO
2

Business ethics
The Group recognises its obligations towards the parties with whom 
the Group has business dealings including customers, shareholders, 
employers, suppliers and advisors.
In general, the interactions with these parties are managed at a local 
level by senior management and the Group expects a high standard of 
expertise and business principles to be maintained in such dealings.
The Group’s policy towards suppliers is that each operating business is 
responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions under which they 
trade with their suppliers. The Group does not operate a formal code 
that it follows with regard to payments to suppliers. Group companies 
agree payment terms with their suppliers when they enter into binding 
purchasing contracts for the supply of goods or services. Suppliers are, 
in that way , made aware of these terms. Group companies seek to 
abide by these payment terms when they are satisfied that the supplier 
has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed 
terms and conditions.
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are important to the 
long term development and sustainability of the operating businesses.
The Group considers the environmental and social impacts of 
conducting business on the community and this forms part of the 
business decision making process. Many community activities and 
events are fully supported by the Group and this relationship is 
managed by the local management teams.
Some highlights from the year include:
In North America
• Somagen Diagnostics supported the Canadian Blood Services in 
their Partners for Life programme which involves a corporate pledge 
for blood donation through staff, family and friends.
• Various charitable events at Hercules US including support to local 
charities such as United Way , Clothes T o Kids, The Haven (domestic 
abuse charity), Paul B. Stephens Exceptional School for Disabled 
Children and Metropolitan Ministries (food bank).
• Somagen funds two academic awards each year in two universities 
in the fields of histotechnology and biomedical engineering.
• J Royal took part in a charity cycle ride for a multiple sclerosis charity .
• Hercules Canada took part in an Earth Day Clean Up and a golf 
tournament to raise funds for a local cancer care centre and cystic 
fibrosis research.
In Europe
• Specialty Fasteners held a fundraising day for Breast Cancer Now 
charity.
• FPE Seals supported Downs Syndrome by entering a team into the 
Great North Run, supported a breast cancer charity and sponsored 
a new strip for a local junior football team. 
• A Hawco employee completed a 190 mile cycle ride from Hawco’s 
offices in Surrey to Paris to support Macmillan Cancer Research and 
the Anaphylaxis Campaign.
• Various charitable events at IS-Rayfast including running the London 
Marathon, a charity sky dive, supporting Movember and a 72 hole 
charity golf challenge.
The Group also contributes to local worthwhile causes and charities 
and in 2015 the Group made donations of £35,504 (2014: £42,698). 
No political donations were made. 40

Corporate Governance
The effectiveness of the Board 
was already reasonably good and 
this provides a good platform 
moving forward.”
John Nicholas, Chairman
During the year , the Board reviewed the Group’s risk management 
framework in light of the Board’s risk appetite. This process concluded 
with a robust assessment of the Group’s principal risks, together with an 
agreed form of reports which the Board will use to ensure that it regularly 
monitors these risks throughout the year . 
The other updates to the Code have also been considered by the Board 
and its respective Committees and some refinements have been made 
to existing practices where appropriate to ensure full compliance.
Further refreshing of the Board took place in 2015 following the 
retirement of John Rennocks as Chairman in January 2015. In addition 
with Marie-Louise Clayton’s term of office expiring in November 2015, 
we needed to recruit a new non-Executive Director.
As well as having to fill these vacancies, it provided a good opportunity 
to refresh the Chairs of the Board Committees. The recruitment of 
Andy Smith in February with significant experience of HR policies and 
practices makes him a good Chair to replace me on the Remuneration 
Committee. Similarly , I was pleased that Anne Thorburn decided to join 
us in September as she brings good experience gained in Board level 
finance roles in international industrial companies. This will allow her to 
be particularly effective as Chair of the Audit Committee. I was also 
pleased that Charles Packshaw agreed to become Senior Independent 
Director of the Company , following my appointment as Chairman.
Finally , we were all sad to learn that Iain will be leaving the Group in March 
2016 after many years as an Executive Director on the Board and we wish 
him well in his retirement. As indicated in the announcement of Iain’s 
departure in September , the Board will not seek to directly replace his 
Board role as Chief Operating Officer . However the Chief Executive 
Officer will set up an Executive Management Group of senior 
management drawn from across the businesses, including the PLC 
Office. This Group will be accountable to the Board, through the Chief 
Executive Officer , which will provide the Board with good insight of senior 
management as it develops its plans for succession. 
Finally , I would hope that as shareholders in the Company you will be 
able to find time to attend our AGM on Wednesday , 20 January 2016. 
It provides an excellent opportunity to meet the Board of Directors 
and challenge them on any matters you feel are important to the 
development of the Company .

Dear Shareholder
In my first year as Chairman of the Company , I have tried to provide 
sufficient opportunity for both myself and my independent colleagues 
on the Board, all of whom are relatively new to their roles, to gain a 
thorough understanding of the culture and values of the Company . 
An important step in this process was the Board’s formal review of Group 
strategy held in Switzerland over two days and combined with a visit to 
Kubo, which the Group acquired earlier in the year . As well as reviewing 
Group strategy with the Executive Directors, the Board also had an 
opportunity to meet senior management in the Group’s EMEA Seals 
businesses, to receive formal presentations from these businesses and 
to have a more informal dinner with these managers.
Later in the year, the Board experienced its first externally facilitated 
evaluation of effectiveness, which had been postponed from last year 
to allow the more recently appointed Directors to gain more insight into 
the workings of the Board. This evaluation exercise was based on 
confidential one-to-one interviews with an external facilitator. I was 
pleased that the facilitator was able to confirm that the effectiveness of 
the Board was already reasonably good as this will provide a good 
platform moving forward. There were some minor recommendations 
that came out of this exercise which are identified further in this Report 
on Corporate Governance and we plan to implement these in the next 
financial year.
The changes introduced in 2014 to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the FRC guidance on risk management in particular , were very timely 
in supporting one of the Board’s key objectives identified last year to 
review the Group’s risk management and internal control processes.  43
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Compliance with the Code
Diploma PLC is required to state whether it has complied with the Main 
Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The previous Code 
published in 2012 was revised and re-issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in September 2014. Set out on pages 43 to 65 is an explanation 
of how the Company has complied with the Main Principles of the 
Code. 
The Board confirms that throughout the financial year, the Company 
applied all of the Principles set out in sections A to E of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code for the period under review. The Board 
also confirms that it complies with all of the Provisions of the Code as at 
the date of this Report . 
There were four cases of non-compliance with the Provisions of the 
Code during the year. These related to timings of appointments 
following the retirement of John Rennocks as Chairman and the 
appointment of John Nicholas as his successor.
B. 1.2 – At least half the Board did not comprise independent non-
Executive Directors during the period from 21 January 2015 until the 
appointment of Andy Smith as an independent non-Executive Director 
on 9 February 2015. The recruitment process had commenced in 
December 2014, but had not been completed by 21 January 2015. 
A.4. 1 – There was no Senior Independent Director (“SID”) appointed for 
the period from 21 January 2015 when John Nicholas resigned as SID 
until the appointment of Charles Packshaw as SID on 27 February 2015. 
Following his appointment as Chairman, John Nicholas was keen to 
follow a fair and structured appointment process for the role of SID.
C.3. 1 and D.2. 1 – There were only two members of the Audit 
Committee for the period from 21 January 2015, when John Nicholas 
resigned as a member, until the appointment of Andy Smith as an 
independent non-Executive Director on 9 February 2015. Similarly , 
there was no Chairman of the Remuneration Committee during the 
same period. There were no meetings of either the Audit or 
Remuneration Committee during this period.
The Company’s auditor Deloitte LLP , is required to review whether the 
above statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the 
Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for their 
review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if it 
does not reflect such compliance. 
Framework of Corporate Governance
The Board
The Diploma PLC Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders 
for standards of governance across the Group’s businesses. Certain 
strategic decision-making powers and authorities of the Company are 
reserved as matters for the Board. The principal matters reserved for 
the Board are set out below. Day-to-day operational decisions are 
managed by the Chief Executive Officer.
• Setting the overall strategic direction and oversight of the 
management of Diploma PLC.
• Recommending or declaring dividends.
• Approval of the Group and Company financial statements.
• All new bank facilities, or significant changes to existing facilities.
• Assessment and approval of the principal risks facing the Group and 
how they are being managed.
• Approval of the Viability Statement.
• Maintaining sound internal control and risk management systems.
• Approval of major corporate transactions and commitments.
• Succession planning and appointments to the Board.
• Review of the Group’s overall corporate governance arrangements 
and reviewing the performance of the Board and its Committees 
annually.
• Approval of the delegation of authority between the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive Officer and the terms of reference of all 
Committees of the Board.
Where appropriate, matters are delegated to a Committee which will 
consider them in accordance with its terms of reference. Details of each 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Diploma PLC 
website at www.diplomaplc.com
Audit Committee
Chaired by Marie-Louise Clayton
Number of meetings in the year: six
Role of the Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing and 
monitoring the Company’s financial statements, accounting 
processes, audit (internal and external), internal control systems and 
risk management procedures and also monitors issues relating to 
fraud, anti-bribery and corruption, sanctions and whistleblowing.
Nomination Committee
Chaired by John Nicholas
Number of meetings in the year: three
Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and its Committees. It identifies and 
nominates suitable candidates to be appointed to the Board (subject 
to Board approval) and considers succession generally.
Remuneration Committee
Chaired by Andy Smith
Number of meetings in the year: three
Role of the Committee
The Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, the framework 
and policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. The remuneration of the non-Executive Directors is 
determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The 
Committee takes into account the business strategy of the Group 
and how remuneration policy should reflect and support that strategy . 44
Corporate Governance continued
The Company has purchased insurance to cover its Directors and 
Officers against the costs of defending themselves in legal proceedings 
taken against them in that capacity and in respect of any damages 
resulting from those proceedings.
The Company also indemnifies its Directors and Officers to the extent 
permitted by law. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover 
where the Director or Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly .
T o ensure that non-Executive Directors can constructively challenge 
and support proposals on strategy , the Board has adopted a process of 
reviewing and approving the agreed strategy for the Company on a 
three yearly basis. The Board met with its key advisors in early June 
2015, to set the scene for a formal review of the Company’s strategy at 
the end of June 2015 in Zurich, Switzerland. The location also provided 
an opportunity to visit the facilities of the recently acquired Kubo, based 
at Effretikon, Switzerland and to receive presentations from the senior 
management of Diploma’s EMEA Seals businesses (Kubo, M Seals, 
Kentek and FPE Seals). The Board received a number of presentations 
and had thorough and challenging reviews with Executive 
management. The Board will review progress annually against the 
objectives set at the Group strategy and will undertake the next formal 
review in 2017 /18. 
Meetings of the Board
The Board has decided to increase its scheduled meetings from 
six to seven in the next financial year so as to provide more time to 
address the substantial additional regulatory matters that it is now 
required to consider on a more formal basis. 
The Board will however meet more frequently if required and this 
year met on seven occasions, including the Strategy Review, as 
set out on page 42.
Each Director is expected to attend all meetings of the Board 
or Committees of which they are a member. In addition, senior 
management from across the Group and advisors attend certain 
meetings for the discussion of specific items in greater depth.
This exposure to the members of senior management from across 
the businesses helps enhance the Board’s understanding of the 
businesses, the implementation of strategy and the changing 
dynamics of the markets in which the businesses operate.
Effectiveness
Independent non-Executive Directors
The non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement and there are no relationships 
or circumstances which could affect, or appear to affect, a Director’s 
judgement. The Chairman, John Nicholas was considered independent 
by the Board both at the time of his appointment as Director on 1 June 
2013 and as Chairman on 21 January 2015. In accordance with the 
Code, the ongoing test of independence for the Chairman is not relevant. 
All non-Executive Directors are advised of the likely time commitments 
at appointment. The ability of individual Directors to allocate sufficient 
time to the discharge of their responsibilities is considered as part of the 
Directors’ annual evaluation process, overseen by the Chairman. Any 
issues concerning the Chairman’s time commitment are dealt with by 
the Nomination Committee, chaired for this purpose by the Senior 
Independent Director.
Leadership
Board composition 
The Board currently comprises a Chairman, three Executive Directors and 
four independent non-Executive Directors. The non-Executive Directors 
are appointed for specified terms and the details of their respective 
appointments are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on 
page 57 . The biographical details of the Board members are set out on 
pages 40 and 41.
As previously reported, John Rennocks retired from the Board at the 
conclusion of the AGM on 21 January 2015 and John Nicholas 
succeeded him as Chairman. The recruitment of another non-Executive 
Director commenced late in 2014 and completed on 9 February 2015 
with the appointment of Andy Smith as an independent non-Executive 
Director. Andy was also appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee (which John Nicholas had vacated on becoming Chairman 
of the Company on 21 January 2015) and a member of the Audit and 
Nomination Committees.
In November 2015, Marie-Louise Clayton’s three year term of office 
expired. Anne Thorburn was appointed an independent non-Executive 
Director on 7 September 2015 and was also appointed a member of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Anne Thorburn will 
be appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee on 17 November 2015.
On appointment as Chairman, John Nicholas vacated the role of Senior 
Independent Director and was replaced by Charles Packshaw who was 
appointed Senior Independent Director on 27 February 2015.
Activities of the Board
The Company’s governance framework is set out on page 43 together 
with a summary of the formal terms of reference. The core activities of 
the Board and its Committees are planned on an annual basis and this 
framework forms the basic structure within which the Board operates.
The Board’s terms of reference also set out the separate and distinct 
roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Chairman is responsible for the overall leadership and governance 
of the Board and ensures that the Directors have an understanding of 
the views of the Company’s major shareholders. The Chairman sets the 
Board’s agenda and ensures that there is a healthy culture of challenge 
and debate at Board and Committee meetings.
The Board appoints the Chief Executive Officer and monitors his 
performance in leading the Company and providing operational and 
performance management in delivering the agreed strategy . The Chief 
Executive Officer is responsible for developing, for the Board’s approval, 
appropriate values, culture and standards to guide all activities 
undertaken by the Company and for maintaining good relationships 
and communications with investors.
The approval of acquisitions, for the most part, is a matter reserved for 
the Board, save that it delegates to the Chief Executive Officer the 
responsibility for such activities to a specified level of authority . Similarly , 
there are authority levels covering capital expenditure which can be 
exercised by the Chief Executive Officer. Beyond these levels of 
authority , projects are referred to the Board for approval.
Other matters reserved to the Board include treasury policies, internal 
control and risk management. 45

Board evaluation
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of effectiveness using 
specifically designed evaluation forms and under the direction of 
the Chairman. This exercise encompasses an evaluation of the 
performance of the Board as a whole, as well as of each of the 
Committees and individuals. Feedback on Board performance is 
presented by the Chairman to the Board and actions and objectives 
are agreed for the following year. 
Following the internal evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board 
carried out in September 2014, the Board identified three areas to 
address in particular in 2015. These objectives and the progress 
achieved in 2015 are set out below:
• T o strengthen the Board’s competencies through the appointment 
of a new non-Executive Director with broad industrial experience 
gained in an international environment – this was achieved by the 
appointment of Andy Smith as a non-Executive Director. 
• T o seek more regular presentations at Board meetings from senior 
management across the Group – during the year, senior 
management from DHG and the EMEA Seals businesses made 
presentations to the Board. In March 2016, the Board will also be 
holding one of their formal meetings at another Group business 
location and will have an opportunity to meet with local 
management in that business.
• T o focus on the management of risk – the Board discussed and 
developed the Group’s risk management framework over several 
meetings. These discussions included the development of an 
updated risk management framework and consideration of the 
Board’s risk appetite. As part of this exercise the Board carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and the 
key controls in place to manage these risks. The results of this work 
are summarised in a separate section of the Strategic Report on 
Internal Control and Risk Management on page 34. 
 
As indicated in last year’s Annual Report & Accounts, the Board this year 
completed an annual evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness using an 
external facilitator to carry out this exercise. A member of the Institute 
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators was appointed to carry out 
this evaluation. 
The evaluation was conducted by means of confidential interviews  
with each individual member of the Board. The exercise encompassed 
an evaluation of the Board as a whole and of the Board Committees. 
The evaluation of the Board covered seven topics: Board role and 
responsibilities, oversight, arrangements for Board meetings, support 
for the Board, Board composition, working together and outcome and 
achievements. 
The external facilitator prepared a detailed report on the results of his 
evaluation which was circulated to all members of the Board and the 
Chairman invited the facilitator to present his report at the meeting of 
the Board on 24 September 2015.
The facilitator concluded that, based on his evaluation, the Board’s 
effectiveness was strong with an average score of 73% across each of 
the seven topics assessed, as identified above. There were no negative 
performance issues identified from the evaluation that related to 
individual Directors or the performance of the Board Committees. 
However, the facilitator recommended a small number of items that  
the Board should address with the aim of strengthening the Board’s 
effectiveness. The principal matters were:
Each non-Executive Director is required to inform the Board of any 
changes to their other appointments.
During the year, the Chairman has also held meetings with the 
non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present.
The appointments of non-Executive Directors are subject to formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedures which are described more fully 
in the Report from the Nomination Committee which is set out on 
page 51.
Diversity
The Board is committed to a culture that attracts and retains talented 
people to deliver outstanding performance and further enhance the 
success of the Group. In that culture, diversity across a range of criteria 
is valued, primarily in relation to skills, knowledge and experience and 
also in other criteria such as gender and ethnicity . The Board has 
considered setting objectives in relation to diversity , but does not 
believe that such objectives are appropriate at this juncture, given 
the relatively small Board. The Board will however keep this matter 
under review, particularly in light of Board succession and development.
Information and professional development
An induction programme is agreed for all new Directors aimed at 
ensuring that they are able to develop an understanding and awareness 
of the Group’s core processes, its people and businesses. The non-
Executive Directors’ awareness of the businesses is further developed 
through periodic visits to the principal business locations and 
presentations to the Board by senior management of the businesses.
Following the new appointments to the Board last year, a managed 
induction programme was set up which includes a visit by each of the 
new non-Executive Directors to the major business units in each of the 
Group’s Sectors where they have an opportunity to meet with senior 
management in these businesses. Meetings were held individually 
between each of the non-Executive Directors and the Executive 
Directors and with some of the principal advisors to the Company .
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Group Company Secretary , is responsible for ensuring that Directors 
are supplied with information in a timely manner that is in a form and of 
a quality appropriate to enable them to discharge their duties. In the 
normal course of business, the Chief Executive Officer gives an oral 
report to the Board at each meeting and information is provided and 
reported through formal Board reports that include information on 
operational matters and strategic developments. There are also reports 
on the performance of the Group’s businesses, financial performance 
relative to the budget, risk management, business development and 
investor relations.
The training needs of the Directors are periodically discussed at Board 
meetings and where appropriate, briefings as necessary are provided on 
various elements of corporate governance and other regulatory issues.
The Group Company Secretary acts as an advisor to the Board on 
matters concerning governance and regulatory issues and ensures 
compliance with Board procedures. All Directors have access to his 
advice and a procedure also exists for Directors to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. No such advice was 
sought during the year. The appointment and removal of the Group 
Company Secretary and his remuneration are matters for the Board  
as a whole. 46
Corporate Governance continued
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a well-developed investor relations programme 
managed by the Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance Director. 
Through this programme, the Company maintains regular contact with 
major shareholders to communicate clearly the Group’s objectives and 
monitors movements in significant shareholdings.
During the past several years, these communications have been 
enhanced by the introduction of Investor Days, both in the UK and in 
Canada which were well attended. In addition, Investor Roadshows  
are now held each year in the US as well as in the UK and formal  
investor presentations are made twice a year to groups of private  
client fund managers. 
Most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Finance Director through presentations made twice a year on 
the operating and financial performance of the Group and its longer term 
strategy . The Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance Director generally 
deal with questions from individual shareholders. 
The Group’s website contains up to date information for shareholders 
which includes the Annual Reports of the past five years, current and 
historic share price information, news releases, presentations to analysts 
and key shareholders. The website also contains factual data on the 
Group’s businesses, products and services.
The non-Executive Directors are given regular updates as to the views 
of institutional shareholders and an independent insight is sought 
through research carried out twice a year by the Company’s advisors, 
focused on both investors and analysts.
Through these processes, the Board is kept abreast of key issues 
and the opportunity is available on request for shareholders to meet 
the Chairman or Senior Independent Director, separately from the 
Executive Directors.
Electronic communications to shareholders include the Notice of the AGM 
which is sent at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. The Company 
proposes a separate resolution on each separate issue and for each 
resolution, proxy appointment forms provide shareholders with the 
option to vote in advance of the AGM.
All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions at the 
Company’s AGM, when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer give a 
statement on the Group’s performance during the year, together with 
a statement on current trading conditions. The Chairman of the Board 
and of the Remuneration and Audit Committees will be available to 
answer questions at the meeting.
The Board has resolved, in line with best practice, to conduct a poll 
on each resolution proposed at the AGM. The results of the AGM 
resolutions, including details of votes cast, are published on the 
Company’s website.
With regard to other shareholder meetings, other than Annual General 
Meetings (“ AGMs”), the Board will continue, in ordinary circumstances, 
to provide as much notice as possible and certainly no less than 
14 working days. However, the Board considers that it should still 
retain the flexibility to reduce the timescale to 14 clear days in the 
case of non-routine business and where it is merited by the business 
of the meeting. For this reason, the Board has again proposed a 
resolution at the AGM to reduce the notice period for General 
Meetings from 21 to no less than 14 clear days.
• the Board should formally review the Group’s policies on cyber risk 
on a more regular basis; and
• the Board should agree to a timetable for circulating Board papers 
and minutes to all members of the Board. 
The Chairman undertook to consider these recommendations and  
will report back to the Board on actions required, where appropriate,  
to address these matters. The Board will report on progress made  
with implementing these recommendations in next year’s Annual 
Report & Accounts. 
The Senior Independent Director, together with the non-Executive 
Directors also carried out a performance evaluation of the Chairman, 
having taken account of the views of Directors.
Re-election
All Directors of the Board are subject to election by the shareholders  
at the first AGM following their appointment by the Board and in 
accordance with the Code, all Directors will also stand for re-election 
annually at the AGM.
Conflicts of interest
Directors are subject to a statutory duty under the Companies Act 2006 
(“the Act”) to avoid a situation where they have, or could have, a direct 
or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly could conflict, with the 
Company’s interests. The Act allows directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate, where the 
Articles of Association contain a provision to this effect. The Act also 
allows the Articles to contain other provisions for dealing with Directors’ 
conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty . 
Procedures adopted to deal with conflicts of interest continue to 
operate effectively and the Board’s authorisation powers are being 
exercised properly in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association.
Charles Packshaw, the Company’s Senior Independent Director, is also 
Head of UK Advisory and Managing Director in HSBC’s global banking 
businesses which is one of the principal banks that provide bank 
facilities and ancillary banking services to the Group and its businesses. 
The Board remains satisfied that this relationship does not provide a 
conflict of interest. 
Accountability
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report & 
Accounts taken as a whole present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group and provides the information necessary to 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy . This is achieved through this Annual Report & 
Accounts, the Annual Review and through other periodic financial 
statements and announcements.
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives 
and for maintaining sound risk management and internal control 
systems. The Board is also responsible for monitoring the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems and it reviews the 
effectiveness of these systems through the work of the Audit 
Committee. 
The principal risks which the Board has identified this year are set out in 
the section on Internal Control and Risk Management on pages 34 to 37 
of the Strategic Report.  47

Audit Committee Report
The Group comprises a set of 
well managed businesses with 
a healthy focus on monitoring 
risks and maintaining robust and 
effective systems of control.”
Marie-Louise Clayton, Chairman of the Audit Committee
There were no particularly subjective accounting issues for the 
Committee to consider this year; those matters that do entail a higher 
degree of judgement are set out later in this Report of the Audit 
Committee and remain unchanged from last year. The Committee 
discussed these matters with the auditor and was satisfied that the 
Group’s approach remained prudent and conservative. 
The Committee continued to liaise closely with the Company’s auditor 
and met him alone several times to review the results of the Group 
and discuss meetings they had held with Group businesses and PLC 
management as part of their audit of the financial statements. The 
Committee also met regularly with the Internal Audit Manager and was 
closely involved in recruiting his successor during the summer. 
I am pleased that in passing my role to Anne I can be confident that the 
Group comprises a set of well managed businesses with a healthy focus 
on monitoring risks and a keen interest in maintaining robust and 
effective systems of control.

Dear Shareholder
In my final report to you as Chair of the Committee, I am pleased to 
report that the Committee made good progress in carrying out a 
comprehensive work programme to ensure that it meets the increasing 
depth of review and reporting that is now required of Audit Committees.
This year’s work was focused on working with the Board to develop 
the risk framework of the Group, in light of the new provisions in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and in particular on challenging 
management on the effectiveness of the internal systems of control. 
The Committee, with the help of reports from the Internal Audit 
Manager, remains satisfied that the control systems operating within 
the businesses are generally strong. As importantly , the Committee 
was also pleased to learn from reports from both the Internal Audit 
Manager and external auditor that there is a culture across the 
businesses to “get things right first time” and where possible improve 
processes, controls and reporting efficiencies.

Audit Committee
The Committee is chaired by Marie-Louise Clayton and comprises 
independent non-Executive Directors. The Chair of the Committee and 
Anne Thorburn are both qualified accountants, who have recent and 
relevant financial experience. 
On appointment as the Chairman of the Company , John Nicholas 
resigned from the Audit Committee on 21 January 2015 in accordance 
with good governance practice, but continues to attend meetings at the 
invitation of the Committee. Andy Smith was appointed to the 
Committee on 9 February 2015 and Anne Thorburn was appointed on  
7 September 2015. Anne will become Chair of the Committee on  
17 November 2015, when Marie-Louise Clayton retires from the Board.  
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. The 
Executive Directors also attend Committee meetings and the Internal 
Audit Manager also attended two Committee meetings. The Committee 
met with the external auditor and Internal Audit Manager during the year , 
without the Executive Directors being present. 
Engagement of the external auditor
The external auditor is engaged to express an opinion on the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company . The audit includes the 
review and testing of the systems of internal financial control and the data 
contained in the financial statements, to the extent necessary 
for expressing an audit opinion on the truth and fairness of the 
financial statements.
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s auditor since its appointment in 
2008. Deloitte LLP provides the Committee with relevant reports, 
reviews and advice throughout the year, as set out in their terms of 
engagement. 
In accordance with UK regulations, the Company’s auditor adheres to a 
rotation policy based on best practice and a new Group lead engagement 
partner was appointed in 2013 in place of the previous lead engagement 
partner who had completed a term of five years in that role. 
During the year , the Committee carried out an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. The assessment was led by 
the Chair of the Committee, assisted by the Group Finance Director and 
focused on certain criteria which the Committee considered to be 
important factors in demonstrating an effective audit process. These 
factors included the quality of audit staff, the planning and execution of 
the audit and the role of management in the audit process. Following this 
assessment, the Committee concluded that the external audit process 
remained effective and that it provides an appropriate independent 
challenge of the Group’s senior management.
The Committee remains satisfied that Deloitte continues to provide 
a robust and effective audit and supports the work of the Committee 
through clear and objective communication on developments in 
financial reporting and governance. In 2016, the Committee will be 
reviewing the Company’s audit tender timetable and processes as part 
of a wider review of the Competition & Markets Authority Order which 
was effective from 1 January 2015 and in preparation for the audit tender 
which will likely be carried out before the end of 2017 . 49

the Group’s two pension scheme arrangements, accounted for in 
accordance with IAS19 (Revised) and the Group’s taxation position.
Risk management and internal control
The principal risks and uncertainties which are currently judged to 
have the most significant impact on the Group’s long term performance 
are set out in a separate section of the Strategic Report on Internal 
Control and Risk Management on pages 34 to 37 . 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a clear organisational structure with defined 
authority levels. The day-to-day running of the Group’s business is 
delegated to the Executive Directors of the Company . The Executive 
Directors visit each operating unit on a regular basis and meet with both 
operational and finance management and staff.
Key financial and operational measures relating to revenues, cash and 
receivables are reported on a weekly basis. Detailed management 
accounts and KPIs are prepared monthly using a robust proprietary 
reporting system to collect and analyse financial data in a consistent 
format. Monthly results are measured against both budget and half year 
reforecasts which have been approved and reviewed by the Board. All 
capital expenditure above predefined amounts must be supported by a 
paper prepared by business management. 
All financial data is taken directly from the trial balances of each business 
held in their local ERP systems and re-analysed and formatted for Group 
reporting purposes. There is no re-keying of financial data and very 
limited use is made of spreadsheets by Group businesses to report 
monthly financial results. The Group’s internal auditor regularly audits 
the base data at each business to ensure it is correctly collected by the 
management reporting system.
As part of the year end close process each business is required to complete 
a self-assessment which evaluates their financial control environment in 
the business designed to identify weaknesses in controls. These 
assessments are critically reviewed by the Group’s Internal Audit Manager 
and a summary for each business is prepared for the Audit Committee. 
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems for the period from 1 
October 2014 to the date of this Report. T aking into account the 
matters set out on pages 34 to 37 relating to principal risks and 
uncertainties and the reports from the Internal Audit Manager , the 
Board, with the advice of the Committee, is satisfied that the Group has 
in place effective risk management and internal control systems.
Internal audit
The Group’s finance department includes a separate Internal Audit 
function. This function is managed by a qualified internal auditor who is 
based in one of the Group’s businesses in Minneapolis in the US. The 
internal auditor remains a member of the Group management team in 
Diploma PLC and reports directly to both the Group Finance Director 
and Chair of the Audit Committee. During the year, the previous Internal 
Audit Manager transferred to a new finance role in the Group and was 
replaced by an experienced qualified internal auditor recruited from 
outside the Group. 
Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of its monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements, the 
Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies have been 
adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates 
and judgements and seeks support from the external auditors to 
assess them. 
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 30 September 2015 are set 
out below: 
Impairment of goodwill:
The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill and the 
assumptions underlying the impairment review. The judgements in 
relation to goodwill impairment largely relate to the assumptions 
underlying the calculations of the value in use of the business or Sector 
being tested for impairment. These judgements are primarily the 
calculation of the discount rate, the achievability of long term business 
plans and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation 
process. This area is a prime source of audit focus and accordingly the 
external auditor provided detailed reporting to the Committee.
Accounting for acquisitions:
The Committee reviewed the accounting for acquisitions completed 
during the year and the assumptions underlying the valuation of 
intangible assets. They discussed the nature of the intangible assets 
with the Group Finance Director and the period over which these assets 
were to be amortised. The Committee also discussed with the external 
auditor the work they had carried out to satisfy themselves that the 
valuation assumptions were appropriate. 
Valuation of inventory:
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance Director that 
set out the gross balances by business, together with any related 
provision against the carrying value. The Committee reviewed the 
bases used to value and confirm existence of inventory held across the 
Group; they also considered the appropriateness of provisions held 
against the carrying value of inventory , having regard to the age and 
volumes of inventory , relative to expected usage. This matter was also 
discussed with the external auditor. 
Recoverability of trade receivables:
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance Director that 
set out the gross balances by business, together with any related 
provision against the carrying value. The Committee reviewed the 
report of work done by the external auditor on trade receivables to 
confirm both existence and recoverability; the appropriateness 
of provisions held against the carrying value of accounts receivable 
were also considered, having regard to the age and creditworthiness of 
the customer. These matters were also discussed with the Group 
Finance Director and the external auditor. 
The Committee was satisfied that each of the matters set out above 
had been fully and adequately addressed by the Executive Directors, 
appropriately tested and reviewed by the external auditor and that the 
disclosures made in the Annual Report & Accounts were appropriate. 
In addition to the main issues reviewed above, the Committee also 
seeks confirmation from the auditor that the Group’s businesses follow 
appropriate policies to recognise material streams of revenue and that 
the audit work carried out more generally has assessed any instances 
where management may be able to override key internal controls 
designed to guard against fraud or material misstatement. The auditor 
also reports to the Committee on other less material matters relating to  50
Audit Committee Report continued
The Committee assures itself of the auditor’s independence 
by receiving regular reports which provide details of any assignments 
and related fees carried out by the auditor in addition to their normal 
audit work, and these are reviewed against the above guidelines.
Details of the external auditor’s total fees, including non-audit fees of 
£12,000 paid to Deloitte LLP during the year are set out in note 27 to the 
financial statements.
Sanctions
Following the acquisition of Kentek in 2014, a specialised distributor of 
filters with substantial operations in Russia and the Baltic States, the 
Audit Committee worked with senior management of the Company , in 
conjunction with local management of Kentek, to determine the scope 
and reach of EU and US led sanctions and implemented a system to 
ensure ongoing compliance with this new sanctions regime. The 
Committee has received reports on compliance with these sanctions 
and will continue to monitor developments until the sanctions are 
suspended or revoked. 
Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing
Diploma has a Group-wide anti-Bribery and Corruption policy to comply 
with the Bribery Act 2010 and it periodically reviews its procedures to 
ensure continued effective compliance in its businesses around the world. 
During the year , the Group rolled out an e-learning training programme to 
all its businesses. This training has been undertaken by all senior 
management and employees in customer or supplier facing roles. It is 
intended that these training programmes will be regularly carried out and 
that the e-learning training programme will be extended to encompass 
other regulatory and compliance based topics, including Code of 
Conduct. 
During the year , the Committee updated the Group’s Whistleblowing 
Policy , which provides the framework to encourage and give employees 
confidence to “blow the whistle” and report irregularities. Employees are 
encouraged to raise concerns with designated individuals, including the 
Executive Directors, the Group Company Secretary or the Chair of the 
Audit Committee. All such reports are investigated and reported to the 
Committee, together with details of corrective action taken. The Group’s 
Whistleblowing Policy is monitored by the Committee and no matters 
were reported to the Committee under this policy during the year . 
In September , the Committee initiated action to introduce a dedicated 
telephone hotline service to be provided by an independent service 
provided across the Group’s businesses, with the aim of further 
encouraging whistleblowing. 
A full programme of internal audit visits has been completed during  
the year. The scope of work carried out by internal audit generally 
focuses on the internal financial controls and risk management 
procedures operating within each business. In January , the Internal 
Audit Manager presents his audit plan for the year to the Committee for 
their approval. Written reports are prepared on the results of each visit 
which set out weaknesses identified during the work, together with 
recommendations to improve the control environment. These reports 
are reviewed and discussed with the Executive Directors.
At the conclusion of the financial year, the Internal Audit Manager 
reports to the Committee on the results of the audit work carried out  
in the year. The Committee reviews management’s response to 
matters raised, including the time taken to resolve such matters. There 
were no significant matters identified in the internal audits undertaken 
during the year, but recommendations were made in relation to 
formalising month end close procedures, policies for inventory 
provisioning and controls over supplier master file data. As well as 
carrying out the normal work on financial contracts, the scope of 
internal audit work this year was extended to include controls operating 
over ERP systems recently implemented, over foreign currency hedging 
policies and procedures being followed to ensure compliance with 
international sanctions. 
The Internal Audit Manager also continues to assist the Committee in 
its oversight of the Group’s controls designed to ensure compliance 
with the policy on anti-Bribery and Corruption. 
The Internal Audit Manager reported to the Committee that good 
progress had been made by the Group’s businesses in implementing 
recommendations communicated last year and in particular in 
improving procedures operating over the completeness and sufficiency 
of cycle counts of inventories and to ensuring that the procedures for 
chasing older receivable balances remained robust.
The Committee continues to keep under review the need for a more 
independent Internal Audit function in the Group. The Committee 
remains satisfied that the Group’s system of internal control is 
appropriate for a group of the size and nature of Diploma PLC and the 
Committee’s current view is that a separate formal independent Internal 
Audit function is not required at this time.
Non-audit fees
The Committee has established a set of guidelines covering the type 
of non-audit work that can be assigned to the external auditor. These 
guidelines were reviewed and updated last year and relate to advisory 
services where the auditor’s detailed knowledge of the Group’s affairs 
means that it may be best placed to carry out such work. This extends 
to, but is not restricted to, shareholder and other circulars, regulatory 
reports, and on occasions, work in connection with disposals.
The external auditor may only provide such services where these do 
not conflict with their statutory responsibilities and ethical guidance.

The Nomination Committee is chaired by John Nicholas, the Chairman 
of the Company who succeeded John Rennocks on his retirement on 21 
January 2015. The Committee is chaired by the Senior Independent 
Director on any matter concerning the chairmanship of the Company . 
The Committee comprises the non-Executive Directors.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Appointment of Directors
As part of any appointment process for new Directors, the Committee 
determines the selection criteria for each Director which takes account 
of diversity , including gender and sets out a detailed description of the 
requirements for the role. The Committee works with external search 
agencies as appropriate, who draw up a long list of candidates from a 
range of industries and backgrounds for initial appraisal by the 
Committee. From this, a shortlist is prepared of suitable candidates that 
most closely meet the selection criteria and these candidates are 
interviewed by members of the Committee. Following these 
interviews, the Committee recommends to the Board the appointment 
of a Director. As part of this process the Committee ensures that it 
follows the Board’s policy on diversity , described on page 45.
In anticipation of the succession of the Chairman, Norman Broadbent 
LLP were appointed to search for a new non-Executive Director with the 
remit from the Committee that the candidate should have broad 
industrial experience gained in an international environment. Following 
the appointment process described above, the Board appointed Andy 
Smith as an independent non-Executive Director. Andy’s induction is 
substantially complete, having met with each of the main businesses in 
Europe and the US and participated in the Board Strategy meeting. 
During the year under review Marie-Louise Clayton’s three year term of 
office expired. An external search for a new non-Executive Director 
commenced with JCA Group, again with a remit from the Committee 
that the candidate should have strong Board level finance experience 
gained in international industrial businesses. Having followed the 
appointment process described above, Anne Thorburn joined the 
Board on 7 September 2015 as an independent non-Executive Director 
and will become Chairman of the Audit Committee on 17 November 
2015 on the retirement of Marie-Louise Clayton. Anne has begun her 
induction programme and will complete this with visits to the larger 
businesses in 2016. 
Norman Broadbent LLP and JCA Group have no other connection with 
the Company . 
Succession planning
At the strategy meeting held in June 2015, the Board reviewed 
succession planning for the Executive Directors and for the senior 
management cadre comprising ca.90 senior managers across the 
Group’s businesses. At this meeting the Board agreed with the Chief 
Executive Officer to establish an Executive Management Group of key 
senior managers who will have the potential to provide leadership in the 
future. This initiative forms a key part of the Board’s succession planning 
and will be pursued further in 2016. 52
Remuneration Committee Report
The remuneration environment 
has remained relatively stable  
and this has allowed me to take 
a more gradual and considered 
review.”
Andy Smith, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
shareholders, however it deduced from these comments and from those 
made by various proxy agencies that these objections related to the use 
of discretion, as allowed under the rules of the Scheme, to increase the 
bonus paid to the Chief Executive Officer by 10% of the amount payable. 
Whilst the Committee feels that it is important to retain discretion to 
amend on occasion awards to Executive Directors, both downwards and 
upwards, it notes shareholders’ concerns and commits to appropriate 
consultation before exercising such discretion in future. 
The Report on Remuneration this year is set out on pages 58 to 65 and 
the salaries and awards paid to the Executive Directors this year remain 
within the parameters of the Policy approved by shareholders at the 
AGM. After last year’s repositioning of base salaries through a one-off 
increase of 8% plus inflation, this year’s increases in base salaries of 3% 
for the Executive Directors have been decided with reference to general 
levels of pay inflation and the range of remuneration increases applying 
across the Group’s cadre of ca. 90 senior managers. Annual bonuses of 
51% of the maximum for the Chief Executive Officer and 6 1% of the 
maximum for the Group Finance Director and the Chief Operating Officer 
reflect the robust performance of the Group this year .
The longer term awards under the L TIP were also substantially below 
those earned in previous years and amounted to ca.34% and 17% of the 
maximum awards payable for the PSP and the SMP respectively . The 
reduced awards reflected the more modest earnings growth reported 
this year , as well as the impact of a broadly flat TSR relative to the FTSE 
250 index. 
The Committee continues to allocate one meeting each year to  
review the remuneration and awards paid to the senior management 
cadre in the Group and takes time to ensure that the remuneration 
structure for this important group of managers remains both appropriate 
and competitive.
I hope shareholders will find this Report helpful and will support the 
advisory vote on remuneration at the AGM in January . I would be 
delighted to meet shareholders at this year’s AGM and answer any 
questions or concerns they have on the Company’s remuneration 
policies.

Dear Shareholder
I have been fortunate that in my first year as Chairman of this Committee, 
the remuneration environment has remained relatively stable after many 
years of constant regulatory change. This has allowed me to take a more 
gradual and considered review of the Company’s remuneration policies in 
the context of the wider debate on the appropriate structure of Directors’ 
remuneration. 
My initial thoughts are that the current Remuneration Policy (“Policy”), 
approved by shareholders in January 2015 is well designed and remains 
appropriate to the current strategic challenges facing the Group and I see 
no reason to make any substantive further changes until we are required 
to review the policy in 2017 .
The Committee has this year carried out a careful review of the 
additional recommendations introduced this year in the revised 2014 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee generally did not feel  
that these recommendations should lead to any substantive change  
to the Company’s existing Policy . The remuneration paid to the 
Executive Directors includes transparent and stretching targets which 
will only pay out if the Company continues to be successful over the 
longer term. Short term remuneration in terms of salary and bonus 
remain competitive and targeted toward the median of comparable 
peer companies. 
During the year the Committee did resolve to amend the existing policy 
on malus in respect of share awards and bonuses to comply with the 
revised 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code and extended the policy to 
include clawback, that is the recovery of cash bonuses or share awards 
already paid. 
At last year’s AGM in January 2015 a significant number of shareholders 
voted against approval of the Company’s Report on Remuneration. 
The Committee was able to obtain only limited specific feedback from  53

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (”the Committee”) is chaired by Andy 
Smith and comprises independent non-Executive Directors.
On appointment as Chairman of the Company, John Nicholas 
retired as Chairman of the Committee and Andy Smith was 
appointed Chairman on joining the Board on 9 February 2015. Anne 
Thorburn was appointed to the Committee on joining the Board on 
7 September 2015.
Bruce Thompson, Chief Executive Officer, attends meetings at the 
invitation of the Committee to provide advice to the Committee to 
help it make informed decisions. The Group Company Secretary 
attends meetings as Secretary to the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee Report
The Report has again been presented this year in two sections. The first 
section repeats the key elements of the Director’s Remuneration Policy 
which was approved by shareholders at the AGM earlier this year on  
21 January 2015. This Policy will continue for a period of three years until 
21 January 2018, unless replaced or amended by a new policy .
The second section of this Report sets out the annual remuneration paid 
to the Directors in the year ended 30 September 2015. This section of 
the Report will continue to be subject to an advisory vote by 
shareholders at the AGM.
Remuneration principles and structure
The Committee has adopted remuneration principles which are 
designed to ensure that senior executive remuneration:
• is aligned to the business strategy and promotes the long term 
success of the Company;
• supports the creation of sustainable long term shareholder value;
• provides an appropriate balance between remuneration elements 
which include performance related elements which are transparent, 
stretching and rigorously applied; 
• provides an appropriate balance between immediate and deferred 
remuneration; and
• encourages a high-performance culture by ensuring performance-
related remuneration constitutes a substantial proportion of the 
remuneration package and by linking maximum payout opportunity 
to outstanding results.
The Policy table set out on the next page summarises the components 
of reward for the Executive Directors of Diploma PLC that will govern the 
Company’s intentions as regards future payments. More detailed 
descriptions of the incentive plans are given in the following sections. 
There have been no changes made to this Policy since it was approved by 
shareholders earlier this year , with the exception that the Committee has 
now approved the introduction of clawback provisions to new L TIP 
awards and the annual bonus plan granted to Executive Directors after 1 
October 2015. This recommendation was included in the revised 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

Executive Directors
Base salary
In determining the annual base salary increases which apply from 
1 October, the Committee considers comparative salaries in similar 
companies and the range of remuneration increases applying across 
the Group and in particular for the Group’s senior management cadre 
comprising ca.90 senior managers across the Group’s businesses.
Annual Performance Bonus
The Diploma PLC Annual Performance Bonus Plan is a cash based 
scheme designed to reward Executive Directors for meeting stretching 
shorter term performance targets. At the start of the financial year 
(1 October), the Board sets a financial performance target principally 
focused on achievement of a target adjusted EPS, which to pay out at the 
maximum is significantly ahead of both internal annual budgets 
and market consensus. The level of bonus payable for achieving the 
minimum target is 5% of base salary . No bonus is payable if adjusted 
EPS does not meet the minimum target.
The definition of adjusted EPS is consistent with the Group’s 
financial statements, however the Committee has discretion to 
modify the definition in the event of changes in accounting policy and/
or material operational, market, exchange rate or environmental factors 
in order to more appropriately reflect management performance. The 
Committee has discretion to reduce awards if minimum thresholds 
are not achieved for operating margins, free cash flow and return on 
adjusted trading capital employed (“ROA TCE”). Where used, the 
rationale for the exercise of this discretion will be disclosed in the 
next Remuneration Committee Report.
Different performance measures and weightings may be used for future 
cycles of the Annual Performance Bonus Plan to those set out in the 
Policy T able to take into account changes in the business strategy .
Individual objectives are also set for the Chief Operating Officer and 
the Group Finance Director relating to factors including operating 
performance, business and management development activities. At 
the end of the financial year, the Committee meets to assess the 
performance of each Executive Director against the financial and 
individual objectives. Bonuses are normally paid in cash in December.
Long term incentive plan (“LTIP”)
The Company operates a long term incentive plan for Executive 
Directors, being the Diploma PLC 2011 Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
The PSP is designed to promote the long term success of the Company , 
while also aligning the Directors’ interests with those of Diploma 
PLC shareholders. 
The PSP provides for a grant of conditional awards of a specified 
number of ordinary shares in the Company , or an option to acquire 
a specified number of shares at an exercise price determined by the 
Committee (which may be nil or a nominal amount). No payment is 
required for the grant of an award.
Awards, which are normally granted annually , must generally be made 
within 42 days after the announcement of the Company’s annual 
results. When making the decision on the level of award, the 
Committee takes into consideration a number of factors, including the 
face value of the award and plan dilution limits.
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or shares 
under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. The relevant share 
price will be the mid-market closing share price on the day before the 
award. A face value limit of 175% of base salary applies to each PSP 
award to Executive Directors, although the Committee, at its discretion, 
may increase the face value of an award to a maximum of 250% in 
exceptional circumstances. 
All awards will normally vest on the date on which the performance 
conditions are determined and confirmed by the Committee, 
following the end of the performance period. The vesting of 
awards is conditional on:
• continued employment;
• the Company’s growth in adjusted EPS over a three year 
performance period; and
• the Company’s TSR performance over a three year 
performance period.
The latter two performance conditions apply to each award so that 
the vesting of 50% of the award is based on growth in adjusted EPS 
and 50% of the award is based on the relative TSR performance. 
Each performance condition is measured over a three year period 
commencing on the first day of the financial year in which the award 
is made. There is no retesting of either performance metric. 25% of 
the PSP awards will vest at the minimum performance threshold.
The Committee will regularly monitor the continuing suitability of 
the performance conditions and may impose different conditions 
on awards granted in subsequent years, having regard to prevailing 
market conditions.
The Committee may decide, on or before the grant of a share incentive 
award, that on exercise of the award, the participant may receive, in 
addition to the shares in which he then becomes entitled, a dividend 
equivalent in respect of the dividends (excluding any tax credit) which 
would have been paid to the participant in respect of shares vesting 
between the date of the award and the time of vesting. These dividend 
equivalent payments may be made in cash or in an equivalent number 
of shares.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, including arrangements for 
early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are 
designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required 
to manage the Company and successfully deliver its strategic 
objectives. 
The Committee considers that a rolling contract with a notice period 
of one year is appropriate for existing and newly appointed directors. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, copies of which are held 
at the Company’s registered office, have been updated to recognise 
developments in law and best practice relating to such contracts during 
recent years. These service contracts contain provisions for 
compensation in the event of early termination or change of control, 
equal to the value of salary and contractual benefits for the Director’s 
notice period. The Company may make a payment in lieu of notice in 
the event of early termination and the Company may make any such 
payment in instalments with the Director being obliged in appropriate 
circumstances to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new 
employment).
The Committee considers that these provisions assist with recruitment 
and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in the best interests 
of shareholders. 56

Other remuneration policies
Payment for loss of office
The Committee has considered the Company’s policy on remuneration 
for Executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to 
applying a consistent approach to ensure that the Company pays no 
more than is necessary .
The loss of office payment policy is in line with market practice and will 
depend on whether the departing Executive Director is, or is deemed to 
be treated as, a “good leaver” or a “bad leaver” . In the case of a “good 
leaver” the policy includes:
• Notice period of 12 months’ base salary , pension and contractual 
benefits or payment in lieu of notice.
• Bonus payable for the period worked, subject to achievement of the 
relevant performance condition. Different performance measures 
(to the other Executive Directors) may be set for a departing Director 
as appropriate, to reflect any change in responsibility .
• Vesting of award shares under the Company’s long term incentive 
plan is not automatic and the Committee would retain discretion to 
allow partial vesting depending on the extent to which performance 
conditions had been met at the date of cessation and the length of 
time the awards have been held. Time pro-rating may be disapplied 
if the Committee considers it appropriate, given the circumstances.
• The Committee will also provide for the leaver to be reimbursed 
for a reasonable level of legal fees in connection with a 
settlement agreement.
When calculating termination payments, the Committee will take 
into account a variety of factors, including individual and Company 
performance, the obligation for the Executive Director in appropriate 
circumstances to mitigate loss (for example, by gaining new 
employment) and the Executive Director’s length of service.
Change of control
Change of control provisions provide for compensation equal to 
the value of salary and contractual benefits for the notice period.
In the event of a change in control, vesting of award shares under 
the Company’s L TIP depends on the extent to which performance 
conditions had been met at that time. Time pro rating may be disapplied 
if the Committee considers it appropriate, given the circumstances of the 
change of control.
Malus and clawback
Malus provisions apply to awards made since 1 October 2012 under 
the Company’s L TIP and annual bonus plans which give the Committee 
the right to cancel or reduce unvested share awards (or in the case of 
the Annual Performance Bonus Plan, cash payments) in the event of 
material misstatement of the Company’s financial results, miscalculation 
of a participant’s entitlement or individual gross misconduct.
During the year, the Committee considered and approved the 
introduction of clawback provisions to new L TIP and Annual Bonus 
Performance Plan awards granted to Executive Directors after 
1 October 2015. The clawback arrangements will permit the Committee 
to recover amounts paid to Executive Directors in specified 
circumstances and will further safeguard shareholders’ interests. 
Remuneration for new appointments
The Committee has determined that new Executive Directors will receive 
a compensation package in accordance with the terms of the Group’s 
approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment. 
The Committee has agreed the following principles that will apply when 
arranging a remuneration package to recruit new Executive Directors:
• The remuneration structure will be kept simple where practicable, 
hence the use of base salary , benefits, pension (or cash allowance 
in lieu), annual performance bonus and long term incentives.
• The emphasis on linking pay with performance shall continue; 
hence the use of variable pay in the form of an annual performance 
bonus and a long term incentive award, which will continue to 
be a significant component of the Executive Directors’ total 
remuneration package.
• Initial base salary will take into account the experience and calibre 
of the individual and their existing remuneration package. Where it 
is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially , a series of increases to 
the desired salary positioning may be given over subsequent years 
subject to individual performance.
• The structure of variable pay will be in accordance with Diploma’s 
approved Policy detailed above with an exceptional maximum 
aggregate variable pay opportunity of 375% of salary . Different 
performance measures may be set in the first year for the annual 
bonus, taking account of the responsibilities of the individual, 
and the point in the financial year that the executive joined.
• Benefits will generally be provided in accordance with the approved 
Policy , with relocation expenses/an expatriate allowance paid 
if appropriate.
• In the case of an external recruitment and after having taken into 
account any variable pay awards to be granted to the executive, 
the Committee may also offer additional cash and/ or share-based 
elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of 
Diploma and shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards 
or arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join the 
Group. This includes the use of awards made under section 9 .4.2 
of the UK Listing Rules. Any such payments would take account of the 
details of the remuneration foregone including the nature, vesting 
dates and any performance requirements attached to that 
remuneration and any payments would not exceed the expected 
value being forfeited. 
• In the case of an internal appointment, any outstanding variable pay 
awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to the terms of grant.
• For all new Executive Director appointments, deferral arrangements 
will apply , to be set according to the circumstances of individual 
appointments and will involve a requirement to acquire shares with a 
proportion of any post tax annual bonus and/ or retention of a 
proportion of L TIP shares received (after tax), in either case, any such 
shares to be retained for at least two years after vesting or until the 
mandated shareholding guidelines have been met.
• Fees for a new Chairman or non-Executive Director will be set in 
line with the approved Policy .

Committee discretion
The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under which it 
operates. In addition, it complies with rules which have either been 
approved by shareholders (e.g. the L TIP) or by the Board (e.g. the Annual 
Performance Bonus Plan). These rules provide the Committee with 
certain discretions which serve to ensure that the implementation of 
the Policy is fair both to the Executive Director and to shareholders, 
taking the overall performance and position of the Company into 
account. The Committee also has discretions to set components 
of remuneration within a range from time to time. The extent of 
such discretions are set out in the relevant rules or in the maximum 
opportunity sections of the Policy T able.
Dilution
In any ten-year period, the number of shares which are or may be issued 
under option or other share awards under any executive share plan 
established by the Company may not exceed 5% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company from time to time. In any ten-year period, 
the aggregate number of shares which are or may be issued under 
option, or other share awards under all share plans established by the 
Company , may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company , from time to time.
Consultation with shareholders and employees
The Committee will consult with its major shareholders in advance of any 
significant changes to the approved Policy . The Committee also receives 
reports from the Group Company Secretary on correspondence received 
from shareholders relating to remuneration matters when their approval 
of the Remuneration Committee Report is sought at the AGM.
The Committee has not consulted with employees on setting the 
Policy for Executive Directors.
Comparison with employee conditions
In determining annual increases in base salary , annual performance 
bonuses and benefits, the Committee takes into account the 
employment conditions applying across the senior management cadre. 
This comparator group comprises ca.90 senior managers across the 
Group’s businesses. This senior management cadre has been chosen 
as a representative group, since comparisons drawn from across the 
globe and by differing roles, skills, experience and qualifications would 
reduce the scope for meaningful comparisons.
Chairman and non-Executive Directors
Recruitment and term
The Board aims to recruit non-Executive Directors of a high calibre, 
with broad and diverse commercial, international or other relevant 
experience. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. Appointments of the 
non-Executive Directors are for an initial term of three years, subject to 
election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment 
and subject to annual re-election thereafter. The terms of engagement 
are set out in letters of appointment which can be terminated by either 
party serving three months’ notice. 
Chairman
John Nicholas was appointed Chairman on 21 January 2015, having 
previously been the Senior Independent Director. His appointment is 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.

Fees
The non-Executive Directors are paid a competitive basic annual fee 
which is approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors. The Chairman’s fee is approved by the 
Committee, excluding the Chairman. Additional fees may also be 
payable for chairing a Committee of the Board or for acting as Senior 
Independent Director. The fees are reviewed each year and take 
account of the fees paid in other companies of a similar size and 
complexity , the responsibilities and the required time commitment.
The non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the 
Company’s share plans, incentive plans or pension schemes and there 
is no provision for payment in the event of early termination. 58
The following section of this Report provides details of the implementation of the Remuneration Policy for all Directors for the year ended

Performance conditions
Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the L TIP awards maturing in 2015 and the outstanding L TIP awards, 
including those granted in December 2013 and February 2015. 
With effect from 1 October 2014, new L TIP awards were granted under the PSP at 175% of base salary; no further awards have been made under the 
SMP although existing SMP awards will continue to mature with the final awards maturing in November 2016. The performance conditions applying to 
new awards made under the PSP have been revised from those set out below for existing awards granted in 2012 and 2013.
The first performance condition for the L TIP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Company’s adjusted EPS, over the three 
consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the annual compound growth rate in the UK Retail 
Price Index (“RPI”) by a specified amount over the same period. For the new awards, the adjusted EPS targets will be specified as absolute figures, not 
relative to RPI. The performance conditions are as follows:
Existing awards (2012 and 2013)
% of existing  
awards vesting New awards (from 2014)
% of new 
awards 
vesting
Adjusted EPS growth (over 3 years) PSP SMP Adjusted EPS growth (over 3 years) PSP
RPI + 15% p.a. or above 100 100
RPI + 12% p.a. 100 50 14% p.a. 100
RPI + 3% p.a. 30 15 5% p.a. 25
Below RPI + 3% p.a. Nil Nil Below 5% p.a. Nil
Where the Company’s adjusted EPS performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis. For the 
purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition remains consistent 
with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years. 60
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Company’s TSR over a three year period to that of the companies in the FTSE 250 
Index (excluding Investment T rusts). The performance conditions are as follows:
Existing awards (2012 and 2013)
% of existing  
awards vesting New awards (from 2014)
% of new 
awards  
vesting
TSR relative to FTSE 250 Index (over 3 years) PSP SMP PSP

Median + 12% p.a. 100 50 Upper Quartile 100
Median 30 15 Median 25
Below Median
Nil Nil Below Median Nil
Where the Company’s TSR performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis. The FTSE 250 Index 
was chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.
Awards vesting in 2015
The PSP and SMP awards made to the Executive Directors on 19 December 2012 and 20 December 2012 respectively , were subject to operating 
performance conditions, independently assessed over a three year period ended 30 September 2015, as set out in the table above. The outcome of 
each award is shown in the table below:

Long term incentive plan – awards granted in the year
The Executive Directors received grants of PSP awards on 5 February 2015, in the form of nil-cost options. These awards were based on the 
mid-market price of an ordinary share in the Company at close of business on the day immediately preceding the award. 
Under normal circumstances, the options will not become exercisable until the performance conditions are determined after the end of the 
three-year measurement period which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made, and provided the Director remains 
in employment. The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the end of the three-year measurement 
period. The performance conditions for these awards are set out on pages 59 and 60.
Outstanding share-based performance awards 
Set out below is a summary of the share-based awards outstanding at 30 September 2015, including both share awards which have vested during 
the year based on performance and share awards which have been granted during the year. The awards set out below were granted based on a face 
value limit of 100% of base salary for December 2012 and December 2013 and 175% of base salary for February 2015. No awards will vest unless the 
performance conditions set out on pages 59 and 60 are achieved over a three year measurement period.

end of the performance period.
Both the PSP and SMP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options (there is a notional exercise price of £1 per award). T o the extent that 
the awards vest, the options are then exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the award date. Details of options exercised during the year and 
outstanding at 30 September 2015 are set out on page 64. 62

The Remuneration Committee’s Annual Report (“Report”) and the Remuneration Committee’s Report on Directors’ Remuneration Policy (“Policy”) 
for the year ended 30 September 2014 were approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 21 January 2015, with the following votes being cast:

At last year’s AGM in January 2015 a significant number of shareholders voted against approval of the Company’s Report on Remuneration. The 
Committee was able to obtain only limited specific feedback from shareholders, however it deduced from these comments and from those made 
by various proxy agencies that these objections related to the use of discretion, as allowed under the rules of the Scheme, to increase the bonus 
paid to the Chief Executive Officer by 10% of the amount payable. Whilst the Committee feels that it is important to retain discretion to amend on 
occasion awards to Executive Directors, both downwards and upwards, it notes shareholders’ concerns and commits to appropriate consultation 
before exercising such discretion in future.

Executive Director’s interest in options over shares
In respect of nil cost options granted under the PSP and SMP , the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated on the date that the 
options first vest. The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to 
exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date (he may exercise the options at any time up to the day 
preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant), any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the 
underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option. This increase or decrease in value reflects an 
investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration. 64
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2015 and the movements during the year are as follows:

Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, to encourage substantial long term share ownership. These specify that, over 
a period of five years from the date of appointment, the Chief Executive Officer should build up and then retain a holding of shares with a value 
equivalent to 200% of base salary . The guideline holding for other Executive Directors is 100% of base salary . The guidelines also require that, 
in relation to L TIP awards, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached. As at 
16 November 2015, all Executive Directors exceeded the applicable shareholding guidelines.

Senior Executives below the Board
The policies and practices with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Executive Directors are generally treated consistently with 
the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have a significant portion of their reward package linked to performance. Annual bonuses are 
linked to short term financial targets which use similar performance metrics to the targets for the Executive Directors. They also participate in cash 
based long term incentive plans which are focused on the operating profit growth of their businesses over rolling three year periods. The Committee 
reviews and monitors the senior executive remuneration arrangements. 66

Share capital
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well as the 
powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from the Group 
Company Secretary and are available on the Company’s website.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on the transfers of securities and/or voting 
rights, other than those relating to the Company’s Share Matching Plan 
(“SMP”), described further below. No person holds securities in the 
Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company . 
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share that is 
not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not prevent dealings in shares 
in the Company from taking place on an open and proper basis, or where 
the Company has lien over that share. The Directors may also refuse to 
register a transfer of a certificated share, unless the instrument of transfer 
is: (i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered office of the 
Company or any other place as the Board may decide accompanied by the 
certificate for the share(s) to be transferred and/ or such other evidence as 
the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to 
make the transfer; (ii) in respect of only one class of shares; (iii) in favour of a 
person who is not a minor; infant, bankrupt or a person of unsound mind; 
or (iv) in favour of not more than four persons jointly .
T ransfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using CREST and 
the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertified share in 
accordance with the regulations governing the operation of CREST .
Participants in the Company’s SMP pledge investment shares to a 
nominee for a period of three years, during which period these shares 
cannot be transferred. There are no other restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company except certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example 
insider trading laws); or where a shareholder with at least a 0.25% 
interest in the Company’s certified shares has been served with a 
disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares. 
Shares held by the Diploma Employee Benefit T rust
While ordinary shares are held within the Diploma Employee Benefit 
T rust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are exercisable by the 
T rustees in accordance with their fiduciary duties. The T rustees of the 
Diploma Employee Benefit T rust also waive dividends on all shares held 
for the purposes of the Company’s long term incentive arrangements.
Share allotment
A general allotment power and a limited power to allot shares in  
specific circumstances for cash, otherwise than pro rata to existing 
shareholders, were given to the Directors by resolutions approved at 
the AGM of the Company held on 21 January 2015. In the year ended 
30 September 2015, the Company has not allotted any shares. These 
powers will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM and resolutions to 
renew the Directors’ powers are therefore included within the Notice of 
the AGM in 2016.
Authority to make market purchases of own shares
An authority to make market purchases of shares was given to the 
Directors by a special resolution at the AGM of the Company held on 
21 January 2015. In the year to 30 September 2015 the Company has 
not acquired any of its own shares. This authority will expire at the 
conclusion of the 2016 AGM and a resolution to renew the authority is 
therefore included within the Notice of the AGM in 2016.
Financial 
Results and dividends
The profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders was £36.7m 
(2014: £35.5m). The Directors recommend a final dividend of 12.4p per 
ordinary share (2014: 11.6p), to be paid, if approved, on 27 January 2016. 
This, together with the interim dividend of 5.8p (2014: 5.4p) per ordinary 
share paid on 17 June 2015 amounts to 18.2p for the year (2014: 17 .0p).
The results are shown more fully in the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 68 to 95 and summarised in the Finance Review 
on pages 18 to 20.
Details of post balance sheet events are included in note 29 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Directors’ assessment of going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39 . The financial position of the Group, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in  67
Strategic Report Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Governance Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Act. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Parent Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group’s consolidated financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the Parent 
Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and Parent 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; 
• the Annual Report & Accounts includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties faced by the Group; and
• the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy .
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors 
on 16 November 2015 and is signed on its behalf by:
BM Thompson
Chief Executive Officer
NP Lingwood
Group Finance Director
Registered office:
12 Charterhouse Square
London
EC1M 6AX
the Finance Review on pages 18 to 20. In addition, pages 81 to 83 of the 
Annual Report & Accounts include the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources, together with a broad 
spread of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and 
sectors, often secured with longer term agreements. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully as described further on pages 34 to 37 .
The Group also has a committed multi-currency revolving bank facility 
of £40m and an accordion option for a further £10m, both of which 
expire on 23 June 2017 . At 30 September 2015, the Group had cash 
funds of £23.0m and had borrowings of £20.0m.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly , they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual 
Report & Accounts.
Statement of disclosure
Each of the Directors has reviewed this Annual Report & Accounts and 
confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and that he has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report & 
Accounts, including the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year . Under that law 
the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulations and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (UK Accounting Standards).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, to present fairly the financial position and the 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation 
to such financial statements, that references in the relevant part of that 
Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view, are references 
to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU.
• For the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company financial statements.
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent 
Company will continue in business. 68

1. General information
Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address 
of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6AX. The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 16 November 2015. These statements 
are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted 
by the European Union (“EU”) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial 
statements of the Parent Company , Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”), 
and are set out in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 96 and 97 .
2. Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”)) financial measures which are not defined 
within IFRS. The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and, as such, these 
measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual 
Report & Accounts.
2.1 Adjusted operating profit
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted operating profit” is defined as operating profit before amortisation and impairment of 
acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to deferred consideration (collectively , “acquisition related charges”), the costs of a 
material restructuring or rationalisation of operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of businesses or property . The Directors believe that 
adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the underlying operational performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted profit before tax” is separately disclosed, being defined as adjusted operating profit, 
after finance expenses (but before fair value remeasurements under IAS 39 in respect of future purchases of minority interests) and before tax. 
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share
“ Adjusted earnings per share” (“EPS”) is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but excluding the tax impact on 
the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit and the tax effects of goodwill in overseas jurisdictions, less profit attributable to minority 
interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe that adjusted EPS provides an 
important measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow
At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, “free cash flow” is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating activities, after net 
capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before expenditure on business combinations/
investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Company’s shareholders. The Directors believe that free cash flow gives an 
important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future investment or distribution to shareholders.
2.5 T rading capital employed and ROA TCE
In the segment analysis in note 3, “trading capital employed” is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents and after 
adding back: borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax and acquisition liabilities in respect of future purchases of minority interests 
and deferred consideration. Adjusted trading capital employed is reported as being trading capital employed plus goodwill and acquisition related 
charges previously written off (net of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets). Return on adjusted trading capital employed (“ROA TCE”) at the 
Group and Sector level is defined as the adjusted operating profit, divided by adjusted trading capital employed and adjusted for the timing effect 
of major acquisitions and disposals. The Directors believe that ROA TCE is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
3. Business sector analysis
For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business Sectors: Life Sciences, Seals and Controls. These Sectors 
form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below. The principal activities of each of these Sectors is described in the Strategic Report 
on pages 1 to 39 . Sector revenue represents revenue from external customers; there is no inter-Sector revenue. Sector results, assets and liabilities 
include items directly attributable to a Sector, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Sector assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a 
business Sector. Sector liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities and corporate liabilities that cannot 
be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business Sector. These items are shown collectively in the following analysis as “unallocated assets” and 
“unallocated liabilities” , respectively .

5. Group employee costs
The key management of the Group are the Executive and non-Executive Directors who have authority and responsibility for planning and controlling 
all significant activities of the Group. The Directors’ remuneration and their interests in shares of the Company are given in the Remuneration 
Committee Report on pages 52 to 65. The amount charged against operating profit in the year in respect of Director short term remuneration was 
in aggregate £2.3m (2014: £2.2m). The charge for share-based payments of £0.5m (2014: £0.7m) relates to the Group’s Long T erm Incentive Plan 
(“L TIP”), described in the Remuneration Committee Report. The fair value of services provided as consideration for part of the grant of the L TIP 
awards has been based on a predicted future value model and was £Nil (2014: £0.2m).

 United Kingdom (1.0) –
 Overseas – (0.5)
Total deferred tax (1.0) (0.5)
Total tax on profit for the year 14.4 13.7
In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the Consolidated Income Statement, deferred tax relating to the retirement benefit 
scheme and cash flow hedges of £0. 1m was credited (2014: £0. 1m charge) directly to the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other 
Comprehensive Income. A further £Nil (2014: £0.5m) was credited to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which relates to share-based 
payments made during the year, comprising a current tax credit of £Nil (2014: £1.0m credit) less a deferred tax charge of £Nil (2014: £0.5m charge).
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year:
The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 20.5% to the profit before tax of 
£51.8m and the amounts set out above is as follows:
2015
£m
2014

Profit before tax 51.8 49.8
Tax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 20.5% (2014: 22.0%) 10.6 11.0
Effects of:
  – higher tax rates on overseas earnings 3.7 3.2
  – adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 0.3 (0.5)
  – other permanent differences (0.2) –
Total tax on profit for the year 14.4 13.7
The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas. The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 21.0% to 20.0% on 1 April 2015; however as the 
Group prepares its consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation tax in respect of the 
year ended 30 September 2015 was 20.5% (2014: 22.0%) and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the above reconciliation. The Group’s net 
overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in the US are taxed at rates of up to ca.38%. 
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2015 have been calculated based on the rate of 20.0% substantively enacted at 
30 September 2015. On 8 July 2015, HM Government announced a reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and 
to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. The impact of remeasuring the Group’s UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at these new rates has not been 
recognised in these consolidated financial statements as the Finance Bill had not been substantively enacted at 30 September 2015. 76

The Group tests goodwill for impairment generally twice a year. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s 
three operating Sectors. This reflects the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored by management and better reflects the 
Group’s strategy of acquiring businesses to drive synergies across a Sector, rather than within an individual business. The impairment test requires a 
“value in use” valuation to be prepared for each Sector using discounted cash flow forecasts. The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination  
of annual budgets prepared by each business and the Group’s strategic plan. Beyond five years, cash flow projections utilise a perpetuity growth 
rate of 2%.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margins, revenue growth rates and the discount rate. The gross 
margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience; revenue growth rates generally approximate to the long 
term average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a business, such as start-ups. The 
annual growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts for the next five years represent the budgeted rates for 2016 and thereafter, average growth 
rates for each Sector; these annual growth rates then reduce to 2% over the longer term. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 30 September 2015 77
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a single market derived pre-tax discount rate of ca. 12% (2014: 13%). 
This single rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses operating generally in well developed 
markets and geographies and with robust capital structures. As these features are consistent between each of the Group’s Sectors the Board 
considers that it is more appropriate to use a single discount rate applied to each Sector’s cash flow forecasts.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill in any of the Sectors was identified.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions noted above to determine whether a “reasonably possible adverse 
change” in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. The analysis indicates that a “reasonably possible adverse change” 
would not give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the three Sectors.

1 During the year, the Group spent £2.9m on constructing and fitting out a new facility in Darlington, UK for FPE Seals Limited. On completion on 23 September 2015, the facility 
was sold to a third party and leased back on a 15 year full repairing lease. No profit or loss was recorded on the sale of the facility. This expenditure has not been included as an 
addition and disposal in the above analysis.
2 During the year, £1.2m of inventory relating to hospital field equipment held in DHG in support of customer contracts was transferred from inventory to hospital field 
equipment.
Land included within freehold properties above, but which is not depreciated, is £4.2m (2014: £2.0m). Capital commitments contracted, but not 
provided, were £0. 1m (2014: £0. 1m).
Freehold properties includes ca. 150 acres of land at Stamford (“the Stamford land”) which comprises mostly farm land and former quarry land. In the 
Directors’ opinion the current value of this land at 30 September 2015 is £1.0m (2014: £1.0m), with a book value of £Nil.

No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies as the Group controls the dividend policies of its 
subsidiaries. Unremitted earnings may be liable to additional overseas withholding tax (after allowing for double taxation relief) if they were to be 
distributed as dividends. The aggregate amount for which deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings was £3.2m  
(2014: £3.0m).

19. Financial instruments
The Group’s overall management of the financial risks is carried out by a central treasury team under policies and procedures which are reviewed and 
approved by the Board. The treasury team identifies, evaluates and where appropriate, hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s 
operating businesses. The treasury team does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than a small number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and short term 
deposits, investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities. T rade and other receivables 
and trade and other payables arise directly from the Group’s day-to-day operations. 
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity , foreign currency , interest rate and capital management. An 
explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below and on page 34 within Internal 
Control and Risk Management, all of which have been audited. 
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations; 
this arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances (including deposits) held with 
financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small privately owned 
businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world. T rade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating 
units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for each customer. 
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables 
where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the provision is written off against the 
underlying receivable. During the year, the Group had an unrecoverable receivable of £0.2m; there have been no other significant trade receivables 
written off in the past five years. 
Exposure to counterparty credit risk with financial institutions is controlled by the Group treasury team which establishes and monitors counterparty 
limits. Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is “ AA” or better.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows:
  Carrying amount

£m
2014
£m
Trade receivables 44.8 41.8
Other receivables 4.0 2.6
Cash and cash equivalents 23.0 21.3
71.8 65.7
There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date. An analysis of the ageing 
and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16. An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is set 
out in note 18.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group continually monitors net cash and 
forecasts cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s requirements in the short, medium and long term. 
Additionally , compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2015 all covenants were complied with fully . 
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on deposits. 
T ypically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group also has a committed  
£40m revolving bank facility (with an option to increase its facility to £50m, subject to market pricing) which expires on 23 June 2017 . During the year 
the Group exercised the accordion option in respect of £15m and increased the committed bank facility to £40m in order to provide cash resources 
to complete an acquisition during the year. At 30 September 2015, the remaining accordion option available is £10m. Interest on this facility 
is payable at between 120 and 170bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. At 30 September 2015, £20m of the facility had 
been drawn down (2014: £Nil). 
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows:

35.8 32.2
Less: Discount (1.4) (0.9)
34.4 31.3
There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date. 
c) Currency risk
The Group’s principal currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, Canadian dollars, 
Euros and Australian dollars. The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents and these 
balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively . Net foreign exchange gains of £0.2m (2014: £0. 1m) were recognised in 
operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Group’s businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure to movements 
in the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and are stated at fair value. 
The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2015 was £25.2m (2014: £31.0m). The net fair value of forward foreign exchange 
contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2015 was £1.2m (2014: £0.3m). The amount removed from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to 
the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was a £0.3m credit (2014: negligible). The change in the fair value of cash flow 
hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the year was £1.5m (2014: £0.4m).
The currency risk arising from both translational and transactional risks are described further on page 37 within Internal Control and Risk Management.
d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Group’s results. The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its cash 
funds and borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates. All cash deposits, held in the UK and overseas, are held on a short term basis at floating 
rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate. 
Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between one and six months 
at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate. An increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a 
significant impact on the Group’s adjusted profit before tax.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents at the reporting dates is set out in note 18. 
e) Fair values
There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value. The basis for determining fair values 
are as follows:
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end forward rates, adjusted for the forward points to the contract’s value date with gains and losses 
taken to equity . No contract’s value date is greater than 18 months from the year end.
T rade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
Other liabilities
The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
f) Capital management risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide good returns to 
shareholders which will support the future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group comprises cash and cash equivalents, 
longer term debt (which includes bank borrowings) and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves 
and retained earnings.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management 
during the year. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or increase bank borrowings.

At 30 September 5.7 3.5
At 30 September 2015, the Group retained put options to acquire minority interests in TPD, Kentek and M Seals. As described in note 22, a put/call 
option was recognised during the period at a value of £3.2m (€4. 1m) in respect of the 20% minority interest in TPD, acquired on 6 October 2014. On 
19 December 2014 and following the exercise of a put option, the Group acquired 10% of the minority interest outstanding in Kentek for an initial 
consideration of £0.6m (€0.8m) with a further amount payable of £0.8m (€1.0m), which is based on the performance of the business in the year 
ended 30 September 2015. 
At 30 September 2015, the estimate of the financial liability to acquire the outstanding minority shareholdings was reassessed by the Directors, 
based on their current estimate of the future performance of these businesses and to reflect foreign exchange rates at 30 September 2015.
This led to a remeasurement of the fair value of these put options and the liability was reduced by £0. 1m (2014: reduced by £0. 1m). This reduction 
was offset by the charge from unwinding the discount on the liability and in aggregate £0.4m (2014: £Nil) has been charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 
The put options to acquire the minority interest of 20% held in TPD are exercisable in tranches between 2016 and 2019; the put option to acquire the 
minority interest of 10% held in M Seals is exercisable in October 2018 and the put option relating to the remaining Kentek 10% minority interest is 
exercisable in two tranches in 2016 and 2018. 
At 30 September 2015, deferred consideration of £0.9m included £0.8m (€1.0m) payable to the vendor of Kentek in respect of the outstanding 
amount relating to the purchase of his minority interest. In addition, £0. 1m (US$0.2m) is payable to the vendor of HPS in respect of the performance 
of the business in the year ended 30 September 2015. Both these amounts are expected to be paid within the next twelve months. During the year, 
aggregate deferred consideration of £0.6m was paid which comprised £0.3m (€0.5m) to the vendor of Kentek relating to final consideration payable 
based on the performance of the business in the year ended 31 December 2014, the final instalment of deferred consideration of £0. 1m (A$0.2m) 
was paid to the vendor of BGS and £0.2m was paid to the vendor of Specialty Fasteners & Components.

(€14.0m), including net debt at acquisition of £1.4m (€1.9m) and before acquisition expenses of £0.2m. The fair value of the 20% minority interest in 
TPD and the related put/call option of £3.2m (€4. 1m) has been calculated based on the net present value of the projected performance of the 
business in the financial years 2016 to 2019 , when the options becomes exercisable. 
On 13 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of Rutin AG, the Swiss holding company of Kubo group (“Kubo”) of companies based in Switzerland and 
Austria for consideration of £22.7m (CHF33. 1m), net of cash acquired of £4.6m (CHF6.8m) and before acquisition expenses of £0.2m. 
On 13 July 2015, the Group acquired 100% of Swan Seals (Aberdeen) Limited (“Swan”) for initial consideration of £2.4m and before acquisition 
expenses of £0. 1m.

From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2015, the newly acquired TPD business contributed £12.9m to revenue and £1.8m to adjusted 
operating profit and the newly acquired Kubo and Swan businesses contributed £11.3m to revenue and £1.3m to adjusted operating profit. If these 
businesses had been acquired at the beginning of the financial year, they would in aggregate have contributed on a pro-rata basis £34.4m to revenue 
and £4.4m to adjusted operating profit. However these amounts should not be viewed as indicative of the results of these businesses that would

The Group has a committed multi-currency £40m revolving bank facility with an accordion option to increase this facility to £50m, subject to market 
pricing. During the year the Group exercised part of the accordion option in respect of £15m and increased the committed bank facility to £40m. 
At 30 September 2015, the remaining accordion option available is £10m. This bank facility expires on 23 June 2017 . Interest on this facility is payable 
between 120 and 170bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
25. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group maintains two defined benefit pension arrangements which are accounted for under IAS19 (Revised) “Employee Benefits” . The principal 
arrangement is the defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, maintained by Diploma Holdings PLC and called the Diploma Holdings PLC UK 
Pension Scheme (“the Scheme”). This Scheme provides benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, leaving service or death 
and has been closed to further accrual since 5 April 2000. 
The second and smaller defined benefit pension arrangement is operated by Kubo in Switzerland and provides benefits on retirement, leaving 
service or death for the employees of Kubo in accordance with Swiss law. Kubo was acquired by the Group on 13 March 2015.

Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme
The Scheme is subject to a Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004 which requires that a valuation of the Scheme is carried out at 
least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met. As part of the process the Company must agree with 
the trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective. The most recent triennial 
actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013 reported that the Scheme had a funding deficit of £2.7m and held assets which covered 90% 
of its liabilities at that date. There were no Scheme amendments, curtailments or settlements during the year.
The Scheme is managed by a set of T rustees appointed in part by the Company and in part from elections by members of the Scheme. The T rustees 
have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Scheme’s assets. The T rustees delegate 
some of these functions to their professional advisors where appropriate. 
The Scheme exposes the Company and therefore the Group, to a number of risks:
• Investment risk. The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are 
expected to provide real returns over the long term, volatility over the short term can cause additional funding to be required if a deficit emerges.
• Interest rate risk. The Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities. As the 
Scheme’s assets include equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way .
• Inflation risk. A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. The Scheme’s assets are expected to provide a 
good hedge against inflation over the long term, however movements over the short term could lead to funding deficits emerging.
• Mortality risk. In the event that members live longer than assumed, a larger funding deficit may emerge in the Scheme.

Risk mitigation strategies
When setting the investment strategy for the Scheme, the T rustees, in conjunction with the employer, take into account the liability profile of the 
Scheme. The current strategy is designed to broadly match assets and liabilities in respect of pensioner members, but to invest in growth assets 
in respect of non-pensioners. Annuity policies have been taken out in respect of some historic pensioners, but the Scheme has not purchased 
annuities for new retirements since 2005.
Effect of the Scheme on the Group’s future cash flows
The Company is required to agree a schedule of contributions with the T rustees of the Scheme following each triennial actuarial valuation. Following 
the triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013, the Company agreed to contribute £0.3m in cash annually to the Scheme. 
The next valuation of the Scheme is due at 30 September 2016.
The Kubo Pension Scheme (“the Kubo Scheme”)
In accordance with Swiss law, Kubo’s pension benefits are contribution based with the level of benefits varying according to category of 
employment. Swiss law requires certain guarantees to be provided on such pension benefits. Kubo finances its Swiss pension benefits through 
the Axa Stiftung Berufliche Vorsorge, a pension fund which administers the pension plans of various unrelated employers and reinsures the 
risks associated with providing guarantees with Axa Winterthur. Despite the existence of this insurance, IFRS requires such pension schemes in 
Switzerland to be accounted for as defined pension arrangements, primarily because the insurer has some ability to vary premiums and to decline 
to continue to provide cover in the future.

29. Subsequent events
On 12 October 2015 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of West Coast Industrial Supplies Pty Limited based in Perth Australia and its affiliate 
company , West Coast Industrial Supplies New Caledonia SAS based near Noumea in New Caledonia (together “WCIS” ) for an aggregate maximum 
consideration of £9 .8m (A$20.5m). The initial cash paid on acquisition was £8.5m (A$17 .6m) but is subject to further adjustment for actual net assets at 
completion. Deferred consideration is also payable based on the performance of WCIS over the next twelve months and on the renewal of specific 
customer contracts. The WCIS businesses are established suppliers of gaskets, seals and associated products and services with a focus on the mining 
and power generation markets. A review to determine fair values of the net assets acquired will be completed during the next financial year . 90
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied in 2015 and the 
comparative year. 
There were no new Standards, amendments or interpretations to existing Standards which have been published and endorsed by the EU and which
have a significant impact on the results, financial position or presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 
2015.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments which 
are held at fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed on pages 66 to 67 .
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). 
Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary , adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed 
herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Non-controlling interests, defined as minority interests, in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s 
equity therein. Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority’s share 
of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
1.3 Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
Goodwill at the acquisition date represents the cost of the business combination (excluding acquisition related costs, which are expensed as 
incurred) plus the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment. Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Minority interests may be initially measured at fair value or, alternatively , at the minority interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of 
the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made for each business combination separately .
1.4 Divestments
The results and cash flows of major lines of businesses that have been divested have been classified as discontinued businesses.
1.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services supplied to customers, after deducting 
sales allowances and value added taxes; revenue receivable for services supplied to customers, as opposed to goods, is less than 3% of Group 
revenue. Revenue is recognised when the risk and rewards of ownership transfers to the customer, which depending on individual customer terms, 
is at the time of despatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. Provision is made for returns where appropriate. Service revenue received 
in advance is deferred and recognised on a pro rata basis over the period of the contract.
1.6 Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type. The defined benefit scheme is closed to 
the accrual of further benefits.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans: Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution schemes are recognised as an employee benefit expense 
when they fall due.
(b) Defined benefit pension plan: The deficit recognised in the balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit cost method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality 
corporate bonds. The pension expense for the Group’s defined benefit plan is recognised as follows:
(i) Within the Consolidated Income Statement:
 – Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments – where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised in 
operating profit;
 – Interest cost on the net deficit in the scheme – calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability at the start of the 
annual reporting period.
(ii) Within the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income:
 – Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the scheme arising from actual experience and any changes in assumptions at 
the end of the year.
Group Accounting Policies
For the year ended 30 September 2015 91
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
 The Group has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit scheme in the period in which they occur, 
outside the Consolidated Income Statement, but in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.
(c) Share-based payments
 The Executive Directors of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby the Directors 
render services in exchange for shares in the Company , or rights over shares (“equity-settled” transactions).
 Equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of 
market based measures, such as the T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR”) targets upon which vesting of part of the award is conditional, and is expensed to 
the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight -line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity . The cumulative expense 
recognised is adjusted to take account of shares forfeited by Executives who leave during the performance or vesting period and, in the case of 
non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely that shares will vest. For the market based measure, the Directors have used a 
predicted future value model to determine fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
 The Group operates an Employee Benefit T rust for the granting of shares to Executives. The cost of shares in the Company purchased by the 
Employee Benefit T rust are shown as a deduction from equity .
1.7 Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency , which is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity 
are translated into UK sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency:
 T ransactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the 
settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement;
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated; and
(iii) Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are retranslated using the exchange rates at the date the fair value was 
determined. Where a gain or loss on non-monetary items is recognised directly in equity , any exchange component of that gain or loss is also 
recognised directly in equity and conversely , where a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(b) T ranslation from functional currency to presentational currency:
 When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency , its results and financial position are 
translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such an average rate does not 
approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used; and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income; these 
cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the foreign operation is 
disposed of.
(c) Net investment in foreign operations:
 Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the foreign operation as appropriate. In the 
consolidated financial statements such exchange differences are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other 
Comprehensive Income as a separate component of equity and subsequently recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of 
the net investment.
1.8 T axation
The tax expense relates to the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, which differs from profit before taxation as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
T axable profit excludes items of income and expense that are taxable (or deductible) in other years and also excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is calculated using rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. T emporary differences arise primarily from the recognition of the 
deficit on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the difference between accelerated capital allowances and depreciation and for short term 
timing differences where a provision held against receivables or inventory is not deductible for taxation purposes. However, deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit, nor the accounting profit.
1.6 Employee benefits continued 92
Deferred tax liabilities are also recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able 
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is possible that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. No 
deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when the item on which the tax or charge is credited or charged directly to 
equity , in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity . The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered. 
T ax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to enforce current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the 
deferred income tax relates to the same fiscal authority .
1.9 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property , plant and equipment are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset 
into use, but excluding interest. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in 
which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property , plant and equipment begins when the asset is 
available for use and is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost, less residual value of the 
asset, over its estimated useful life as follows:
Freehold property – between 20 and 50 years 
Leasehold property – term of the lease
Plant and equipment – plant and machinery between 3 and 7 years
– IT hardware between 3 and 5 years
– fixtures and fittings between 5 and 15 years
Hospital field equipment – five years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial year 
end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over 
the term of the relevant lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying 
amount and are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1.10 Intangible assets
All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at their amortised cost or fair value less any provision for 
impairment.
(a) Research and development costs
 Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development costs are written off as incurred until it can be demonstrated that the conditions for 
capitalisation as described in IAS38 “Intangible Assets” are met; at which point further costs are capitalised as intangible assets up until the intangible 
asset is readily available for production and amortised on a straight -line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life.
 Costs are capitalised as intangible assets unless physical assets, such as tooling, exist when they are classified as property , plant and equipment.
(b) Computer software costs
 Where computer software is not integral to an item of property , plant or equipment its costs are capitalised as other intangible assets. 
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life of between three and seven years.
(c) Acquired intangible assets – business combinations
 Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, including, but not limited to, customer lists, supplier lists, databases, 
technology and software and patents and that can be separately measured at fair value, on a reliable basis, are separately recognised on 
acquisition at the fair value, together with the associated deferred tax liability . Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis to the Consolidated 
Income Statement over the expected useful economic lives.
 Fair values on larger acquisitions are assessed as follows; customer and supplier relationships are valued using a discounted cash flow model; 
databases are valued using a replacement cost model. For smaller acquisitions, intangible assets are assessed using historical experience of 
similar transactions.
(d) Goodwill – business combinations
 Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration over the aggregate fair 
value of the identifiable intangible, tangible and current assets and net of the aggregate fair value of the liabilities (including contingent liabilities of 
businesses acquired at the date of acquisition). Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Impairment testing is carried out annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions is not amortised.

Group Accounting Policies continued
For the year ended 30 September 2015 93
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
1.11 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value in use; its value in use is 
the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit. Impairment losses 
are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(a) Impairment of goodwill
 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to a cash-generating unit; cash-generating units for this purpose are the Group’s three 
Sectors which represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored by the Group’s Board of Directors for internal and 
management purposes. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually , or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
 If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the goodwill attributable to the cash-generating unit.
 An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
(b) Impairment of other tangible and intangible assets
 At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent, if any , of the impairment loss. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash inflows. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
 Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss for tangible and intangible 
assets other than goodwill is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1.12 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (generally calculated on a weighted average cost basis) and net realisable value, after making due 
allowance for any obsolete or slow moving inventory . Cost comprises direct materials, duty and freight-in costs.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
1.13 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
(a) T rade receivables
 T rade receivables are initially measured at fair value, do not carry any interest and are reduced by a charge for impairment for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Such impairment charges are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(b) T rade payables
 T rade payables are non-interest bearing and are initially measured at their fair value.
(c)  Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, interest bearing deposits, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and can form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
(d) Put options held by minority interests
 The purchase price of shares to be acquired under options held by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries are calculated by reference to the 
estimated profitability of the relevant subsidiary at the time of exercise, using a multiple based formula. The net present value of the estimated future 
payments under these put options is shown as a financial liability . The corresponding entry is recognised in equity as a deduction against retained 
earnings. At the end of each year , the estimate of the financial liability is reassessed and any change in value is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, as part of finance income or expense. Where the liability is in a foreign currency , any change in the value of the liability resulting from 
changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
(e)  Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
 The Group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the effects of its exposures to 
fluctuations in foreign exchange arising from operational and financial activities. In accordance with its treasury policy , the Group does not hold or 
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is their market price at the 
balance sheet date. 94
 Under IAS39 , hedging relationships are categorised by type and must meet strict criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. At the inception of 
the transaction the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The Group uses cash flow hedges (e.g. forward foreign exchange currency 
contracts) to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction.
 In relation to cash flow hedges, to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other 
Comprehensive Income and the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. For cash flow hedges that do not result 
in the recognition of an asset or a liability , the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement 
in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is kept in 
equity until the hedged transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year.
 The Group does not use financial instruments to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities that are 
attributable to a particular risk and could affect the Consolidated Income Statement (fair value hedges). No financial instruments are used to hedge 
net investments in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).
1.14 Investments (available for sale financial assets)
The investment held by the Group comprises equity shares which are not held for the purposes of equity trading and in accordance with IAS39 is 
classified as available for sale. They are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes 
therein are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income.
1.15 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
Leases include hire purchase contracts which have characteristics similar to finance or operating leases. All other leases are classified as operating 
leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the 
expected lease term.
1.16 Other liabilities
Other liabilities are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is possible that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Other liabilities are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at 
the balance sheet date. 
1.17 Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the AGM; interim dividends are charged in the period they are paid.
1.18 Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares are classified as equity . Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of 
tax, from the proceeds. The Group also maintains the following reserves:
(a) T ranslation reserve – The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign businesses.
(b) Hedging reserve – The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging 
instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge. 
(c) Retained earnings reserve – The retained earnings reserve comprises total cumulative recognised income and expense attributable to 
shareholders. Bonus issues of share capital and dividends to shareholders are also charged directly to this reserve. In addition the cost of 
acquiring shares in the Company and the liability to provide those shares to employees, is accounted for in this reserve. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury shares or indirectly within 
an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or 
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in 
equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. These shares are used to satisfy share awards granted to Directors under the Group’s share 
schemes. The trustee purchases the Company’s shares on the open market using loans made by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company .

1.19 Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective
The IASB has published a number of new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards which are not yet effective, but will be 
mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2015. Set out below are those which are considered most relevant to 
the Group:
• IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”: comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is 
recognised. IFRS 15 is effective for the Group for the year ended 30 September 2019 . The Group is assessing the potential impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
The following new or amended Standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements:
• IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
• IFRS 10/11/12 “Consolidated Financial Statements” , “Joint Arrangements” and “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities”
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011–2013 Cycle
1.20 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In order to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 1. 1 to 1. 19 above, management 
has used estimates and judgements to establish the amounts at which certain items are recorded. Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
are those which have the greatest impact on the financial statements and require the most difficult and subjective judgements about matters that 
are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that management believe 
to be reasonable. However given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be different from the assumptions used. The critical 
accounting estimates and judgements are set out below:
1.20.1 Goodwill impairment
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future 
periods. T o assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment of the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill, using 
discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the “value in use” to the Group of the capitalised goodwill. This calculation is usually based on projecting 
future cash flows over a five year period and using a perpetuity to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter. A discount factor is applied to 
obtain a current value (“value in use”). The “fair value less costs to sell” of an asset is used if this results in an amount in excess of “value in use” .
Estimated future cash flows for impairment calculations are based on management’s expectations of future volumes and margins based on plans 
and best estimates of the productivity of the assets in their current condition. Future cash flows therefore exclude benefits from major expansion 
projects requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure has not been approved at the balance sheet date.
Future cash flows are discounted using discount rates based on a market derived weighted average cost of capital, adjusted if appropriate for 
circumstances specific to the asset being tested. The weighted average cost of capital is impacted by estimates of interest rates and equity returns 
and is reviewed on an annual basis.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s businesses for this 
purpose. Changes to the assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors’ assessment of the 
carrying value of goodwill.
1.20.2 T axation
The Group operates in a number of tax jurisdictions around the world. T ax regulations generally are complex and in some jurisdictions agreeing tax 
liabilities with local tax authorities can take several years. Consequently , at the balance sheet date tax liabilities and assets are based on 
management’s best estimate of the future amounts that will be settled. While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded are accurate, 
the actual amounts could be different from those expected.
Deferred tax assets mainly represent timing differences that the Group expects to recover at some time in the future and by their nature, the 
amounts recorded are therefore dependent on management’s judgement about future events. Account has also been taken of future forecasts of 
taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these deferred tax assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or 
there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the timing difference might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax asset will 
need to be revised in a future period.
1.20.3 Inventory and trade receivable provisions
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working capital, principally 
inventory and trade receivables. Impairment charges are made against obsolete or slow-moving inventories, bad or doubtful receivables.
The decision to make an impairment charge is based on the facts available at the time the consolidated financial statements are approved and are 
also determined by using profiles, based on past practice, applied to certain aged inventory and trade receivables categories. In estimating the 
collectability of trade receivables, judgement is required in assessing their likely realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
and related ageing of the past due balances. Specific accounts are assessed in situations where a customer may not be able to meet its financial 
obligations due to deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy .
1.20.4 Future purchases of minority interests
The Group’s financial statements include a financial liability for the net present value of the expected amount that it will pay in future years to acquire 
the outstanding shares held by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries. This amount is based on the Directors’ estimate of the future 
profitability of the relevant subsidiary and the assumption that year end exchange rates will remain consistent until the exercise of the option. Any 
changes to the estimated profitability of the relevant business and/or changes to the assumption of the relevant exchange rate, will change the 
estimate of this financial liability . 96

a) Accounting policies
a.1 Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed on pages 66 to 67 , under the historical cost convention in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK Accounting Standards. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, 
no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company . The Company’s profit after tax for the year was £23.9m (2014: £20.3m).
a.2 Investments and dividends
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Dividend income is recognised when received. Final dividend distributions are 
recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.
a.3 Employment Benefit T rust and employee share schemes
Shares held by the Diploma Employee Benefit T rust (“the T rust”) are stated at cost and accounted for as a deduction from shareholders’ funds in 
accordance with UITF 38. Shares that are held by the T rust are not eligible for dividends until such time as the awards have vested and options have 
been exercised by the participants.
a.4 Cash flow statement
The Company is exempt from the requirements of FRS1 (revised) to include a cash flow statement as part of its Company financial statements 
because the Group prepares a Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, as part of the consolidated financial statements.
a.5 Related parties
The Company has taken advantage of paragraph 3(c ) of FRS8 (“Related Party Disclosures”) not to disclose transactions with Group entities or other 
interests of the Group which qualify as related parties. There were related party transactions with the pension trustees of the Diploma Holdings PLC 
UK Pension Scheme, referred to in note 25.
a.6 Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to the auditor for the audit of the Company’s accounts of £3,500 (2014: £3,500) were borne by a fellow Group undertaking.
b) Directors’ and employees’ remuneration
No remuneration is paid directly by the Company; information on the Directors’ remuneration (which is paid by an immediate holding company) 
and their interests in the share capital of the Company are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 52 to 65. The Company had 
no employees (2014: none).

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 September 2015 98
Opinion on financial statements of Diploma PLC
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2015 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the related notes 
1 to 29 and the Group Accounting policies. This also comprises the Parent 
Company Balance Sheet, the Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders’ 
Funds and its related notes (a) to (d) and the Parent Company Accounting 
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that 
would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the company
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement on pages 66 and 67 that the Group is a going concern. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 34 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 35 to 37 that describe those risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated;
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Carrying value of goodwill
The key assumptions used in the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
are determined with reference to judgemental factors such as projected cash 
flows and the appropriate discount rate. As at the year-end the Group held an 
aggregate of £89.3 million of goodwill (2014: £80.2 million). Refer to note 10 for 
details of these balances.
We assessed the assumptions used in the impairment model, specifically 
including the cash flow projections, cash-generating unit allocation, 
discount rates, perpetuity growth rates and the sensitivities applied. Our 
procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with reference to 
historical trading performance and consulting with our valuation specialists 
who benchmarked assumptions such as the discount rate to external 
macro-economic and market data.
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that either 
individually or collectively would be required for the assets to be impaired 
by performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions, we considered 
the likelihood of such a movement in those assumptions arising and the 
adequacy of the disclosures within the financial statements.
Accounting for acquisitions 
There is a risk that the acquisition accounting for the businesses acquired in the 
year, as set out in note 22, has not been correctly applied. Specifically, there is a 
risk that incorrect judgements are made which results in inaccurate valuations 
of intangible assets.
There is also a risk the valuation of any liability for future purchases of minority 
interests, as set out in note 20, is incorrectly recorded.
We have challenged the key assumptions made by management in 
accounting for the acquisitions. Specifically, we have reviewed the 
discount, tax and growth rates and in doing so we involved our own 
valuation specialists to assist us in our assessment.
We have also re-calculated the liability of future purchases of minority 
interests and agreed this back to supporting forecasts. 
• the Directors’ statement in the Directors’ Report about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to 
the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the Director’s explanation on page 34 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the 
company and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided 
any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that 
had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in 
the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Diploma PLC 99
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. We determined materiality for the Group 
to be £2.7 million (2014: £2.5 million), which is approximately 5% of profit 
before tax (2014: 5%).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £53,000 (2014: £50,000), as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Audit of all components are performed at a materiality level not exceeding 
50% of Group materiality.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and 
its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we 
focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 11 (2014: 8) 
locations. Each of these 11 locations was subject to a full scope audit. An 
additional 8 (2014: 6) locations were subject to specified audit procedures which 
address each of the significant balances and significant risks within these 
entities. T ogether the work at these locations represents the principal business 
units of the Group and accounts for 75% (2014: 71%) of the Group’s revenues 
and 80% (2014: 78%) of the Group’s operating profit.
The Group audit team has designed and implemented a country visit 
programme to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior 
member of the Group audit team visits the component locations to hold 
discussions with the lead partner, review their working papers, conclude on 
any findings and attend close out meetings with local management. Each year 
this programme of visits includes the three most significant territories (being 
the US, Canada and UK).
Where no visits are carried out the Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior 
member of the team has held discussions with the lead partner and attended 
close out meetings by phone.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial 
information of the remaining components not subject to audit or specified 
audit procedures. 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Valuation of inventory including appropriateness of judgements applied 
within the obsolescence provision
Management judgement is required in determining the completeness of the 
inventory provisions and making an assessment of its adequacy, considering 
the age and volumes relative to expected usage. At the year-end the Group 
held inventories of £56.6 million net of impairment provisions of £5.9 million 
provision (2014: £54.1 million net of impairment provisions of 5.3 million 
provision). Refer to note 15 for details of these balances.
We evaluated the recorded provision, specifically checking those relevant 
inventory lines to assess whether they have been aged correctly and the 
appropriate provision percentage has been applied. We have assessed the 
net realisable value of inventory and challenged management’s 
assumptions with regards to the completeness of the inventory provisions 
and made an assessment of its adequacy, considering the age and 
volumes relative to expected usage. We also compared the actual sales 
value of a sample of inventory items to their book value to ascertain that 
the carrying value of inventories does not exceed their net realisable value.
The recoverability of trade receivables and appropriateness of the bad  
debt provision 
Management judgement is required in determining the completeness of  
the trade receivables provision and making an assessment of its adequacy, 
considering the expected recoverability of the year end receivables. At the 
year-end the Group held trade receivables of £44.8 million net of impairment 
provisions of £0.6 million (2014: £41.8 million net of impairment provisions of 
£0.5 million). Refer to note 16 for details of these balances.
We have challenged management’s assumptions in calculating the bad 
debt provision, including reviewing the ageing of receivables in comparison 
to previous years, reviewing the level of bad debt write-offs in the current 
year and against the prior year and checking the recoverability of 
outstanding receivables through examination of subsequent cash receipts.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 49.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made 
or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to 
report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with eleven provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have 
nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if,
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ Statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified 
any such inconsistencies or misleading statements. 100
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on 
Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim 
to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are either required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

company overview
Rentokil Initial is one of the largest business services companies in the 
world, with some 93,000 employees, providing a range of support services. 
Our business operates in four markets: Hygiene, Security, Facilities
Management and Parcels Delivery.
The brands of ‘Rentokil’ and ‘Initial’ represent consistent quality of service
across more than 40 countries, including the major economies in Europe, North
America, Asia Pacific and Africa.
Hygiene
20,000 Employees
Security
26,000 Employees or increasingly a mix of both, which is tailored to meet their
individual needs.
Facilities Management
Facilities Management Services Cleaning, catering and
hospital services are provided as stand-alone contracts but also
create the platform from which multi-service contracts are
provided offering one point of customer contact. Any number of
Rentokil Initial services can be incorporated within a contract
using our own specialist management services.
Tropical Plants Offered to customers on a rental and
maintenance or purchase and maintenance basis, they range from
a single plant or tree to displays for the largest atrium. Our specialist
in-house design and development team also offers a range of
services to facilities managers, interior designers and architects, to
introduce plants as an integral part of building design and
refurbishment to meet the changing needs in interior environments.
Conferencing Our UK network of 28 specialised education and
training centres meets the needs of corporate and public sector
customers. These centres provide specialist meeting facilities,
residential accommodation, hot desks and internet cafés,
together with leisure and recreational amenities.
Parcels Delivery
As the UK’s premium express service, specific deadlines or any
time next day deliveries can be met. Fully integrated despatch
processes provide significant performance benefits to any
customer, large or small.
Hygiene
Hygiene Services provide a total washroom solutions service,
floor mat, garment and flat linen rental services. The washroom
solutions range includes air fresheners, sanitizers, feminine
hygiene units and hot air hand dryers, as well as dispensers and
consumables for soap, paper towels and linen roller towels. Floor
mats, some of which include branding and health and safety
statements, are supplied to a wide client base. Bespoke workwear
and uniforms are manufactured and supplied to commercial and
industrial customers and the hospitality sector, with full inventory
management increasingly provided to give additional benefits to
customers. Specialist high-performance workwear for sectors such
as the medical, hi-tech and emergency services, is also designed
and manufactured to meet stringent performance standards. Flat
linen (primarily table and bedroom linen) is rented and laundered
for corporate and hospitality customers and health service
providers. 
Pest Control provides a service for the control of pests, primarily
in the workplace. Special emphasis is placed on health, safety and
protection of the environment. Our research and development
provides effective and innovative solutions for pest control, which
together with improved working practices, set higher standards of
operational effectiveness and environmental care for the customer.
Security
Effective security solutions are provided to meet customers’ needs
for personal safety and protection of property. These are met
through both the application of advanced technologies and well
trained security officers. We provide security solutions for our
customers using either electronic security or manned guarding,

Results
In summary, underlying trading was broadly in line with market
expectations. Turnover from continuing operations increased
6.9% to £2,471.1 million; profit before tax increased 4.7% to
£408.5 million, before charging £11.7 million as an exceptional
loss on disposal of businesses and earnings per share, adjusted for
this exceptional loss, were up 9.8% to 16.47p, with basic earnings
per share up 5.5% to 15.83p. Operating cash flow was excellent
at £269.3 million. Net debt was £52.5 million lower than 2002 at
£1,207.9 million, notwithstanding the effect of £23.1 million of
adverse foreign exchange adjustments and £90.7 million arising
from a net outflow of funds from share buy-backs, acquisitions
and disposals.
Dividend
The board is recommending a final dividend of 4.35p per share,
giving a full year dividend of 6.10p per share, an increase of
10.3% over 2002. The board is planning for an increase in the
dividend per share in 2004 of at least 10%.
Strategy and markets
The company’s vision statement is set out on page 14 in the chief
executive’s review. The words are new but they enunciate a set of
principles which have guided Rentokil Initial for many years. The
company already occupies a leading position in the business
services sector, offering hygiene, safety and security solutions.
However, the markets we serve provide us with a wealth of
opportunities for growth. Increasing economic prosperity in most
markets around the world is bringing with it ever increasing
demands for consistent and high standards of hygiene, safety and
security. Growing public concern over these issues, fuelled by ever
increasing regulation, gives the company an opportunity 
which it fully intends to develop.
Strong distinctive branding assists in reinforcing our competitive
edge. We have the benefit of two well-established brands,
‘Rentokil’ and ‘Initial’, which we believe are symbols of 
consistent quality and so differentiate our services from those 
of our competitors.
We do not forget that our customers, wherever they may be,
have the right to expect consistent quality standards at a fair 
price from a world-leading business services company. We have
the network and reach that allows us to be the premium quality
supplier of business services in the great majority of the world’s
developed economies. With the imminent enlargement of the
European Union and the growing prosperity across Europe, we
are confident that there will be an increasing demand for higher
standards and sophistication in hygiene, safety and security 
which will provide us with many opportunities for developing 
our activities.
Equally importantly, we have a great opportunity to further
develop our position within countries in which we already
operate. We expect to achieve this by increasing our market
shares for existing services through organic growth and bolt-
on acquisitions, using our widespread experience in developing
business services across many countries.
Corporate governance and corporate social responsibility
Since I became chairman in 2002, the board has been
strengthened further by the appointments of Peter Long and 
Paul Mason in 2002 and 2003 respectively. 
2003 saw the introduction of the new Combined Code, following
a long period of review and discussion, prompted mainly by the
failure of corporate governance in companies, particularly in the
United States. The new Combined Code has introduced a number
of improvements to an already generally robust system of
governance in the UK. I am pleased to say that your board has
put in hand changes (including reorganisation of procedures and
terms of reference of board committees) to ensure compliance
with the new Code. More information on corporate governance 
is set out in the report of the directors.
We continue to make good progress in developing and
implementing practices and procedures in relation to corporate
social responsibility, which support the policies which have been
publicly adopted by the board. More information on corporate
social responsibility may be found in the report of the directors.
Chairman’s Statement
2003 has been a year of change for the company with James Wilde succeeding me as chief executive at the beginning
of the year and his subsequent restructuring of the management of the company into four service sectors. He will
comment in detail in his review on the company’s performance in 2003. RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC  5
People
On behalf of the board I would like to pay tribute to the efforts
of all our 93,000 employees. We have always considered our
people to be the cornerstone on which we rely to maintain the
high quality of service on which our reputation is based. Rentokil
Initial has always been a company in which success is recognised
and in which advancement follows achievement. To that end, we
maintain high standards of training and career opportunities.
Prospects
Organic turnover growth is the prime requirement for profitable
growth and, to that end, the company is maintaining investment
in additional sales management and sales staff, where
appropriate, and introducing further technological developments
to improve the productivity and quality of our services. The main
emphasis on development will be concentrated on Hygiene and
Security within continental Europe.
The company is aiming for good growth in turnover in 2004
although it is likely that margins will be adversely affected by
pricing levels of net new business gains, the faster growth in our
lower margin businesses and the investments referred to above. 
As a result of the initiatives already taken and those planned for
2004, the company should benefit from a strong performance in
2005 and beyond, reflecting an improving turnover growth rate,
especially in the company’s higher margin businesses.
Sir Clive Thompson

Acquisitions 
Seven bolt-on acquisitions were made in 2003 in Hygiene and
Security and, in addition, we entered both the North American 
and Belgian electronic security markets with one acquisition in
each. The total cost for the nine acquisitions (with aggregate
annualised turnover of circa £35 million) was £22.2 million; these
contributed £20.9 million to 2003 turnover and £1.3 million to
profit before tax. 
Disposals
The net loss on the previously reported sale of the Belgian 
cash-in-transit business and the recent sale of four small
businesses within Facilities Management (which together had
annualised turnover of circa £15 million) was £0.2 million. In
addition, a review of the deferred consideration due from the
disposal of businesses in 2000 has led to a charge of £11.5 million,
to give a total exceptional loss of £11.7 million.
2003 Results
In 2003, Rentokil Initial increased its turnover from continuing
operations by 6.9% to £2,471.1 million, and by 4.8% at constant
2003 average exchange rates. Profit before tax and before the
£11.7 million exceptional loss on disposal of businesses increased
by 4.7% to £408.5 million, and by 0.9% at constant 2003 average
exchange rates. Earnings per share, adjusted for the exceptional
loss, increased 9.8% to 16.47p with basic earnings per share up
5.5% to 15.83p. 
Profit before tax, after £11.7 million loss on the disposal of
businesses, increased by 1.7% to £396.8 million and reduced by
2.0% at constant 2003 average exchange rates. Operating cash
flow was excellent at £269.3 million, up 10.8% on 2002.
Segmentally, there were strong performances in Security and
Parcels Delivery. 
The sector performances are described on pages 8 to 13 and the
geographic performance is summarised on page 7. These refer 
to continuing operations and are at constant 2003 average
exchange rates.
Management
With the company having operations in more than 40 countries,
employees benefit from the company’s philosophy of developing
the skills of management through experience in several different
services. Today this experience is a pre-requisite for promotion to
senior levels of management. This philosophy has created an
environment in which our managers can be moved effectively
between the company’s businesses around the world, broadening
their skills and reinforcing the Rentokil Initial culture.
The company executive board comprises myself, the finance
director, the four sector managing directors and the company
secretary. Each sector managing director is supported by a 
sector finance director and each business is run by a dedicated
management team. Central services are provided for finance,
legal, corporate affairs, management development, research 
and development, acquisitions and procurement.
I am pleased to report on the results for 2003, my first year as chief executive. The new sector structure which I put 
in place at the start of the year is now fully established and is providing the platform for a more customer-facing
approach to sales and service delivery.

the turnaround has been slower than expected, the new

major initiatives, which are expected to lead to an increase in 
the annualised value of contracts towards the end of 2004.

to provide services which keep washrooms

large clients who have many sites across the UK. This new sales
effort was supported by the launch in September of an updated
washroom products range, bringing a fresher, standardised look.
Pest Control turnover was up by 1.8% at £224.4 million and
operating profit up by 2.5% at £84.8 million. UK turnover was up
1.7% at £70.0 million and continental Europe was up by 2.5% at
£106.0 million with encouraging performances in most countries.
Asia Pacific and Africa turnover reduced by 0.6% to £32.8 million
whilst North America turnover was up by 1.8% at £15.6 million.
During the year, Hygiene won several important contracts. 
UK Hygiene Services was appointed by the NHS Logistics
Authority to manage and supply all of its uniform requirements
nationally for the next three years. This exclusive deal will see us
supply garments to 1,124 wearers. In the US, Pest Control won
significant contracts during the year with Rite – Aid Drug stores,
Saddle Creek Corporation and the US Naval Academy in Annapolis.
In Asia, Baxter Singapore named Pest Control its Supplier of the
Year and presented it with a long service award to mark 20 years
of excellent partnership. Our focus on managing health and
safety was recognised by the Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents in the UK, with Gold Awards going to Textile
Services and Pest Control.  RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC   9
“a focus on 
managing health
and safety”
Initial Textile Services have, to date, supplied
23,000 bespoke garments for Kwik Fit to 4,000
wearers in 350 locations.
Initial wear4work supply over 500
wearers, in three police forces, with
riot suits. These are manufactured in
flame retardant, petrol repellent
kermal viscose fabric and designed
specifically to protect front line
officers, when doing their job in
dangerous situations.
Research indicates that the most
important requirements of washroom
facilities are cleanliness and a fresh,
pleasant atmosphere. An unpleasant
odour rightly gives the impression of
an unhygienic washroom.
The company’s in-house development
team has designed a new airfresh
system. It gives effective and
consistent perfume levels, is
environmentally friendly through 
its use of solar energy and can
recognise usage patterns.
Rentokil Pest Control’s responsible
approach to product safety and
environmental management has
resulted in the development of the
RADAR mouse control unit. Using
patented technology to trap a mouse,
the unit humanely despatches it with
carbon dioxide, then signals that it
needs servicing. RADAR offers
customers a replacement of traditional 
anti-coagulant baits. Chief Executive’s Review
Security turnover was up 7.2% at £584.0 million with operating profit up by 9.4% to £58.1 million, the margins
improving in both electronic and guarding. Continental Europe turnover was up 3.9% at £135.3 million, with strong
performances in Belgium and France. North America had an excellent performance with turnover up by 16.6% at
£179.4 million from a combination of strong growth in guarding contracts, additional demand for temporary services,
and a useful contribution coming from acquisitions made during the year. UK turnover was up by 3.4% at 
£269.3 million, which was a good result within a competitive market, where impending legislative changes will be, 
in the long term, to the benefit of our business.
Security
Margin improvement in electronic and guarding
“North America
had an excellent
performance”
There were many highlights within Security during 2003. Notably,
in the UK, we opened both our new communications centre in
Milton Keynes and our alarm receiving centre in Burnley (see
opposite page). We also signed a deal with American Express 
to secure its five UK sites including its European headquarters 
in Brighton. We won contracts with Volkswagen, to provide
security and fire services for the whole of its production facility 
in Belgium, and with AXA, for the monitoring of alarms at all 
of its branches throughout the country. In the USA, we won a 
three-year contract with Southwestern Bell Communications,
worth $5m in annual contract value, to provide security services
at 37 locations in five states. Finally, our business 
in the UK was awarded two medals by the National Security
Inspectorate under its Gold scheme; one for Quality Management
under ISO9001:2000 and for compliance with BS7499, BS7858 
and BS7984, and the other for health and safety at work in
compliance with UK health and safety legislation and with
OHSAS 18001/1999. 
It is increasingly important to business and
the community that there is a safe and
secure environment. Our role in providing
that safety and security is constantly
evolving, as we continue to invest both in
our people and our systems in the pursuit of
excellence. RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC  11
Our new alarm receiving centre monitors 100,000 sites
across the UK, day and night, using software developed 
by our own specialists. 
With a team of over 100 staff, we operate the service
around the clock, 365 days a year. Staff at the centre can
control CCTV cameras, listen to live audio from on-site
microphones and monitor fire and intruder alarms using
high speed technologies.
Initial’s customers can use a secure internet connection 
to log on to the network to view and report on alarm
management data for their own sites around the UK.
Visual surveillance is now at the heart of security
solutions as personal and property security become
increasingly important.

Indoor plant specialist, UK Rentokil Tropical
Plants, was successful at this summer’s most
celebrated horticultural shows picking up
three Royal Horticultural Awards; two 
Gold Medals and one Silver Gilt.
The company’s exotic display of palms from

and the BBC Gardeners World and the Silver Gilt at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Initial Retail Cleaning provides cleaning services on the 
high street and in shopping centres to many of the 
biggest names in retailing.
New methods of operation include the introduction of

manufacturers, special equipment is developed, including
unmanned robotic cleaning machines for large floor areas. 
Total Facilities Management turnover grew by 3.6% to £691.4 million, although operating profit reduced by 
5.8% to £79.4 million.
Catering Services in the UK, was awarded a five-year contract,
potentially worth £12.5 million, by BNFL to provide catering
services to its plant in Sellafield, England. Tropical Plants scooped a
two-year contract to look after over 1,000 varieties of exotic plants
at Manchester Airport, in the UK. UK Tropical Plants also did well
on the awards front, picking up the Gold Medals at Hampton
Court Flower Show and BBC Gardeners World and the Silver Gilt at
the Chelsea Flower Show. In health and safety management, the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents gave Gold Awards to
Management Services, Hospital
Services, Cleaning and Environmental
Services.
Facilities Management Services turnover grew by 4.5% to 
£493.0 million, with operating profit reduced by 4.7% to 
£35.2 million. The UK had good growth in turnover but 
operating profit showed a small decline due to lower margins 
on the net new business wins. A poor performance in North
America, including the loss of some large cleaning contracts,
adversely impacted both turnover and operating profit.
Tropical Plants turnover fell by 4.4% to £112.6 million and
operating profit by 13.6% to £17.8 million, with the level of
seasonal activities contributing less than expected. North America
turnover was down by 5.3% at £61.6 million and Continental
Europe down by 1.5% at £29.2 million. UK turnover fell by 6.5%
to £12.2 million. Asia Pacific and Africa turnover was down by
4.9% at £9.6 million.
Conferencing turnover grew by 10.6% to £85.8 million, largely 
as a result of additional capacity, with operating profit down by
1.5% to £26.4 million, with the profitability improving in the
second half of the year as the new centres began to trade
profitably and customer demand in the peak periods improved.
Within Conferencing, 2003 saw the opening of two new
conferencing sites at Greenwich and Crewe, bringing the total
number of centres in the UK to 28. New business wins for
Cleaning included a seven-year contract to clean Terminal 3 at
Heathrow Airport, worth in excess of £20 million over the
contract term, and a six-year contract to clean Stansted Airport,
worth more than £10 million over the life of the contract. RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC  13
Parcels Delivery in the UK again increased its
market share during 2003. Developments in
client information access helped to win major
new business in a competitive market and
achieve growth from existing customers.
Among the successes was the appointment of
Parcels Delivery to deliver consignments of
hardware and software from Computer 2000,
a large IT distributor. As part of the service to
Computer 2000, Parcels Delivery has installed
its weighing and labelling technology at the
client’s Lutterworth distribution centre and
implemented an integrated sorting system. 
Parcels Delivery turnover was up by 16.2% at £213.2 million with operating profit at £30.9 million up by 11.6%.
UK turnover grew by 13.9% to £208.3 million with a 5.4% increase in operating profit, the margin impacted by the
higher proportion of non-premium next day consignments.

“constantly 
enhancing our 
network” 14 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
The company’s new vision, which I announced at the time of the
2003 interim results, is:
To be the international business services company, paramount 
in providing hygiene, safety and security solutions in all our 
geographic markets, with the strengths and experience of a 
multi-national company, whilst retaining the agility and 
characteristics of a local company.
The Rentokil Initial culture combines a strong sales and
marketing orientation, the provision of high quality service and
rigorous control of costs. This culture is the foundation of the
company’s development into one of the world’s largest business
services companies which offers a comprehensive range of
services to industry and commerce.
I firmly believe that we are well positioned to develop our
services, benefiting from our unified culture, focus on research
and development and commitment to the customer. As a
company, we work closely with the buyers and end users of 
our services, and seek to become more integrated into our
customers’ operations. 
In practical terms, the provision of hygiene, safety and security
solutions involves looking after people – employees and visitors –
in the workplace or public areas. From our point of view, it is
about monitoring, managing the environment, assets and people.
The aim is to accelerate growth particularly in Hygiene and Security,
with the main thrust being in continental Europe. We will continue
to develop all our services in their existing geographic areas.
Rentokil Initial has a good base in Europe, but the bias is
currently towards the UK where we generate 49% of turnover, as
against 32% in continental Europe. The population in continental
Europe is six times greater than the UK. The markets in
continental Europe are fragmented and European Union
legislation is driving higher standards of hygiene and security. As
a consequence, there is a good opportunity to replicate the
density and coverage of our UK operations. This will be achieved
through a mix of organic growth and acquisitions. Under our
new sector structure, we are heightening our emphasis on
finding and making more bolt-on and stand-alone acquisitions,
Chief Executive’s Review
especially in Hygiene and Security. Line management within the
continental European businesses have been charged with
identifying suitable acquisition opportunities.
In time, we will also see the development of a pan-European
business for our services, assisted by the progressive lowering of
barriers to trade within the European Union and the benefits of
our new structure. This will create the opportunity to provide
services in many cases on a cross-border basis, taking advantage
of improved route efficiencies and containment of overhead costs. 
Vision RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC  15
I believe that organic turnover growth is the prime requirement
for profitable growth. We will therefore invest in additional sales
management and sales staff where appropriate and continue
technological developments to improve the productivity and
quality of our service delivery. Recruitment of people for future
management positions and company-wide training will remain
key areas of focus.
We will continue the development of our four markets, Hygiene,
Security, Facilities Management and Parcels Delivery. The main
emphasis will be concentrated on Hygiene and Security within
continental Europe, where there is a good opportunity to
replicate the density and coverage of our UK operations.
In the past year, the restructuring and ongoing initiatives have
been aimed at improving organic growth rates within an
increasingly price-competitive environment.
Progress in 2003 has been slower than expected, especially in our
higher margin businesses, so that, in 2004, whilst we aim for
good growth in turnover, margins are likely to be impacted by
the pricing levels of net new business gains, the faster growth in
our lower margin businesses and the investments outlined above.  
Bolt-on and stand-alone acquisitions will be targeted to
supplement our organic growth, financed by the generation 
of strong cash flow.
I firmly believe that Rentokil Initial is now much stronger and
better positioned such that the initiatives already taken, and
those planned for 2004, should lead to a strong performance in
2005 and beyond with an improving turnover growth rate,
especially in our higher margin businesses.
Prospects
James C F Wilde
Chief Executive
24th March 2004 16 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
Operating profit
In 2003 total operating profit increased by £13.5 million to 
£455.5 million, before exceptional losses arising on disposed
businesses of £11.7 million. This 3.1% increase was in part
supported by a weaker sterling exchange rate against the trading
currencies of many of our overseas businesses, partly offset by the
effects of an even weaker US dollar. At constant 2002 average
exchange rates, before exceptional items, year-on-year operating
profit growth would have been 2.0%.
Exceptional items
The exceptional items totalling £11.7 million (2002: £nil)
represent, almost entirely, adjustments to the deferred disposal
consideration, previously reported in year 2000, in respect of two
businesses where the purchasers have not met, or are unlikely to
meet, either the earn-out criteria or disposal note conditions
agreed to at the time of the disposal. The remainder represents a
small loss in respect of the five business disposals completed in
the financial year.
Interest
Net interest payable reduced by 9.1% to £47.0 million arising
from the strong operating cash flow and the much lower variable
interest rates experienced, these being partly offset by the
incremental effects of the share buy-back programme. 
Profit before tax
After interest and exceptional items, pre-tax profits increased by
1.7% to £396.8 million at actual reported rates of exchange. At
constant 2002 average exchange rates the 2003 profit before tax
after exceptional items would have been £4.1 million lower at
£392.7 million, with currency gains arising on the pre-tax profit
conversions of our European, Australasian and South African
businesses being partly offset by currency losses in North
America, Asia and Zimbabwe.
Taxation
The overall tax charge reflects an underlying rate of
approximately 32.1% (being the weighted average of the local
rates in the various countries in which the company operates),
which was reduced to 26.5% in 2003 (25.7% calculated on 2003’s
pre-exceptional profits – 2002: 26.8%) by a continuing
combination of the utilisation of tax losses, goodwill
amortisation, prior period adjustments and other one-off items. 
Earnings per share and dividends
Profit after tax and minorities was £290.1 million, up £5.5 million
(1.9%) on 2002’s £284.6 million. At 15.83p, basic earnings per
share, after adjusting for the weighted average number of shares
bought back by the company, was 5.5% higher than 2002. Before
exceptional items the adjusted earnings per share of 16.47p was 
9.8% higher than 2002’s basic earnings per share of 15.0p. This
improvement was beneficially impacted by the aforementioned
exchange differences, the reduction in net interest payable, the
lower tax charge and a 3.4 % reduction in the weighted average
number of shares in issue.
In line with the statement set out in the “Future” and “Prospects
for 2003” sections of the interim report 2003, the board has
proposed a final dividend of 4.35p per share, bringing the total
dividend to 6.10p, up 10.3% on 2002’s 5.53p.
Cash flow
The company continues to be structured and managed to utilise
as little fixed and working capital as possible to optimise profit
and cash flow.
Capital expenditure is budgeted to take account of the
prospective growth and profitability and returns on capital of 
the various businesses, and is controlled through authorisation
and reporting procedures to match the actual progress of each
business through the year. Working capital, particularly debtors,
is budgeted tightly in line with growth requirements and is also
reviewed regularly and controlled tightly.
We entered 2003 with £1,260.4 million of net debt. Cash flow
from operating activities (i.e. before interest and tax and also
before capital expenditure, dividends and acquisitions) in the
year was £610.3 million (2002: £575.9 million). Working capital,
including £9.4 million (2002: £11.3 million) cash spend against
certain provisions, produced an inflow of £1.4 million (2002:
£14.9 million outflow) whilst capital investment (net of disposals)
reduced to £159.4 million compared with £161.2 million in 2002,
to give free cash flow before dividends, acquisitions and disposals
of £282.4 million (2002: £254.5 million) which, after adjusting 
for lease financing on fixed assets of £13.1 million (2002: 
£11.4 million), produced operating cash flow of £269.3 million
(2002: £243.1 million).
Dividend payments were £104.4 million, up by 6.9% over 2002’s
£97.7 million, reflecting the net of the dividend per share
increase and the lower number of shares in issue. This gave 
a cash flow before acquisitions and disposals in the year of 
£178.0 million (2002: £156.8 million).
We invested net cash of £21.2 million in acquisitions 
(2002: £34.5 million) as covered elsewhere in this review. 
There were disposal proceeds of £6.4 million in 2003 
(2002: £nil). Net cash inflow before use of liquid resources 
and financing was £163.2 million (2002: £122.3 million). The 
share buy-back programme produced an outflow of £75.9 million 
Finance Director’s Review RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC  17
(2002: £234.6 million). After lease financing of £13.1 million
(2002: £11.4 million), issue of ordinary share capital in respect 
of share options of £2.9 million (2002: £5.2 million) and 
negative foreign exchange movements of £23.1 million (2002:
£14.9 million), year-end net debt reduced to £1,207.9 million.
Shareholders’ funds
Equity shareholders’ funds at the end of 2003 were negative
£619.1 million, compared to the negative £723.6 million at the
end of 2002. The principal cause of this movement was the
£180.0 million retained profit partly offset by the £73.1 million
cost of share buy-backs.
In relation to turnover and profits, the low level of net 
operating assets in the company (excluding intangible assets) of 
£399.6 million (2002 £366.1 million) reflects the nature of service
businesses where the scarce resource is not assets but the people
employed in the business and the customer base which has been
built up over the years. However, this figure does not include 
the goodwill of £2.4 billion previously written off to reserves
invested into the acquisitions which produce good profits and
cash flow, nor does it include the value of the company’s own
businesses and brands that have been built up over the years.
The real value of this goodwill can be seen in the very high
return on operating assets earned by the business (119%
operating profit on average net operating assets), the interest
cover of 9.4 times, and the free cash flow in the year of 
£282.4 million (2002: £254.5 million) which was available to
finance dividends, acquisitions and the purchase of own shares.
Financing strategy and structure
Our businesses around the world are budgeted and managed 
to generate cash in their local currencies and to repay local or
intercompany debt and then pay dividends each year into 
central treasury. These cash flows are then used to meet the
company financing requirements. Central treasury operations are
undertaken in accordance with policies and procedures approved
by the board. These operations include undertaking borrowings
under the company’s bank committed credit facilities, note
issuance under the company’s Euro Medium Term Note
programme, the placing of deposits and the use of financial
instruments to manage the company’s underlying commercial
currency and interest rate exposures. We do not trade such
financial instruments. The effect of the company’s treasury
activities is reflected in the disclosures in note 20 to the accounts.
During 2003 the company continued to broaden its financing
mix, with the issue of a further four short term notes totalling
£88.7 million under its existing m2.5 billion Euro Medium Term
Note programme. All the notes issued were rated BBB+ by 
Standard & Poor’s, a rating which has been unchanged since it
was first established in 2001. This rating, together with its stable
outlook, was recently reaffirmed by the rating agency as part of
its normal annual review process.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk can arise as follows: from transactions in
currencies other than the home currency of the relevant business;
from translation of the results and assets and liabilities of
overseas businesses; from foreign currency financial assets and
liabilities; or from financial instruments purchased or issued to
hedge or manage these exposures. Although we do not have any
material import or export business, any significant foreign
currency transactions are hedged back into the currency of the
relevant business using forward foreign exchange contracts or
options and the total of such transactions at the year end was
£6.6 million (2002: £15.9 million).
Our policy is not to hedge the translation exposure of the profits
of foreign businesses back into sterling; however, we normally
finance overseas acquisitions with debt in the relevant currency
and maintain debt in foreign currencies to match part of the
profits and cash flow of our overseas operations. Details are set
out in the net debt analysis on page 18.
Interest rate risk
Swaps, options or forward interest rate agreements may be used
to fix or manage the interest rates on borrowings or deposits 
or their currency exposure. Substantially all of the company’s 
net borrowings are at floating rates of interest beyond the 
first half of 2004. In the event that interest rates rise or fall 
thereafter by 1% p.a. simultaneously across all the company’s
borrowings, the net interest payable of the company would 
then correspondingly increase or reduce by approximately 
£12 million on an annualised basis.
Liquidity management
Our policy is to maintain committed bank facilities sufficient to
cover forecast borrowing requirements with a margin of safety
and after allowing for any bond issues made under the
company’s m2.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note programme. 
At 31st December 2003, the company had available liquidity
totalling £554.6 million, consisting of £411.8 million of undrawn
committed bank credit facilities and £142.8 million of short term
bank deposits placed by central treasury which matured in
January 2004 and were used to repay bank debt. The company is
in compliance with the financial and other covenants contained
within its committed bank credit facilities as well as all
obligations relating to the notes issued under its Euro Medium
Term Note programme.  18 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
Acquisitions
During 2003 the company purchased 9 companies and businesses
for a total consideration of £22.2 million which, together with
adjustments for deferred consideration, took the cash spend to
£21.2 million. Details of the businesses acquired are set out on
page 76 of this annual report and the turnover and operating
profit therefrom are set out on the face of the consolidated
profit and loss account on page 46 of this annual report.
The consideration for these businesses included £16.8 million of
goodwill which has been capitalised as an asset, together with
the goodwill on earlier acquisitions since the change in
accounting standards effective on 1st January 1998. More
detailed commentary on our policy of non-amortisation of
goodwill and the impairment testing in respect thereof is
provided in the Accounting Policies section of this annual report
on page 51.
Disposals
Five businesses were disposed of during the year for a net
consideration of £4.8 million which, after adjustments for
deferred consideration, gave a net cash inflow of £6.4 million. 
We continue to monitor the periodic public announcements
made by the purchaser of our former US plant services business,
Ashtead Group plc. In 2000, we received from Ashtead Group plc
a £134 million convertible loan note in part consideration for the
sale of this business. Fuller details of their public announcements
and their relevance to the convertible loan note are more fully
explained in note 20 to the accounts. The company continues to
take all steps as may be required to protect its legal rights to the
payment of interest and principal under the terms of the note.
Share buy-back
During 2003 the company continued to buy back its shares, its
mandate to do so having been renewed at the annual general
meeting on 29th May 2003. During the year the company bought
back some 38.7 million shares at a cost of £73.1 million. Between
29th March 2000 and 31st December 2003 the company has
bought back 1,045.1 million shares (representing some 36.4% 
of the issued share capital as at 1st March 2000) at a total cost 
of £1.89 billion, this representing an average cost of 181 pence
per share, all such purchases having been earnings per share
enhancing.

Finance Director’s Review
At 31st December 2003 an analysis of the net debt by major currencies (after taking account of currency and interest swaps
outstanding) shows: RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC  19
At 31st December 2003 the company had outstanding approval
to buy back a further 254.9 million shares, representing some
14.0% of the then outstanding share capital. Since the year-end a
further 7.4 million shares have been repurchased at a total cost
of £13.8 million, this representing an average cost of 186 pence
which, like earlier purchases, are earnings per share enhancing.
Pension scheme
Since closing the defined benefit sections of its UK pension
scheme to new starters and introducing a defined contribution
section in its place in 2002 the company has not made any
further changes to the employee benefits or contributions of its
defined benefit pension arrangements in the UK. Whilst there
are currently no plans to make any such changes the prospective
changes to UK pension legislation which are likely to be effective
from April 2006 and the level of funding of the scheme will be
kept under close review by the company.
The UK pension scheme trustee in conjunction with its actuary
and in consultation with the company finalised the results of 
the April 2002 triennial valuation of its defined benefit pension
scheme in March 2003. As part of the usual triennial valuation
process the required level of company contributions were 
re-calculated. Whilst no contributions were required in 2003, 
a company contribution of approximately £8.0 million will be
made in March 2004. Thereafter it is anticipated that further
annual payments will be necessary (currently estimated to be
£12.0 million in March 2005) given the lower mortality rates, the
increased inflation rates and changes to bond and investment
yields assumed in the 2002 valuation. The next triennial valuation 
will be in April 2005.
In 2003 the company continued to account for pensions using
SSAP 24. The pro-forma effects of FRS 17 in the contexts of the
2001, 2002 and 2003 balance sheets and 2002 and 2003 profit
and loss accounts, are shown in note 27 on page 69 of this
annual report. Given the company’s market capitalisation is in
excess of £3 billion and compared with UK pension funds
generally, the net deficit at 31st December 2003 of £131 million
shown under FRS 17 is considered to be a relatively low exposure.
Accounting standards
During the year the company has implemented the amendment
to Financial Reporting Standard FRS 5 “Reporting the Substance
of Transactions – Revenue Recognition” as issued by the
Accounting Standards Board in November 2003. We see this as
part of the progressive harmonisation process of UK GAAP
reporting requirements with International Financial Reporting
Standards which will be effective from 1st January 2005. The
effect of applying this new policy in 2003 has been to reduce
profit before tax by £0.3 million. There was no impact on the
2002 profit and loss account and therefore the 2002 results have
not been restated. The 2002 comparative balance sheet, however, 
has been restated to reflect the future recognition of contract
income on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. As a
result creditors were increased by £22.5 million, offset by a £4.0
million decrease in corporation tax and a £2.8 million decrease in
deferred tax to give a net reduction in shareholders’ equity of
£15.7 million.
In addition to the specific change above, the company, in
consultation with its auditors, is making good progress in its
move towards the introduction of International Financial
Reporting Standards in 2005. The company would anticipate
being able to update shareholders on these plans towards the
end of 2004, subject to there being sufficient clarity, at that time,
on the final agreed format of such standards. Any such update
will attempt to clarify the potential financial and disclosure
effects of universal adoption of such standards.

At 31st December 2003 the trade creditors of the group represented 56 days of annual purchases and the UK businesses’
trade creditors represented 54 days of purchases; UK trade debtors represented 44 days of turnover. During the year the
parent company did not have any trade creditors.
The company takes account of social, environmental and ethical considerations when managing the business and when
contemplating new activities. In 2002 the board adopted a range of corporate social responsibility (’CSR’) policies. In
addition to the existing policies and procedures in respect of the environment and health and safety, they comprise
policies on ethics, and policies in relation to the fundamental rights of employees, equal opportunities and diversity,
employee remuneration, training and employee development, job security and wealth creation, relationships with
customers and suppliers and community involvement.
Mr E F Brown is the director responsible for corporate social responsibility matters.
Measuring compliance with CSR policies relating to its people has been a priority in 2003 and businesses have reported
on their compliance with the Rentokil Initial good practice guides on employment. A summary of the outcome of the
review is contained in the company’s CSR report for 2003, which is available on the company’s website (see below). The
board has been pleased with the outcome of the review which proved to be a useful benchmark of the employment
practices in the operating businesses internationally and identified a number of opportunities for the spread of best
practice in a number of areas such as communications and skills training. No practices were identified that could be
considered to be a breach of the board’s CSR policies.
The corporate social responsibility section of the company’s website www.rentokil-initial.com provides a current
overview of our plans and progress in the areas of health and safety, environment and people. The section also contains
copies of all the corporate social responsibility policies adopted by the board and some of the supporting procedures
and standards, and offers answers to many commonly asked questions. The company’s Corporate Social Responsibility

REVIEW OF 
THE YEAR 24 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
Future developments are commented on by the chief executive in his review on pages 14 and 15.
An interim dividend of 1.75p per share amounting to £31.1 million was paid on 31st October 2003. The board
recommends the declaration of a final dividend of 4.35p amounting to £79.0 million (adjusted for the waiver of
dividend in respect of the shares held by the trustees of the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust) payable on 4th June
2004. The total distribution for 2003 would then be 6.10p per share (2002: 5.53p) amounting to £110.1 million.
During the year 9 companies and businesses were acquired for a total consideration of £22.2 million, which, together
with adjustments for deferred consideration, took the total spend to £21.2 million. These acquisitions contributed 
£20.9 million to turnover and £1.9 million to profit before interest and £1.3 million to profit after interest. Goodwill
amounting to £16.8 million has been capitalised as an intangible asset on these acquisitions.
The consolidated profit before taxation for 2003 was £396.8 million (the tax on this was £105.2 million).
The book value of the consolidated tangible fixed assets at 31st December 2003 amounted to £662.8 million 
(2002: £624.3 million).
Dividends declared and recommended out of 2003 profits amount to £110.1 million. Retained profits of £180.0 million
have been transferred to reserves. Net consolidated capital employed is now negative £612.6 million compared to
negative £717.3 million last year.
During 2003, employees exercised options to buy 2.1 million shares of 1p each in the capital of the company under the
terms of the share option schemes approved by shareholders in general meeting. As a result, the company’s issued share
premium account increased by £2.9 million.
The company complies with The Combined Code, appended to the Listing Rules, issued by the Financial Services
Authority (“Combined Code”). It is the intention of the board that the company should also comply fully with the Code
on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council on 23rd July 2003 (‘Revised Code’) by the time it
issues its 2004 annual report. The company’s compliance with the Combined Code and progress made in achieving
compliance under the Revised Combined Code are illustrated below:
1. Principles of good governance
The company has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code as set out below:
a) The board
The board believes that it has structured its affairs to ensure that it leads and controls the company. It is satisfied
that directors bring independent judgement to bear on issues facing the company.
The board meets nine times a year and additionally when necessary and follows a formal schedule of matters
reserved for its decision in accordance with a board calendar which is contained in standing board procedures and
practices. As appropriate, the board delegates certain responsibilities to both standing and ad hoc committees
under its standing procedures and practices on a clearly mandated basis.
At each scheduled meeting of the board, the chief executive reports on the company’s operations worldwide and the
finance director reports on the financial position of the company. In addition, under the board’s standing procedures
and practices and the board calendar, significant issues affecting the company are reviewed on a regular basis.

Report of the Directors RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 25
The chief executive is responsible for the management of the company, subject to the strategic direction of the
board and such matters that the board shall specifically reserve for its consideration and approval. He is also
responsible for the achievement of the objectives set by the board and for preparing an overall strategy for the
company to achieve such objectives and shall implement the overall strategy decided by the board through the
management and organisation of the company. Matters reserved for the approval of the board are set out in the
board procedures and practices which are reviewed on a regular basis.
b) Chairman and chief executive
Sir Clive Thompson has been chairman of the company since May 2002 when, following the untimely death of the
previous chairman, Mr H E St L King, he initially combined the roles of chief executive and chairman until 
Mr J C F Wilde took over as chief executive on 1st January 2003. He retired as an executive in April 2003.
The role of the chief executive and his relationship with the board is set out in a) above.
c) Board balance
The company ended the year with the chairman, three executive directors and five independent non-executive
directors (see page 20). The board believes that the non-executive directors are independent of management and
free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their
independent judgement and thus characterises them as “independent”.
d) Information and professional development
The board is satisfied that it is provided with information in an appropriate form and quality to enable it to
discharge its duties. All directors receive full induction when they join the company. Major shareholders are given
the opportunity to meet non-executive directors, especially newly-appointed ones.
All directors have access to independent professional advice at the company’s expense and have access to the
advice and services of the company secretary.
e) Appointments to the board
Recommendations on new appointments to the board are made by the nomination committee, a majority of
whose members are non-executive directors. Non-executive directors are appointed for terms of three years
subject to re-election. Mr P Mason was elected to the board by shareholders at the annual general meeting in May
2003 with the full support of the board, following a unanimous recommendation of the nomination committee
which had appointed external consultants to identify possible candidates.
f) Re-election
All directors submit themselves for re-election at least once every three years.
g) Directors’ remuneration
The statement of the company’s policy on executive directors’ remuneration and details of directors’ emoluments
are contained in the Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 42. The board’s policy is that all new executive directors
should have service contracts which are terminable on 12 months’ notice by the company.
It is also the board’s policy to ensure that the company maintains contact, as and when necessary, with its 
principal shareholders both directly and through the Association of British Insurers and the National Association
of Pension Funds.

GOVERNANCE
(CONTINUED) 26 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
h) Relations with shareholders
The board attaches considerable importance to effective communication with all shareholders. In addition to the
annual and interim reports, trading statements are published at the time of the annual general meeting in May
and in November or December each year. Published information on the company is available on its website. The
annual general meeting also provides an opportunity for the chief executive to make a business presentation to
shareholders and for shareholders, in turn, to raise questions and discuss the company with the board. It is
standing practice for the chairman to advise the meeting of the proxy voting after each resolution has been voted
on at the annual general meeting.
The chief executive and finance director hold regular meetings with analysts and institutional shareholders to
discuss the company’s strategy and financial performance. Following the publication of the Revised Code, the
chairman has sought the views of major UK based shareholders on how members of the board and, in particular,
the non-executive directors, should develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders about the
company with the result that the chairman and, if so requested, non-executive directors will make themselves
available for discussions with shareholders at the time of the release of the preliminary results and on other
occasions if specifically requested by shareholders.
i) Annual general meeting
All directors attend the annual general meeting and are available to answer questions put to them by
shareholders.
j) Accountability and audit
The annual report provides information on and an assessment of the company’s business, operations, financial
position and prospects. The board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal controls, including
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management, and reviews the effectiveness of the system
at least annually in order to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets. The system is designed
to manage, rather than eliminate, risk and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The board has established procedures necessary to implement the requirements of the Combined Code relating
to internal controls as reflected in the guidance on the review of companies’ systems of internal control, in
accordance with the Combined Code, which has been prepared by a working party established by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The risk identification and management process has been in place
during the whole of 2003 (and up to the 24th March 2004, the date of the approval of the audited 2003 accounts)
and during that time the board has regularly reviewed the process. The board has also carried out a review of the
effectiveness of the system of internal controls. The process used by the board to review the effectiveness of the
system of internal controls includes the review of reports on a six monthly basis, on legal compliance and claims
issues. Insurance and risk management and treasury issues are reviewed annually or more frequently if necessary.
In addition the audit committee reviews the scope of audits, the half-yearly and annual financial statements
(including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements) and reports to the board on financial issues raised
by both internal and external audit reports.
The board has modified the terms of reference of the audit committee to bring them into line with the terms of
the Revised Code. The audit committee receives reports from the internal audit department and reviews the
performance of the department.
In addition, the board has adopted a range of CSR policies (see page 23) which are being implemented by the
company and its subsidiaries on a planned basis (implementation is referred to on the company’s website
www.rentokil-initial.com). The board is implementing a risk identification and management process in relation to
social, environmental and ethical issues similar to the process used by it in relation to internal controls.

Report of the Directors RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 27
k) Going concern
After reviewing group and company cash balances, borrowings and projected cash flows, the directors believe
that the group and company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
l) Auditors’ independence
The company has reviewed its relationship with its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and concluded that
there are sufficient controls and processes in place to ensure the required level of independence. Consequently
there are no plans to replace PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose re-appointment is proposed as set out in the
notice of annual general meeting on page 78 of this annual report.
2. Code of best practice
During the year ended 31st December 2003, the company has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of
the Combined Code.
Donations for UK charitable purposes in 2003 amounted to £115,000 and a further £57,000 was donated in other
countries. There were no payments to political organisations.
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the company will be proposed at the annual
general meeting to be held on 27th May 2004.
Shareholders approved an authority for the company to make market purchases of its own shares at the annual general
meeting held on 29th May 2003, when authority was given to purchase up to 277 million shares. This represented 15%
of the company’s issued share capital at the time, being the maximum which the Listing Rules of the UK Listing
Authority permit to be bought by way of market purchases under a single authority.
Since 29th May 2003 the company has purchased a further 21.9 million shares at a total cost of £43.4 million.
The current buy-back authority expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming annual general meeting. The board
considers that it would be in the interests of shareholders that the board should continue to have the flexibility to buy
back shares in appropriate circumstances beyond the annual general meeting. The board is therefore seeking the
authority of shareholders to buy back up to 273 million shares by way of market purchases, which represents 15% of
the company’s issued share capital at the date of this report.
The proposed authority is dealt with in resolution 6 contained in the notice of annual general meeting on 
page 78. If given, it will replace the current authority granted on 29th May 2003.
Until the new authority is given by shareholders, the current authority allows the company to buy back approximately
a further 248 million shares. If the company were to use this authority in full, it would have approximately 1.6 billion
shares in issue at the time of the new authority and, under the 15% limit in the Listing Rules referred to above, the
number of shares for which shareholders could give authority would be limited to just over 235 million. Therefore, in
order to comply with the Listing Rules, the authority being proposed in resolution 6 provides that the company may not
make market purchases under this authority of such number of shares as in aggregate amounts to 15% or more of the
number of shares in issue immediately following the annual general meeting.

The minimum price payable per share under the proposed authority in resolution 6 is 1p (the nominal amount of each
share) and the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) is 5% above the average market price per share for the five
business days immediately preceding any purchase.
The board intends to use this authority to purchase shares with discretion. Purchases will be made only from funds not
required for other purposes and in the light of prevailing market conditions. No purchase will be made unless the board
is of the opinion that it will result in an increase in earnings per share. The board will also take into account the
company’s cash resources and bank facilities, the effect on gearing and other possible investment opportunities before
deciding whether to exercise this authority.
Any purchase of shares pursuant to this authority will be made on market. Shares purchased will be cancelled and will
not be available for reissue.
The Remuneration Report, which has been adopted by the board, is set out on pages 29 to 42 and the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities is set out on page 43.
The board believes that the proposed resolutions to be put to the annual general meeting to be held on 27th May 2004
are in the best interests of shareholders as a whole and, accordingly, recommends that shareholders vote in favour of
the resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the company.

Remuneration Report
INTRODUCTION
THE
REMUNERATION
COMMITTEE AND
ITS PROCESSES
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (as formerly set
out in the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations 2002) (“Schedule 7A”) and The Combined Code, appended to the Listing
Rules, as issued by the Financial Services Authority (“Combined Code”). This report also makes reference to the revised
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“Revised Code”) which will come into effect for reporting years beginning on
or after 1st November 2003, which will apply in relation to the company’s annual report and accounts for 2004. 
In framing its remuneration policy the committee has given full consideration to the matters set out in Schedules A and
B to the Combined Code and has endeavoured to take full account of the matters set out in section B to the Revised
Code. A resolution (resolution 2) to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting to be held on
27th May 2004.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the company’s members on the matters set out in Part 3 of Schedule
7A and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. Items 1 to 4 in the last section of this report entitled Pay and Benefits have been audited.
The company’s remuneration committee (“Committee”) is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the
Combined Code and the Revised Code and its terms of reference are available on the company’s website. The
Committee makes recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration and its cost. 
It determines, without reference to the board, the pay and benefits of the executive directors and sector managing
directors and the company secretary, in the light of the recommendations of the chief executive (other than in relation
to himself) and professional advice and external sources of information referred to below. 
The members of the Committee during the year under review were Mr B D McGowan, Mr P J Long, Mr P Mason and 
Mr R R Spinney, who are all independent non-executive directors, and the Committee was chaired by Mr McGowan. 
Mr P Mason joined the Committee after his election to the board at the annual general meeting held in May 2003.
At the beginning of 2004, the board approved a number of changes to the terms of reference of the Committee. The
principal changes being as follows: to make the Committee responsible for setting targets for performance related pay
schemes for executive directors and senior executives; to advise the board on major changes in employee benefit
structures throughout the company; and to advise the board on the contractual terms applicable to termination
payments for executive directors and senior executives. In addition, the Committee has assumed responsibility for
making recommendations to the board on the level of the chairman’s fees which was formerly undertaken by the
chairman’s fees committee, which has now ceased to exist.
The Committee seeks to obtain information from suitable sources regarding directors’ remuneration. In this context it
and the company have obtained reports from Towers Perrin, who operate one of the most extensive management pay
databanks in the UK. It specifically commissioned the remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt, to advise on the
discretionary share option schemes and the Deferred Share Award Plan, which were introduced in 2000, and that firm
continues to provide advice to the Committee on the performance conditions applicable to these incentive
arrangements.
None of the members of the Committee participates in company incentive arrangements or has any personal interest
(other than as shareholders) in the matters under consideration, conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, or
any day-to-day involvement in running the business. No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own
remuneration. 30 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
POLICIES General
The policy of the board towards remuneration matters is to provide pay and benefits packages for the executive
directors, the sector managing directors and the company secretary that are appropriate to attract, retain and
incentivise the best staff in order to meet the objective set by the board to achieve superior performance. Specifically,
with regard to executive directors, the objective of the policy is to ensure that executive directors should receive
remuneration that reflects their responsibilities and performance. Account is also taken in the case of sector managing
directors of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which they are responsible and the extent to
which the strategic objectives set by the board are being met. 
The Committee monitors competitive market practices, particularly through the use of generally available external
independent data, such as that provided by Towers Perrin. The Committee also takes into account the size, complexity
and international nature of the company’s operations when assessing comparative data.
Remuneration packages for executive directors, sector managing directors and senior management generally contain
the following principal elements:
• Salaries
• Bonuses
• Share options
• Pensions
• Benefits
The Committee has developed remuneration packages designed to align the interests of executives with those of
shareholders. Consistent with the board’s policy, the remuneration packages awarded to directors are intended to be
competitive and provide a mix of performance-related and other remuneration designed to incentivise directors but not
detract from the goals of Corporate Governance. The executive directors and sector managing directors are entitled to
bonuses, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions (see sub-section entitled “Bonuses” below). 50% of
bonuses are paid in the form of shares that vest after one year in accordance with the terms of the company’s Deferred
Share Award Plan. Sector managing directors’ bonuses are based in part on the achievement of turnover and profit
targets for the performance of the businesses for which they are responsible and in part on their membership of the
Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan (their relative entitlements under both schemes are abated to reflect the fact
that they participate in both). Generally, the personal targets of senior managers (other than executive directors and
sector managing directors) are tied into the performance of those profit centres to which they contribute. Both short-
term rewards (base salary, annual bonuses and fringe benefits) and longer-term benefits (share options and pension
benefits) reflect the responsibilities and performance of individual executives.
The company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be
performance related. As described on page 31, executive directors and sector managing directors may earn annual
incentive payments with a maximum of between 53.3% and 80.0% of their basic salaries together with the benefits of
participation in share option schemes. 
Remuneration Report RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 31
The relative importance of the performance related elements of the executive directors’ remuneration in 2003 is
summarised below:
PERFORMANCE
BONUS (INCLUDING
AWARDED UNDER
BASE SALARY AND THE DEFERRED SHARE
BENEFITS AWARD PLAN 2003) SHARE OPTIONS TOTAL
J C F Wilde 66% 4% 30% 100%
R C Payne 75% 3% 22% 100%
E F Brown 79% 2% 19% 100%
Note: The value of share options have been calculated in accordance with the Black-Scholes model.
Executive directors are entitled to accept one non-executive directorship or similar appointment outside the company,
provided that the board’s permission is obtained and fees from any such appointments are paid to the company.
Currently, no executive director holds an outside appointment.
Salaries
Executive directors’ basic salaries are determined by the Committee at the commencement of each year and when an
individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries in the
company at a senior level as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on executive
directors’ remuneration in British companies in both the support services sector and generally (for example, survey of
executives’ remuneration prepared by Towers Perrin referred to above). 
Bonuses
The Committee establishes the performance criterion that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be
paid and deferred shares awarded to executive directors under the Deferred Share Award Plan. In setting appropriate
bonus parameters the Committee has taken advice from the remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt. The Committee
believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the company’s shareholders and
that, in the context of bonus entitlement, is best measured by movements in the company’s basic earnings per share.
The performance criterion for the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan 2003 was that for every 1% increase (and pro
rata for lesser percentages) in the company’s earnings per share over the earnings per share for the previous year over
2% in excess of the rate of inflation Mr J C F Wilde would receive a bonus of 10% of basic salary (maximum 80.0%), 
Mr R C Payne would receive 6.65% of basic salary (maximum 53.3%) and the sector managing directors (including 
Mr E F Brown) would receive 3% of basic salary (maximum 24.0%). The Committee considers that earnings per share
growth of 2% in excess of the rate of inflation should be expected and that if that rate is exceeded and only if that rate
is exceeded should the performance be rewarded.
The performance criteria for the Senior Executive Bonus Scheme 2003, which applies to sector managing directors, was
as follows:
(a) For each 1% of turnover in excess of 97% of budget, the sector managing director will receive 1% of salary as a bonus
with a maximum bonus of 13% i.e. achievement of 110% of budgeted turnover.
(b) For each 1% of profit in excess of 90% up to 95% of budget the sector managing director will receive 0.5% of salary
as a bonus. For each 1% of profit in excess of 95% of budget the sector managing director will receive 1% of salary
as a bonus. 32 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
(c) Where turnover achieved is on or in excess of 100% of budget the profit bonus in (b) for over 95% will be doubled
(giving 2% of salary for each 1% of profit over 95%).
The total entitlement in respect of the above is subject to a maximum of 50% of basic salary.
Sir Clive Thompson is not entitled to a bonus in respect of 2003. 
Bonuses for executive directors for the year ended 31st December 2003 are summarised in the Pay and Benefits section
of this report starting on page 37. The maximum bonuses for executive directors for the year ending 31st December
2004 will range between 53.3% and 80.0% of basic salary and are summarised below: 
2004 MAXIMUM BONUSES 2003 BONUSES AS % OF
AS % OF BASIC SALARY BASIC SALARY
J C F Wilde 80.0% 3.5%
R C Payne 53.3% 2.4%
E F Brown 74.0% 1.2%
Note: 2003 basic salaries for the purposes of this table are the rates of salary as at 31st December 2003. 2004 salaries are
those effective at 1st January 2004.
Bonuses are awarded on or about 1st March following the end of the financial year to which they relate. In accordance
with the company’s Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan, 50% of the annual bonus as calculated above, is paid in cash
with the remaining 50% being satisfied by the award of shares in the company. The number of shares awarded is
calculated by reference to the two prices shown in the quotations for the company’s shares immediately preceding the
date of the award plus one quarter of the difference between these two prices. The Rentokil Initial Employee Share
Trust holds these shares in trust on a conditional basis for a period of one year from the date of award. The directors’
interests in shares awarded under the Deferred Share Award Plan in respect of 2002 and 2003 are summarised in the
Pay and Benefits section of this report starting on page 37.
Share options
The company has share option schemes for approximately five hundred senior executives worldwide. Schemes have
operated since 1973 and new schemes were established with the approval of shareholders in 1989, 1996 and 2000. The
exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
Grants of share options up to and including 1999 were based upon individual performance and conditional on the
achievement of a 15% increase in basic earnings per share in the financial year preceding the date of grant, which was
duly achieved. Share options granted in the period 1996 to 1999 (inclusive) were subject to an exercise condition under
which the earnings per share of the company needed to be at least 2% (3% in 1999) in excess of the UK rate of inflation
over a period of three years, which was duly achieved.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary schemes (“Discretionary Schemes”), which
were approved by shareholders in 2000, are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the
company. The Committee sought the advice of the remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt, on both the structure of
the Discretionary Schemes and the level of benefits payable under them. The Committee believes that performance
criteria set out below best satisfy the alignment of shareholders’ interests with those of executive directors in particular
and executives in general by ensuring that benefits under the Schemes are only realisable if there has been a material
real growth in earnings per share. There are two levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes, Level 1 which
Remuneration Report RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 33
applies to all senior executives (including executive directors) and Level 2 which applies to executive directors and sector
managing directors, which may be summarised as follows:
Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the company’s annual growth in earnings per share on average
over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at
least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of inflation or, failing this, the company’s annual growth in
earnings per share on average over a greater period (up to a maximum of ten years) is at least 4% in excess of
the UK rate of inflation. Until 2003, the grant of options under Level 1 was in the range of 25% to 150% of
basic salary depending on the position of the executive in the company. During 2003 the Committee reviewed
the factors applied to directors’ and executives’ salaries when calculating entitlements and accordingly on
options granted in 2003 the range of percentages of salary was reduced to 16.7% to 100% of basic salary (for
further information on executive directors see below).
A summary of the progress towards satisfaction of the performance targets for Level 1 share options, granted
since 2000, is set out in the following table:
EXERCISE AVERAGE TARGET AVERAGE EPS
GRANT PRICE (PENCE) PERIOD GROWTH (%) GROWTH (%)
2000 156.5 2000 to 2003 6.3 4.7
2001 205.25 2001 to 2003 6.1 10.6
2002 266.75 Minimum period has yet to elapse N/A N/A
2003 204.5 Minimum period has yet to elapse N/A N/A
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return (calculated by Watson Wyatt),
i.e. the appreciation of the share price (including reinvested dividends) in comparison with the performance of
the FTSE 100 Index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three
consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis:
If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 Index, then 25% of the Level 2 share
options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the
FTSE 100 and in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services
companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a
performance in the upper quartile in a group of support services companies.
Before 2003 the number of Level 2 share options granted was 50% to 100% of basic salary depending on the
position of the executive in the company, but following the review in 2003 referred to above, the range of
factors used in 2003 was 33.3% to 66.6% (for further information on executive directors see below). The
performance conditions for Level 2 share options granted have been satisfied as follows:
PERCENTAGE
EXERCISABLE 
EXERCISE PERIOD (FIXED PERIOD (ANY BALANCE
GRANT PRICE (PENCE) OF 3 YEARS) WILL HAVE LAPSED)
2000 156.5 2000 to 2002 85%
2001 205.25 2001 to 2003 100%
2002 266.75 2002 to 2004 To be established
2003 204.5 2003 to 2005 To be established
Note: The exercise price will be adjusted to reflect the cost of holding the shares less the dividend income thereon. 34 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 
The company’s policy is to grant share options to directors and senior executives annually. The entitlements of executive
directors to the grant of options under the Discretionary Schemes in 2003 (see table below) were calculated by
multiplying their basic salaries by the factors set out below and then dividing by the strike price (i.e. the mid-market
closing price for the company’s shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant):
MR J C F WILDE MR R C PAYNE MR E F BROWN
Level 1 1.0 0.6666 0.6
Level 2 0.6666 0.4444 0.3333
Note: no share options were granted to Sir Clive Thompson, in either 2002 or 2003 as he retired as an executive in April
2003 and, under the rules of the Discretionary Schemes, no participant is entitled to be granted share options in the
period of 18 months preceding his or her retirement.
The Committee is currently reviewing the factors to be applied in 2004.
Executive directors are also members of the savings-related share option scheme, which is approved by the Inland
Revenue and which was introduced in 1998. 
Details of the executive directors’ outstanding share options are shown in the Pay and Benefits section of this report
starting on page 37.
Pensions
Executive directors are members of the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme. Their dependants are eligible for dependants’
pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service. The pension arrangements provide for a
pension on retirement of 2/3 basic annual salary after 20 years’ eligible service. No other payments to directors are
pensionable and there are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements to directors. The executive directors
are members of the company’s defined benefit pension scheme and their accrued entitlements under the scheme are as
set out in the Pay and Benefits section of this report starting on page 37. 
Sir Clive Thompson retired as an executive in April 2003 and, on his retirement, receives a pension from the Rentokil
Initial Pension Scheme.
Contracts
It is the company’s policy that executive directors should have rolling contracts subject to one year’s notice by the
company. The executive directors have rolling contracts which are subject to one year’s notice by the company and six
months’ notice by the relevant director and are dated as follows: Mr J C F Wilde, 8th April 2002; Mr R C Payne, 7th March
2002; and Mr E F Brown, 6th April 1999. 
The company’s policy in respect of the notice periods for the termination of executive directors’ contracts conforms with
the Revised Code. The Committee is fully aware that, under the Revised Code it should take a robust line in reducing
compensation to reflect departing directors’ obligations to mitigate loss.
Sir Clive Thompson’s contract as an executive director expired on his retirement on 4th April 2003. As non-executive
chairman, with effect from 5th April 2003, he now has a rolling contract, (dated 28th May 2002) subject to twelve
months’ notice by either the company or him. 
Remuneration Report RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 35
All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the board on
the recommendation of the non-executive directors’ fees committee within the limits set by the Articles of Association
and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. The basic fee paid to
each non-executive director in the year was £35,000. The chairmen of the remuneration and audit committees are each
paid an additional £5,000 per annum. Also, the deputy chairman receives additional fees of £10,000 per annum for
fulfilling that role. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and they do not participate in any of the
company’s share option schemes or bonus schemes and are not eligible to join the company’s pension scheme as active
members.
At the annual general meeting held on 29th May 2003 shareholders approved a proposal that the limit on the annual
fees for non-executive directors, which was last reviewed in 1997, be increased from £500,000 to £1,000,000. The new
limit allows for a larger number of non-executive directors required by the most recent corporate governance
developments and future increases in directors’ fees to allow for inflation, changes in duties and market developments. 
The following graph shows the company’s performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the
performance of the FTSE 100 Index also measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE 100 Index has been selected 
for this comparison as the company is currently and has been a member of the FTSE 100 during the period covered by
the graph.
Note:
The above graph illustrates the movement of the company’s total shareholder return assuming dividends are re-invested
on the ex-dividend date against that of the FTSE 100 Index since 31st December 1998 and has been prepared on the
basis that the notional investment changes each time the index changes.

Notes:
1. All share options granted before 2000 are exercisable.
2. Level 1 share options granted under the Discretionary Schemes in 2000 and subsequently cannot yet be exercised as
the performance criteria have yet to be satisfied save for those granted in 2001 where the performance criteria have
been satisfied. 85% of Level 2 share options granted in 2000 and 100% of Level 2 share options granted in 2001 are
exercisable (see table on page 33). Level 2 share options granted in 2002 and 2003, cannot yet be exercised as the
relevant performance criteria have yet to be satisfied.
3. As a result of the company’s total shareholder return in 2001 to 2003 being above the upper quartile of the FTSE 100
Index and above the upper quartile as measured against a sector comparator group (see “Performance graph and
charts” on pages 35 and 36), 100% of the Level 2 options granted in March 2001 became exercisable on the third
anniversary of their grant in March 2004.
4. Sir Clive Thompson exercised 993,974 share options in 2003 at a strike price of 122.165p which had a value of 173p
per share at the date of exercise (namely the mid-market closing price on the date of exercise of the share option)
and resulted in a total notional gain of £505,287.
5. No other directors were granted options in the shares of the company or any other group entities.
6. None of the terms and conditions of share options granted were varied during the year.
7. All share options must be exercised by the expiry of ten years from their date of grant.

Notes: 
1. The accrued pension entitlements shown are those that would be paid annually on retirement based on years of
service to date. The increase in accrued pension entitlement during the year reflects additional service. There were
no changes to accrued benefits during the year.
2. All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Actuarial Guidance
Note GN11 as published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. The transfer values disclosed above
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on
transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the directors’ pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable
to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the
increase in accrued benefits that the director has earned in the period, whereas the change in his/her transfer value,
required by the Companies Act discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his/her transfer value and includes the
change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the
beginning of the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year.
3. Members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions; neither the contributions nor
the resulting benefits are included in the above tables.
4. No director is a member of a money purchase scheme sponsored by the company.
5. The information given regarding Sir Clive Thompson takes into account the actuarial position as at 31st December
2003, although he retired in April 2003 and receives a pension from the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme. 42 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC

2. In addition to the interests in shares noted above, on the 3rd March 2004 the shares awarded on 3rd March 2003
under the Deferred Share Award Plan 2002 vested unconditionally in the executive directors. There have been no
further changes in the interests set out above between 31st December 2003 and 24th March 2004. The shares
awarded on 1st March 2004 are not included as these are held by the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust on a
conditional basis but, subject to the vesting criteria being satisfied, will vest on 1st March 2005. The table in sub-
section 2 on page 38 gives details of shares awarded under the Deferred Share Award Plan in which the executive
directors have an interest, which are not yet included in the table above.

Remuneration Report RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 43
Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the company and of the group and of the profit and loss and cash flows of the group for that period.
In preparing these accounts, the directors are required to adopt suitable accounting policies and to apply them
consistently, making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent, and following applicable accounting
standards. 
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the company keeps proper accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable them to ensure that
the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company
and the group and taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.   
The maintenance and integrity of the Rentokil Initial plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried
out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on
the website.   
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

OPINION
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Rentokil Initial plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheets,
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of
Movement in Equity Shareholders’ Funds and the related Notes which have been prepared under the historical cost
convention and the accounting policies set out in the Statement of Accounting Policies. We have also audited the
disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the Remuneration Report (“the
auditable part”).
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. The
directors are also responsible for preparing the Remuneration Report. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a
body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, the Finance Director’s Review, the
Report of the Directors, and the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions
of the Combined Code issued in June 1998 specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s or group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration Report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and
the auditable part of the Remuneration Report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements.
Report of the Auditors RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 45

• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group at

CURRENCIES
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and comply with the Companies Act 1985 (“Act”),
except for the departure noted under intangible assets below, as amended by the Companies Act 1989 and applicable
accounting standards.
During the year the company has adopted Application Note G which was issued as an amendment to FRS 5 “Reporting the
Substance of Transactions” by the ASB in November 2003 to be adopted for accounting periods ending on or after 23rd
December 2003. This has replaced the previous policy of recognising, where appropriate, a higher proportion of the total
income at the start of contracts to reflect initial value of services performed and has resulted in a prior year adjustment to
shareholders’ equity of £15.7 million (net of tax). This is accounted for by a £22.5 million increase in creditors offset by a
£4.0 million decrease in corporation tax and a £2.8 million decrease in deferred tax. As there was no impact on the 2002
profit and loss account, the results for 2002 have not been restated. The effect of applying this new policy in 2003 has been
to reduce profit before tax by £0.3 million.
The consolidated accounts comprise those of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings (“subsidiaries” or
“subsidiary companies”) together with the group’s share of profits and net assets of the associated undertakings
(“associates” or “associated companies”).
The results of newly acquired companies and businesses are consolidated from the date of acquisition. The results of
companies and businesses disposed of during the year are consolidated until the date of disposal.
For acquisitions involving deferred consideration, estimated deferred payments are accrued in the balance sheet.
Interest due to vendors on deferred payments is charged to the profit and loss account as it accrues. For disposals
involving deferred consideration, estimated deferred receipts are prepaid in the balance sheet. Interest from buyers on
deferred receipts is credited to the profit and loss account as it accrues.
The results of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
The assets and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at year-end exchange rates. Exchange differences on the
results for the year, opening net assets and on foreign currency loans which relate to overseas investments are recorded
as movements on reserves in accordance with SSAP 20. Foreign currency transactions in the year and balances in the
year-end balance sheet are translated at the average and closing rates of exchange respectively. Any exchange
differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account, with the exception of exchange gains and losses in respect
of loans which hedge against foreign currency investments which are recorded as movements in reserves.
Turnover excludes VAT and other similar sales based taxes and represents the amounts receivable for services rendered
(including franchisee fees) and goods sold outside the group. Contract income is recognised in accounting periods on a
straight-line basis over the life of the contract.
Production, service, selling and other direct branch costs are classified as cost of sales. Administrative expenses comprise
head office costs and research and development expenditure which is written off as incurred.
The cost of pensions in respect of the group’s defined benefit pension schemes is charged to the profit and loss account
so as to spread the cost of pensions over the average expected service lives of employees in the schemes. Actuarial
surpluses or deficits from the regular costs are spread over the average future service lives of employees in the schemes
using the projected unit credit method. Differences between the amount charged in the profit and loss account and
payments made to the schemes are treated as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Contributions to defined
contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The notes to the accounts continue to include the required disclosures in accordance with the transitional provisions of
FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits”.

ACCOUNTING
POLICIES RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 51
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the aggregate of the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions made prior to January 1998 remains eliminated against reserves. This will be charged
in the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions made since 1st January 1998 is shown as an asset and (in accordance with FRS 10)
each acquisition is assessed to determine the useful economic life of the business and the goodwill. For the types of
business normally acquired by the company, the board considers that the goodwill is an inseparable part of the total
value of the relevant business. These are service businesses which are not subject to high volatility in fashions or markets
and demand for these services is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Such businesses, if properly managed,
should grow in value over the years and hence neither the value of the business nor the goodwill have a measurable
useful economic life and the goodwill is not amortised. This treatment of goodwill represents a departure from the Act
which requires goodwill to be amortised over its useful economic life. However, such departure is permitted under the
Act in order to give a true and fair view. The directors believe that it is not possible to identify a finite life for goodwill
in respect of acquisitions and accordingly, the treatment of goodwill identified above is necessary in order to give a true
and fair view. In view of the inability to identify a finite life for goodwill in respect of acquisitions, it is not possible to
quantify the effects of such departure from the Act. In the event that it could be considered that the value of the
business or its goodwill does have a measurable economic life, then the goodwill would be amortised through the profit
and loss account by equal instalments over such useful economic life. The potential lives of the businesses and goodwill
are reviewed annually and revised where appropriate.
In the event that the useful economic life did not exceed 20 years, goodwill would be subject to an impairment review at
the end of the year of acquisition and at any other time in the event that the directors believe that an impairment may
have occurred. Where the goodwill is assigned a useful economic life which is in excess of 20 years or is indefinite, the value
of the relevant businesses and goodwill are assessed for impairment against carrying values on an annual basis in
accordance with FRS 11. Any impairment would be charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which it arises.
Provision for depreciation of freehold buildings is made in equal annual instalments of 1% to 2% of cost. Leasehold
land and buildings are amortised in equal annual instalments over the periods of the leases subject to a minimum
annual provision of 1% of costs. No depreciation is charged on freehold land or fixed assets under construction. When
properties are sold the difference between sales proceeds and net book value is dealt with in the profit and loss
account. In accordance with FRS 15 annual impairment reviews are performed for properties with a useful economic life
of greater than 50 years at the balance sheet date.
Other tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Provision for depreciation is made in equal annual
instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
4 to 5 years - Vehicles
3 to 10 years - Plant, machinery and equipment, tropical plants and their containers on rental
3 to 10 years - Office equipment, furniture and fittings. 
The company selects its depreciation rates carefully and reviews them regularly to take account of any changes in
circumstances. When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the company takes into account are expected
technological developments, expected market requirements and the intensity of which assets are used.
Where the group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is
treated as a finance lease. Other leases are treated as operating leases. Future instalments payable under finance leases,
net of finance charges, are included in borrowings with the corresponding asset values recorded in fixed assets and
depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their lease terms. Lease payments are apportioned
between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account as interest, and the capital element which
reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provision is made in accordance with FRS 12 for:
Vacant property - In respect of vacant and partly sub-let leasehold properties to the extent that future 
rental payments are expected to exceed future rental income.
Environmental - For all known liabilities to remediate contaminated land on the basis of management’s 
best estimate of the costs of these liabilities.
Self insurance - For all claims incurred as at the balance sheet date based on actuarial assessments of these
liabilities.
Other provisions - For all other known liabilities which exist at the year end based on management’s best 
estimate as to the cost of settling these liabilities.
The derivative instruments used by the group, which are used solely for hedging purposes (i.e. to offset foreign
exchange and interest rate risks), comprise currency and interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward
foreign exchange contracts. Such derivative instruments are used to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying
exposure of the group in line with the group’s treasury policies.
Interest rate differentials under swap arrangements and forward rate agreements used to manage interest rate
exposures are recognised by adjustment to net interest payable. Premiums or discounts arising on the purchase of
derivative instruments are amortised over the shorter of the life of the instrument and the underlying exposure.
Currency swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at closing rates of exchange. Where the
borrowings are used to finance net overseas investments exchange differences are taken to reserves in accordance with
SSAP 20. Resulting gains and/or losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related borrowings or,
where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in
the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the taxable profits and
results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all the available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal
of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be
rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold. Neither is deferred tax recognised
on overseas profits where there is no commitment to remit those profits to the UK.
Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Own shares held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust to satisfy obligations under the Rentokil Initial share option
schemes are carried at cost as part of fixed asset investments. These amounts will be transferred to shareholders’ funds
in 2004 in accordance with UITF 38 published in December 2003 and effective for accounting periods ending on or after
22nd June 2004. If the cost of these shares were to exceed the anticipated proceeds on exercise of the options by
employees, the excess will be written off to the profit and loss account in accordance with UITF 17.

ANALYSIS

Notes to the Accounts
The analysis of turnover is based on the country in which the order is received and would not be materially different if
based on the country in which the customer is located. Turnover from franchisees and from an associate in Asia have
been included to reflect the involvement by management in these businesses.
Interest and net debt are managed by the central treasury function and therefore it is not considered appropriate to
analyse these by segment.
Cost of sales and administrative expenses include, in respect of businesses acquired during 2003, £15.8m and 
£3.2m respectively.
During the year the group disposed of 5 non-core businesses with net assets of £6.3m (after minority interests) for a
consideration of £4.8m, realising a loss on disposal of £0.2m after the write back of £1.7m of negative goodwill and
providing £0.4m to cover warranty claims. In addition, a further £11.5m relates to a charge against the recoverability of
deferred consideration regarding two businesses disposed of in 2000.

As a substantial proportion of profits are generated outside the UK, the standard rate of tax has been determined as
the weighted average of the standard rates of tax in each of the different countries where profits are generated. The
relevant rates were 32.1% in 2003 and 32.3% in 2002.
Based on current capital investment plans, the group expects to continue to be able to claim capital allowances 
and goodwill deductions in excess of depreciation in future years.

Notes to the Accounts
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders by the weighted average
number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust for UK
Employees (note 12) where dividends have been waived.
For adjusted earnings per share, the profit attributable to shareholders is adjusted for the exceptional loss on disposal
of businesses (note 3), and is presented to reflect the ongoing performance of the group. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all
dilutive potential shares. The company has only one category of dilutive potential shares, being those share options granted
to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the company’s shares during the year.

Under the provisions of the accounting policy set out on page 51, goodwill is carried as an intangible asset on the
balance sheet. The directors have reviewed these acquisitions and have determined that, as service businesses which are
not subject to high volatility in fashions or markets, demand for these services is likely to continue for the foreseeable
future. Hence neither the value of these businesses nor the associated goodwill have a measurable useful economic life
and the goodwill is therefore not being amortised. The useful economic lives and values of the businesses and goodwill
were re-assessed as at 31st December 2003.

Vacant properties
The group has a number of vacant and partly sub-let leasehold properties, with the majority of the head leases expiring
before 2020. Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments together with other outgoings, after taking
into account existing sub-tenant arrangements and assumptions relating to later periods of vacancy. 
Environmental
The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and
provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
Self insurance
The company purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks in order
to limit the maximum potential loss that the company could suffer in any one year. Individual claims are met in full by
the company up to agreed self-insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The calculated cost of self-insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance 
sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions. The annual review of these provisions by external actuaries resulted 
in an increase in the reserves and in the insurance charge to the profit and loss account in the year of £1.1m 
(2002: £1.0m - credit).
Other provisions
Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating

Floating rate cash earns interest at commercial rates in line with local market practice. Central treasury companies invest
all significant cash surpluses in major currencies (£, US$ and Euro) at money market rates.
Fixed rate cash deposits include £13.5m (2002: £15.6m) invested in UK and US Government bonds which are held 
by the group’s insurance operations in accordance with local insurance regulations and are used to meet insurance
liabilities as they fall due. The weighted average interest rate earned is 6.0% (2002: 6.3%) and the weighted average
rate is fixed for 1.0 years (2002: 1.8 years).
Short term deposits are placed with banks usually for maturities of up to six months and earn interest at market rates
related to the currency and the sums invested.

Notes to the Accounts
The table opposite provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the group’s
financial assets and financial liabilities at 31st December 2003 and 2002. Fair value is the amount at which a financial
instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties (other than a
forced or liquidation sale) and excludes accrued interest. Where available, market values have been used to determine
fair values. Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows
at relevant interest and exchange rates.
The company has issued the following medium term notes under its m2.5bn Euro Medium Term Note programme:
CURRENCY/AMOUNT INTEREST COUPON MATURITY DATE
m50m Floating rate - 3 month EURIBOR +0.4375% 7.10.04
m13m Floating rate - 3 month EURIBOR +0.31% 1.11.04

m500m Fixed rate - 5.75% pa 21.05.07
£250m Fixed rate - 6.125% pa 19.11.08
The aggregate book and fair values for these notes are reflected in the opposite table.
The fair value of other short term borrowings and long term borrowings (under which short term drawings are made under
committed credit facilities which mature in October 2006) approximate to their book values given their short term maturity.
Other debtors include a balance of £143.0m (2002 restated: £135.8m) in respect of a convertible loan note issued by
Ashtead Group plc (“Ashtead”) in partial consideration for their purchase of our former US plant services business. The
note has a final maturity date of 31st March 2008 and interest accrues at 5.25% per annum. At 31st December 2003 £9.0m
(2002 restated: £1.8m) of this balance is represented by accrued interest.
In March 2003 the board of Ashtead announced that it had defaulted under its banking arrangements as a direct result
of uncertainties in the current and prior year reported results of its US Sunbelt Rental business. These uncertainties have
since been resolved. Ashtead has also taken a number of steps to improve its financial reporting controls and has also re-
negotiated its medium-term financing agreements to resolve the existing defaults thereunder. As part of these steps, on
30th May 2003, the convertible note holder, BET Ltd, agreed to certain amendments to the original terms of the
convertible note. These amendments included the deferral of the interest payments due for the period 1st April 2003 to
31st January 2005 until the earlier of 31st January 2005 or the date of a full refinancing of Ashtead’s senior debt. Interest
continues to accrue at the original note rate of 5.25%p.a., compounding on the respective original interest repayment
due dates. A refinancing fee of £1.5m will also be payable by Ashtead on the earlier of 31st January 2005 or the date of
a full refinancing of Ashtead’s senior debt.
On 22nd January 2004 Ashtead announced its interim results for the six months to 31st October 2003 and updated the
market on its trading prospects. These indicated both a gradually improving trading position and continuing emphasis on
cash flow generation from operations and selective non-core asset disposals. Ashtead also stated that it continued to
examine options for refinancing their bank facilities and remain confident that they will do so well before January 2005
particularly given the favourable indicators seen regarding the economic recovery in the USA. Ashtead also said that whilst
no guarantee could be given that they would be able to refinance, they would, as time progresses, review other options
in parallel to facilitate repayment of their facilities. Since their recent trading announcement the Ashtead share price has
risen from 18.0p to 30.0p as at the date of this report. On 24th March 2004, Ashtead announced the appointment of
Deloitte & Touche LLP as their auditors upon the resignation of the previous auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

In accordance with FRS 13 disclosure requirements a fair value of £114.6m (2002 restated: £135.8m) has been ascribed to
the convertible note. This has been calculated after discounting the cash flows of the note in accordance with the
conditions prevailing at 31st December 2003 at the then market interest rates and after due adjustment for credit risk. 
No fair value sum has been ascribed to the equity conversion option given that the option conversion strike price of £1.50
is at significant variance to Ashtead’s share price at 31st December 2003 of 15.5p.
The company will continue to monitor any further announcements by Ashtead and take any steps as may be required in
the future to protect the note holder’s legal rights.
Debtors include £1.9m (2002: £9.4m) of interest bearing and £2.5m (2002: £9.0m) of non interest bearing notes and
deferred consideration received in respect of non-core business disposals. The notes/deferred consideration have final
maturities between 2004 and 2008, although earlier repayments may be precipitated under the terms of the respective
disposal notes/sale agreements.
The group does utilise foreign currency short term and long term borrowings to hedge overseas acquisitions and
investments. Any differences between the book values and the fair values for these borrowings are shown on page 63.
Currency exposures
As explained in the Finance Director’s Review on page 17 the group’s currency borrowings (including those held in its
main operating businesses) are used to hedge the exchange effects arising from the retranslation of its net overseas
investments. Gains and losses arising on net overseas investments and the currency borrowings used to hedge the
currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses in accordance with SSAP 20.
The group’s businesses provide goods and services in their local economies, sourced predominately from the local
economies. As a consequence the group’s businesses do not have any material transactional currency exposures nor any
material foreign currency assets or liabilities by reference to their reporting currencies. Such foreign exchange
differences which do arise on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the
group companies and the group (2003: £nil, 2002: £0.1m).
Hedges
Other than the gains and losses on net interest rate and currency swaps noted in the fair value table on page 63, there are
no material unrecognised or deferred gains or losses at either year end in respect of financial instruments used as hedges.
Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the group’s financial liabilities, other than short term trade creditors and
accruals, at 31st December was as follows:

The group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees. The major schemes
are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the United Kingdom is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme which has a number of defined
benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants and a defined contribution section.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are carried out every three years. The most recent actuarial valuation was at 1st
April 2002. It was carried out using the projected unit method and the principal assumptions made by the independent
professional actuary were that pensions would increase by either 2.7% per annum or 3.6% per annum, pensionable
salaries would increase by 3.8% per annum and pensions would be discounted back to the valuation date using discount
rates of 6.7% per annum for the period after retirement and 7.2% per annum for the period before retirement.
The market value of the scheme’s assets totalled £613.9m as at 1st April 2002. However, for the purposes of the
valuation, the assets were adjusted by £55.6m to reflect the underperformance of the scheme’s actual investments
relative to a portfolio of bonds over the preceding three years. The combined value of the assets and the above
smoothing adjustment represented 115% of the value of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected
future increases in pensionable salaries and pensions.
In light of the results of the 2002 actuarial valuation, the company is resuming contributions to the defined benefit
sections of the scheme of approximately £8.0m in March 2004. Thereafter it is anticipated that further annual payments
will be necessary (currently estimated to be £12.0m in March 2005).
The world-wide pension cost for the group was £15.2m (2002: £12.4m) of which £4.5m (2002: £3.1m) related to the
group’s total UK pension cost which was calculated using the same assumptions as above. The above UK pension cost
makes allowance for a credit of £5.0m in respect of experience surpluses that are being recognised over 11 years, the
average future service lives of employees in the scheme. There is a prepayment of £14.9m (see note 14) in the group’s
balance sheet (2002: £19.4m) in respect of the UK scheme resulting from the difference between contributions paid and
pension costs charged to date.
The additional disclosures required under FRS 17 are shown below. These relate only to the main UK scheme but they
would not be materially different if they included the defined benefit schemes which operate in other countries.
The numbers shown in this disclosure have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK scheme as at 1st
April 2002 updated by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess
the liabilities of the scheme at 31st December 2003. Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31st December 2003.

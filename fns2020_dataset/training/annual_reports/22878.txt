Strategic Report
We aim to manufacture better 
casing for every sausage
Devro at a glance
Our mission Our business model
Extracting collagen
Collagen used for casing and gel  
is taken from the hides of carefully 
selected animals – officially approved 
for human consumption.
Operating safely,  
to provide the world’s 
food manufacturers 
with a safe and secure 
supply of consistently 
better collagen 
products, helping 
them optimise 
efficiency and 
enhancing the value 
of their offering.
Why our business exists
Devro’s collagen casing is used to 
manufacture all varieties of sausage. 
Historically, animal intestines were  
used as casing for sausage, but over  
the past 50 years the use of collagen 
casing has significantly increased,  
as it enables food manufacturers to 
automate production and reduce costs. 
It is better suited to contemporary food 
hygiene and traceability requirements, 
and technical specifications can be 
determined in advance. 
What our customers do
Devro’s customers manufacture 
branded and own-label sausage 
products worldwide, reaching 
consumers through retail and  
food service outlets.
Manufacture
Devro is a world leader in the 
manufacturing technology of this 
highly sophisticated process. Our 
casings are consistent, reliable and 
versatile to suit the needs of both 
sausage manufacturers and  
consumer preferences.
Applied technology
The production of collagen casing is a 
complex technological process. Devro 
combines expertise and innovation  
to produce casings that allow our 
customers to make better sausage.
How we do this
How we create value
Devro creates value by converting  
a basic raw material, collagen, from 
the inner layer of cattle and sow 
hides, into a homogeneous gel and 
extruding it to tightly controlled 
dimensions, before being compressed 
and packed for supply to customers. 
Devro’s manufacturing processes are 
unique and have evolved over many 
years of technical development. 
Who we sell to
Devro’s revenue comes primarily from 
the sale of collagen products directly 
to food manufacturers and, in some 
markets, local distributors. Devro sells 
to over 1,000 customers in more than 
100 countries, with a product range  
in excess of 500 individual items, 
covering eight principal types  
of application.  3
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Sales, marketing & distribution
Devro products are sold across all 
continents in over 100 countries. We 
sell directly to food manufacturers 
and via agents and distributors.
Reinvesting in our business
Devro has a successful track record  
of applied research and development 
and focused capital investment.
Customer products to consumers
Devro’s innovation and casing 
performance allow our customers  
to produce differentiated products 
for the consumer. Our casings 
consistently score highly for 
appearance, colour, bite and  
overall acceptance in independent 
research and consumer testing.
Approximately one-third of Devro’s 
sales are in emerging markets and 
two-thirds are in developed markets. 
Over 100 Devro employees work in 
customer-facing operations as sales  
and technical advisers.
The market we are in
Devro is one of five significant 
producers globally of collagen casing  
in the world market, with a number  
of smaller local or regional competitors. 
Additional value is created for the 
customer by collaborating with specialist 
food machinery manufacturers and 
suppliers of food ingredients to  
optimise product performance.
What makes us different
Devro differentiates itself from 
competitors by developing innovative 
new products, by working closely 
with customers to enhance their 
manufacturing efficiencies and by 
providing high-quality technical 
support to customers.
Why our customers choose Devro
To satisfy our customers’ demands, 
we use our knowledge of how to 
manipulate the complex chemistry of 
collagen to balance the requirements 
of food producers for strength  
and size stability with consumer 
preferences for tenderness and bite.  4

A global footprint in changing times
Understanding our markets
Introduction
There have been many improvements  
in edible collagen casing over the past 
50 years; some as a result of technical 
developments and others as a result of 
improved plant manufacturing systems. 
The continued significant investment 
over many years by Devro has enabled 
the provision of a unique, modern, safe 
and secure edible collagen casing that 
runs more efficiently on sausage 
production lines at much higher speeds 
and produces better sausage products 
that are widely accepted by consumers.
Today, Devro products are sold by  
our dedicated commercial teams,  
in association with our experienced 
distributor network, to over 100 
individual markets and are used in  
the production of a huge variety of 
regional and national sausage types.
Maintaining a detailed understanding  
of our markets and our customers has 
been, and continues to be, a key aspect 
of our business philosophy.
Growth
Lower cost opportunities for sausage 
producers, combined with consumer 
acceptance, continue to drive the 
demand for edible collagen casing.
Over the past 10 years there has  
been a steady increase in the volume  
of edible collagen casing used in 
sausage production.
Trends
There are numerous social and 
demographic factors that are 
contributing to the growth in the 
consumption of sausage, and 
consequently an increased growth in  
the use of edible collagen casing, across 
both developed and emerging markets.
The growth in global population 
continues to be a key driver, particularly 
in relation to the rapid increase in the 
rate of urbanisation. Consumers are 
being exposed to a much wider choice 
and better availability of sausage within 
the urban environment, compared to 
those who are living in rural areas. The 
global population living in an urban 
environment has surpassed that of  
rural and is forecast to continue to  
rise steeply. This urbanisation trend 
contributes significantly towards 
improved living standards and rising 
incomes which in turn influence the 
affordability of sausage and processed 
meat products.
The improvement in the availability  
of sausage and processed meat 
products gives rise then to increased 
average meat consumption across  
both developed and emerging markets.
From our creation over 50 years ago, Devro has 
evolved into an established leading supplier of 
edible collagen casing throughout the world.

Americas
The Americas remains a strong market 
for edible collagen casing, particularly  
in the small calibre snack stick sector  
in North America. Rapid growth in 
demand in a number of Latin American 
countries continues, driven by 
increasing meat consumption and 
improving economic conditions.
Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA)
EMEA continues to be a major market 
for the use of edible collagen casing  
and remains a market where there is 
potential for future growth via further 
conversion of animal intestines to edible 
collagen casing. Many markets within 
Europe, including Germany, are highly 
developed, sophisticated and mature 
markets for sausage manufacture. 
However, traditional techniques are  
still widely employed and many of the 
premium products remain in animal 
intestines. As Devro’s new generation of 
edible collagen products are introduced, 
more and more producers and retailers 
are looking closely at the cost savings 
that can be made by converting to 
edible collagen casing.
Asia-Pacific
In Asia and the Pacific regions, growth 
in the use of edible collagen casing 
continues strongly. Asia-Pacific has  
the largest single edible collagen  
casing market, which is China. Use  
of the product has grown considerably, 
primarily due to the increase in 
urbanisation and the growing popularity 
of Western-style sausage. The 
investment in modern manufacturing 
processes and the need for efficient 
manufacturing of safe and secure 
quality sausage has driven producers  
to explore more urgently the benefits  
of edible collagen casing.

Our strategy in action 9
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
With our new plant in Nantong, 
China, fully commissioned  
and operational, we now plan  
to capitalise fully on this.
During 2016, whilst revenue increased 
4.7% due to favourable exchange rate 
movements, sales volumes declined  
by 6.6% due to region-specific factors.
Actions have been taken in 2016 to 
ensure a return to growth in 2017 and 
beyond. These include an acceleration 
of the revenue growth component of 
the Devro 100 programme, focused  
on significantly upgrading our sales 
capabilities. This involves further 
development of key account 
management processes and the 
strengthening of our sales management 
in key markets.
The collagen casings market in China 
now accounts for around 40% of total 
global demand and, with the completion 
of our new local manufacturing plant in 
2016, we are well positioned to grow our 
sales there. This market is expected to 
grow at 3-5% per annum over the 
coming years.
£241.1m
Revenue 
Prior to the investment  
in the plant in Nantong, 
Devro supplied the Chinese 
market with casings from 
the other plants in our 
global network. 
The completion of our new domestic 
facility has enabled us to focus on 
qualifying products with existing  
and potential customers, which is 
progressing well. 
 
Hui Yi explains: 
 
“We have had very positive feedback from 
a broad customer base who have started 
to use casing from the new Nantong 
plant. We are delivering strong growth in 
sales as customers see our products 
delivering production efficiency and 
lowering their costs of manufacture. 
 
“They also see better attributes for 
consumers including the appearance and 
bite of the end product using our casing 
which keeps the consumers coming back 
to buy the sausages. We are continuing  
to build relationships with customers 
across the country and see sales  
moving forward.”

Having transformed our global 
manufacturing footprint, we  
are now focused on delivering  
a return on our investments.
With a three-year programme of 
investment and restructure across  
our global manufacturing footprint 
completed during 2016, we now  
have a modern asset base, effectively 
organised as one global supply chain. 
Our new facility in Sandy Run, South 
Carolina, USA is now on-stream. 
Although the transition from the old 
plant to the new, whilst maintaining 
production, was challenging, we look 
forward to improving efficiencies  
further in 2017.
The focus is now on maximising  
the potential across our global 
manufacturing base, harnessing  
our expertise to focus on global  
cost reduction initiatives.
 2 new

opened in 2016
During the past 18 months  
a number of projects have 
been underway to maximise 
capacity and efficiency in 
our production facilities.
One such initiative was the upgrade  
of a manufacturing unit in our Bellshill 
plant in Scotland. 
 
Karen Ferguson explains: 
 
“Since the unit was installed in 2011  
we have been continually working on 
improvements to ensure we get the best 
quality products and maximum capacity 
from the lines. In 2015 investment was 
approved to incorporate the latest 
technology in high-speed drying to 
further increase manufacturing capacity. 
 
“I joined Devro in 1997 as a Graduate 
Trainee and have been working as 
Engineering Project Manager since  
2014. I was delighted to be given the 
opportunity to manage a project aimed  
at increasing Devro Scotland’s ability to 
reduce cost of manufacture, and shape 
the future for casing manufacturing at  
our Bellshill plant.  
 
“Although technically challenging, the 
upgrade was successfully carried out  
to plan, with encouraging results being 
realised so far.”

invested in research and 
development in 2016 
An integral part of our  
success has been the ability  
to lead our market in 
developing differentiated 
products which meet the  
needs of our customers.
In 2016, we invested £8.0 million in 
research and development, a clear 
indication of our commitment and  
intent to remain the industry leader  
in innovation.
Our research capabilities were further 
enhanced by the acquisition of Devro 
B.V. in October 2015, which enabled 
collaboration in 2016 on key projects.
As part of the Devro 100 programme, 
significant progress was made during 
2016 on the next generation of 
products, which will start to launch  
in 2017.
Devro has a long history  
of collagen research, 
product development and 
service improvement. We 
are committed to creating  
a culture of innovation 
involving everyone in  
the organisation.
“Collaborating with external partners  
is not new to Devro and it is especially 
helpful when trying to solve issues where 
we don’t have the expertise within the 
company. Here at Devro we are also 
looking to learn from other organisations 
involved in Open Innovation and taking 
best practices from new research in this 
area. Working with external partners 
brings us closer to realising our strategic 
priorities whilst gaining access to 
up-to-the-minute technologies and 
expertise for mutual benefit.”
In conversation with Katrina Davidson,  
Open Innovation Coordinator, Devro Group 14
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report
After a three-year 
transformation period,  
in 2016 we achieved a 
major milestone with the 
completion, as planned,  
of our two capital 
investment projects  
in the USA and China. 
Chairman’s Statement
Global demand for collagen casings and 
related products grew by approximately 
4% in 2016. Regional variations led to a 
range of opportunities and challenges 
and the higher levels of capacity in  
the market provided customers with  
a range of options of varying quality  
and functionality.
Devro’s reported revenues were 4.7% 
above the prior year. This includes 
exchange rate movements, which were 
particularly beneficial in the second half. 
As previously guided, Devro’s revenues 
in constant currency declined 6.9% in 
the year. Volumes in Latin America, 
Continental Europe, Russia and China 
reduced, although China returned to 
year-on-year growth in the final quarter. 
The performance in these areas was 
partially offset by increased volumes, 
and stable or increasing local currency 
average sales prices, in Japan, South 
East Asia and the UK & Ireland.
After a three-year transformation period 
we achieved a major milestone in 2016 
with the completion, as planned, of our 
two capital investment projects in the 
USA and China. These new plants are 
now an integral part of our global 
manufacturing footprint. 
In our November 2016 trading update 
we highlighted that our anticipated  
sales volumes for 2017 will result in  
an under-utilisation of available global 
capacity. As a consequence the Board 
decided to accelerate and implement 
more extensively the next stage of the 
group’s strategic development. This 
programme, known as Devro 100, 
focuses on growing revenue through 
improving our sales capabilities, further 
improving manufacturing efficiencies to 
reduce unit costs and introducing the next 
generation of differentiated products. 
To underpin the Devro 100 programme, 
a significant change in the group’s 
organisation structure was implemented  
in the fourth quarter, under which we 
moved from local sales and manufacturing 
responsibilities to three sales-focused 
commercial regions, supported by 
global business development and global 
supply chain operations. The Board 
believes this will result in a strong focus 
on areas of future profit growth,  
faster development of new products 
and greater use of local operational 
expertise for the benefit of Devro 
worldwide by sharing best practices.
Given the extensive nature of this 
programme there will be a significant 
level of incremental costs during 2017 
and 2018 which will be reported 
separately as exceptional items.
Financial highlights
Underlying operating profit increased 
14% to £38.1 million (2015: £33.3 million), 
as it benefited from currency 
movements and lower input prices, 
which more than offset the effects  
of lower sales volumes.
After including exceptional items, 
operating profit was £15.4 million  
(2015: £19.2 million). A breakdown  
of exceptional items, together with a 
more detailed explanation of the group’s 
financial performance, is set out in the 
Financial Review on pages 18 to 23.
Board 
Rutger Helbing joined the Board in  
April 2016 as Group Finance Director 
following Simon Webb’s retirement  
in March.
In December, Malcolm Swift agreed  
to join our Board as a Non-Executive 
Director with effect from 26 April 2017. 
At this time, Paul Neep will stand down 
after 12 years as a Non-Executive 
Director: I am extremely grateful  
for his significant contribution.
Employees
The expertise, experience and 
commitment of so many people who 
work in Devro are key to the future 
success of the business. 2016 was a 
demanding year for all colleagues as  
we progressed with the transformation 
of the business. On behalf of the Board,  
I thank all employees for their contribution.
I am particularly impressed by the  
way that new employees, in China  
and elsewhere, have integrated and 
strengthened our capabilities in  
many areas. 15
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016

Dividend
The Board is proposing to maintain the 
final dividend at 6.1p per share (2015: 
6.1p) bringing the total for the year to 
8.8p per share (2015: 8.8p). Subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting in April, the dividend  
will be paid on 12 May 2017, to those 
shareholders on the register at  
31 March 2017.
Return on investments
Having completed the transformation  
of our global manufacturing footprint, 
we are now focused on the need to 
deliver a return on our investments at 
the same time as generating strong  
cash flow for the reduction of debt.  
The actions planned under the Devro 
100 programme will accelerate these 
returns. However we do recognise that 
the further exceptional items in 2017 and 
2018 represent an additional investment 
from our investors. We are convinced 
that, with the quality of our new 
production facilities and strengthened 
senior management capability across 
the group, combined with a new global 
organisation structure, Devro is well-
positioned to grow sales and reduce 
costs over the coming years. Our 
markets are dynamic and continue  
to grow, providing good opportunities  
for Devro to create long-term value  
for our shareholders.

Chief Executive’s Review
Following the significant capital 
investments we have made in recent 
years, our objective is to use our high-
technology assets to supply a growing 
global market with differentiated quality 
products, whilst reducing costs to levels 
substantially lower than has historically 
been possible with legacy facilities.
Markets overview
Devro supplies collagen casings, gel  
and film to over 100 countries worldwide. 
Current estimates are that this market  
is growing by 2-4% per annum. After a 
period of contraction in China in 2015, 
demand in this market returned to 
growth in 2016.
Markets have become increasingly 
competitive and customers are ever 
more demanding. Our markets are 
dynamic, presenting real opportunities 
for growth and development.
Strategy
Devro’s three-part strategy focuses  
on revenue growth, manufacturing 
efficiency and product differentiation. 
The Devro 100 programme will 
accelerate progress across all three 
elements, as outlined below.
Revenue growth
Reported revenue increased 4.7%, 
strongly impacted by movements in 
exchange rates, particularly during  
the second half. Revenue in constant 
currency reduced 6.9%, reflecting  
lower sales volumes. 
Over 80% of the group’s sales come 
from edible collagen casings, for which 
total volumes declined 8.2% compared 
to prior year. This was due to a series of 
region-specific factors and actions have 
been taken to ensure a return to growth 
during 2017 and 2018. 
Volumes in the UK & Ireland increased 
by 1.3% accompanied by continued 
progress in pricing. There have been 
some significant transfers of volume 
between UK sausage manufacturers 
during 2016, which has enabled Devro  
to increase its market share.
In Continental Europe, volumes declined 
7.5% in an environment of increased 
competition over recent years. In order 
to compete more effectively in this 
market we are in the process of 
significantly upgrading our sales 
capabilities, as part of the Devro 100 
programme. Volumes in Germany grew 
2.1% as a result of working closely with 
customers to address their needs 
through our extensive product portfolio.
Volumes in Russia and surrounding 
markets were down 13.0% for the year 
reflecting the extremely competitive 
nature of the market in Russia that has 
been further exacerbated by the weak 
rouble. Our sales run-rate improved in 
the second half following the launch  
of a new product offering in Russia  
that was specifically developed to  
meet these market conditions. Other 
markets in the region, including Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan and Belarus, maintained 
similar volumes to prior year.
North America volumes declined 4.8% 
over the year, with most of the decline in 
the final quarter, particularly as one key 
account reduced inventories to manage 
working capital. We expect our volumes 
in this market to return to growth in 2017.
Our Latin America business was 
impacted by the change in sourcing 
away from the old USA plant, as part  
of the transformation of our global 
manufacturing operations. Despite 
extensive development and testing, 
when manufactured on a commercial 
scale it was found that the redesigned 
products were not able to meet 
customer needs, given their unique  
and demanding applications, resulting  
in a 33.5% volume reduction. Whilst 
many technical challenges have now 
been resolved, the process of scaling up 
testing and requalifying products will 
take time and we do not expect a major 
recovery in Latin America volumes until 
2018. This remains a key area of focus 
for the group.
Volume growth remained strong in 
Japan (+4.5%), where Devro casings 
have been used to develop a successful 
application in the confectionery market, 
sales of which have continued to

demand efficiently. This investment has 
been completed and all operations are 
now managed by the new global supply 
chain function. 
As the new China plant started up in the 
first half, 160 new colleagues joined the 
business in Nantong and, through the 
training and commissioning process, 
rapidly developed an impressive 
capability to manufacture high quality 
products. The plant is approved for 
sales inside China and for exports, has 
been accredited for FS22000 (the 
global food safety standard) and has 
recently achieved full Halal certification.
In the US, as well as bringing the new 
plant into operation, the closure of the 
old plant was completed at the end  
of the first half with the number of 
employees reduced by 200.
Devro 100 – Improving manufacturing 
efficiency
With the global manufacturing  
footprint now complete, the Devro  
100 programme will focus efforts  
on delivering significant further cost 
savings to improve the unit cost of 
production. The establishment of the 
global supply chain function will support 
this improvement through identifying 
and applying best practice across the 
global operations to achieve better 
efficiency and cost savings. 
As the new plants have been completed, 
engineering teams have returned to 
regular operations, enabling them to 
support this programme. In addition  
we are engaging external support, 
alongside our experienced employees,  
to assist with improving our existing 
processes through external benchmarking. 
Product differentiation
Effective research and development  
is key to product differentiation. An 
experienced group research team was 
established in 2015, which actively 
collaborates with external research 
projects to extend knowledge and 
identify opportunities. These capabilities 
were further enhanced through the 
acquisition of Devro B.V., which had  
built a strong technical skills base in 
co-extrusion gel.
Devro 100 – Next generation  
of differentiated products
The third element of Devro 100 is  
the development of next generation 
products, which will deliver casings 
offering a step-change in attributes and 
performance. During 2016 significant 
progress was made on this development 
and in 2017 we plan to commence the 
launch of some of these new products  
in certain regions, reflecting the specific 
requirements of these markets.
Outlook
Overall demand remains strong and  
we continue to see many attractive 
opportunities to grow the business.  
In 2017, we will focus on increasing 
revenue to regain market share, 
achieving cost savings across our global 
operations and commencing the launch 
of new, differentiated products, as part 
of the Devro 100 programme. The 
further exceptional costs of this 
programme are expected to be between 
£10-12 million over the next two years, 
plus capital investments of between 
£7-8 million, with expected benefits  
of between £13-16 million per annum  
by 2019. Over this period there will also  
be a focus on reducing net debt levels.
Combined with the upgraded global 
manufacturing asset base, we are 
confident this will deliver long-term 
growth.
Safety
It was a tragedy for all colleagues that 
there was a fatal accident at our Czech 
plant on 30 March 2016, involving a 
forklift truck. We co-operated closely 
with the relevant authorities in the 
investigation process and launched  
our own in-depth internal investigations 
to learn from this distressing incident. 
For further information on our safety 
management see pages 30 to 31.

expand. Volumes in South East Asia 
increased 5.9%, principally due to a 
strong recovery in Korea related to sales 
growth in the food service sector and a 
new product developed to meet local 
requirements. Volumes in Australia 
declined 7.8%, including the impact  
of one significant customer who moved 
to dual sourcing.
Devro’s volumes in China for the year  
as a whole were 31.4% below prior year, 
but were strong in the final quarter as 
volumes came on-stream from the new 
plant in Nantong. In 2016 there was an 
oversupply of product at the lower  
end of the market, which resulted  
in significant price-led promotional 
activity. Devro decided not to 
participate in this activity, particularly 
given the higher costs of importing 
products before the new plant became 
operational. Devro is now in a period  
of testing products from the new plant 
with existing and potential customers. 
The new casings are performing well, 
which is reflected in the return to 
year-on-year sales growth in the  
final quarter.
Total volumes of gel sold across the 
group increased over 30% through a 
combination of further growth in the  
US, as our existing customers increased 
their market share, and new volumes in 
Europe, as a result of the acquisition of 
Devro B.V. in 2015 plus the development 
of an additional key account.
Devro 100 – Revenue growth
A key element of the Devro 100 
programme is to significantly upgrade 
our sales capabilities. An extensive, 
structured plan is being implemented, 
with particular focus on ‘key account 
management’ processes. Several new 
senior sales managers joined the 
business, strengthening our presence  
in key markets. This programme has 
progressed well in 2016 and will 
continue during 2017. 
Manufacturing efficiency
Over the past three years, the business 
has undergone a significant programme 
of investment and restructuring, to 
ensure that we have modern production 
capacity capable of supplying future  18

Financial Review
The financial results for 2016 comprised a number of 
significant moving parts. In terms of operating profit for  
the year the adverse impact from lower sales volumes  
was offset by lower input prices and exchange rate benefits.
Cash flow in the year continued to be impacted by the 
completion of the capital investment projects in 2016,  
which required further planned capital expenditure, as  
well as exceptional cash costs. The total cash outflow  
related to completion of these projects was material at  
£40 million, although £17 million below 2015. Due to these 
cash investments, net debt increased as expected during the 
year, but was further impacted by the significant weakening 
of sterling. With underlying EBITDA for the year of £58.8 
million and covenant net debt (including derivative financial 
liabilities) of £156.2 million at year end, the net debt to 
EBITDA covenant ratio was 2.7 times at 31 December 2016.
There will be no further exceptional charges related to the 
capital investment projects. As highlighted in our November 
2016 trading update, the Devro 100 programme will result in 
additional exceptional costs until 2018, together with some 
related capital expenditure. However, the amounts will be at 
lower levels than those we have seen in each of the last  
three years. 
Going forward, the continued strong underlying cash 
generation from the business, combined with lower cash 
requirements for capital expenditure and exceptional items, 
will enable further reduction in net debt.

Revenue 241.1 230.2 +4.7% -6.9%
Revenue for the year was ahead of 2015, with the benefits of 
exchange rate movements more than offsetting the reduction 
in sales volumes. Year-on-year revenue growth can be 
analysed as follows:
2016 vs 
2015

Volume -6.6% +0.9%
Price/mix -0.3% +0.3%

The reduction in sales volumes primarily related to China, 
Continental Europe, Russia and Latin America. Volumes in 
China, Continental Europe and Russia were impacted by 
region-specific competitive pressures, although performance 
improved significantly in the second half of the year in China 
and Russia. In Latin America, the lower volumes resulted from 
product performance issues related to the change in sourcing 
Going forward, the continued strong 
underlying cash generation from the 
business, combined with lower cash 
requirements for capital expenditure  
and exceptional items, will enable  
further reduction in net debt.  19

away from the old USA plant as part of the transformation  
of the global manufacturing operations. Sales volumes grew 
in Japan, South East Asia and the UK & Ireland. 
Sales of gel continued to grow well in the USA, as customers 
transferred from cellulose applications to collagen co-
extrusion. There was a full year of gel sales in Continental 
Europe following the acquisition of PV Industries B.V. (now 
renamed Devro B.V.) in October 2015, which contributed 1.7% 
to volume growth. 
Price/mix was slightly adverse, through a combination of 
changes in the geographical mix of sales and an investment  
in pricing in a number of competitive markets, where tactical 
pricing was applied. The geographical mix impact primarily 
related to the reduction in volumes in the Americas where 
market prices are above the global average, partially offset  
by the reduced volumes in China where the prices are lower. 
Operating profit
Operating profit for the year can be analysed as follows:
2016 
£’m
2015 
£’m Change
Underlying EBITDA 58.8 49.7 +18.3%
Underlying depreciation & 
amortisation (20.7) (16.4) -26.2%
Underlying operating profit 38.1 33.3 +14.4%
Exceptional items (22.7) (14.1)
Operating profit 15.4 19.2
 
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit increased £4.8 million between 
2015 and 2016, as a result of a number of factors which are 
described below. 
The reduction in sales volumes by 6.6% reduced underlying 
operating profit by £6.5 million, and price/mix by a further 
£0.8 million as explained above.
Input prices were £4.5 million lower than prior year, which 
increased underlying operating profit, following further 
reductions in raw materials prices, particularly in the USA  
and Australia, combined with lower energy prices.
Overall manufacturing costs increased by £0.7 million, 
incorporating a number of factors. Production efficiency 
improved in Scotland and Australia compared with the first 
half of the prior year, which had been temporarily affected  
by the restructuring actions implemented in late 2014. With 
the new plants completing in 2016, there were changes in  
the fixed costs associated with the global manufacturing 
operation, comprising savings from the closure of the old  
USA plant and additional costs associated with the new plant 
in China. Given that capacity from the new plants was only 
available for a restricted period in 2016, these additional costs 
had a limited impact on underlying operating profit in 2016. 
However, there will be a full year impact in 2017. 
As highlighted in our November 2016 trading update, the 
lower sales volumes in 2016, which will result in a lower 
starting point for sales in 2017, combined with the full year 
availability of the capacity from our new plants, will result in 
an under-utilisation of available global capacity in 2017. This 
will adversely affect underlying operating profit in 2017, 
although it is expected to be partially offset by the full year 
impact of the savings from the closure of the old USA plant, 
together with global manufacturing efficiency savings from 
the Devro 100 programme.
Devro has operations around the world in multiple currencies. 
Net movements in exchange rates had a favourable impact  
on underlying operating profit of £5.3 million, reflecting the 
weakening of sterling against most other key trading 
currencies of the group compared to 2015, particularly  
during the second half of the year. 
Underlying operating profit also included the effects of a full 
year contribution from Devro B.V. of £0.6 million, which was 
acquired in October 2015, and other movements of £2.4 
million including reduced bonus payments.
Depreciation & amortisation
The increase in underlying depreciation and amortisation  
of £4.3 million comprises the commencement of depreciation 
of the new plants in 2016 (£2.3 million) and foreign exchange 
movements (£2.0 million).

The group has invested £110 million on the two capital

USA over the last three years, and the majority of the group’s 
capital investment during the year was related to the final 
phase of these projects. Both new plants are now in operation 
and the capital investment is complete, subject to 
approximately £3 million of capital retention payments  
which will be paid in 2017 once the associated criteria  
have been met.

Working capital improved by £2 million during the year with 
the benefits of lower receivables and higher payables being 
partially offset by increased inventories.
The movements in receivables and payables reflected 
improved working capital management, and the increase in 
inventories resulted from movements in foreign exchange 
(+£4 million) combined with some effects from the reduced 
sales volumes.
Cash flow and net debt
Devro continues to be a highly cash generative business. In 
order to fund the significant investments made as part of the 
transformation of the manufacturing footprint, additional long 
term facilities were put in place in 2014 to supplement the 
shorter term facilities.
The three-year investment programme came to an end in 
2016 and, as expected, net debt increased to £153.6 million  
at 31 December 2016 (or £156.2 million including derivative 
financial liabilities) compared with £125.5 million at year end 
2015. This includes the effect of a significant weakening of 
sterling during 2016 (given that a part of the group’s debt is 
denominated in US dollars), in particular following the result 
of the EU Referendum vote on 23 June 2016, which increased 
the reported net debt figure at 31 December 2016 by 
approximately £19 million (including the effect on derivative 
financial liabilities).
Key financial measures are as follows:
2016 2015
Net debt £153.6m £125.5m
Covenant net debt/underlying  
EBITDA ratio 2.7 times 2.6 times
Underlying operating cash flow £64.4m £53.1m
Return on capital employed (ROCE) 11.5% 11.5%
At 31 December 2016, the covenant net debt / underlying 
EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times. As expected, this was a reduction 
from the 2.9 times ratio reported at 30 June 2016. The 
underlying EBITDA to net interest payable ratio was 7.6 times 
at 31 December 2016, meaning that both ratios were within 
their limits despite the changes in exchange rates during 
the year. 
Now that the capital investment projects are complete, cash 
generated from the business will enable net debt levels to  
be reduced, which will ultimately result in the covenant ratios 
returning nearer to historic levels. 
The group remained within its funding facilities throughout 
the year, which include the US$100 million US private 
placement that took place in the first half of 2014, and the 
£110 million revolving credit facility which was negotiated  
in December 2014 and will be in place until 2019. 
Underlying operating cash flow (before pension deficit 
funding) was £64.4 million (2015: £53.1 million), an increase  
of £11.3 million relating to higher EBITDA and lower net 
working capital. 
Cash outflow from exceptional items was £22.9 million  
(2015: £15.5 million) and from pension deficit funding was 
£2.5 million (2015: £3.2 million), resulting in operating cash 
flow of £39.0 million (2015: £34.4 million).

Net finance cost 6.9 2.0
Net finance cost on pensions 2.3 2.1
Total net finance cost 9.2 4.1
As expected, the net finance cost for the year was higher  
than 2015 due to the increased level of net debt in 2016,  
which also attracts a higher rate of interest, and the ceasing 
of capitalisation of interest during the first half once the new 
plants became available for use. Capitalisation of interest in 
2016 was £0.5 million (2015: £2.7 million). 
The small increase in net finance cost on pensions over 2015 
reflects the higher discount rates assumed at the end of last 
year compared to the year before.
Pension schemes
Devro operates a number of defined benefit schemes  
around the group, although all of these are now closed to  
new entrants. The net pension liabilities of these schemes  
can be analysed as follows:
2016 
£’m
2015 
£’m
Fair value of scheme assets 254.8 225.4
Present value of scheme liabilities (350.8) (281.8)
Net pension liabilities (96.0) (56.4)
The increase in net pension liabilities during the year largely 
reflects the lower discount rates at the end of 2016, compared 
with the end of last year, especially in the UK. Further analysis 
of the movement in net pension liabilities is set out in note 25 
to the financial statements.

Tax credit on exceptional items (2.7) (3.1)
Tax charge in income statement 4.0 0.5
The group operates around the world and earns profits  
which are subject to tax at differing rates in different tax 
jurisdictions. The investment incentives the group had 
previously benefited from in the Czech Republic became fully 
utilised in 2015, and as a result the group’s underlying tax rate 
increased this year to 23% (2015: 12%). 
Earnings per share

Underlying basic earnings per share 13.3p 15.4p
Basic earnings per share 1.3p 8.8p
We have again presented an adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) measure, which excludes exceptional items, to provide 
a better indication of our underlying performance of the 
group. Underlying basic EPS reduced by 2.1 pence with the 
improvement in underlying EPS due to increased underlying 
operating profit (+2.9p) being more than offset by the effects 
of increased interest (-3.1p) and the higher effective tax 
rate (-1.9p).
The change in reported basic EPS reflects the lower 
underlying basic EPS plus higher exceptional costs in 2016.

of 6.1 pence per share, which will be payable on 12 May 2017  
to shareholders on the register at 31 March 2017.
Alternative performance measures
In addition to statutory financial measures, management  
uses certain alternative performance measures (which are  
not defined by IFRS) to assess the operating performance 
and financial position of the group. The alternative 
performance measures that Devro uses are ‘constant 
exchanges rates’, ‘underlying’, ‘earnings before interest,  
tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)’, ‘net debt’, 
‘covenant net debt’ and ‘return on capital employed’.
Constant exchange rates
The group has operations across the world in multiple 
currencies, and is exposed to translation risk on fluctuations  
in foreign exchange rates. As a result, the group’s reported 
revenue will be impacted by movements in actual exchange 
rates. The group presents revenue growth on a constant 
currency basis in order to eliminate the translation effect  
of foreign exchange rate movements, enabling investors to 
better understand the operational performance of the group.
Revenue growth at constant currency is calculated by 
translating both the current and prior year local currency 
amounts using the prior period average exchange rates.  22

Underlying
Underlying figures are stated before exceptional items.  
Devro is undergoing a major transformation including the 
construction and start-up of two new plants in China and the 
US which completed in 2016, a restructuring of operations in 
Scotland and Australia initiated in 2014 and the Devro 100 
programme which will continue until 2018. The incremental 
costs associated with implementing this transformation are 
significant, and as a result have been classified as 
exceptional items. 
Reported operating profit reflects the costs associated with 
the transformation without the benefits of the additional 
volumes expected to be generated in 2017 and beyond.  
The underlying measures have been adjusted to exclude 
exceptional items in order to give a more accurate 
representation of the costs incurred to manufacture the 
volumes produced in 2016. This treatment is consistent  
with the internal reporting used to manage the business.

EBITDA is defined as operating profit excluding depreciation 
and amortisation. This measure is used by management to 
assess operational efficiency and, given that it excludes 
non-cash depreciation and amortisation, it is a useful 
approximation for cash generation from operations. This 
measure is in common use elsewhere and a reconciliation

of how well the group is utilising its available capital, and  
is a measure in common use elsewhere. ROCE is calculated  
by presenting underlying operating profit as a proportion

Capital employed for this purpose is defined as net assets 
excluding interest-bearing assets and liabilities, derivative 
financial instruments, current and deferred tax balances,

Going concern
At 31 December 2016 the group was operating within the 
banking covenants related to its revolving credit facility and 
US private placement facilities. The group’s detailed financial 
forecasts indicate that there is sufficient headroom in the 
facilities for the foreseeable future and that they can be 
repaid in line with the expected terms.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the group have adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Like any other business, Devro’s operations are exposed to risks 
which could potentially have an adverse impact on the group.
The directors have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The 
main risks identified are set out in the 
following pages. Additional risks which 
are not presently known to management 
could also have an adverse effect on  
the company.
The Board has taken into consideration 
the principal risks when considering the 
adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting, and when assessing the 
prospects of the company for the 
purpose of the viability statement.
The going concern and viability 
statements can be found on page 43. 
In addressing and overseeing risk, the 
Board is supported by the Risk 
Committee. The Committee submits 
four formal reports to the Board in the 
course of the year. 
A report from the Committee can be 
found on page 42.
The Financial Reporting Council has 
encouraged companies to consider how 
Brexit might impact them, so we have 
separated this out from the list of other 
risks for a more detailed analysis in the 
box below:
Following the UK’s decision to leave 
the EU, the Government has now 
clarified its position: the UK will leave 
the EU, the Single Market and the 
current customs union, perhaps as 
early as mid-2019.
This has a number of implications for 
Devro. For example, while our Scottish 
factories mainly manufacture for the 
UK, some product is currently exported 
to the EU, and our Czech and Dutch 
plants send small amounts of their 
product to the UK. Our people move 
freely between our European plants.
All of the above could cease on Brexit, 
and while the UK Government has 
stated, with confidence, its intention  
to negotiate replacement trade 
agreements with the EU and other 
countries, it is not possible at this 
stage to gauge how successful they 
will be. The risk for UK-based 
exporters such as Devro Scotland,  
is that the proposed new international 
trading arrangements may not  
be secured before the existing  
framework is removed, or may be on 
disadvantageous terms compared to 
the current conditions. We are therefore 
preparing contingency plans based on 
various “worst-case” scenarios.
With six manufacturing operations 
around the world, Devro is well placed 
to reconfigure its global routes to 
market in order to adapt to changing 
regulatory restrictions. A review of the 
various potential supply permutations 
is underway.
Our Regulatory Affairs Director  
has established strong working 
relationships within government,  
and is working to ensure that collagen 
food products do not get overlooked 
in future trade discussions.
It is important to keep this in 
perspective: the great majority of 
Devro group production and trade is 
unaffected. The total volumes which 
could conceivably be impacted 
amount to no more than 8% of  
group output. 
The potential Brexit-related 
opportunities both here in the UK  
and overseas which could offset  
any downside are also under review.
With our global footprint, and 
contingency planning underway,  
we are well placed to deal with 
whatever emerges from the post-
Brexit negotiations.

Key risk Impact Mitigation Movement
LOSS OF MARKET SHARE/
PROFIT MARGINS DUE TO 
INCREASED COMPETITIVE 
PRESSURES
The group operates in 
competitive markets  
throughout the world.
Expansion by competitors could 
lead to overcapacity in the industry 
and the consequent risk of loss of 
volume or price pressure.
The group invested £8.0m in 
research and development activities 
in 2016, to extend and differentiate 
the product range and improve the 
quality of our products.
Our capital investment programme 
has started to reduce our unit costs 
with further actions planned for 
2017 and 2018. 
We also aim to expand the total 
collagen casings market by 
developing products which convert 
animal intestine applications to 
collagen casing.
FINANCIAL RISKS
The main financial risks relate  
to the availability of short and 
long-term funding.
Failure to operate within the agreed 
financial framework could lead to 
inability to support long-term 
investment or to raise capital for 
funding growth. Interest rate 
increases could impact earnings.
All term debt is arranged and 
managed centrally and appropriate 
covenant headroom is maintained.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
Almost 90% of the group’s 
revenues are invoiced in 
currencies other than sterling. 
Adverse foreign exchange  
rate movements could reduce 
revenues and the sterling value  
of reported profits. 
The financial impact of exchange 
rate fluctuations within our 
operating units is mitigated by  
a policy of hedging a substantial 
portion of transactional foreign 
exchange risk for periods of up to  
15 months using forward contracts.
DOWNTURN IN CONSUMER 
DEMAND
Consumer preferences evolve 
over time, and are influenced by  
a number of issues outside our 
control, including economic 
factors and health considerations.
A decline in consumer demand 
could lead to increased competition 
in the marketplace and reduced 
sales revenue/profitability.
Devro’s wide range of products 
allows flexibility to respond to 
customer and market demands.
We continue to invest heavily  
in our products and processes  
with the aim of increasing quality  
while reducing our cost base to 
remain competitive.
OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION
The group is at risk of disruption 
to its manufacturing capability 
from poor operational 
performance, or major disruptive 
events, such as fire or flooding.
Prolonged operational disruption 
could result in sustained loss of 
capacity or capability, and could 
affect our ability to deliver  
to customers.
This, in turn, could adversely affect 
the group’s financial performance.
The group maintains industry-leading 
operational processes and procedures 
to ensure effective operational 
management at each of our plants.
With six manufacturing operations 
in various locations, the group has 
manufacturing flexibility, and this 
enables effective contingency 
planning. Our business continuity and 
disaster recovery plans are regularly 
tested and continually updated.
Appropriate insurance policies are  
in place.

DISRUPTION TO SUPPLY OR 
INCREASE IN PRICE OF KEY 
RAW MATERIALS
The group’s most important  
raw material is collagen, a 
naturally occurring animal  
protein obtained from cattle  
and sow hides.
There is a risk that changes may 
occur in the supply or demand 
for food grade collagen, resulting 
in significant cost increases for 
the group’s business.
Raw collagen represents 
approximately 15% of the group’s 
total operating costs.
Increase in price would adversely 
impact the group’s operating costs.
Disruption to supply could adversely 
affect manufacturing performance.
The group manages the collagen 
sourcing risk by, where possible, 
entering into long-term 
arrangements with specialised 
suppliers in various parts of  
the world.
DEVELOPMENT OF NON-
CASING TECHNOLOGIES
More than 80% of the group’s 
revenue is derived from the 
manufacture and sale of edible 
collagen casing, primarily  
for sausages.
For many years, several 
manufacturers of machinery  
used in the food industry have 
been promoting “co-extrusion” 
systems for sausages which  
do not require casing.
If there were to be a significant 
conversion to co-extrusion, there 
could be an adverse effect on sales 
of casing, revenues and profits.
The group makes substantial 
investments in product 
development and manufacturing 
processes to sustain competitive 
advantage.
Where there have been conversions 
to co-extrusion in the past, the group 
has often been successful in obtaining 
the business to supply the collagen 
gel required for such applications, 
and, following the 2015 acquisition of 
Devro B.V., continues to be a world 
leader in this specialist category.
POLITICAL AND REGULATORY 
RISK
As a supplier to the food industry, 
the group complies with all 
relevant food safety regulations. 
Regulatory authorities routinely 
enact changes to food safety 
legislation.
Political uncertainty leaves 
international trading companies 
exposed to the risk of restrictions 
on cross-border sales.
As a global trading company, 
political change (including, but not 
limited, to Brexit) could impact our 
ability to operate internationally.
Changes to food safety regulations 
could result in restrictions on  
the movement of the group’s 
products, or its raw materials, 
between territories, or necessitate 
changes to the production 
processes at one or more of the 
group’s manufacturing operations. 
The Global Quality and Regulatory 
Affairs Director actively monitors 
planned and actual changes to 
regulations in all relevant 
jurisdictions in order to minimise 
disruption to our business.
The group is a founder member  
of the Collagen Casings Trade 
Association, which represents the 
industry and promotes its excellent 
record in regulatory and health 
issues. Supplier approval and 
traceability are under constant 
review.
See Brexit analysis on page 24.

PEOPLE
Shortage of people with relevant 
expertise.
There is considerable competition 
for highly-trained staff in certain 
areas. Devro’s strategy of significant 
investment in the company’s 
manufacturing base requires the 
recruitment and retention of 
highly-skilled technical managers 
and employees.
A number of internal programmes 
have been introduced to train and 
develop key employees.
INCREASED FUNDING 
REQUIREMENTS OF PENSION 
SCHEMES 
Estimates of the amount and 
timing of future funding 
obligations for the group’s 
defined benefit pension  
schemes are based on  
various assumptions, including 
the projected investment 
performance of the pension 
scheme assets, future bond 
yields, changes to assumptions 
about the longevity of the 
schemes’ members and  
statutory requirements.
Any significant deterioration in the 
schemes’ asset values or unforeseen 
increases in scheme liabilities might 
increase the group’s funding 
obligations and could adversely 
affect the group’s profits and 
financial strength.
The position and performance of 
each of the pension schemes are 
continually monitored by the group, 
in conjunction with pension trustees 
and professional advisers. 
All defined benefit schemes are 
closed to new entrants, and the 
group is actively working to match 
assets to expected future cashflow.
IT SYSTEMS/CYBER RISK
IT systems are central to our 
business operations. Vulnerability 
to an external attack is a growing 
worldwide issue.
An outage for a period of time could 
have an impact on our operations. 
Loss of commercial or personal data 
could damage the business or our 
reputation, and result in increased 
financial penalties.
We ensure that our systems  
are appropriately secured and 
employ firewalls and other security 
features. Regular penetration testing 
is conducted.
PRODUCT CONTAMINATION
Raw materials and ingredients 
may contain impurities, 
contamination or disease.
Contamination could lead to a 
product recall, loss of reputation,  
or significant costs of compensation.
All of our manufacturing sites have 
achieved FS22000 approval. This 
requires a Hazard Analysis and 
Critical Control Point programme  
to be implemented with the aim  
of preventing contamination.

Measuring our performance
Key Performance Indicators
We monitor our performance against our 
strategic objectives by means of Key 
Performance Indicators (“KPIs”). The most 
important of these KPIs at a group level 
focus on the following areas:
Revenue growth
Growing in developed and emerging markets
Manufacturing efficiency
Optimising our use of existing assets and investing  
in new technology
Product differentiation
Differentiating ourselves through research and development
Sales volume growth*
  
Underlying operating  
cash flow***
   
Volume growth of edible collagen casings (%)
Cash generated from underlying operations 
before pension deficit funding (£’m)
A key element underpinning the group’s strategy is 
to deliver growth in sales revenue. There are several 
components to revenue growth, including changes in 
sales volumes and in price/mix. As a result, the group 
monitors sales volume growth separately, and 
changes in price/mix are monitored through revenue 
growth. Devro sells to markets around the world from 
strategically located commercial operations and 
through an extensive network of distributors 
and agents.
Underlying operating cash flow is the amount of cash 
generated by the group through its trading activities 
and manufacturing operations before exceptional 
items, investment in capital expenditure and pension 
deficit funding. This measure is used to evaluate the 
performance of the business and to assist the 
management of working capital.
*  Continuing operations, and restated for revised pensions accounting rules (IAS 19R)  
where relevant.
** Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating both the current year  
and prior year local currency amounts using the prior period average exchange rates.

Revenue is monitored on the basis of operating 
segments as follows: Americas, Asia-Pacific and 
Europe. Given the significant distorting effects  
of movements in exchange rates, revenue growth  
is monitored in constant currency**.
Health and safety matters are discussed further  
on pages 30 and 31 of this Annual Report. Safety 
performance is measured in various ways at a local 
level. At group level, it is measured by the rate of 
injuries requiring treatment by a health professional, 
which is calculated as the number of injuries per 
million hours worked, comprising both lost working 
day injuries and recordable injuries.
Covenant net debt/underlying EBITDA measures 
the liquidity of the group. Underlying EBITDA/net 
interest measures our ability to service our 
net debt.
Underlying EBITDA is defined, explained and 
reconciled to equivalent statutory measures in  
the Financial Review on pages 21 to 23.
Covenant Net debt/underlying EBITDA and 
underlying EBITDA/net interest are the two key 
covenants for the short and long-term funding  
for the group, and are therefore monitored on an 
ongoing basis.
Covenant net debt includes derivative financial 
liabilities and is defined, explained and reconciled 
to equivalent statutory measures in the Financial 
Review on pages 21 to 23.
Return on capital employed (ROCE) represents 
underlying operating profit as a percentage of 
average capital employed. Capital employed is 
defined as fixed assets plus current assets less 
current liabilities, excluding all balances related to 
interest-bearing assets and liabilities, any derivative 
financial instruments, any deferred tax balances, and 
any pension assets or liabilities. It is a key indicator  
of how the company is making use of its available 
capital, and is a good reflection of the performance 
of the company in terms of both earnings and 
cash flow.

While the group aims to take a long-term perspective

performance of each of its businesses in the shorter 
term. The KPI used in this monitoring process is 
underlying operating profit. This measure is used to 
evaluate the performance of each business, including 
sales price, manufacturing efficiency and overhead 
and operating cost control.
Underlying operating profit excludes exceptional

Corporate Social Responsibility Report
Health and safety
In the last 10 years, we have focused  
on safety in the genuine belief that  
all accidents in the workplace are 
preventable. 2016 was a disappointing 
year, and we know that we must refocus 
our efforts in 2017 and beyond in order 
to regain momentum in this area.
It was a tragedy for all colleagues that 
there was a fatal accident at our Czech 
plant on 30 March 2016, involving a 
forklift truck. We co-operated closely 
with the relevant authorities in the 
investigation process and launched  
our own in-depth internal investigations 
to learn from this distressing incident. 
Effective from January 2017, a new  
role has been established to ensure  
total consistency in the management  
of safety at all sites, with direct 
responsibility for group-wide standards 
and their implementation. 
Safety underpins all our operational 
procedures with accountability for 
safety at every level of the organisation. 
We are committed to guaranteeing the 
physical and psychological integrity of 
our employees as we recognise that our 
employees are our greatest advocates 
and assets.
We believe that all work-related injuries 
and work-related ill health cases can be 
prevented. Our aim is to provide a safe 
and healthy working environment for all 
colleagues, contractors and visitors and 
ensure that everyone returns home 
safely when they finish their work.
• We will set consistent standards 
across all locations, have high 
expectations of others, recognise 
good safety behaviour and be 
uncompromising in tackling  
poor behaviour or unsatisfactory  
safety performance.
• We will ensure that safe systems  
of work are in place for all tasks,  
that risk assessments are 
documented and reviewed 
periodically and that they reflect  
the actual practices taking place  
in all parts of the organisation.
• We will ensure that robust incident 
investigations are carried out to 
determine the root cause, prevent 
recurrence and continually improve 
d ay - t o - d ay s a f e t y b e h av i o u r s  
and performance.
• We will communicate on safety issues 
and are committed to providing open 
and honest feedback on all safety 
and health concerns.
• We will ensure that all parts  
of the organisation adhere to a 
Management of Change process so 
that safety needs are addressed in 
advance of changes being made.
• We will provide the necessary 
competent resources for health and 
safety management and ensure that 
safety is afforded the correct priority 
on everyone’s agenda.
• We will provide safe working 
environments and promote healthy 
living to improve the health and 
well- being of our employees.
• We will respect all legislation.
Health and safety is our first priority  
and is always high on the agenda  
in meetings of senior management 
including the Executive Management 
Team and Board. In addition, the Board 
reviews the Global Health and Safety 
Statement annually.
The Board’s Health and Safety 
Committee reviews and monitors safety 
performance in each of the regions. All 
sites have an annual safety and training 
plan in place and these are submitted to 
the Committee at the start of the year 
for review.
The Committee met six times in 2016  
to review progress and meet with the 
regional safety committees.
As a global manufacturing business, we 
inevitably have an impact on the wider 
world. We take our responsibilities  
to society and the environment seriously 
and make sure they are reflected in all  
our group policies and statements. 31

2016 safety statistics
We recorded 10 lost working day 
incidents in 2016 compared to nine  
in 2015. The number of working days 
lost due to injury was 347 (2015: 206). 
These incidents demonstrate the need 
for continuous improvement in the 
management of health and safety  
risks in the workplace. 
Following every serious incident a full 
report is drafted with all remedial actions 
put in place as soon as is practical, with 
the circumstances shared at all sites to 
ensure the chance of recurrence 
elsewhere in the group is minimised.
The Chief Executive meets personally 
with every colleague who has been 
involved in a Lost Working Day Injury.
We also measure our performance by 
looking at the number of recordable 
injuries, those that need more attention 
than basic first aid and require the 
attention of a health professional. In 2016, 
there were seven recordable incidents 
reported which was a significant decrease 
from the 20 reported in 2015.
There were 1,885 behavioural audits 
conducted in 2016, lasting over 700 
hours, which identified over 1,500 
unsafe acts and conditions.
Devro is committed to pro-actively 
resolve hazards before an incident 
occurs. One of the key initiatives in 
achieving this is through effective near 
miss reporting. Devro understands that 
near miss reporting has many benefits 
which includes engaging the workforce 
(all workers at all levels) in solving 
problems, increasing safety ownership 
and reinforcing workers’ self-esteem  
and it develops a positive and necessary 
attitude surrounding safety.
In 2016, one of our core objectives  
was to increase near miss reporting 
throughout the organisation. Through 
this initiative we have as a result seen  
a 144% increase in the number of near 
misses reported from the workforce to 
259 (2015: 106).

Environment
As a manufacturer of goods operating 
across a global platform we are 
committed to the prevention of pollution 
and reducing our environmental impact. 
The main environmental impacts of our 
processes continue to be the emission 
of carbon dioxide and the generation  
of the solid waste from process which 
we send to landfill.
Within four of our major locations,  
and as a result of local regulatory 
requirements, we operate our own 
waste water treatment plants. In the 
fifth, Scotland, we partially treat our 
effluent to ensure we meet the outflow 
parameters before discharging directly 
into the public sewerage system, where 
our waste is combined with domestic 
effluent and treated by Scottish Water.
The environmental concerns, and  
thus pressures on Governments and 
communities, differ region by region.  
As a company with worldwide operations, 
our business similarly is subject to a 
variety of regulatory regimes and 
cultures. As a consequence, we deal 
with environmental issues through a 
network of field and regional specialists 
operating within the business units. 
There is active global co-operation 
between our sites, and this is utilised  
to ensure that the many country-specific 
solutions we have implemented across 
our manufacturing facilities have now 
been adopted across several business 
units where common solutions  
are practical.
While the individual business units 
measure the relevant environmental 
impacts aligned to the specific country 
or regional legislation, we also 
collectively monitor our group-level 
performance via three main measures:
• carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions  
from the use of fuels and electricity  
in our factories;
• water consumption; and 
• solid waste produced in our 
processes disposed of via landfill.
All three are important to us but our 
major concern is climate change, and 
as such, it is a main area of commitment 
and focus. We monitor and maintain  
our equipment and processes to reduce 
the impact of fuel consumption and 
electricity-related CO
2
 emissions. Our 
major capital projects last year in the 
USA and China have incorporated the 
best available technologies to minimise 
our emissions and energy usage per 
kilometre of product manufactured.
Global targets
By 2015 we had already met and 
surpassed the targets we had set in 2011, 
which required a 10% reduction per 
kilometre product in carbon dioxide 
emissions, water use and solid waste to 
landfill. We achieved double the target 
we had set.
Having evaluated the legislative 
requirements in the countries where  
we operate, and after investigating the 
opportunities presented by technology, 
new targets were adopted (against 2015 
baseline) that by 2020 we would:
• reduce emissions (tonnes CO
2
 per 
million metres production) by 30%;
• reduce energy usage (GJ per million 
metres production) by 15%;
• reduce water usage (cubic metres 
per million metres production) by 
10%; and
• reduce landfill (tonnes of solids sent 
to landfill from process) to zero.
These targets demonstrate our 
aspirations in making a step-change  
in environmental performance into  
the next decade and underline  
our commitment and resolve to  
manage our environmental impacts  
and responsibilities.
Carbon dioxide
In addition to manufacturing at our 
established plants in the USA, Scotland, 
Australia and Czech Republic 
throughout 2016, we were also 
commissioning two new plants in the 
USA and China. Overall we achieved a 
5% reduction in emissions levels from 
the 2015 baseline which was an excellent 
performance, particularly considering 
the output constraints which are 
incumbent with plant commissioning.
In the established plants in Australia, 
Czech Republic and Scotland we 
reduced our emissions against the 2015 
baseline by just over 9%, a reduction in 
real terms of 9,950 tonnes of CO

Energy consumption
Energy consumption and emissions are 
closely related. In 2016 we saw a strong 
performance in the established plants 
delivering a combined improvement  
of 25% which gave an overall global 
contribution of 5.5%. 
This 5.5% saw a reduction overall  
across the business of 70,000 GJ’s, 
which in context would be enough 
energy to power 4,000 houses per 
annum. This was achieved against a 
backdrop of reduced production due  
to plant commissioning.
Water
Our water consumption is a mixture of 
well-extracted and mains supply, this 
being driven both commercially and by 
the conditions in the regions. We 
measured water usage for the first time 
in China with the commissioning of the 
new Nantong plant and, of course, had 
water usage in both the established and 
new manufacturing facilities in the USA. 
Similar to our energy profile, we made 
significant reductions per million metre 
of casing produced in the established 
plants (circa 18%) which offset some of 
the usages that can be expected from 
commissioning of new processes and 
systems on green field sites. In total we 
continued the trend of reducing usage 
globally, this year by 3% against the 
2015 baseline.

As the following bar chart shows, we 
have reduced water usage in all but one 
of the last 10 years and our current rate 
of water required to produce our 
products has now been reduced by  
one-third since 2005.

Solid waste to landfill
In the various regions in which we 
operate, local legislation governs landfill 
use and is quite diverse. However, there 
is a common message to reduce the 
impact wherever and whenever 
possible. In most areas, landfill from 
inert sources (bricks, concrete, building 
waste) is under less restrictive control.
We remain focused on finding new 
avenues for our process waste and 
continue to evaluate new technologies 
with our business partners. We made 
some progress this year with a new 
contract in Australia which has seen 
about 800 tonnes converted from 
landfill to further processing, and  
this will double in 2017. Scotland have 
completed similar work and will be 
trialling a new waste stream from the 
first quarter of 2017 which will look  
to divert upwards of 3,000 tonnes  
of process waste from landfill. In total  
in 2016 we sent 1,800 tonnes less to  
landfill than in 2015, in a year where  
our manufactured volumes increased.
This is wholly consistent with our 
strategic aim to reduce waste from our 
manufacturing processes in the short-
term, and find new avenues for disposal 
in the longer-term, thus achieving our 
stated goal of zero landfill from process 
waste by 2020.

Environmental management systems
Our main vehicle for compliance and 
improvement continues to be our 
environmental management systems.  
All our manufacturing sites employ 
environmental management systems, 
based around the ISO 14001 model.  
Four of the plants have now been 
accredited with the ISO 14001 standard 
and are now actively working to 
upgrade to the new 2015 variant. Work 
on this will be ongoing throughout 2017 
with accreditation due by 2018. In the 
two new plants, all systems have been 
based on the ISO model and this will 
ease accreditation when the plants  
seek evaluation against the standard.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Our emissions of greenhouse gases  
are mainly due to the use of energy  
in our factories and centre on heat  
and electricity for our manufacturing 
processes. In addition, we use HFCs  
and HCFCs in refrigeration equipment, 
own a number of vehicles and rent 
offices. The figures below cover all of 
these activities except where we rent  
an office where the energy use is not 
measured separately. The impact of  
this on our numbers is not material.
We started collecting information  
in this format in 2012 as part of our 
responsibilities as a FTSE4Good company.
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013, 
and taking account of the new GHG 
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (2015).

People and human rights
The group places considerable value on 
the active involvement of its employees 
on matters affecting them locally and  
on matters that affect the group. This  
is achieved through visible and regular 
communications, both formal and informal, 
from their own management and that of 
visiting Executive Management Team 
members. It is now common practice  
to bring together multi-cultural teams  
to work on strategically important 
projects. This has many benefits,  
not least of which is creating a more 
unified and consistent business culture. 
Employee representatives are consulted 
regularly on a wide range of matters 
affecting their current and future 
interests. Particular focus this year has 
been the training of staff in the group’s 
two new factories and the restructuring 
of the organisation under the new 
Executive Management Team. We  
also launched the first Devro Academy 
modules, our in-house knowledge-
sharing initiative, to make technical 
knowledge-share easily available in  
all regions.
Devro is an equal opportunities 
employer and our employees and 
applicants are treated fairly and equally 
regardless of their age, colour, creed, 
disability, full or part-time status, 
gender, marital status, nationality or 
ethnic origin, race, religion or sexual 
orientation. Applications from disabled 
people are always fully considered, 
bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of 
members of staff becoming disabled, 
every effort is made to ensure that their 
employment with the group continues 
and the appropriate training is arranged. 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued
It is the policy of the group that the 
training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons should, 
as far as possible, be identical with that 
of other employees.
We employed 2,265 people, on average, 
around the world during 2016 (2015: 
2,174). As at 31 December 2016 the group 
employed 2,221 people (2015: 2,258). 
We encourage the development of 
employees through training. We invest 
both time and money in this which 
provides benefits for both the group, 
through a more highly-skilled workforce, 
and the individual employees, who gain 
both qualifications and experience that 
they can use to further their careers 
whilst with the group and in any future 
roles elsewhere. As at 31 December 2016 
we were training 16 apprentices around  35

two apprenticeships were completed. 
As at 31 December 2016, 26 people  
who had successfully completed 
apprenticeships with us were still 
employed by the group.
The group continues to support 
employees in their Professional Certificate 
in Management accreditation through  
the Open University Business School, 
with another intake planned for 2017. 
This is supplemented with support for 
professional education in other disciplines. 
Devro does not have a specific human 
rights policy. However, we have judged 
that human rights are not a material risk 
for the business due to the developed 
culture of ethical business practice and 
strong labour regulation present in most 
of the countries that the group operates 
in. All the group’s plants, wherever 
located, adhere to our own high-
standard labour practices. We run our 
business responsibly and ensure that  
all our employees, customers, suppliers 
and other stakeholders are treated fairly 
and with respect. 
In accordance with the Modern Slavery 
Act 2015 the group has published a 
statement on its website setting out the 
steps taken to prevent modern slavery 
and human trafficking in its business 
and supply chains. 
As at the end of the year the gender 
breakdown of the workforce was as

Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Report 
From 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2016, the company 
applied the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”).
1. Board composition
Mr G J Hoetmer, Chairman, Mr P W B Page, Chief Executive, 
Ms J A Lodge, Non-Executive Director, Mr P A J Neep, 
Non-Executive Director, and Mr P N Withers, Non-Executive 
Director, served as directors throughout 2016. Mr S C Webb, 
Group Finance Director, stepped down from the Board on 
31 March 2016, and was replaced in that role by Mr R A 
Helbing who was appointed as a Director on 4 April 2016.
The Non-Executive Directors are considered to be 
“independent” directors. This opinion is based primarily  
on careful consideration of their character and judgement  
and their contribution to the work of the Board and its 
committees. None holds any external position which would 
impinge upon his or her independence or objectivity, nor  
are there any relationships or circumstances such as are 
envisaged by Provision B.1.1 of the Code, other than as set  
out in the following paragraph.
Mr P A J Neep, who has held the position of “Senior 
Independent Director” since October 2005, has advised  
the Board that he wishes to retire, and will not be seeking 
re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”). Mr P N Withers will take over as Senior Independent 
Director from that date.
The Board views the Senior Independent Director’s role 
generally as a passive one, but acknowledges that there  
can be occasions where there may be a need for shareholders 
to convey concerns to the Board other than through the 
Chairman or the Chief Executive. The company’s major 
shareholders are reminded that the Senior Independent 
Director is willing to meet with them if they wish.
As previously announced, Mr M S Swift will join the Board  
as a Non-Executive Director at the forthcoming AGM.
All current directors, other than Mr P A J Neep, will stand  
for re-election at the 2017 AGM, and Mr Swift will stand for 
election. As in previous years, brief biographies of Board 
members, giving details of their experience and other main 
commitments, can be found on pages 36 and 37, allowing 
shareholders to make an informed decision on the question  
of re-election. All the directors have had their performance 
reviewed recently, as described on page 40, and the 
Chairman is satisfied that each continues to be effective  
and to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Details of Mr Swift’s experience can be found in the notice  
of the 2017 AGM, which is on the company’s website  
(www.devro.com).
There is a clear division of authority and responsibility 
through the separation of the roles of the Chairman and  
Chief Executive. This demarcation is set out in writing  
and was reviewed by the Board in 2015.
Directors of the company and its subsidiaries have the benefit 
of a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy.
The leadership and effectiveness of the 
Board are primarily my responsibility  
as Chairman. 
 
We recognise the importance of, and  
are committed to, high standards of 
corporate governance, aligned with the 
needs of the company and the interests  
of all our stakeholders. 
 
My fellow directors and I fully appreciate 
the importance of sound governance  
in the efficient running of the company,  
and in particular to the effectiveness  
and independence of the Board and the 
management of risks faced by the group. 
The following report sets out how we do 
this. It covers how the Board and its 
committees operated in 2016.

• approval of the annual budget; and
• major decisions on capital expenditure.
 Strategy and planning
 Performance review
 Corporate governance
The day-to-day management of the business is the responsibility of executive management.
Balance and diversity 
The Chairman and the Board understand the need to ensure that the balance of the Board is appropriate for the requirements 
of the business, and the benefits of diversity in its broadest sense are clearly understood. However, for a relatively small Board, 
it remains difficult to set targets for members of any particular background, and this applies to the issue of women on the 
Board. The Board’s policy is therefore to actively encourage women to apply to join the Board whenever a vacancy exists, and 
the report from the Nomination Committee on page 41 sets out how we do this. Ultimately, however, any appointments must 
be made on merit, taking account of the specific needs of the business at the relevant times, for the benefit of the company 
and its stakeholders.
Information flow
On appointment to the Board, directors are provided with an induction programme to familiarise themselves with the group’s 
businesses and the risks and strategic challenges facing the group, as well as the economic, competition, legal and regulatory 
environments in which the group operates.
The directors are supplied with detailed papers covering the group’s operating functions in advance of all Board meetings  
and a secure web-based portal is used to disseminate additional relevant information on a regular basis.
Members of the Executive Management Team attend and make presentations as appropriate at meetings of the Board.  
A programme of strategic and other reviews, together with training provided during the year, ensures that the directors 
continually update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the group’s businesses, as well as their awareness of industry, 
risk, legal, regulatory, financial and other developments to enable them to fulfil their role on the Board and committees  
of the Board effectively.
The directors are authorised to obtain independent professional advice at the company’s expense in performance of their 
duties as directors, although none has done so in the period under review. In addition, all directors have access to the services 
of the Company Secretary, who is also responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are observed and for advising the 
Board on corporate governance matters.
Board and committee proceedings
The Board acknowledges that it is collectively responsible for the success of the company by providing entrepreneurial 
leadership, setting the company’s strategic aims, ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place  
and reviewing management performance.
A number of committees carry out detailed independent oversight on behalf of the Board in relation to the audit of the 
company, health and safety issues, the remuneration of directors, appointments to the Board and the risks facing the group.
In 2016, the Board broadly divided its time as follows: 40

Board papers are generally circulated one week before the meetings. Comprehensive monthly management accounts in an 
agreed format are also sent to directors in a timely manner.
The Audit, Remuneration, Nomination, Health and Safety and Risk Committees, all appropriately resourced, met a total  
of 22 times during the year.
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors met informally during the year, providing an opportunity to review the 
business without the Executive Directors being present.
Board evaluation
In December 2016, the Board conducted an evaluation process based on a detailed questionnaire which was distributed to  
the directors for their consideration. Results were collated confidentially by the Company Secretary, and reviewed by the 
Chairman. Individual and collective discussions on the Board’s performance then followed.
The questionnaire examines the balance of the skills of the directors, the operation of the Board in practice, including 
governance issues, and the content of Board meetings. Feedback from the process is used to identify opportunities to improve 
the performance of the Board and the directors.
This process also addresses the effectiveness of the Board committees, covering such matters as meeting arrangements,  
and information provision. The results of the 2016 process were discussed by the Board and, where areas of improvement  
were identified, actions were agreed.
A satisfactory review of the performance of the Chairman was completed by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director.
2. Relationship with shareholders
The company communicates with institutional investors primarily though analysts’ briefings and meetings with major 
shareholders, as well as timely Stock Exchange announcements. The Board, and in particular the Non-Executive Directors, are 
kept informed of investors’ views in the main through distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings. The Chairman is willing to 
meet with shareholders to discuss matters such as strategy and governance and, as mentioned above, the Senior Independent 
Director is available in the event of shareholder concerns which cannot be addressed through the usual channels.
Broader shareholder communication takes place through the company’s website, which contains significant company 
announcements and other relevant information, and also through the Annual Report and AGM. All directors attend the AGM, 
and shareholders have the opportunity to hear presentations on the group’s financial and business performance, as well as to 
question any member of the Board on any relevant topic.
Votes at the AGM are conducted by way of a poll to ensure that the votes of shareholders who are unable to attend may be 
taken into account. The results are announced to the Stock Exchange.
Each substantial issue is proposed as an individual resolution of the AGM. Notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting.

3. Directors’ remuneration
Details of the level of remuneration received by the directors in 2016 are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
on pages 47 to 61. The Board believes that the current levels of remuneration are at the right level to attract and retain the 
directors needed to run the company successfully, without being excessive. Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed 
against those paid for similar positions in comparable companies. Professional advice from independent advisers is sought 
each year in this regard by the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee.
An explanation of the company’s incentive schemes, including how these are linked to the company’s strategy, is set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for notice periods of one year. Due to the technical nature of the business, 
these contracts contain restrictive covenants which will be rigorously applied and, taking this into account, the Board and the 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee believe that the notice periods are reasonable and in the best interests of the 
company, having regard to prevailing market conditions and current practice among public companies.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually by the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee, taking 
independent external advice as appropriate.
Mr P A J Neep chaired the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee throughout 2016. The other members of the 
Committee were Mr G J Hoetmer, Ms J A Lodge and Mr P N Withers. The Committee met five times in 2016.
Throughout 2016, the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee was chaired by Mr P W B Page, with Mr R A Helbing 
replacing Mr S C Webb as the other member when he joined in April 2016. This Committee met once in 2016 to review the 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors for the current year.
The Remuneration Report contains a detailed statement of the remuneration of each director for 2016, including details of the 
company’s pension policy for Executive Directors.
The written remit of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee is available on the company’s website. 
In view of Mr P A J Neep’s impending retirement at the AGM in April 2017, Mr P N Withers will take over as Chairman of the 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee from that date.
4. Report from the Nomination Committee
The members of the Committee during the year were Mr G J Hoetmer (Committee Chairman), Ms J A Lodge, Mr P A J Neep 
and Mr P N Withers. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has written terms of reference which can be found on the company’s website. These include the regular review 
of the structure, size and composition of the Board. In 2016, the Committee met formally on two occasions.
During the course of the year, the Committee sought a new Non-Executive Director.
After a comprehensive search of external candidates using independent consultants, a number of strong contenders were 
identified. The Committee then reviewed the various candidates against the agreed specification before unanimously agreeing 
to nominate Mr Malcolm Swift to the Board for the post. Mr Swift will take up the position at the 2017 AGM, subject to election.
The question of succession planning for senior management below Board level is primarily the responsibility of the  
Chief Executive.
The Committee will continue to facilitate the candidature of women for Board appointments, and recruitment consultants  
will be instructed to ensure, whenever possible, that a significant proportion of any longlist put forward should be women. 
Shortlists will, where possible, be drawn up in a way which forces diversity amongst the final candidates.
5. Report from the Health and Safety Committee
This Committee was formed in 2009, reflecting the Board’s commitment to health and safety matters.
The members of the Committee during the year were Mr P N Withers, who chaired the Committee, Mr P W B Page  
and Ms F L Curran, the company’s Global Health and Safety Manager.
The Committee has written terms of reference which can be found on the company’s website.
The Committee convened six times in 2016 and on four of these occasions met (either by video, telephone or in person)  
with representatives of the safety committee of one of the group’s main manufacturing facilities. 42
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Directors’ Report
5. Report from the Health and Safety Committee continued
The safety performance of the group is reviewed at each meeting, and the Committee receives and reviews reports on all 
serious safety incidents. The Committee also reviewed and endorsed the safety plans for each of the main sites at the 
beginning of the year.
Following a review of the Committee structure by the Board in February 2017, it was agreed that Mr P N Withers will step  
down as Chairman of this Committee in view of his new role as Chairman of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee. 
Mr M S Swift will join as Committee Chairman, both with effect from 26 April 2017 and Mr Kevin Shoemaker, Group Supply 
Chain Director, will join as a Committee member on 25 April 2017.
6. Report from the Risk Committee
An ongoing process is in place to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks the group faces, which accords with the 
FRC’s 2014 guidance and the Code. A Risk Committee was formed in 2010, chaired by the Group Company Secretary and 
comprising the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Management Team, as listed on pages 36 and 37.  
This Committee meets four times a year and its remit includes the following:
• Assess and monitor 
To assess and monitor risk across the group and to recommend mitigating strategies in respect of the key risks;
• Risk Register review 
To review and update the Risk Register four times a year;
• Process review 
To review the group process for evaluating risk to ensure it remains appropriate and relevant; and
• “Bottom up” review  
To co-ordinate an annual “bottom up” review of risk across the group, culminating in formal reports to the Audit Committee 
and the Board in the fourth quarter of each year.
The Committee is charged with reviewing risk throughout the group and reporting thereon to the Board. As part of the 
process, risk assessment procedures are applied across the group. Each group operating company prepares a risk assessment 
for its business. This involves each company preparing a report identifying the relevant risks to both current operations and 
future strategy, the process for managing and mitigating these risks and the means by which management might be assured 
that the processes are effective. A similar exercise is also conducted at group level, taking account of any significant risks 
identified by each of the individual operating companies. The risk assessment reports are collated and considered by the Risk 
Committee, and then the Audit Committee, before being reviewed and finalised by the Board. The Board and the Risk 
Committee also agree a number of key risks for in-depth review by the Committee in the course of the following year. At the 
end of the annual cycle in 2016, the Board considered the work done by the Committee and the processes used to identify  
and manage risk, and concluded that the approach taken remained proportionate and appropriate. The system is designed  
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The principal risks identified as part of the 
group risk assessment process, and how they are managed or mitigated, are summarised on pages 24 to 27.
7. Financial reporting
The Board acknowledges its responsibility to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s 
position and prospects. The Annual Report contains a Strategic Report on pages 2 to 35, including a Chairman’s Statement, 
Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review. The Board believes that this additional narrative sets the accounts in context 
and promotes a better understanding of the current status of the business and its outlook.
To ensure consistency of reporting, the group has an established consolidation process as well as formal financial and 
operational procedures manuals. Management monitors the publication of new reporting standards and works closely  
with the statutory auditors in evaluating the impact of these standards.
8. Internal control 
The Board of Directors, being ultimately responsible for the group’s system of internal control, has established an internal 
financial control structure which is designed to provide the Board with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that it can  
rely on the accuracy and reliability of the financial records.
The structure, which is based on an assessment of material financial risks, can be described under the following headings:
Financial reporting
There is a budgeting system in place which includes an annual budget approved by the Board. Monthly actual results are 
reported against budget. Revised forecasts for the year are prepared regularly. The company reports formally to shareholders 
twice a year, with two additional trading updates.
Operating controls
Financial and operational policies and procedures are set out in formal procedures manuals. Business directors and senior 
financial staff are responsible for ensuring that all relevant staff are familiar with their content and application.
Corporate Governance Report continued 43
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Treasury
Formal written treasury procedures are in operation, covering banking arrangements, hedging instruments, investment of cash 
balances and borrowing procedures. Individual staff responsibilities and levels of delegated authority in relation to treasury 
matters are defined.
Internal audit
The company has an internal audit function, provided by the Business Controls and Financial Analyst, who has a reporting  
line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and also direct access to the Chairman of the Board. The Business Controls  
and Financial Analyst normally attends Audit Committee meetings and makes a formal report to the Committee annually.
Capital investment appraisal
The company has clearly defined guidelines for the approval and review of capital expenditure projects, which include annual 
budgets and designated levels of authority. 
Integrity of personnel
The company has a Policy on Business Conduct which sets out specific requirements for all staff to meet the company’s 
standards of conduct and integrity in their business dealings.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control and considers that the group has an established 
system of internal control which the directors believe to be appropriate to the business.
9. Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position  
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 35, along with the financial position of the group, its debt levels and 
borrowing facilities.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the 
group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Key factors to support the going concern basis of accounting include the following:
• As at 31 December 2016, the group was operating within the £110m revolving credit facility negotiated in December 2014, 
and due to expire in 2019, and the US$100m US private placement, completed in June 2014 and due to expire between 2021 
and 2026, and related key covenants.
• Forecasts of profits and cash flow have been prepared which indicate that the group is expected to operate within its key 
covenants and funding facilities for the foreseeable future.
10. Viability statement 
In accordance with the Code, the directors have assessed the viability of the group over a three-year period, taking into 
account the group’s current position and the potential impact of the principal risks.
The group’s strategy is focused on long-term growth through revenue growth in developed and emerging markets, optimising 
the use of existing manufacturing assets and investment in new technology, and differentiation through product and process 
research and development. Whilst the directors have no reason to believe the group will not be viable over a longer period, 
given the inherent uncertainties involved and the higher-level nature of longer-term forecasting, the directors have determined 
that a three-year period to 31 December 2019 constitutes an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement. 
This three-year period aligns with the period focused on by the Board during the strategic planning process.
In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. The group’s principal risks, and how these 
are managed, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 24 to 27, and the group’s capital and financial risk management 
policies and exposures are set out in note 23 to the financial statements.
The three-year strategic plan is constructed on a “bottom up” basis and is reviewed by the Board annually. This process 
involves input from individual group operating companies and includes assumptions regarding expected sales volumes  
by region, production levels by manufacturing site and the level of targeted cost savings achieved. The plan is reviewed 
continuously throughout the year and is updated as circumstances evolve. 44
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Directors’ Report
10. Viability statement continued
The output from this planning is used to perform central debt and headroom analysis, which includes a review of sensitivity  
to “business as usual” risks and also stress testing using “severe but plausible” events. The analysis takes account of the 
availability and likely effectiveness of the further mitigation actions that could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or 
occurrence of the identified risks or events.
Based on this assessment, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2019.
11. Share capital
The Takeover Directive disclosures regarding the company’s share capital structure are included in the share capital section  
of the Directors’ Report on pages 62 to 65 of this report.
12. Statement on compliance
This statement, together with the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 47 to 61, and the Audit Committee Report 
on pages 45 to 46, describes how, in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016, the company has applied the provisions 
and principles of corporate governance as set out in the 2014 edition of the Code. The company has complied with all the 
Code’s provisions throughout the period in question, with one exception. The company’s remuneration committee structure 
does not fully comply with Provision D.2.2, as the remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Non-Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Committee comprising the Executive Directors instead of by a committee of Non-Executive Directors, as 
proposed by the Code. The company’s two-committee approach, which is more fully described and explained in the 
Remuneration Report, is designed to ensure that no director is involved in setting his or her own remuneration, thus avoiding 
any potential conflict of interest, while ensuring that the experience of the Chairman is available to the Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Committee. The Board believes that this arrangement is an appropriate and effective use of the available 
resources and is fully aligned with the spirit of the Code.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference,  
which are available on the company’s website, and include  
the responsibilities set out in Provision C.3.2 of the Code.
Ms J A Lodge chaired the Committee throughout the  
period under review. The other members of the Committee 
throughout 2016 were Mr P A J Neep and Mr P N Withers.  
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board views Ms J A Lodge as the Committee member 
with both recent and relevant financial expertise as stipulated 
in Provision C.3.1 of the Code. In the course of the year there 
were four meetings. These were attended as required by the 
Group Finance Director, management and the Business 
Controls and Financial Analyst, as invitees. Representatives  
of the statutory auditors also attend as appropriate.
The Committee and the statutory auditors operate 
procedures to ensure that the auditors remain objective  
and independent. These procedures include the pre-approval 
of the scope of the audit by the Committee.
Statutory auditors
KPMG LLP were appointed as the company’s statutory 
auditors at the 2015 Annual General Meeting, and their 
re-appointment is subject to approval at each subsequent 
Annual General Meeting. 
Statutory audit
KPMG conducted limited non-audit work for the company  
in 2016, generating £20,000 in fees (2015: £41,000). Details  
of audit and non-audit services are shown in note 8 to the 
financial statements. The ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees 
is 0.06:1 (2015: 0.13:1). The Committee noted the relatively low 
level of non-audit work when reviewing the statutory auditors’ 
independence and concluded that, in view of the safeguards 
in place, this would not impinge upon their objectivity  
or independence.
The Committee is charged with reviewing the effectiveness  
of the auditors. The following processes are used for this purpose:
• The Committee received a detailed audit plan from the 
statutory auditors at the beginning of the annual audit 
process which included an outline of the proposed scope 
of the audit, and identification of key audit risks and areas 
of focus. This was discussed and agreed with the Committee.
• The Committee challenged the work done by the statutory 
auditors to test management’s assumptions and estimates 
in relation to the significant issues.
• A survey was conducted of all businesses within the group 
to assess the effectiveness of the group and local statutory 
audit teams.
• At the completion of the statutory audit the Committee 
received feedback from the Group Finance Director on 
how effectively issues were addressed at the statutory 
audit clearance meetings.
Based on the above processes and feedback, and its own 
ongoing assessment of the statutory auditors’ performance 
(for example, through consideration of the statutory auditors’ 
reports and interactions with the group audit partner), the 
Committee was satisfied with the independence, objectivity 
and overall effectiveness of the statutory auditors with regard 
to the 2016 audit process.
As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am 
pleased to present the report in respect of 
2016. This report summarises the work of 
the Committee in the course of the year.

Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Directors’ Report
Significant issues
The significant issues considered by the Committee during 2016, and how these were addressed, are as follows:
Exceptional items
The final phase of the group’s two major investment projects to construct new manufacturing plants in the USA and China was 
completed in 2016, including the training of new staff, commissioning of equipment and the commencement of operations at 
the plants. The costs associated with these projects have been significant and judgement has been required by management 
to determine which costs should be expensed as incurred and which should be capitalised. In addition the Board decided 
during 2016 to accelerate, and implement more extensively, the Devro 100 programme which will upgrade the group’s sales 
capabilities, significantly reduce unit cost of manufacture and launch the next generation of differentiated products. This 
programme is expected to result in significant additional costs until 2018, starting in 2016.
Where costs have been expensed as incurred, judgement has been required to determine whether these costs should be 
disclosed as exceptional items, taking account of their nature and size, and in particular, whether they are incremental to 
normal operations. In some cases provisions have been set up in previous periods for the estimated liability for these costs. 
The Committee has addressed these matters through reviewing and discussing reports from management outlining the nature 
and amount of the relevant costs, the amounts settled during the year for provisions held at the end of 2015, the estimates 
involved, and the proposed accounting treatments, in particular reviewing the disclosure of amounts as exceptional items, and 
the associated descriptions included in the financial statements. The statutory auditors have also carefully examined this area 
and have reported their assessment to the Committee.
Carrying value of inventory
The perishable nature of the group’s inventory means it is appropriate to hold a provision for obsolescence based on  
age from the date of manufacture. The group makes additional specific provisions in the event that any quality issues or 
damaged inventory are identified. The start-up of operations during 2016 at the group’s new manufacturing plants in the  
USA and China increased the risk in relation to inventory valuation given the process of calibrating and refining the new 
production processes prior to the commencement of normal production. The group makes additional specific provisions in  
the event that such products do not meet the required customer specifications. During the course of the year inventory levels 
have risen compared with the end of 2015, and the level of provision has risen in line with this. The Committee has assessed  
the judgements of management relating to the carrying value of inventory, both with respect to the continued appropriateness  
of the group’s accounting policy in providing for inventory obsolescence, and for any additional specific provisions.  
The statutory auditors have also focused on this area and reported their findings to the Committee.
Whistleblowing procedure
The company’s whistleblowing procedures are also reviewed regularly. Following a decision by the Committee in 2013,  
a confidential, multi-language system, entitled “SpeakUp”, was set up and communicated to everyone in the group. The 
Committee believe that these arrangements will facilitate a proportionate and independent investigation of such matters.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee acknowledges that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts should be fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Committee advises the Board on whether it believes that the Annual Report and Accounts meet this 
requirement. In order for the Committee to make this assessment, it considers reports from management received during  
the year, monitoring financial performance and at year end in support of the financial statements, and also reports from the 
statutory auditors on the findings of their annual audit. Formal review processes are in place to ensure that the Annual Report 
and Accounts are factually accurate.
The Committee also satisfies itself that the key messages in the narrative are consistent with the financial reporting, and that 
the Annual Report and Accounts as a whole are clear and understandable both in terms of the language used, and the layout 
and framework.
Following its review, the Committee was satisfied that the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts present a fair, balanced and 
understandable overview, including the necessary information for shareholders to assess the group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.
The responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts is on pages 64 to 65.

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased  
to present the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for 2016.  
 
This report provides details of the 
remuneration paid to Executive and  
Non-Executive Directors for services  
to the company during the year.  
 
In 2016, the Remuneration Committee 
carried out an extensive review of the 
current Executive Directors’ remuneration 
policy. I have set out below details of the 
new policy that will be brought to 
shareholders for approval at our AGM,  
as well as the rationale for those changes 
and how that policy will be implemented 
in 2017.
Paul Neep
Chairman, Executive Directors’  
Remuneration Committee
Committee Chairman’s 
introduction
Overview of policy and link to our business strategy
The Committee sets the strategy, structure and levels of 
remuneration for the Executive Directors and reviews the 
remuneration of other members of senior management in  
the group. It does so in the context of the group’s overall 
strategy and performance to align the financial interests  
of the Executive Directors and other senior managers  
with the achievement of the group’s objectives, and with 
shareholder returns.
The Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 55 to 61 sets 
out how our policy was operated in 2016. This will be subject 
to an advisory vote at the AGM on 26 April 2017.
Pay and performance in 2016
Base salary
Our long-standing approach to base salaries for Executive 
Directors is to be around mid-market levels. In 2016, the 
Committee increased the Chief Executive’s salary by 1.5%,  
a little less than the average of other pay rises elsewhere in 
the group. The new Group Finance Director’s salary was set 
taking into account his experience and skills as well as market 
rates for similar positions in comparable companies, and was 
consistent with the salary of the outgoing director.
Annual bonus
The Committee believes that annual bonus targets should  
be genuinely challenging, clearly linked to the company’s 
strategy and designed to align the interests of shareholders 
and executives.
For 2016, the annual bonus targets were largely focused on 
profit growth, with non-financial strategic targets accounting 
for a maximum 20% of the award. The Committee set the 
financial performance conditions for the annual bonus based 
on the budgeted exchange rates at the start of the year, in  
an effort to avoid the outturn being subject to the vagaries  
of the currency markets. As a result, while the 2016 underlying 
operating profit moved forward, the recalculated figure fell 
below the minimum threshold, and as the non-financial 
objectives were subject to a profit underpin at threshold level, 
the result was that no bonus was payable in respect of 2016.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Chief Executive and former Group Finance Director 
received conditional awards under the Devro Performance 
Share Plan in 2014. The performance targets for these awards 
were partly based on EPS growth and partly on relative TSR 
measured across a three-year performance period ending on 
31 December 2016. The Committee reviewed the performance 
of the group against these conditions in February 2017, and 
concluded that neither threshold had been met. As a result, 
the awards in question have lapsed. A full explanation of the 
performance metrics is shown on page 58.
Directors’ Remuneration Report  48
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Directors’ Report
Changes to our policy for 2017-2020
The current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, and a triennial shareholder vote is required  
at the 2017 AGM for the same or a revised policy. A new policy for 2017-2020, as set out on pages 50 to 54, will be put to 
shareholders as a binding vote at this year’s AGM. Subject to shareholder approval the new policy will be applied from 
1 January 2017.
The Committee has carried out an extensive review of the current policy and the Executive Directors have also reviewed  
the Non-Executive Directors’ element of the policy. In the course of their review, the Committee consulted with our major 
investors, before concluding that the current policy for the Executive Directors remains broadly appropriate but that a limited 
number of changes would bring it in line with evolving “best practice” while also providing some valuable flexibility for the next 
three-year policy period.
In summary, the key changes and rationale for those changes are as follows:
• The annual bonus maximum opportunity under the policy for both Executive Directors will increase from 100% of salary  
to 125% to provide some headroom and flexibility for the three-year policy period. Importantly, there is no intention, at  
this time, to increase the actual maximum opportunity for the Executive Directors from the current 100% of salary. If the 
Committee is considering an increase it would consult with its largest investors. 
• Increasing flexibility within the policy to enable the Committee to select performance measures for the annual bonus and 
long-term incentive that are aligned with the strategy of the Company. As part of this, it is proposed that a cash target  
will be introduced into the annual bonus and that ROCE is introduced as a performance measure for the 2017 long-term 
incentive awards, in addition to the current TSR and EPS measures. 
• We will increase the shareholding requirement for Executive Directors from 100% of base salary to 150% of base salary to 
strengthen the alignment of executives to shareholders.
For ease of reference, these key changes, as well as a small number of changes for administrative ease and clarification, are  
set out in detail in the table on page 49. The Executive Directors concluded two small changes should be made to the Non-
Executive Directors’ element of the policy to provide additional flexibility and these are also detailed in the table.
Implementation of policy for 2017
Our Chief Executive’s base salary will not be increased in 2017, and our Group Finance Director will receive a 1.5% increase; 
broadly in line with the workforce average. The maximum annual bonus opportunity and LTIP award level will remain the same 
as in 2016. For the LTIP metrics, as mentioned above, we propose to introduce ROCE alongside TSR and underlying EPS in 
order to support a focus on delivering returns from the capital projects in China, the USA and elsewhere in the group.
The 2017 annual bonus will be targeted primarily on underlying operating profit and cash, with a small element of non-financial 
objectives accounting for 20% of the weighting. A cash target was last used as an annual bonus measure in 2014, and has been 
reintroduced in the 2017 awards in order to provide a focus on debt reduction.
Further details of how our policy will be implemented in 2017 are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration at pages 55 to 61.
Review of shareholder vote on 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration 
At our 2016 AGM, the resolution to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration, despite being passed with the requisite 
majority, had some 35% of votes cast against. The Committee understands and accepts the concerns raised by some 
shareholders relating to the treatment of executives on cessation, the exercise of discretion and pro-rating of long-term 
incentive awards and will take these concerns into account in making remuneration decisions going forward. The Committee 
will also continue to consult with our shareholders on remuneration matters.
Summary
We continue to monitor our approach to remuneration to ensure that it remains relevant and consistent both with our strategy 
and performance, and is aligned to shareholder value. As always I am available to you to receive your comments or discuss our 
approach to remuneration and answer any queries you may have. I look forward to your support at the AGM.

Directors’ Report
Policy report 
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the company directors and has been 
prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”). The policy report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM and (subject 
to approval) the policy will take legal effect from 26 April 2017, but be applied from 1 January 2017.
The Remuneration Policy
The company’s remuneration policy must enable it to attract and retain leaders with the skills, experience and drive to execute 
the company’s business strategy within a framework which is aligned to the interests of the company’s shareholders, for 
example, through the deferral of bonuses and the requirement to hold shares. The Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”) believes that a significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration should be 
performance-related.
Each year, the Committee conducts a formal review of risk in the context of remuneration. A review of pay for other employees 
across the group, particularly salary increases, is also carried out each year when reviewing overall remuneration policy and 
this is taken into account when setting policy for the Executive Directors. No consultation process with employees was 
conducted in 2016 in respect of the directors’ remuneration policy.
The Committee welcomes dialogue with shareholders and consults with its major investors and investor bodies regarding 
changes to Executive Director remuneration policy. Any views and feedback on arrangements from our investors will be 
considered by the Committee as part of its annual review of directors’ remuneration.
Remuneration of Executive Directors
The following table summarises each element of the Executive Directors’ remuneration package, the policy for how these are 
operated and their link to the company’s strategy.

will be subject to a robust 
financial underpin.

Directors’ Report
Notes to the policy table
1. Annual Bonus Plan performance metrics
Performance measures, the weighting between them and stretching targets will be set at the start of each year by the 
Committee, based on the company’s financial KPIs and strategic priorities for the year and taking account of the business  
plan, budget for the year and market conditions. At least 80% will be based on relevant financial targets and up to 20% may  
be attributed to a relevant non-financial target. Together, these targets are intended to incentivise and reward shorter-term 
performance, consistent with the interests of the shareholders and the overall strategy of the company.
2. PSP metrics
The Committee selects performance measures for the PSP awards that are aimed at incentivising and rewarding performance 
over the medium to long-term, aligned with the interests of the shareholders and consistent with the group strategy.
3. Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The Deferred Share Bonus Plan contains no additional performance conditions as any awards arise from an annual bonus 
which was itself subject to performance conditions.
4. Comparison with employees’ remuneration policy
The key difference between Executive Directors’ remuneration policy and that of employees generally is that, for the Executive 
Directors, there is significantly more weighting to variable performance-related pay. Variable pay is seen as more relevant for 
senior executives because of their greater ability to influence the overall performance of the company.
Shareholding guidelines
To provide alignment between shareholders and directors, the Executive Directors are required to build up a holding of 150% 
of salary over time. Any shares vesting from share incentive plans must be retained (subject to sales to meet tax and incidental 
costs of sale) until the target is reached.
Remuneration awarded prior to the effective date
For the avoidance of doubt, following approval of this policy report, authority was given to the company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration 
reports including those share plan awards set out on pages 59 and 60. Details of any payments to former directors will be set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Annual Bonus Plan and PSP policy
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP according to the rules of each respective plan and consistent with 
normal market practice and the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange, including flexibility in a number of aspects. How 
the Committee will retain flexibility includes (albeit with quantum and performance targets restricted to the descriptions 
detailed above):
• Who participates in the plans.
• When to make awards and payments.
• How to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and how much of an award should vest.
• How to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the group.
• Whether a director is a “good/bad” leaver for incentive plan purposes and whether and what proportion of awards vest at 
the time of leaving or at the original vesting date(s).
• How and whether an award may be adjusted in certain circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or for 
special dividends).
• What the weighting, measures and targets should be for the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP from year-to-year.
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy to adjust targets and/or set different measures and alter weightings 
for the Annual Bonus Plan and to adjust targets for the PSP if events happen that cause it to determine that the metrics are 
unable to fulfil their originally intended purpose, provided the new metrics are not materially less difficult to satisfy. Any 
adjustments will be fully disclosed in the following year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
All historic awards that were granted under any current or previous share schemes operated by the company, but remain 
outstanding, detailed on page 60, remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.

3. Pension is 2017 policy applied to 1 April 2017 salaries.
4. No share price appreciation is assumed in long-term incentive awards.
Service agreements and payments for loss of office of Executive Directors
It is the company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one 
year’s notice by the company and the director. In the event of early termination (including following a change of control in the 
company), the directors’ contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period. In summary, the 
contractual provisions are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months by the company, 12 months by the director.
Termination payment There is no provision for specific payment. If any existing contract is breached by 
the company, it would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the 
net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, subject to 
mitigation and phased payments where appropriate. Any statutory amounts would be 
paid as necessary.
Remuneration entitlements Pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with 
vesting for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below). 
In all cases, performance targets would apply. 
Change of control No Executive Director’s contract contains additional provisions in respect of change  
of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the company’s share plans will be determined based on 
the relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement or other 
circumstances, at the discretion of the Committee “good leaver” status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will normally 
vest on cessation, or on the original vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that 
time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three-year period actually served. However, the Committee has 
discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and/or to disapply time pro-rating.
The default treatment under the 2009 Deferred Share Bonus Plan is that any awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, good leavers are entitled to retain their awards and to vest after leaving, subject to the rules of the Plan.
Legal fees, or a contribution towards them, in connection with any Settlement Agreement, and outplacement consultancy fees 
may be paid if this is considered appropriate. 54

Recruitment and promotion policy for Directors
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s prevailing 
approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the 
market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as is required to attract the most appropriate candidate. It may be set initially at a 
below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has 
been proven and sustained. The annual bonus potential would be limited to 125% of salary, and conditional awards under the 
Devro plc Performance Share Plan may be up to the Plan maximum of 150% of salary or 200% on recruitment in exceptional 
circumstances. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or 
incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these  
awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed 
to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue. For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the company will meet certain relocation and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate, the Committee may agree on the recruitment of a new executive to a notice period in excess of 12 months but  
to reduce to 12 months over a specified period.
The fees for a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be reflective of experience, time commitment, responsibility and 
scope of the role and will be consistent with the approved remuneration policy at the time.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept external board or committee appointments, provided they do not interfere with 
the Executive Directors’ obligations to the company. The Board will decide at the time of appointment whether an Executive 
Director may retain the fees for such appointments.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for fixed terms, with no notice period, with an entitlement to accrued fees and 
expenses only up to the date of termination. These appointments are subject to the company’s Articles of Association.  
All directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The dates of the initial letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors are as follows:
Name Date of letter of appointment Date term due to expire

Executive Directors’ salaries
Current salaries for Executive Directors at the date of this report are as follows:
Chief Executive: £467,832
Group Finance Director: £305,000
From 1 April 2017 the Group Finance Director’s salary will be increased by 1.5% to £309,575 and the Chief Executive’s salary will 
remain unchanged.

J A Lodge £43,500 £42,500 £5,000 £48,500 £47,500
Annual bonus
For 2017, 40% of the annual bonus for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director will be determined by underlying 
operating profit, 40% will be determined by a cash target derived from the budgeted movement in net debt, excluding 
dividends and exchange rate movements, and 20% by non-financial strategic targets. This year, the Committee has set 
different non-financial targets for each of the Executive Directors in line with the business strategy and operational plan.  
The Chief Executive has seven objectives, reflecting the strategic imperative of increasing sales in key markets, improved 
manufacturing yield, and product innovation. The Group Finance Director’s five objectives are primarily focused on the 
delivery of the restructuring programme announced in November 2016, and the savings which will result.
The non-financial targets are stretching and, furthermore, will be subject to the achievement of a robust underpin based on 
underlying operating profit. Provided this underpin is met, successful achievement of each individual objective may trigger  
a partial payout.
When reviewing the profit performance condition for 2017, the Committee will again look at operating profit before exceptional 
items and will restate the actual underlying operating profit using the budgeted exchange rates in order to strip out the effect 
of currency fluctuations, which are, in the main, outside of the control and performance of management. This year the 
Committee has set a tighter range than usual.
The Committee considers that the actual targets for the 2017 bonus are commercially sensitive, but full details will be disclosed 
in the 2017 report.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Awards will be made in 2017 to the Chief Executive to the extent of 110% of base salary; and to the Group Finance Director  
to the extent of 100% of base salary. Subject to the new Remuneration Policy being approved at the AGM in April 2017, the 
performance measures for these awards will be targeted on underlying EPS (40%), ROCE (40%) and TSR (20%). The TSR 
performance condition will be based on a comparator group comprising the 50 FTSE listed companies above and 50 
companies below Devro by market capitalisation. 25% of this part of the award will vest for median TSR performance, rising on 
a straight line basis so that there will be full vesting for top quartile performance. The actual targets for the underlying EPS and 
ROCE elements will be finalised by the Committee when the awards are granted, and will be included in the Stock Exchange 
announcement at that time.
Pension and other benefits
The pension and benefits arrangements are as set out in the policy table above.
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) throughout 2016 were Mr P A J Neep 
(Committee Chairman), Mr G J Hoetmer, Ms J A Lodge and Mr P N Withers. 56
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
The Remuneration Committee continued
The Committee received advice from:
• The Company Secretary (as Secretary to the Committee) and the Chief Executive.
• New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited being a group company of Aon plc) as independent adviser  
to the Committee. New Bridge Street were appointed as advisers by the Committee in view of their expertise in this area.
No director is involved in any part of a meeting of the Committee when their individual remuneration or contractual terms are 
being decided.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman is set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee, whose members in 2016 were Mr P W B Page, Mr S C Webb (until he retired on 31 March 2016) and Mr R A Helbing 
(from 4 April 2016). The two-committee approach ensures that no director is involved in setting his or her own remuneration.
Advisers to the Committee
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct and has confirmed to the Committee that 
it adheres in all respects to the terms of the Code. The Committee has satisfied itself that advice from New Bridge Street is 
objective. As disclosed on page 36, Mr G J Hoetmer is Chairman of the supervisory board of Aon Groep Nederland B.V. While 
that company and New Bridge Street are both part of the Aon plc group, the Committee has been advised that the two are 
operated independently from each other, and therefore is satisfied that the relationship does not impinge on the objectivity or 
independence of the advice provided by New Bridge Street. The total fees paid to New Bridge Street for the advice provided 
to the Committee during the year were £26,284. Fees are charged on a ‘time spent’ basis. Neither New Bridge Street, nor any 
other company in the Aon Group, has provided any other services to the company during the year.

Summary of 2016 annual bonus
No annual bonus was paid in respect of 2016.
The Committee agreed in 2015 that for the purpose of the bonus calculation, currency exchange rate fluctuation would be 
excluded. This is achieved by calculating underlying operating profit using the company’s budgeted exchange rates for the 
various non-sterling currencies in which the group trades. Applying this approach to the 2016 underlying operating profit 
produced a notional figure of £29.1m, which was below the threshold for minimum payout of £34.3m.
The non-financial targets for 2016 were linked to key strategic milestones, as follows:
Objectives Outcome
1.  Returns on projects: To have the new US plant in commercial production by 
end of June 2016 and to have the new Nantong plant in commercial 
production before the end of December 2016.
Partially completed. Both plants in 
production at the target dates, but 
transition in the US taking longer  
than anticipated.
2.  Devro 100 programme: To have launched internal communications for this 
key strategic initiative and have a clear plan approved by the Board and 
incorporated in the 2017 budget.
Completed.
3.  Innovation pipeline: To present, and have accepted by the Board, clear plans 
for new product introduction
Completed. 58

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Objectives Outcome
4.  Improved sales capability: To present a plan for the evaluation and 
development of the group’s sales capability, and to have all posts filled with 
appropriately experienced people by end of September 2016.
Partially completed. One position unfilled.
5.  Cost control: To present the unit cost reduction action plans for 2017-2018 to 
the Board, to be approved and incorporated in the 2017 budget.
Completed.
However, in line with our policy, these targets were subject to a financial underpin that the notional Group Operating Profit 
should exceed £34.3m, and as that level was not reached, no bonus was payable in respect of the non-financial targets.

Joining arrangements for Mr R A Helbing
Mr R A Helbing joined the company as Group Finance Director on 4 April 2016. As disclosed last year, certain significant Share 
Plan awards with his previous employer lapsed when he left them to join Devro and the Committee therefore agreed that he 
should receive an award under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan equal to 100% of base salary to replace incentive pay 
forfeited, and taking into account the vesting periods and expected value of those forfeited awards. The anticipated value of 
the replacement award was consistent with that of the forfeited awards. This was in line with the shareholder-approved policy. 
A normal 100% award was also granted in 2016. Both awards are subject to the usual three-year performance period and 
details of the targets are set out on page 60. Mr Helbing’s future awards will revert to 100% of base salary.
The Devro plc Performance Share Plan
The three-year performance period for the awards under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan made to Mr P W B Page and 
Mr S C Webb on 9 June 2014 ended on 31 December 2016. The performance conditions which applied, and performance

Conditional nil-priced options under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan are considered for award annually, with earliest 
vesting occurring generally after three years and normally being dependent on both continued employment with the group 
and the extent to which the performance conditions set out below are met. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon 
the group’s underlying Earnings Per Share (“underlying EPS”) growth over the relevant performance period, with the other 
50% being dependent upon the group’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance measured over the same period 
against the 100 listed companies (excluding Investment Trusts) closest to the company in terms of market capitalisation  
(i.e., 50 higher and 50 lower).

Directors’ Report
Change of control
The company has a number of financial agreements which it considers significant, with major banks containing certain 
termination rights for those banks upon a change of control of the company.
The company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office  
or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the company’s share plans may cause options and awards

Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2016, the company had been notified of the following material interests in the issued ordinary share capital 
of the company under DTR5:
Notified number of

Neptune Investment Management Limited 23,453,194 14.05
NN Group N.V. 21,890,708 13.11
Marathon Asset Management 11,492,268 7.06
Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited 8,350,475 5.01

Management Limited advising that they had firstly decreased their holding in the company to 23,317,901 ordinary shares 
equating to 13.97% of issued share capital, then increased it to 23,801,270 ordinary shares equating to 14.26% of issued  
share capital, and finally decreased it to 23,372,620 ordinary shares equating to 13.99% of issued share capital.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The AGM of the company will be held at 11am on 26 April 2017 at the Westerwood Hotel, St Andrews Drive, Cumbernauld,  
G68 0EW. The notice of meeting and explanatory notes are available on the company’s website (www.devro.com). 
Shareholders will be asked for their approval of the items of business which are explained in the notes.
Disclosure of information to auditors
So far as each person who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are unaware. Each of the directors has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s 
statutory auditors are aware of that information.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the group and company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements, unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss  
of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the Act and, as

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2016
Devro plc (“the company”) and its subsidiaries (“the group”) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of collagen products 
for the food industry. The company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is 
incorporated and domiciled in Scotland. The address of its registered office is Moodiesburn, Chryston, Glasgow G69 0JE.
1. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and individual company financial statements 
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These consolidated and individual company financial statements have both been prepared in accordance with European Union 
endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), IFRS IC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under 
the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and pension scheme assets.
The group’s reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest £0.1 million.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position  
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 35, along with the financial position of the group, its debt levels and 
borrowing facilities.
In addition, note 23 includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the 
group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Key factors to support the going concern basis of accounting include the following:
• As at 31 December 2016 the group was operating within the £110m revolving bank facility negotiated in December 2014 and 
due to expire in December 2019, and US$100m US private placement, completed in June 2014 and due to expire between 
2021 and 2026.
• Forecast of profits and cash flows have been prepared which indicate that the group is expected to operate within its key 
covenants and funding facilities for the foreseeable future.
Critical estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect  
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues  
and expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best assessments of amounts, 
events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The key areas that require estimates and 
judgements that have a significant risk of material misstatement or of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the accounting for the group’s exceptional items and carrying value  
of inventory. 
Exceptional items
Devro is undergoing a major transformation including the construction and start-up of two new plants in China and  
the US which completed in 2016, a restructuring of operations in Scotland and Australia initiated in 2014 and the Devro 100 
programme which will continue until 2018. The costs associated with this transformation are significant, and judgement has 
been required to determine which costs should be expensed as incurred and which should be capitalised. Where costs have 
been expensed judgement has also been required to determine whether these costs should be disclosed as exceptional items, 
taking account of their nature and size and in particular whether they are incremental to normal operations. In some cases 
provisions have been set up in prior periods for the estimated liability for these costs and judgement is applied relating to the 
timing of recognition of provisions and the estimation of the amount of the provision. An analysis of exceptional items 
recognised is included in notes 3 and 4. Details of provisions are included in note 21.
Carrying value of inventory
Determining the carrying value of inventory involves a degree of judgement as to whether the group will be able to sell the 
inventory it has on hand for more than the value recorded in the balance sheet, which is typically the cost of production.  
The group adopts a policy of providing for inventory when it reaches a certain age, and also for any inventory where there  
are specific concerns. These estimated provisions are based on management’s best assessments of future sales volumes  
and the likely selling prices, and actual results may differ from these estimates.  73
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Although not considered significant issues the following are considered to be other key areas of judgement and estimation:
Pension obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension schemes is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves certain 
key assumptions and complex calculations. The key assumptions include discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, 
future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such 
estimates are subject to uncertainty. An analysis of the sensitivity of the pension obligation to changes in key assumptions  
is provided based on movements in key variables that could reasonably occur. Further details are provided in note 25.
Tax
The group’s tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates effective at the balance sheet date. In addition to 
corporation tax, the group is subject to indirect taxes such as sales and employment taxes across the tax jurisdictions in the 
countries in which it operates. The varying nature and complexity of these tax laws requires the group to review its tax 
positions and make appropriate adjustments at the balance sheet date. In addition the recognition of deferred tax assets is 
dependent upon an estimation of future taxable profits that will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. In the event that actual taxable profits are different, such differences may impact the carrying value of deferred 
tax assets in future years. Further details are provided in notes 9 and 24.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures 
(a) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective in 2016 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations became mandatory for the first time during the 
financial year beginning 1 January 2016. All were either not relevant for the group or had no material impact on the financial 
statements of the group:
 Effective date
• IFRS 10 (amendment) – Consolidated financial statements  1 January 2016
• IFRS 11 (amendment) – Joint arrangements 1 January 2016
• IFRS 12 (amendment) – Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2016
• IAS 1 (amendment) – Presentation of financial statements 1 January 2016
• IAS 12 (amendment) – Income taxes 1 January 2016
• IAS 16 (amendment) – Property, plant and equipment 1 January 2016
• IAS 27 (amendment) – Separate financial statements 1 January 2016
• IAS 28 (amendment) – Investments in associates 1 January 2016
• IAS 38 (amendment) – Intangible assets 1 January 2016
• Annual improvements 2014 1 January 2016
(b) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations 
were in issue but have not been applied in these financial statements:
 Effective date
• IFRS 9 – Financial instruments  1 January 2018
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
• IFRS 16 – Leases 1 January 2019
It is expected that the group will adopt these amendments to standards on their effective dates. The directors do not 
anticipate that the adoption of these amendments to standards will have a material impact on the financial statements  
of the group, apart from that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings 
made up to 31 December 2016. Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation. The purchase method  
of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the group. The results of subsidiary 
undertakings acquired or disposed of are consolidated for the period from or to the date on which control passed. Uniform 
accounting policies are applied across the group.
The subsidiaries are entities over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date on which control ceases. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, 
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred. Any identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
non-controlling interest. Any unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment  
of the asset transferred. 74
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2016 continued
1. Accounting policies continued
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the purchase method. The consideration transferred in  
a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets 
transferred by the group and liabilities incurred by the group to the former owners of the acquiree in exchange for control  
of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date amounts  
of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
When the consideration transferred by the group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement 
period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which 
cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value 
with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating 
units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the 
other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, are capitalised at cost and 
when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Cost includes the original purchase 
price of the asset and the costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Following 
initial recognition, finite life assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and indefinite life assets are not amortised. Finite life 
intangible assets have a residual value of £nil and are amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer software   4-5 years
Development projects   15 years
Customer contracts and relationships 12 years
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a 
success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs can be measured reliably. External and internal 
costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are 
examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Finite life assets are 
reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
The group’s only indefinite life intangible asset is goodwill.
Research and development
In general, research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it occurred. 
However, as set out above, under certain conditions development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset. 75
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment is  
its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition and directly attributable costs. Provision for depreciation  
is made so as to write off the costs of the assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings   50 years
Plant and machinery   8-15 years
Computer equipment   4-5 years
Motor vehicles     4 years
Fixtures and fittings   10 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or on assets under construction.
Assets under construction are transferred to the appropriate asset category when they come into use. Depreciation on assets 
so transferred is provided with effect from the month following the date of transfer.
Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, or more frequently 
if there have been indications of any significant change in either.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with carrying amounts and are recognised within 
other operating income or expense in the income statement. 
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the year in which they are incurred.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually or whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to 
depreciation or amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and its value in use. 
Grants
Grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in current and non-current liabilities as appropriate and credited 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with 
the costs they are intended to compensate.
Fixed asset investments
The company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis and includes 
transport and handling costs. In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production 
overheads based on the normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the price at which inventories can be sold in the normal 
course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from their existing 
state to a finished condition. Provision is made, where appropriate, for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost, less provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience, 
together with specific amounts that are not expected to be collectible. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. 
Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. 76

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with maturity dates of less than three months which 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the 
cash flow statement, net cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents net of bank overdrafts. 
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the group 
has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment of non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence of impairment which could include 
significant financial difficulty for the issuer or counterparty or observable data indicating there is a measurable decrease  
in the cash flows expected from a group of financial assets.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency  
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in sterling, which is the company’s functional and presentation currency. 
Foreign currency transactions in each entity are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing  
at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive 
income as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
Other gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the income statement.
The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling, the presentation currency of  
the group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year. The balance sheets of foreign 
currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange 
differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign denominated subsidiary, the 
deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve (since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1) 
relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement. All other translation differences are taken to the income 
statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are 
used to provide a hedge against the group’s net investments in foreign enterprises. These are taken directly to equity or other 
comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the 
group’s activities. Sales revenue, which is net of returns, rebates and discounts, and which excludes value added tax and sales 
between group companies, represents the net invoiced value of goods supplied and is recognised when the goods have either  
been delivered to or collected by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to them. 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised by the company in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payment  
is established. 
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised 
within profit or loss, except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which 
case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowable.  
It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Tax provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it  
is probable that the group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets  
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or  
the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged  
or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity  
or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred tax liabilities 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either 
the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Pensions 
The group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. All defined benefit pension plans are 
now closed to new entrants.
Payments to defined contribution pension plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The group’s obligations in respect of defined benefit pension plans are valued by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. All group plans are funded externally, with the exception of Germany, where, in line with local practice, 
obligations are supported by insurance policies. Plan assets are valued at fair market value and are held completely separate 
from the group’s assets. Full formal actuarial valuations of obligations are carried out at frequencies of not more than three 
years and are updated regularly for reporting purposes. 
Amounts recorded in the balance sheet represent the fair value of external plan assets less the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations. 
Amounts recorded in the income statement represent the current service cost over the reporting year, which is included in 
operating profit, and net finance income or cost, i.e. interest income on assets less interest cost on liabilities calculated using the 
discount rate, which is included as a separate component of finance income and cost. Other income statement credits or charges 
can arise for special events, such as a past service benefit improvement or settlement and curtailment of plan liabilities.
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liabilities which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the gains or losses on  
plan assets excluding interest, and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive 
income. Actuarial gains and losses on liabilities occur due to changes in actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date and 
also due to any differences between assumptions and actual outcomes. Gains and losses on plan assets represent the 
difference between interest income over the year, and the actual return achieved. 
Share schemes
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based incentive plans as consideration for services received from 
employees. The fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised as an expense with  
the total amount to be expensed being determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of the 
awards includes any market performance conditions, but excludes the impact of any service or non-market performance 
vesting conditions and is reduced by any consideration received from employees. Any non-market performance or service 
conditions are included in assumptions over the number of awards expected to vest, and the total expense is recognised over 
the full vesting period in the income statement with a corresponding credit made to equity. At the end of each year the group 
revises its estimates of the number of awards expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions and recognises the 
impact of any revision in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The social security contributions payable on share awards granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting 
period and is treated as a cash-settled transaction. 78
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
Dividends payable
The liability for final dividends is recorded when the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recorded when paid.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transactions costs incurred, and subsequently re-measured at fair value 
where associated risks are hedged by derivative financial instruments. Un-hedged borrowings are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in  
the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability  
for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred, except where they are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part  
of the cost of that asset. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the balance sheet date, with the present value of estimated cash flows used if the effect of the time value of 
money is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has either started 
implementing the plan or announced its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of the obligation comprises 
costs which are directly related to the restructuring.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments used to hedge risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations are initially 
and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated by reference to market forward rates at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using market forward rates.
Gains or losses arising from the movement to fair value are taken to the income statement except where the derivative is 
designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedges. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item 
being hedged and the hedging instrument, and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.  
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedges
The group has designated forward foreign exchange contracts and the interest rate differential of cross-currency interest rate 
swaps as cash flow hedges.
For cash flow hedges, the effective part of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Gains or losses relating to any ineffective part of changes in fair value are taken immediately to the income statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the hedged transaction occurs, 
for example, when the forecast sale or purchase transaction takes place. 
Any movements in fair value occurring after the time when hedging contracts cease to be cash flow hedges are taken directly 
to the income statement. 
Fair value hedges
The group has designated the exchange element of cross-currency interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. 
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2016 continued 79
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income 
statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the 
hedged risk. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged risk is amortised in the income statement from 
the time the hedging contracts cease to be fair value hedges.
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains or 
losses relating to any ineffective portion are taken immediately to the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity  
are transferred to the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. 
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing the performance of the operating segments. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are incremental to normal operations and are separately disclosed by 
virtue of their nature or size to enable a better understanding of the group’s underlying financial performance. See critical 
estimates and judgements section on page 72.
2. Segment information 
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board. The Board reviews the group’s financial results on a 
geographical segment basis with three identifiable operating segments:
• Americas: which includes North America and Latin America.
• Asia-Pacific: which includes Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China and the rest of South East Asia.
• Europe: which includes Continental Europe, UK, Ireland and Africa.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on underlying operating profit. This measurement basis 
excludes the effects of exceptional income and expenditure from the operating segments. The Board assesses the operating 
segments based on group profit for external sales in each region, rather than statutory profit for the region which also includes 
profit on intercompany sales.
Finance income and cost, and net finance cost on pensions, are not included in the segment results that are reviewed by the Board.
Segment assets exclude tax assets, which are managed on a central basis.
Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities and non-current borrowings, which are managed on a central basis. 
Information provided to the Board is consistent with that in the financial statements.

During the year, the UK corporation tax rate was 20%. Further reductions to 19% from 1 April 2017, and to 17% from 1 April 2020 
were substantively enacted in October 2015 and September 2016 respectively. This will reduce the company’s future current 
tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2016 has been calculated based on these rates. 
The group’s effective tax rate on profit before exceptional items of 23.2% (2015: 12.3%) has increased principally due to 
investment incentives in the Czech Republic becoming fully utilised in 2015.
Adjustments in respect of prior years include adjustments to transfer pricing related liabilities. 
10. Profit for the year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the parent company’s income statement and statement  
of comprehensive income have not been presented in these financial statements.

Shares arising from the Performance Share Plan are only treated as dilutive where the effect is to reduce earnings per share. Diluted 
earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £2.2m (2015: £14.6m) by  
the average number of shares, including the effect of all dilutive potential shares, of 168,658,183 (2015: 168,406,376).
Underlying earnings per share is calculated in order to eliminate the effect of exceptional items after tax in 2016 of £20.0m 
(2015: £11.0m) on the results. Underlying basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the underlying profit attributable  
to ordinary shareholders of £22.2m (2015: £25.6m) by 166,941,137 (2015: 166,928,534) shares, being the weighted average

In the income statement, amortisation of £0.3m (2015: £0.3m) is included in cost of sales and £0.6m (2015: £0.8m) in 
administrative expenses.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The group’s goodwill entirely relates to the acquisition of PV Industries B.V. which was completed during 2015, and represents 
a single cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount of this cash generating unit is determined from value in use calculations, and the key assumptions are 
those regarding the discount rate, profit margin and sales growth rates. 90

The group prepares cash flow forecasts for the next five years derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by 
management, based on expected market growth rates and prior experience, with an estimated long-term growth rate of 1.5% 
per annum assumed at the end of the five year forecast period. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8.7%  
(2015: 11.3%). 
Based on these calculations there is sufficient headroom over the book value of goodwill.

At 31 December 2016, trade receivables of £5.5m (2015: £5.0m) were past due but not impaired. The group believes that the 
unimpaired amounts are collectable in full based on historical payment behaviour and an analysis of customer credit risk. The

Formal procedures are in place to minimise, as far as possible, losses from non-collection of receivables. These procedures, 
which include designated levels of authority, cover the opening of new accounts, payment terms and the setting up and review 
of credit limits. Where considered appropriate, payment in advance or confirmed letters of credit are required before product 
is released to customers. 
There have been no significant losses due to the impairment or non-collection of receivables in recent years.

23. Capital and financial risk management, and financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks associated with capital, interest rates, foreign exchange, 
credit, and liquidity. It is the group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. These 
policies have remained unchanged throughout the year, are consistent with the previous year, and are summarised below:
Capital
When managing capital, the group’s objectives are to safeguard the business as a going concern, provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and maintain an efficient capital structure. The group’s capital structure 
consists of net debt and equity of the group. Net debt is total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Equity comprises 
issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings. In order to maintain its capital structure, the group may adjust the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The covenants related to the group’s bank loan facilities determine a minimum underlying EBITDA to net interest payable ratio 
and a maximum covenant net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio. These measures are defined, explained and reconciled to the 
equivalent statutory measures in the Financial Review on pages 21 to 23. The group had adequate headroom within both 
covenants throughout the years ending 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
Another measure used to monitor the strength of the group’s balance sheet is the gearing ratio, which expresses the group’s 
net debt as a percentage of its equity. The covenant and gearing ratios at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 were  
as follows:
2016
£’m
2015
£’m
Total borrowings (note 22) 163.5 135.1
Less: cash and cash equivalents (note 18) (9.9) (9.6)
Net debt (note 32) 153.6 125.5
Equity 109.0 131.1
Bank loan covenant ratios:
Covenant net debt to underlying EBITDA 2.7 2.6
Underlying EBITDA to net interest payable 7.6 11.3
Gearing ratio 140.9% 95.7%
Market risk
a) Interest rate risk
The group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, together with currency swaps used to 
hedge intercompany loans.
The group borrows in the desired currencies at both floating and fixed rates of interest and may use forward rate agreements 
or interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
The US dollar private placement completed during 2014 means that around half of the group’s debt is currently at a fixed rate 
of interest. The group entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps of US$40m during 2014 to convert a portion of the US 
dollar private placement into synthetic sterling denominated debt at a fixed rate of interest. These swaps were closed out 
during 2016 with proceeds of £3.4m. The foreign exchange element of these swaps was measured at fair value through profit 
and loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the income statement to offset any fair value gains or losses on 
the hedged portion of the US dollar private placement. 
Cash is held in interest-bearing current accounts where practicable with any excess cash placed on deposit. Any deposits 
made are for periods of less than three months.
The sensitivity of net finance costs to a movement in interest rates is restricted by the level of fixed rate borrowing now in 
place. A variation of, for example, 100 basis points in interest rates, applied to the group’s borrowings, cash and short-term 
deposits at 31 December 2016, would result in a movement in finance costs of £0.8m (2015: £0.7m) and finance income of 
£0.1m (2015: £0.1m). This would result in an adverse post-tax impact on the group’s income statement of £0.6m (2015: £0.5m) 
and a post-tax impact on the group’s equity of £0.6m (2015: £0.5m). 100

Market risk continued
b) Foreign exchange risk
The group has several significant overseas subsidiary undertakings whose revenues and expenses are denominated in a variety 
of currencies. Group policy dictates that foreign currency exposures arising from future commercial transactions are reviewed 
by Group Treasury and hedging activities are undertaken as appropriate in order to manage the net foreign exchange risks 
arising. Group policy permits the hedging of up to a maximum of 80% of the net external currency transaction exposures for 
periods of up to a maximum of fifteen months forward. It is not group policy to routinely hedge translation exposures apart 
from those created by inter-company loans or where foreign currency denominated assets are planned to be returned to the 
UK in the form of a dividend. Specific Board approval is required for any other translation exposure hedging.
A portion of the group’s investment in its Czech subsidiary, Devro s.r.o., is hedged by a Czech koruna foreign exchange forward 
contract which mitigates the foreign currency risk arising from the subsidiary’s net assets. The forward contract is designated 
as a net investment hedge. No ineffectiveness was recognised from the hedge. The group’s investments in other subsidiaries 
are not hedged.
The table below details the impact changes in foreign exchange rates would have had on the group’s underlying operating 
profit and post-tax profit for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 due to the translation of both 
subsidiary profits from their functional currency into sterling, and also underlying currency transactions net of hedging 
arrangements and balances within group companies which are denominated in currencies other than the reporting currency  
of that group company. The movements in equity as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 includes the impact changes 
in foreign exchange rates would have on the translation of subsidiary net assets, as well as the effect of cash flow currency and 
net investment hedges.
In each case, it is assumed that the named currency is strengthening or weakening against all other currencies, while all the 
other currencies remain constant. The percentage foreign currency movement is based on the maximum annual percentage 
movement against sterling during the previous four years. Results are shown for all currencies where the impact on group 
post-tax profits would be significant.

Derivative financial instruments 1.4 3.5
Trade receivables 26.0 30.7
Other receivables 1.7 1.9
39.0 45.7
The group monitors its credit exposure using credit ratings, where applicable, and through its policy of requiring appropriate 
credit checks on potential customers before sales commence. These procedures limit the group’s exposure to any one party  
to approved levels. Exposure to banking counterparties is only permitted with approved banks which have one minimum  
short-term rating of A1/P1/F1 with rating agencies S&P, Moody’s or Fitch. At the reporting date no single banking exposure  
was greater than £2.7m (2015: £2.4m). The group does not hold any collateral as security.
Liquidity risk
Alongside the longer term funding provided by the US dollar private placement completed during 2014, which was put in place 
to support the group’s two major investment projects, the group has medium term loan facilities which are regularly reviewed 
to ensure that they provide adequate liquidity for the group. The facilities are managed on a centralised basis with appropriate 
local availability. Details of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 
are shown below:

At 31 December 2016, the group had in place unsecured floating rate committed loan facilities totalling £110.0m (2015: £110.0m). 
These facilities consist of a single syndicated revolving credit facility with four banks, negotiated in December 2014 and 
expiring on 19 December 2019. 
In addition to the committed facilities, local uncommitted working capital facilities of £5.0m (2015: £5.0m), US dollars 2.0m 
(2015: US dollars 2.0m), and Czech koruna 175m (2015: Czech koruna 120m) were also in place at 31 December 2016. These 
facilities are renewable within one year. 102

Derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value are disclosed by level of the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy:
Level 1    Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 2     Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either 
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
Level 3    Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)
All of the group and company’s derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value were classified as Level 2 as at 
31 December 2016 (2015: Level 2). They have been valued using publically available data, such as forward foreign exchange 
rates. There are no financial instruments measured as Level 3. 
At 31 December 2016, the net fair value losses on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge the foreign currency 
risk of anticipated future sales and purchases amounted to £1.0m (2015: £0.7m). These will be transferred to the income 
statement and recognised in other operating income or expense when the forecast sales and purchases occur during 2017.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset to the extent that there is a legally enforceable right to do so, as permitted by IAS 12.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £39.3m (2015: £10.6m) of gross losses.
Deferred tax of £12.7m (2015: £4.2m) in respect of some of the group’s previously incurred taxable losses is unrecognised due 
to uncertainty over the timing of future taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered. 
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of any withholding or other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings 
of subsidiaries. There are no unremitted earnings on which UK tax is expected to become payable if repatriated (2015: Nil). 108

The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. The major schemes are of the defined benefit type 
and, with the exception of Germany where book reserves are supported by insurance policies, the assets of the schemes are 
held in separate trustee-administered funds. The defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants. The total pension 
obligation cost for the group was £8.2m (2015: £7.5m), of which £4.0m (2015: £3.2m) related to the overseas schemes. On  
the advice of the actuaries, cash contributions to the group’s defined benefit schemes are expected to be £5.2m for the year 
ending 31 December 2017.
The most significant defined benefit scheme within the group is the Devro Limited (UK) Pension Plan, which operates in the 
United Kingdom. The latest triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at 31 March 2014 was finalised during 2015. The other major 
defined benefit schemes operate in Australia and the USA. 
Actuarial assumptions appropriate for each country have been used.
The last formal actuarial valuations of the group’s material defined benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2016 
by qualified independent actuaries. The major assumptions used by the actuaries in the following principal countries were:

has been assumed in respect of the USA plan as the plan is now frozen. 109

Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy plan 
experience. These assumptions are under continual review. The mortality assumptions at 31 December 2016 are based on the 
following tables:
Years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65

Male Female Male Female
United Kingdom – SAPS ‘Normal’ (YOB)* 22.5 24.8 22.4 24.7

*  Adjusted by -0.2 years for male non-pensioners and -1.1 years for female non-pensioners (-0.4 for female pensioners) with CMI 2013 improvements using a long-term 
rate of 1.25% per annum.
The Australian defined benefit scheme provides only for a lump sum payment on retirement.
In addition to the above schemes, the group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Germany which, in common with 
typical practice in that country, is supported by insurance policies. At 31 December 2016, the value of the insurance asset  
was £2.2m (2015: £2.0m) and the value of the liability was £3.8m (2015: £3.0m). A proportion of the assets and liabilities  
of the German plan, relating to the period when the business operated as a branch of Devro Inc or Devro (Scotland) Limited,  
was retained by the group after the sale of Devro GmbH in September 2011.
In addition, the group has benefit arrangements in respect of two former executives in the USA for which the group has made 
adequate provisions on the advice of the actuaries. There is also an individual pension arrangement in Japan in respect of 
which appropriate contributions are made annually. The plan in Germany and these additional arrangements in the USA and 
Japan are included under the “other” heading in this note. 
The aggregate fair values of assets in the group’s defined benefit schemes at 31 December 2016 were estimated to be:

All equities and bonds have quoted prices in active markets. The diversified growth funds also have quoted prices. 
Investments in each of the main schemes are well diversified. Strategy is split between liability matching and return generating 
assets with the split determined depending on the duration of the scheme, the funding position and the relevant country’s 
pension rules. For the UK, the scheme invests 60% of the portfolio in growth assets with the remainder in UK government 
bonds matched to scheme liabilities. For the US scheme a defensive approach is taken given the shorter maturity of the 
scheme liabilities with around 70% of the portfolio invested in fixed income assets and the remainder in growth assets, 
principally equities. For the Australian scheme the strategy is for 70% of the portfolio to be invested in growth assets, with the 
remainder invested in defensive, primarily fixed income assets. In all three schemes, the investment approach will be de-risked 
over time as the funding position improves and market conditions allow. 110

The net deficit position has increased during the year. The discount rate decreased for all of the group’s schemes, increasing 
the present value of the liabilities in each of the schemes. The impact of the decrease in the discount rate on the net deficit  
of the UK scheme was mitigated by the performance of the scheme assets with actual returns being above estimated interest 
income. The group continues to pay contributions to pension schemes in accordance with local regulatory requirements and 
on the advice of qualified independent actuaries. The latest triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at 31 March 2014 was 
finalised during 2015 and resulted in contributions increasing to £2.5m per annum until 2026.

The cumulative re-measurements in other comprehensive income are £101.2m loss (2015: £68.2m loss).
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 19 years, with benefit payments over the next ten years

The schemes’ funds have been invested in a range of assets which are due to be realised in line with the associated liabilities. 
The trustees review the schemes’ assets and adjust the weighting between short-term and long-term assets to combine 
security and growth with the liquidity required to meet the obligations as they fall due. 
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure defined benefit obligations:
Assumption Change in assumption
Indicative impact on defined benefit obligation 
(before deferred tax)
Discount rate Increase by 0.25% Decrease by £15.8m
Decrease by 0.25% Increase by £16.6m
Rate of salary increase Increase by 0.25% Increase by £0.2m
Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £0.2m
General inflation Increase by 0.25% Increase by £4.9m
Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £4.7m
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by £11.2m
The above sensitivity analyses are based on the same change in assumption in each of the group’s schemes (except where 
changes are limited through the individual scheme rules), while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined 
benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the projected unit credit method is applied in the same way as for the 
calculation of the pension liability recognised in the financial statements. 113
Devro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Risks
Through its defined benefit pension obligations, the group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are 
detailed below:
Market volatility The accounting estimate of net pension obligations is very sensitive to changes  
in market conditions. The discount rate used to estimate the defined benefit 
obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, or similar, whilst 
scheme assets are invested in a range of other assets, which are themselves 
subject to fluctuations in value. Changing market conditions and movements  
in the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension obligation on the 
group’s balance sheet, in other comprehensive income and in the income statement.
Choice of accounting assumptions The value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by actuarial valuations 
over long-term cash flows. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions 
about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future inflation. 
Due to the long-term nature of these schemes these estimates are subject to 
significant uncertainty, and the final outcome could be significantly different  
to the assumptions used. 
However, the risk is limited in certain respects for some schemes. The Australian 
scheme allows for a lump sum payment on retirement, so is not sensitive to 
changes in mortality assumptions, whilst the US scheme is frozen so that it is not 
sensitive to inflation or salary rises. Similarly the rate of increase in UK salaries is 
limited to 1% per annum.

16,490 ordinary shares of 10 pence each were issued during the year in connection with the Devro 2003 Performance Share 
Plan (2015: 11,490).
27. Share-based payments
Under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan and its predecessor (together “the plans”), the executive directors’ Remuneration 
Committee made provisional allocations of ordinary shares in the company to employees of the group, including Executive 
Directors. No payment for an allocation is made by a participant. Allocations normally vest over a three-year period, are 
conditional on the continued employment of the participant and are subject to certain performance conditions. These 
performance conditions relate to growth in the company’s earnings per share and the company’s Total Shareholder Return  
in comparison to its peer group. 
For awards where vesting is subject to the growth in earnings per share the fair value of an allocation represents the market value 
of the ordinary shares in the company on the date of the provisional allocation, less the discounted value of estimated dividends 
expected to be paid during the vesting period. A participant is not entitled to receive dividends during this period. The fair value  
of awards subject to the company’s Total Shareholder Return performance is determined using a Monte Carlo option valuation 
methodology. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year using this method was £1.92 (2015: £2.01) with 
the significant inputs to the model being the share price at the grant date, an expected volatility in the share price of 25.5% (based 
on historic trends), the term of three years, risk free interest rate of 0.51% and expected dividend yield.
Amounts provided in the accounts are based on an estimate of the probability of the targets in respect of allocations being achieved.
During the year 16,490 shares were issued under the Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan (2015: 11,490). 114

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Devro plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the group and company balance sheets, the group 
and company cash flow statements, the group and company statements of changes in equity and the related notes, set out on 
pages 66 to 119. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2016 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement, in decreasing order of 
audit significance, that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: 
Exceptional items £22.7m (2015: £14.1m) 
(Refer to page 46 of the Audit Committee Report and pages 72 and 79 for accounting policies and note 4 on page 82 for 
financial disclosures). 
The risk: The financial statements include costs of £22.7m which are disclosed as exceptional and primarily comprise the costs 
associated with establishing the two new factories in the USA and China (£20.7m) and other direct costs associated with the 
Devro 100 initiative (£2m). The classification of income and expenditure as exceptional is an area of judgement and it is not a 
term defined under IFRS. There is a risk that items are inappropriately described as exceptional, thus not providing an accurate 
reflection of the underlying (i.e., pre-exceptional) performance of the group within both the narrative sections of annual report 
and within the financial statements. Further, there is a risk that amounts are inconsistently classified as exceptional year on 
year and that the movements during the year in provisions relating to exceptional costs are not classified appropriately. 
Our response: Among our procedures in this area, we have considered in detail the group’s accounting policies and principles 
for recognising elements of income and expenditure as exceptional. We challenged the directors over the inclusion of costs 
and expenses within the exceptional categorisation by comparing those included to our own expectations based on our 
knowledge of the group and its operations, with particular focus on the non-recurring nature of any amounts. We also 
performed detailed testing on a sample basis (e.g. by recalculating amounts disclosed as exceptional), and have considered 
the appropriateness of recognising these items as exceptional with reference to the aforementioned group accounting policies. 
We assessed the consistency of the items classified as ‘exceptional’ year on year and in accordance with the group’s 
accounting policy. We assessed the group’s disclosures for exceptional items in the narrative sections of the annual report in 
light of the ESMA guidance on the reporting of Alternative Performance Measures. We also assessed that amounts classified as 
exceptional are described within the financial statements with reference to either their nature or function as appropriate and 
that exceptional items in consecutive periods are classified consistently. 
Carrying value of inventory £33.8m (2015: £28.5m)
(Refer to page 46 of the Audit Committee Report, pages 72 and 75 for accounting policies and note 16 on page 94 for financial 
disclosures). 
The risk: The risk is that the carrying value of inventory exceeds its net realisable value due to the perishable nature of 
inventory held and the quality of finished goods. The group adopts a policy of providing for inventory when it reaches a certain 
age, and also for any inventory where there are specific quality concerns. Establishing a provision for slow-moving, obsolete 
and damaged inventory involves estimation and judgment, taking into account forecast sales and product quality issues based 
on history. 
Our response: Among our procedures in this area, we attended stock counts close to the year-end to understand the 
procedures for identifying obsolete inventory and we observed such inventories at the count. We checked the inventory 
provision calculations against the group’s policy for aged, obsolete and slow-moving inventory. We assessed the provisions  
for inventory loss compared to historical trends and with reference to known quality issues. We considered the sales and 
manufacturing forecasts and performance for each location in our assessment of the inventory provision, challenging the 
assumptions made by the directors. We also tested a sample of inventory to sales subsequent to the year end to assess 
whether they were sold at more than net book value.

Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report
Capitalisation of assets relating to capital projects 
We continued to perform procedures over the capitalisation of assets relating to capital projects. However, in accordance with  
the progress of the capital projects, there has been a significant reduction in the amount of costs capitalised in the current 
year (£22.2 million in current year compared to £55.4 million for the year in 2015) and, as a result, we have not assessed this  
as one of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and, therefore, it is not separately discussed in our report this year. 
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality amount £1.14m (2015: £1.2m) 
basis 
4% (2015: 4%) of Group profit before tax adjusted for 
exceptional items of £22.7m (2015: £14.1m) 
Range of component materialities £0.2m to £1m (2015: £0.1m to £1m) 
Threshold for reporting corrected and uncorrected 
differences to the Audit Committee
£60,000 (2015:£60,000) plus lesser differences if warranted  
on qualitative grounds
The group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks  
detailed above and the information to be reported back. The group team and component auditors performed audits for  
group reporting purposes at five (2015: three) of the group’s twelve (2015: eleven) reporting components and the head office 
function. We subjected one component to specified risk-focused audit procedures over revenue and receivables. (In 2015, two 
components were subjected to specified audit procedures over key areas including inventory, exceptional items, capitalisation 
of assets relating to capital projects, revenue, receivables, cash, taxation, payroll, as applicable). These entities were not 
individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual 
risks that needed to be addressed. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the group’s results: 
Revenue Profit before tax Total assets
79%
11%
10%
95%
3%
2%
95%
3%
2%
 Full audit
 Specified audit procedures
 Out of scope
The remaining 10% (2015: 18%) of total group revenue, 2% (2015: 3%) of group profit before tax and 2% (2015: 11%) of total 
Group assets is represented by six reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 6% (2015: 9%)  
of any of total group revenue, group profit before tax or total group assets. For these remaining components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these. 
Telephone conferences were held with all component auditors (2015: in addition to calls, the group team visited component 
locations in Scotland, Czech Republic and Nantong, China). At these meetings, the audit risks and strategy as well as findings 
reported to the group team were discussed in detail, and any further work required by the group team was then performed by 
the component auditor. In addition, for the current year’s audit the group team reviewed the audit files of the components in 
the Czech Republic and USA. 
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 122

4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified continued
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ Viability Statement on pages 43 to 44, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, 
the directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 31 December 2019; 
or 
• the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
6 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the 
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or 
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the directors’ statements, set out on pages 43 to 44, in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 44 relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven 
provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 64 to 65, the directors are  
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the company’s members as a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, 
which are incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of 
this report, the work we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
growth on this scale would not have been possible. In 
financial terms, disciplined execution of these strategies 
over the five year period has resulted in Burberry’s 102% 
revenue growth and 82% increase in operating profit, with 
core retail/wholesale operating profit increasing 128% on a 
112% revenue gain. This notwithstanding a financial crisis 
in mid-course.
The five year financial profile is capped by the record 
2010/11 performance. Total revenue grew 27% to 
£1,501m, a 24% gain at constant exchange rates. 
Operating profit increased 37% to £301.1m, achieving an 
historical high 15.6% retail/wholesale operating margin. 
Diluted EPS reached 48.9p, a 39% gain. After-tax return 
on capital, at 35%, remained strong. All of these figures are 
on an adjusted basis, and exclude the impact of the now 
discontinued legacy business in Spain. The Group ended 
the year with a £298m net cash balance. The Board has 
recommended a 43% increase in the full year dividend  
to 20.0p.
Looking ahead. While on a secular basis, underlying trends 
contributing to luxury growth – wealth creation, rise of 
growth market consumers, continuing consumer interest – 
appear favourable, the global macro environment suggests 
some reserve. 
Although Burberry was among the leading performers 
in the sector during 2010/11, a strong rebound in luxury 
spending on the heels of recession lifted most participants. 
Despite some healthy headline forecasts, the current 
climate includes distinct uncertainties – record fiscal 
deficits in advanced economies, rising inflation in high 
growth economies and record commodity prices for 
all. Political tensions in sensitive areas of the world also 
present potential challenges. In short, the macro backdrop 
may not be as favourable in 2011/12.
Near-term factors aside, the Board’s optimism for 
Burberry’s future remains in full. The Group possesses a 
clear and well executed strategy, world-class management 
and design teams and a strong financial profile, further 
enabled by a powerful culture capable of executing under 
a range of market conditions. And the brand operates in 
attractive markets with specific opportunities across the 
spectrum. Burberry’s results for the year and across this 
volatile five year period clearly demonstrate these qualities. 
On behalf of the Board and shareholders, I thank the team 
around the world for their contributions to these excellent 
results, and look forward to Burberry’s further progress.
John Peace, Chairman
An historic year for Burberry – record revenue, margin and 
profit. These results reflect not only the most recent year’s 
effort, but five years of endeavour by this team.
The five key strategies, outlined further in this report, have 
been executed with lasting effect on the business and 
business model. In terms of status, the Burberry brand  
has clearly solidified its unique democratic positioning 
within the luxury arena. Retail, the channel which 
maximises the brand’s ability to manage consumer 
perception, has become the primary route of distribution, 
moving from 43% of total revenue in 2005/06 to 64% in 
2010/11 (greater adjusting for full China integration) –  
while licensing activities have been largely confined to 
three global categories and Japan, with the foundation set 
for future integration of the brand’s business in that market. 
Burberry has also gained share across geographies, in 
both developed markets such as the US and high growth 
economies like the Middle East. Work in Asia, most 
recently the acquisition of the brand’s store network in 
China, has positioned Burberry well in this high growth 
luxury region. In line with the strategy, attractive non-
apparel categories have been intensified, accounting for 
40% of retail/wholesale revenue in 2010/11 relative to 29% 
in 2005/06. Lastly, through a range of initiatives, including 
development of an integrated supply chain and SAP 
implementation throughout the majority of the business, 
operational capability has been upgraded substantially. 
Without this investment in infrastructure and expertise,  9   12
Chief executive officer’s letter
At the most fundamental level, management’s primary 
objectives are the continued development of the Burberry 
brand and delivering sustained, profitable growth over  
the long term. These objectives are addressed through  
a precise vision for the Group, a consistent strategy and  
a distinctive set of values. Although the global recession of 
2008-2009 slowed progress in some respects, we did not 
compromise pursuit of either objective. With an improving 
external environment in 2010/11, the team capitalised 
on the expertise and infrastructure developed during 
preceding years and the Group’s strong financial position 
to accelerate investment in the brand and reassert the 
strategic growth agenda.
Brand Investment
We have long held that great brands project a pure, 
consistent experience across all channels in order to 
standout in today’s cluttered consumer arena. Sharp 
definition communicates the point of difference and 
informs consumer choice, while also conveying authenticity 
and integrity, which are vitally important to a heritage brand 
such as Burberry. A pure brand image captures mindshare.
Further, globally pervasive digital technology is altering 
consumers’ relationships with brands – both expectations 
of, and ways of interacting with, them. Digital’s capabilities 
of movement, sound, information capacity and  
self-navigation allow for an all-encompassing emotive 
brand experience, which can be achieved anywhere – 
not confined to a brand’s physical environment, such 
as a retail store. The technology has raised consumers’ 
expectations for a voice in, and greater access to, the 
brand. Consumers also increasingly expect transparency 
and clarity with respect to the company behind the brand.
•	 Burberry World launch. In line with these principles, 
the Group launched Burberry World – a website 
providing the complete expression of the Burberry 
brand, as well as full e-commerce capability – in the 
final quarter of 2010/11. Burberry World offers access 
to the brand’s defining features, including heritage 
and archival imagery, behind-the-scenes footage of 
key events, such as runway shows and photo shoots, 
philanthropic activity and comprehensive product views 
and information – the site contains the most complete 
product assortment available for purchase anywhere. 
Burberry World also connects the broader Burberry 
community through Burberry Acoustic – a site featuring 
music and videos from emerging British artists – and  13
artofthetrench.com, our social media site allowing 
members to explore and share experiences of the iconic 
trench coat. Beyond simply delivering an on-brand 
interface online, our goal is to provide the perfect, 
complete Burberry experience. We are also reorienting 
other consumer-related activity, including retail stores, 
for multi-channel connectivity – however a consumer 
engages with the brand, the experience should be 
consistent. In terms of its direct commerce implications, 
we expect Burberry World to drive sales across all 
channels – digital (currently transactional in 45 countries 
and six languages), retail, wholesale and licences – 
through long-term consumer engagement and direct 
merchandise access and information. Achieved through 
substantial investment, this global platform is the focal 
point for the brand.
•	 Correcting legacy issues. Although great progress 
has been made in revitalising the Burberry brand over 
the last decade, inconsistencies with the modern 
democratic luxury positioning remain. During the year, 
the Group intensified investment in correcting these 
legacy brand issues. In retail, while the outlet store 
format is primarily an inventory management tool, parts 
of the portfolio are not appropriately aligned with the 
brand; as a result, several outlet stores were closed 
in the year, as others were upgraded, renovated and 
expanded. In the wholesale channel, management 
is concentrating distribution in fewer doors, those 
consistent with the brand’s status, and improving  
in-store presentation through several initiatives, 
including an emphasis on dedicated real estate. In the 
licensing arena, the year saw the impact of the Japan 
leather goods licence termination, as part of the multi-
year process to align that market with the global brand. 
Finally, with the Spring/Summer 2011 season, Burberry 
largely completed the local-to-global product transition 
in Spain. Each of these activities was undertaken 
at a significant cost to earnings, which will only be 
recaptured over time through greater brand vitality. The 
Group will continue to take similar action to purify brand 
presence in the seasons ahead.
Reasserting the Growth Agenda
Confident in the long-term potential of the Burberry brand 
and our design, marketing and retail-led business, we 
reasserted the strategic growth agenda as the world 
began to emerge from recession.
•	 China acquisition. In September, Burberry acquired  
its store network in China from a longstanding franchise 
partner for approximately £65m. China is the most 
exciting luxury market in the world today, whether 
defined by current size, growth rate or long-term 
potential. Already estimated to be the fourth largest 
luxury customer group globally, the Chinese consumer 
is projected to be the most important sector growth 
driver both domestically and internationally over at 
least the next few years. In addition to the transaction, 
under which the Group acquired 50 stores, the local 
team opened an additional net seven stores during 
the year. Since acquisition, the stores have achieved 
approximately 30% sales gains on a year-over-year 
basis. Burberry is well positioned in this market,  
and the acquisition is a key growth platform for the 
brand’s future.
•	 Retail expansion. Retail investment accelerated with a 
62% increase in store-related capital expenditure during 
the year. Average space expanded 9%, excluding the 
China acquisition, led by 28 mainline store additions, 
many of which were clustered in high potential markets. 
Investments included flagship stores in new markets, 
including Beijing and Sydney – the first flagships in 
China and Australia – as well as established markets 
such as London, Milan and Paris. Store renovation 
activity also intensified to ensure the entire portfolio 
keeps pace with the brand’s aspirations and digital 
presentation standards; major projects included  
Las Vegas and Boston.
•	 Marketing in the digital dimension. Marketing efforts 
enlarging the brand’s digital dimension also intensified 
in 2010/11. With digital content becoming a primary 
vehicle to communicate brand identity and engage 
consumers, we continued to invest in content, both in 
terms of creation capability and volume. An expanded 
team of digital experts develops rich bodies of 
consumer-oriented content around any brand activity – 
the traditional still images of Burberry’s main advertising 
campaigns are now accompanied by sets of video  14
Chief executive officer’s letter continued
stories, while simple product shots have become video 
clips. A local fashion show or store opening becomes  
a global event through live-streamed production.  
Digital innovations, such as virtual trunk shows, 
which allow runway show viewers to select items for 
immediate purchase, further immerse consumers in 
the brand. To extend consumer reach, Burberry works 
with leading digital media companies to distribute this 
exciting content across their platforms. The Group  
has also increased digital marketing investment through 
greater use of email and online advertising. During  
the year, the brand deepened engagement with its 
social media communities – including the proprietary 
artofthetrench.com – through the addition of dedicated 
content and more frequent interaction. With almost five 
million fans (at 31 March), Burberry is the leading luxury 
brand on Facebook. Burberry has achieved a leadership 
position within the luxury sector in the digital marketing 
arena, and will continue to invest substantially in these 
activities. Referencing these and related initiatives,  
Fast Company magazine named Burberry to its 2011 
list of the world’s 50 most innovative companies.
•	 Product intensification. In the product arena, 
Burberry directed investment to both core and young 
categories. To drive innovation in the core women’s and 
men’s outerwear and large leather goods categories, 
the design and merchandising teams explored a 
wider range of exotic and luxury materials, pursued 
technical innovation and broadened the highest fashion 
components of the lines. The teams also reoriented 
development processes around creating distinct 
monthly product capsules to ensure a continuous flow 
of new and compelling merchandise to stores. The 
Group continued to invest in replenishment capability 
with the goal of constant availability of continuity core 
product at retail. Looking at young businesses, the 
childrenswear operations, previously located in Spain, 
were integrated with the London-based product 
divisions, with additional resource commitment in 
design and merchandising. The underdeveloped 
women’s shoe category benefitted from similar resource 
intensification, as well as assortment expansion and 
greater space allocation within our store network,  
where sales growth accelerated in the year.
•	 New market investment. Investment in new markets 
also accelerated. Burberry launched its Latin America 
strategy with a dedicated regional management team 
and headquarters located in São Paulo, Brazil. The 
team opened stores in Brasilia, São Paulo and Puebla, 
Mexico during the year. Looking east, the Group further 
developed its joint operation to capitalise on the rapidly 
growing consumer economy in India. Burberry now 
has five stores in this exciting market. Although in the 
near term these operations incur significant start-up 
expenses, we expect them to contribute meaningfully 
to future profit growth. In addition, through franchise 
partners, the Group entered four new markets in 
2010/11, including Egypt and Mongolia.
•	 Infrastructure investment. Reasserting the growth 
agenda required continued evolution and investment in 
infrastructure – finance, information technology, human 
resources, legal. Across the agenda – from disciplined 
management of replenishment inventory to producing 
digital events to meeting the structural requirements 
of new markets – these resources enabled and 
contributed to growth in the year.
Culture and values
Alongside brand and growth, we continued to invest in our 
culture. As a team, we look to reinforce a company culture 
characterised by
•	 Shared vision for the future of brand and business
•	 Democratic and meritocratic ethos
•	 Connected, collaborative style of interaction
•	 Focus on the Burberry brand as the touchstone against 
which all activity is measured
These principles relate directly to the brand’s core values: 
to protect, explore and inspire. Investing (both mental 
and financial resources) in this culture encompasses a 
broad range of initiatives, from communication activities to 
compensation structures and other employee benefits to 
encouraging performance standards – which also extend 
beyond the organisation to our partners. These uniting 
cultural forces, along with our passion, emotion and 
conviction, are as important to Burberry’s success as the 
five strategic themes. Though a commercial enabler, this 
culture equally defines the type of community we believe 
in, and the type of company we want to be. 15
Record financial results
In addition to investing for the future, the team continued 
to execute, achieving record revenue and profit in the year. 
Revenue increased 27% to £1,501m. An 11% comparable 
store sales gain combined with 9% space expansion and 
a 12% contribution from China to produce 36% retail 
revenue growth (22% excluding the China acquisition) to 
£962m. Wholesale revenue increased 17% (26% ex-China) 
to £441m. Licensing revenue was marginally ahead with 
the effect of terminated Japan and apparel licences offset 
by strength across global licences and currency gains. 
Under the single brand, the Group is a well balanced 
portfolio of businesses – balanced diversity within each 
of product, channel and region. With the exception of 
the Japan licences, all parts of this portfolio performed 
well in the year. Adjusted operating profit increased 37% 
to £301m with adjusted retail/wholesale operating profit 
growing 59% on a 29% revenue gain – achieving an 
historical high 15.6% adjusted retail/wholesale operating 
margin. Notwithstanding the substantial investment,  
the Group ended the year with net cash of £298m.
Looking ahead
In summary, it’s been an historic year for the Group,  
the result of a united effort of employees, suppliers, 
customers and licensing and franchise partners. We thank 
this extended team for their commitment and partnership. 
Turning to 2011/12, although the external environment 
may be less certain, we look forward with optimism. 
The brand is well positioned, the strategies are effective, 
the team is united and the consumer engaged. We will 
continue to invest to realise the potential of this great 
brand and business.

Diversified offering
Within the Burberry offering, there is a product 
hierarchy – each collection with unique branding 
and a distinct Burberry identity. 
At the top is Burberry Prorsum, the most fashion 
forward collection centred around catwalk/
runway shows each year. Prorsum, the Latin 
word for ‘moves forward’, provides the design 
inspiration for the brand. 
In the centre of the pyramid is Burberry London 
– or what a customer wears on weekdays for 
work (tailored ready to wear).
And at the base of the pyramid is Burberry  
Brit – what a customer wears on the weekend 
(casual wear), including Burberry Sport.
Collections are distinctly designed and 
merchandised across the pyramid to drive the 
brand’s revenue and profitability. Outerwear 
and non-apparel span all levels as Burberry 
continues to innovate and diversify these  
core categories.

Through more coordinated use of brand assets and greater integration of its global organisation, Burberry has  
the opportunity to enhance consumer responsiveness and operate more efficiently and effectively. This potential  
lies both in the front and back-of-house operations.
In 2010/11 Burberry was again included in Interbrand’s 
Top 100 Global Brands; was awarded the 2010 British 
Graduate 100 Award for ‘Where Fashion Graduates Want

as receiving the Inaugural Innovation Award at the 2010 
British Fashion Awards.
Product and marketing excellence underpin this brand

Marketing innovation
•	 Launched	new	Burberry .com	site
The rollout of the new Burberry.com website began  
in the fourth quarter of 2010/11, with the site live in  
six languages and transactional across 45 countries 
by the year end. The site, known as Burberry World, is 
the ultimate expression of the Burberry brand, allowing 
customers globally – in many cases for the first time – 
to connect with all its aspects, from heritage, to music

dynamic audiovisual content the site becomes a place 
to engage, entertain and interact, as well as providing 
the ultimate online luxury shopping experience through 
a personalised customer service offer that includes the 
ability to Click to Chat and Click to Call in real time and 
in 14 languages. The site provides a powerful locus  
for ongoing efforts to build the Burberry community 
around the world.
•	 Extended	luxury	leadership	position	in	social	media
Engaging with social media is a further critical part 
of the Group’s strategy to connect customers with 
the Burberry brand. In 2010/11, Burberry further built 
its leadership position amongst luxury brands on 
Facebook, ending the year with approaching five million 
fans, as well as almost 200,000 followers on Twitter 
and over four million channel views on YouTube. A key 
milestone in late 2010/11 was the launch of the brand 
on Chinese social media sites Sina Weibo, Kaixin001, 
Douban and YouKu, having launched country-specific 
Twitter accounts in Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Turkey and 
Korea earlier in the year. The Group’s own social media 
site, artofthetrench.com, continued to inspire people 
around the world and across generations to share their 
experiences of the iconic trench coat. By the end of the 
year, the site had received more than 11 million page 
views since its launch in November 2009.
•	 Continued	transformation	of	fashion	shows
Burberry continued to break new ground in the reach 
and impact of its fashion shows. Previously closed 
door events for invited guests, the use of livestream 
technology allowed Burberry to take these key brand 
moments to an ever-wider audience over the course of 
the year, culminating with the livestream of the Burberry 
Spring/Summer 2011 womenswear show, which has 
been watched by over one million people across more 
than 180 countries around the world. The introduction 
of ‘retail theatre’ technology allowed the livestreaming 
of shows directly to flagship stores globally, while the 
development of instant digital commerce purchase 
capability, supported by supply chain innovation, has 
allowed customers for the first time to buy directly 
from the runway for delivery in seven weeks. Further 
innovations, such as the streaming of the September 
2010 womenswear show in 3D to five locations around 
the world, and the hosting of the Autumn/Winter 2011 
womenswear show on the iconic video screens in 
Piccadilly Circus, London, have continued to broaden 
reach and awareness.
•	 Further	digitisation	of	the	brand
Continued investment and an intense focus on 
infrastructure development meant the Group was able 
to accelerate the digitisation of the brand. In 2010/11, 
the Group further bolstered its world-class creative  
and IT teams to remain at the forefront of innovation 
and excellence in the creation and distribution of  
digital assets.   32

•	 Key	appar el	categories	outperformance
Outerwear remains the core of the Burberry apparel 
business, from timeless iconic pieces to innovative 
contemporary styles. A key growth driver, outerwear 
accounted for over half of mainline retail apparel sales 
in the year. At the top end of the pyramid, fashion 
outerwear drove outperformance from Prorsum,  
the runway collection that creates the halo for the  
entire Burberry brand.
•	 Integrated	menswear
SS11 saw the launch of the first fully in-house global 
menswear collection. Historically a licensed business, 
the Group exited all 11 licences between 2006/07  
and 2010/11, enabling the relaunch and repositioning 
of this category. This first pure collection drove 
outperformance in menswear during the year,  
with reported growth of 31%.
•	 Further	built	childr enswear	
Building childrenswear remains a key focus for  
the Group. Childrenswear was formally integrated  
into the global business in 2010/11, with the division 
now located in the Group’s London headquarters  
and its product aligned with core design and 
merchandising strategies. 
2010/11 also saw the intensification of ongoing efforts 
to correct those legacy issues that are inconsistent with 
the global luxury positioning of the Burberry brand.  
A key focus of this effort has been to upgrade the  
brand positioning with wholesale partners. A number  
of Japanese non-apparel licences were also terminated 
during the year and the restructuring and transformation 
of the Spanish business were succesfully completed, 
with the global collection rolled out across all channels 
for the first time from SS11.

Intensify and focus on under-penetrated non-apparel categories to leverage further Burberry design and merchandising 
expertise and iconic branding through investment in product development, marketing and supply chain.
Non-apparel remains a key driver of growth, contributing 
40% of retail/wholesale sales during the year. In 2010/11  
it was again the Group’s fastest growing product category.
•	 Lar ge	leather	goods
Large leather goods remain the backbone of the 
Burberry non-apparel business, representing about 
50% of revenues in this category.
•	 Men’ s	accessories
Men’s accessories was amongst the strongest 
performing categories within non-apparel, albeit from 
a small base. Strong growth across wholesale and 
retail channels was driven by a significantly expanded 
assortment servicing increased demand. Consistent 
global growth in this category was complemented by  
a particularly strong performance in certain markets 
such as China, where the predominantly male  
luxury consumer responded very positively to the 
accessories offer.
•	 Shoes
Women’s shoes represent an important growth 
opportunity for Burberry, reaching 7% of mainline  
sales in 2010/11. Boots, a natural complement  
to the Burberry outerwear offer, performed  
particularly strongly.

•	 Beauty
In June 2010, the Group launched its first cosmetics 
line, Burberry Beauty, with its fragrance licensee 
Interparfums. Reinforcing the brand’s core trench 
and outerwear heritage through its focus on natural, 
effortless beauty, Burberry Beauty was first introduced 
as a test format through a limited number of wholesale 
partners globally and later directly to customers on 
burberry.com. Supported by digital assets and used in 
all Burberry advertising campaigns and runway shows, 
Burberry Beauty is enjoying a strong early response 
from consumers and press as it approaches its  
first anniversary.
•	 Global	licences
Burberry has three global licensing agreements: 
fragrance (Interparfums), timepieces (Fossil) and 
eyewear (Luxottica). During the year, Burberry 
strengthened its organisation to manage these 
relationships more intensively, more closely aligning 
strategies to unlock the potential of licensed products  
in line with owned categories.

Shift company culture and processes from a static wholesale model to a dynamic retail model.  
Retail-led growth refers not only to the operation of Burberry’s own stores, but also to a fundamental  
shift in the Group’s operating structure.
2010/11 saw strong progress in building the brand’s retail 
presence globally.
•	 Retail	expansion	and	optimisation
A record number of new Burberry stores opened 
around the world in 2010/11. A net 26 mainline stores 
were opened during the year, including a new flagship 
in Beijing, while a net 34 concessions were added. In 
line with the Group’s flagship cluster strategy, half of the 
new stores were opened in existing high profile markets, 
while store renovations included major upgrades in 
Boston and Las Vegas.
•	 Digital	integration
2010/11 saw investment in in-store Retail Theatre 
technology to connect and leverage innovative content 
across all platforms. This technology enabled Burberry 
to synchronise completely consistent messages 
to customers across all mediums for the first time, 
and offered an unrivalled audiovisual experience for 
customers in stores. iPads were also introduced to 
selected stores globally, allowing access to increased 
inventory through Burberry World.
•	 Pr oductivity	gains
A continued focus on driving store productivity led 
to the achievement of 11% comparable store sales 
growth in the year. Average unit retail prices rose in 
the period, while product flow and replenishment 
capability improved. The Group’s ongoing investment 
in customer service standards was a key driver in 
improving productivity, evolving to cover customer 
interactions across all channels to deliver a consistently 
high quality experience. A global Customer Service 
team was established during the year to offer 24/7 
tailored support to customers in 14 languages, by 
telephone, email and through the new Click to Call 
and Click to Chat functions on Burberry World. Client 
Services, which provides a personalised luxury service 
to the Group’s most important clients, expanded to 30 
locations across the world, and the Burberry Experience 
sales and service programme was successfully 
extended from the Americas, Asia and Europe to 
Emerging Markets including China.
•	 New	concept	tests
The Brit store concept was rolled out further in 2010/11, 
following the opening of the first test store in New York 
in late 2009. Five new stores showcasing this casual, 
contemporary expression of the Burberry brand were 
opened over the course of the year, including the first 
outside the US in Milan.

INvESTING IN UNDER-p ENETRATED mAR kETS
Focus on and invest in under-penetrated markets. For Burberry, these consist of both developed markets like the  
United States and emerging markets including China, India and the Middle East. All distribution channels and a variety  
of business models are used to optimise these opportunities. 
Key highlights in 2010/11 include:
•	 China	acquisition
The acquisition of the Burberry business in China was a 
clear highlight of the year. In September 2010, for about 
£65m, the Group acquired 50 stores across 30 cities, 
which had previously been operated by its Hong Kong 
based franchisee. This acquisition gives the Group 
control of the Burberry brand in the fastest-growing 
luxury market in the world. Ten new stores have already 
been opened since the acquisition, including the 
brand’s most digitally-advanced flagship in the world 
in Beijing. Merchandising and inventory initiatives have 
successfully driven productivity in existing stores, with 
comparative store sales up about 30% in the second 
half of the year. 
•	 Extended	pr esence	in	Latin	America,	India	and		
new	markets
Following the establishment of a joint operation in India 
and the establishment of regional offices in São Paulo 
and Dubai in 2009/10, the Group continued to extend 
the Burberry presence in these high growth markets. 
A major brand event in Mumbai in December 2010 
marked the opening of the brand’s fifth store in India, 
with related PR and marketing activity introducing the 
brand to this young, digitally-aware customer base. 
In Latin America, the Group opened its first store in 
the key city of São Paulo, and now has three stores 
operating in Latin America. A total of 25 stores were 
opened in Emerging Markets over the course of 
2010/11. Through franchise partners, the first Burberry 
stores were opened in Armenia, Egypt, Israel and 
Mongolia during the year.
•	 Building	wholesale
The Group continued to invest in its wholesale 
presence globally, building separate London, Brit and 
childrenswear corners in department stores, exiting 
generic outerwear departments and adding real 
estate for menswear. A focus on building in-season 
replenishment capability supported growth. 2010/11 
also saw a continued focus on building the Burberry 
Travel Retail business.

pURSUING opERATIoNAL Exc ELLENcE
Burberry continues to pursue its goal to be recognised as much for operational expertise as for product  
and marketing excellence.
A continued focus on, and investment in, operational 
excellence has driven improvements across all business 
functions, and has been a key enabler for front-end innovation.
•	 Enhanced	capabilities	
Reinforcing and refining core back-end disciplines 
was a central focus again in 2010/11, specifically 
in replenishment, planning, logistics and sourcing. 
Replenishment practices were enhanced across 
all product categories, resulting in a nearly 50% 
contribution of replenishment styles to mainline 
sales over the year. Enhancing planning capabilities 
enabled better execution and inventory management 
and 2010/11 also saw the development of a global 
pricing architecture. Improvements in sourcing drove 
savings during the year and quality programmes were 
introduced to factories and distribution centres globally. 
Logistics enhancements enabled the execution of 
monthly deliveries and fulfilment of in-season reorders.
•	 Intr oduced	monthly	flow
In 2010/11 the Group began to execute a synchronised 
monthly flow of new product and floorsets across its 
physical and virtual real estate, featured in tailored 
digital assets. Requiring a co-ordinated and integrated 
approach across the business, from Design, to 
Merchandising, to Buying and Retail, this new approach 
introduces a refreshed offer each month, while providing 
a strong platform from which to connect customers 
more regularly with the Burberry brand. 
•	 Continued	SAP	implementation
The Group took further steps towards the completion of 
its implementation of SAP , with 80% of stores covered by 
the end of the year and the incorporation of China and 
Burberry Middle East scheduled for 2011/12. In addition, 
between April and November 2010, Burberry successfully 
implemented a new, single SAP HR database for the 
employee records of 6,500 employees in 25 countries 
across Europe, the Americas and Asia. This is allowing 
the Group to align its global HR processes and structures, 
and is providing global visibility for the first time.
•	 Prioritised 	 or ganisational 	 ef fectiveness	
Closer collaborative relationships within the business 
have been critical to the successful development and 
implementation of Group initiatives. Further senior level 
governance structures have been established during the 
year to leverage operating best practice globally and to 
co ordinate all capital investments. For example, IT has 
become an integral partner to key marketing and retail 
initiatives including Burberry World and Retail Theatre, 
while supply chain innovation has been a key enabler 
in allowing customers to purchase directly from the 
runway. The foundation was also set during the year for 
the establishment of a global shared services team to 
drive efficiencies and enhance financial control across 
the business, while global strategy teams have been 
established to build detailed medium to long-term views 
for all regions. Externally, partnership working continues 
to bring benefits in key areas such as corporate 
responsibility. Burberry joined the Ethical Trading Initiative 
during the year, making it the first luxury brand to do so.

Retail 
64% of revenue (2010: 60%); generated from 174  
mainline stores, 199 concessions within department stores, 
44 outlets and digital commerce
Retail sales increased by 32% on an underlying basis (36% 
at reported FX). China, which transferred from wholesale 
to retail on 1 September 2010 following the acquisition of 
the former franchisees’ operations, contributed 12% of this 
underlying growth. New space in other regions generated 
a further 9% of the underlying growth.
Comparable store sales in the year increased by 11% 
(H1: 9%; H2: 13%), with mainline stores significantly 
outperforming in line with the strategy. In mainline stores, 
average selling prices increased again, largely reflecting 
mix (greater penetration of Burberry Prorsum and London 
with continued outperformance from outerwear) and 
improved full price sell-through. Traffic benefited from 
digital marketing initiatives and the introduction in the 
second half of the year of monthly flow of products, 
offering newness for consumers. Replenishment styles 
accounted for nearly half of mainline revenue – up by 
nearly 10 percentage points in the last year.
Asia Pacific, where retail accounted for about 80% of 
revenue in the year, performed strongly, with double-digit 
comparable store sales growth throughout the period, 
led by Hong Kong and Taiwan. Excluding China, a net 
seven stores were opened in the region, of which five were 
clustered in Hong Kong. Comparable store sales growth 
of the acquired business in China was about 30% in the 
second half. These sales were not included in Burberry’s 
11% comparable growth in the year. 
Europe delivered double-digit comparable growth in 
the year, with the focus of investment on both mainline 
stores, including London Heathrow Terminal 5 and the 
first Burberry Brit trial outside the United States, in Milan, 
as well as new concessions for non-apparel and Brit in 
prestige department stores. 
Americas’ performance improved in the second half of 
the year. In the United States, Burberry opened a further 
four Brit trial stores. Outside the United States, Burberry 
opened its fourth store in Canada, as well as its first two 
stores in Brazil and its first in Mexico. 
The Burberry Middle East joint operation, with 15 stores 
in the region, delivered a strong fourth quarter due to 
increased tourist activity. Further investment was made  
in the Dubai regional office and in retail expertise.
Average retail selling space increased by 18% in the year 
(H1: 11%; H2: 26%), of which China (both acquired and 
new stores) contributed 9% in the year (H1: 3%; H2: 16%).

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Wholesale 
29% of revenue (2010: 32%); generated from sales to 
department stores, multi-brand specialty accounts, 
Emerging Market franchisees and Travel Retail 
Excluding China, underlying wholesale revenue increased 
by 25% in the year. This reflects restocking by wholesale 
customers as well as robust consumer demand for the 
Burberry brand. Improved planning, supply chain and 
logistics capabilities enabled Burberry to satisfy higher 
in-season orders and to achieve better order fulfilment 
rates. Menswear performed very strongly, especially 
in the second half, as Spring/Summer 2011 was the 
first collection designed entirely in-house, following the 
termination of the final regional menswear licences. 
By region, Asia Pacific, the Americas and Emerging 
Markets all performed strongly. A net nine stores were 
opened by franchisees during the year. Europe, which 
accounts for about 40% of Group wholesale revenue, 
showed more moderate growth as the business continued 
to focus on key department store customers and 
rationalise small, non brand-enhancing specialty accounts. 
Initial sales of the Spring/Summer 2011 global collection  
in Spain contributed 2% to the 25% underlying growth  
in the full year (H1: nil; H2: 4% contribution to growth). 
Including China, wholesale revenue increased by 16%  
on an underlying basis (up 17% at reported FX).
Licensing 
7% of revenue (2010: 8%); of which approximately  
two-thirds from Japan (split roughly two-thirds apparel  
and one-third from various short-term non-apparel 
licences) and the balance from global product licences 
(fragrance, eyewear and timepieces) and European 
wholesale childrenswear 
Total licensing revenue in the year declined by 4% on  
an underlying basis, in line with guidance. Revenue was  
up 1% at reported FX, reflecting the strength of the yen,  
which is largely hedged 12 months forward.
The planned termination of the final regional menswear 
licences and the Japanese leather goods licence reduced 
revenue by £6m, as expected. Other Japanese royalty 
income was broadly flat year-on-year, while the global 
product licences delivered double-digit growth. 
During the year, Burberry strengthened its organisation  
to manage relationships with global product licensees 
more intensively, more closely aligning strategies to  
realise the potential of licensed products in line with  
owned categories. In December 2010, Burberry and 
Interparfums extended certain terms of their fragrance 
licence by one year.
Burberry continues to evaluate integration opportunities  
in licensing. 47

from exchange rates. 
Retail/wholesale adjusted operating profit grew by 59% to 
£219.5m, up £82m year-on-year. A gross margin increase 
of 390 basis points was partly offset by higher operating 
expenses as guided.
Gross margin
Gross margin for the year increased by 390 basis points 
to 64.9%. In the first half, gross margin improved by 670 
basis points, driven by increased full price sell-through 
resulting from strategies implemented in the second half 
of the previous year. Following the 1,400 basis point 
improvement in the second half of FY 2009/10, the 
second half increase in FY 2010/11 was, as expected, 
more modest (up 170 basis points). This reflected the 
shift to retail from wholesale, a further but more moderate 
improvement in mainline sell-through and higher sales 
of replenishment styles, offset in part by a mix shift to 
Burberry Prorsum and London. 
Operating expenses 
Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were 
49.3% in the full year (H1: 49.5%; H2: 49.1%). 
Regional expenses, which are about two-thirds of total 
costs, grew by less than the rate of sales growth, despite 
the shift to retail and an increased investment of about 
£40m in new ventures such as China, Latin America,  
India and the Japanese non-apparel joint operation.  
This operating leverage was then re-invested in corporate 
initiatives to drive future growth, in areas such as design, 
customer service, IT and marketing. The cost of share 
schemes increased by about £15m year-on-year, with  
a similar increase currently expected in FY 2011/12.  48

Restructuring credit/(costs) 1.0 (3.4)
Chinese put option liability

(2.2) (3.4)
Restructuring 
The restructuring credit of £1.0m relates to the release of a 
provision held in respect of the cost efficiency programme 
announced in January 2009 (2010: £3.4m charge).
15% economic interest in the Chinese business 
As disclosed at the time of the transaction, there is  
a 15% economic interest held by a third party in the  
acquired China business. As there is a put option which  
is exercisable from 2020, accounting rules state that  
the discounted value of the estimated ultimate liability  
must be recognised on the balance sheet (£47.3m at  
31 March 2011). In subsequent periods, there may be two 
adjustments taken through the income statement. Firstly, 
any change to the estimate of the ultimate liability will be 
taken through operating profit. Secondly, the unwind of 
the discount (together with the impact of any change in 
discount rate) will be taken through interest. Both of these 
will be treated as exceptional items and excluded from 
adjusted profit before tax. The £3.2m non-cash charge 
taken in the year represents the unwind of the discount  
in the seven months since acquisition.
Taxation 
In FY 2010/11, Burberry had a tax charge of £83m,  
giving a tax rate, as guided, of 27.9% (2010: 27.4%). 
The tax rate on adjusted profit for FY 2011/12 is currently 
expected to be about 27%.
Discontinued operations
Burberry has now largely completed the restructuring  
of its Spanish operations announced in February 2010.  
The results have been included in discontinued operations 
as below.
Year to 31 March
£ million 2011 2010
Adjusted operating result (2.1) –
Restructuring costs (4.1) (45.4)
Taxation – (25.0)
Loss for discontinued 
Spanish operations (6.2) (70.4)
In FY 2010/11, the discontinued operations generated 
sales of £49.3m (2010: £94.8m) and an adjusted operating 
loss of £2.1m (2010: nil). This is better than guided due 
to more effective clearance of residual inventory and tight 
cost control during the exit period. In FY 2011/12, sales  
of the global collection in Spain through all channels will  
be reported within Europe. 
Following a small credit in the second half, the charge 
associated with restructuring Spain was £4.1m in the year. 
Cash spend was £20m.  49
Net cash and balance sheet 
Net cash at 31 March 2011 was £298m, up from £262m 
at 31 March 2010, nothwithstanding the £52m investment 
to date in acquiring the China business and £108m of 
capital expenditure. Working capital was broadly neutral 
in the year. Other major outflows were restructuring spend 
(£20m), tax paid (£98m) and dividends (£69m).
Inventory at 31 March 2011 was £248m, an increase  
of 49% year-on-year, reflecting growth in the business.  
Of the £81m increase, roughly one-third is in China and 
two-thirds is the investment to support monthly flow of 
new products and increased replenishment. 
In March 2011, Burberry renegotiated its revolving credit 
facility, now totalling £300m and maturing in June 2016. 
The pricing and terms of this new facility are significantly 
improved compared to the previous £260m facilities which 
have been cancelled. 
Outlook 
While mindful of the global macro challenges in 2011/12, 
Burberry remains confident in its strategies. With a strong 
financial position, Burberry will continue to invest for 
growth in the current year. 
Revenue
The following guidance for retail, wholesale and licensing  
is consistent with that given in April 2011.
•	 Retail
In the year to 31 March 2012, Burberry plans an increase 
of 12-13% in average retail selling space. This includes a 
net 20-25 additional mainline stores with a bias towards 
China, Latin America and the Middle East. In addition, 
the 50 stores acquired in China will add about 12% to 
average selling space in the first half of the year.
•	 Wholesale
In the six months to 30 September 2011, Burberry 
projects wholesale revenue excluding China to increase 
by a mid teens percentage at constant exchange 
rates. Good progress is expected from the Americas, 
Travel Retail and Emerging Markets and sales of the 
global collection in Spain are expected to continue to 
contribute a low single-digit percentage to this growth.
Including China, wholesale revenue in the first half is 
projected to increase by a mid single-digit percentage 
at constant exchange rates (2010: £226m).
•	 Licensing 
In the year to 31 March 2012, Burberry expects 
licensing revenue at constant exchange rates to 
increase by a mid single-digit percentage. This assumes 
all Japanese apparel and non-apparel royalty  
income is received at contractual minimum levels  
as originally planned.
On this basis, underlying licensing revenue from Japan 
is expected to be broadly flat year-on-year. A step-up 
in royalty income from the apparel licence, which was 
negotiated in October 2009, will be offset by the planned 
termination of additional non-apparel licences in Japan. 
The global fragrance, eyewear and timepieces product 
licences are expected to deliver double-digit growth.
In the year to 31 March 2012, licensing revenue at 
reported FX is expected to increase by a high single-digit 
percentage, reflecting a more favourable yen hedge rate 
year-on-year.
Operating margin
In FY 2010/11, Burberry delivered a record adjusted  
retail/wholesale operating margin of 15.6%. Gross margin 
and operating expenses will continue to be dynamically 
managed to enable further investment in the business:
•	 to evolve its business model, organisation and 
infrastructure (in areas including customer service, 
planning and supply chain); 
•	 to drive long term growth (including flagship transitional 
costs and digital initiatives across all channels).
For FY2011/12, Burberry expects to deliver a modest 
improvement in operating margin. However, with 
investment weighted to the first half, operating margin  
in the six months to September 2011 is currently  
expected to be lower than in the same period last year.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in FY 2010/11 was £108m, below 
guidance of around £130m, reflecting delayed cash 
outflow on certain projects.
In FY 2011/12, capital expenditure is planned at  
£180-£200m, partly reflecting this delayed spend from 
2010/11. Given the brand momentum and increased 
store productivity, the year-on-year uplift is mainly in 
retail, balanced between new stores and refurbishments. 
New space growth is planned to accelerate to 12-13% 
(excluding acquired China stores), while the number of 
major renovations is planned to increase significantly  
to between 15 and 20. 
Retail investment will be clustered in flagship markets, 
including London, Paris and Milan; Chicago; and Hong 
Kong, Shanghai and São Paulo. 
Investment in IT business projects will continue at around 
£30m, with the emphasis on increasing connectivity 
between Burberry and its suppliers, employees,  
customers and partners. 50

RISK
PRINCIPAL RISKS
Effective management of risks is essential to the delivery of the Group’s objectives, the achievement of sustainable 
shareholder value, the protection of its reputation and meeting corporate governance requirements. 
Risk Impact Mitigation
Loss of key management or the 
inability to attract and retain  
key employees.
The loss of key individuals or the inability 
to recruit and retain individuals with the 
relevant talent and experience would 
adversely impact the Group’s ability to 
deliver its strategies.
Competitive incentive arrangements 
exist, with specific initiatives in place 
designed to retain key individuals. 
Recruitment is ongoing and talent 
review and succession planning 
programmes are in place. 
The Group’s operations depend 
on IT systems and operational 
infrastructure in order to trade 
efficiently. Increasingly technology 
is also being used to stream major 
events and to communicate through 
social media.
A failure in these systems or a denial 
of service could have a significant 
impact on the Group’s operations and 
reputation, and potentially result in the 
loss of sensitive information. Negative 
social media campaigns could impact 
on the Group’s reputation.
A number of controls to maintain the 
integrity and efficiency of the Group’s IT 
systems are in place, including recovery 
plans which would be implemented in 
the event of a major failure. IT security is 
continually reviewed and updated.
Major incidents such as natural 
catastrophes, global pandemics  
or terrorist attacks affecting one  
or more of the Group’s key locations 
could significantly impact  
its operations.
A major incident at a key location would 
significantly impact business operations, 
the impact clearly varying depending on 
the location and its nature. The impact 
of the loss of a distribution hub would 
clearly differ from a global pandemic, 
but both would impact revenue  
and profits.
Business continuity plans are in place 
to mitigate operational risks, but cannot 
ensure the uninterrupted operation 
of the business, particularly in the 
short term. The regional spread of the 
Group’s three key distribution hubs also 
helps to mitigate risk. There is a Group 
incident management framework in 
place that addresses the reporting and 
management of major incidents.
The risks set out below represent the principal risks 
and uncertainties which may adversely impact the 
management of the Group and the execution of its growth 
strategies. The steps the Group takes to address these 
risks, where they are matters within its control, are also 
described. Such steps will mitigate but not eliminate risks. 
Some of the risks relate to external factors which are 
beyond the Group’s control. The order of the risks is in no 
way an indication of their relative importance, and each of 
the risks should be considered independently. If more than 
one of the events contemplated by the risks set out below 
occur, it is possible that the combined overall effect of 
such events may be compounded.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that 
risks are effectively managed by the Group. The Board 
has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility 
for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management methodology. 
Risks are formally reviewed by the Group Risk Committee 
which meets at least three times a year. Key business 
risks are also considered as part of the Group’s strategy 
development and ongoing business review processes.  
The risk assessment process has been enhanced during 
the financial year incorporating best practice identified 
during a benchmarking review. Please refer to the 
Corporate Governance section for further details of the 
Group’s risk management processes and internal controls. 55
Risk Impact Mitigation
The Group operates in a number 
of emerging markets which 
are typically more volatile than 
developed markets, and are subject 
to changing economic, regulatory, 
social and political developments 
that are beyond the Group’s control. 
Infrastructure and services also tend 
to be less developed.
Seizure of assets or staff. Related party 
business practice that is inconsistent 
with the Group’s ethical standards 
and the UK regulatory environment. 
Increased operational costs due to 
country specific processes driven by  
the regulatory environment.
The Group uses the services of 
professional consultants to advise 
on legal and regulatory issues when 
entering new markets, to undertake 
due diligence and to monitor ongoing 
developments. The Group has 
strengthened the teams responsible for 
its emerging markets operations and 
works with franchisees or joint operation 
partners who compensate for its relative 
lack of experience in a number of  
these markets.
Failure by the Group or associated  
third parties to act in accordance  
with ethical standards.
A failure to act appropriately could result 
in penalties, adverse press coverage 
and reputational damage with a 
resulting drop in sales and profit.
A number of initiatives are in place, 
led by the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee which reports in to the 
Group Risk Committee. These include 
undertaking ethical visits and joining the 
Ethical Trading Initiative, further details 
of which are set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility report.
The Group’s operations are subject 
to a broad spectrum of regulatory 
environments with which it needs 
to comply. The pace of change 
and the consistency of application 
of legislation vary significantly 
in the countries in which the 
Group operates, particularly in an 
environment where public sector  
debt is often high and tax revenues  
are falling. 
Failure to comply could leave the 
Group open to civil and/or criminal legal 
challenge, significant penalties and 
reputational damage.
The Group continually monitors and 
improves processes to gain assurance 
that its licensees, suppliers, franchisees, 
distributors and agents comply with its 
terms and conditions and relevant local 
legislation and good practice.
Specialist teams at Group and regional 
level, supported by third-party specialists 
where required are responsible for ensuring 
employees are aware of regulations  
relevant to their roles. A number of 
assurance processes are in place to 
monitor compliance.
Over-reliance on key supply  
chain vendors.
The Group relies on a small number 
of vendors in key product categories, 
and for specialist digital and IT services. 
Failure of one of these businesses to 
deliver products or services would have a 
significant impact on business operations.
The Group continues to strengthen 
its supply chain management team 
to enable it to evolve and develop its 
manufacturing base to reduce the 
dependency on key vendors. The 
Group has strengthened its internal 
digital and IT teams during the year 
and continues to facilitate knowledge 
transfer to internal resources. Annual 
financial checks are carried out on all 
key vendors.
The significant growth within the 
business puts pressure on resources 
and the supply chain.
Failure to effectively manage the pace  
of change will inevitably adversely 
impact the Group’s operations and 
return on investment.
Governance processes are in place 
for each major strategic initiative and 
these are supplemented by monthly 
meetings with senior management 
to review operational performance. 
Management and operational structures 
are continually reviewed to ensure that 
these support the Group’s growth. 
The Group closely manages key 
supplier relationships, which includes 
the monitoring of financial and  
non-financial performance. 56
Risk Impact Mitigation
A substantial proportion of Group 
profits is reliant upon its licensed 
business in Japan and other key 
licensed product categories.
The Group expects licensees to 
maintain operational and financial 
control over their businesses. Should 
licensees fail to manage their operations 
effectively or be affected by a major 
incident, the royalty income may  
decline directly impacting the profits  
of the Group.
To minimise risks in Japan the Group 
has established its own operations 
in Tokyo, and there are minimum 
royalty payments specified in its 
licence agreements, including the 
apparel licence with Sanyo Shokai and 
Mitsui & Company. Under its licence 
agreements, the Group can control 
product development, marketing 
and distribution. Regular licensee 
royalty reviews take place to monitor 
compliance with licence terms,  
which can manage but not eliminate  
non-compliance.
Economic downturn. The Group’s performance remains 
strong; however, reduced consumer 
wealth driven by adverse economic 
conditions could lead to a reduction in 
demand, disrupt its supply chain or lead 
to an increase in bad debts, all of which 
would impact sales and profitability.
The global reach of Burberry helps 
mitigate local economic risks.  
In addition, the Group’s financial 
reporting and review processes would 
highlight any ongoing drop in demand. 
Counterparty credit checks are in place 
for all key customers and suppliers, 
and flexible payment terms are used to 
assist suppliers as required. 
Unauthorised use of the  
Group’s trademarks and other 
proprietary rights.
Trademarks and other intellectual 
property (IP) rights are fundamentally 
important to the Group’s reputation, 
success and competitive position. 
Unauthorised use of these, as well as 
the distribution of counterfeit products, 
damages the Burberry brand image  
and profits. 
The Group’s global IP team has been 
expanded during the year to increase 
cover in emerging markets. Where 
infringements are identified (often in 
partnerships with other luxury brands 
and retailers) these are addressed 
through a mixture of criminal and civil 
legal action and negotiated settlement.
IP rights are largely driven by national 
law and the Group cannot necessarily 
be as effective in all jurisdictions in 
addressing IP issues.
Inability to absorb commodity  
price increases. 
The Group’s ability to produce 
products and deliver them on time 
depends on the availability and price of 
commodities, which fluctuate according 
to global economic conditions, weather 
patterns, civil unrest and natural 
disasters. Failure to obtain adequate 
supplies, or supplies at the right time, 
will impact gross margin and profit.
The Group’s agreements with suppliers 
are negotiated by its global sourcing 
teams in advance. 
Anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
and joint operations may not  
be realised.
The Group’s acquisitions, strategic 
alliances and joint operations may not 
yield the financial outcomes expected, 
and can therefore impact sales, 
profitability and the return on investment.
In addition to rigorous due diligence 
processes for acquisitions, using both 
in-house experts and professional 
advisers, post acquisition reviews are 
also undertaken to ensure the business 
is performing in line with acquisition 
business plans.
RISK CONTINUED  58
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
EXCELLENCE IN PEOPLE
Seizing the energy of our brand and the passion of our people, we lead the evolution of an agile, connected Burberry, 
creating the talent of today and tomorrow.
Burberry is part of an extended community made up of 
both employees and external partners, with the twin aims 
of being a great brand, as well as a great company to work 
for and do business with. 
Evolving the organisation, across regions and functions, 
is a natural part of the business and has become second 
nature. This year we have established a number of  
cross-functional strategic decision councils that enable 
us to stay closely connected and make timely decisions 
about business priorities that support our five key business 
strategies. Each strategic council is chaired and co-chaired 
by a member of the Executive Strategic Council and 
individuals from cross-sections of the business are invited 
to connect and collaborate based on their expertise. 
Examples of these councils include a Strategic Customer 
Council, Strategic Innovation Council and Strategic 
Responsibility Council. 
A more robust process to identify talent and potential 
was also implemented during the year, to feed effective 
succession and workforce planning, and elevate our existing 
Leadership Development programme and bi-annual T alent 
Reviews. Every employee in the company is now eligible 
to participate in the Group’ s freeshare plans and is in a 
performance based incentive scheme.
Diversity
A commitment to diversity remains one of our principal 
values. Our diverse employee population continues to 
enrich and strengthen our company culture, driving our 
success as a luxury brand.
After continued expansion into emerging markets and the 
opening of new regional head office locations in Asia and the 
Middle East, our global workforce continues to diversify and 
grow. Burberry now employs nationals of 95 countries across 
all continents.
We continuously open our doors to new and developing talent 
and we are focused in providing opportunities for employees 
across the organisation to realise their full potential. 
We are committed to promoting gender equality and equal 
opportunities at every level of the organisation. Our global 
management team is evenly split by gender. In the 2010 
Opportunity Now Awards, Burberry was awarded the 
‘Female FTSE 100 Award’ which is presented to the UK 
business with the most women on its board. This was in 
addition to receiving the ‘FTSE Executive Women Award’ 
which is given to the UK business that employs the most 
female executives as listed in the FTSE 100 index. 
Health, safety and wellbeing
Burberry is committed to providing a safe and healthy 
working environment for its employees, customers and 
third party contractors. Burberry uses a third party to 
undertake audits at its locations throughout the world.  
The audit framework requires stores and offices to be 
audited at least once every three years, and distribution 
centres or manufacturing sites annually. A governance 
framework is in place to ensure audit recommendations 
are addressed in appropriate timeframes, and ultimate 
ownership sits with the Global Health & Safety Committee, 
which is chaired by a Board member.
Burberry launched a wellbeing programme in 2010/2011, 
which was designed to encourage staff to lead healthier 
lifestyles. Research identified that staff had found that the 
programme had increased their awareness of how to live a 
healthier lifestyle, and reduced the amount of sick leave. In 
the UK this reduced dramatically to 0.8% days per employee 
compared to the 2010 Chartered Institute of Personnel and 
Development retail and wholesale rate of 2.6%. 59
The multi-channel customer experience
In response to an increasingly multi-channel customer,  
the Burberry Experience sales and service programme  
has evolved to cover all customer interactions across  
all channels – in-store, online, and by phone-to-deliver  
an exceptional, consistent and differentiated service. 
In store, the roll out of the Burberry Experience began in 
Emerging Markets and China, after previous successful 
implementation in the Americas, Asia and Europe. 
Consistent sales and service training is now provided 
across all stores globally. The programme continues 
to evolve in order to enhance further the customer 
experience, and the first in-store pilots of multi-channel 
digital initiatives have been completed. 
Service standards have been developed and evolved 
through guidelines and policies that ensure all  
customer-facing channels offer an elevated and globally 
consistent service. The implementation of global repair 
centres and an International Return Policy have enhanced 
the after sale service, ensuring a personalised experience 
at every interaction with the brand.
There has been investment in improving customer service 
contact and this year a global in-house Customer Service 
team has been established. This team provides 24/7 
support to customers in 14 languages. They engage with 
customers by phone, email and through ‘Click to Chat’ 
and ‘Click to Call’ on burberry.com. 
Client Services, which provides a personalised luxury 
service to Burberry VICs (Very Important Clients) 
worldwide, continues to expand across all regions and 
to reinforce customer loyalty globally. Specialist Client 
Services Consultants are now available in 30 flagship 
locations across the world, speaking 20 languages.  
VICs also have access to Client Service Consultants  
online and by phone to enhance the luxury experience. 
Underpinning these activities has been an initial focus on 
the analysis of cross-channel business activity, generating 
customer insight to increase retail productivity. 60
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
In 2010/11 the Group strengthened its CR team  
to a total of 16 members globally. 
Ethical supply chain 
Burberry believes that its products should be made 
only in factories that comply with local labour and 
environmental laws and by workers who work fair but not 
excessive hours, are provided with a safe, hygienic work 
environment, and who can exercise their right to freedom 
of association as well as collective bargaining. The majority 
of Burberry products are manufactured in Europe through 
third party suppliers.
All Burberry suppliers are governed by the Group’s Ethical 
Trading Policy, which sets clear expectations regarding  
the management of labour standards. Four new policies 
were added to this during the year, covering Bribery  
and Corruption, Foreign Contract Labour, Unauthorised 
Sub-Contracting and Animal Welfare. 
Ten Burberry team members are charged with ensuring the 
implementation of the policy throughout the supply chain 
as their sole responsibility, working in partnership with  
third-party auditors and NGOs as appropriate to approve 
and assess the activities of suppliers. The team conducted 
over 700 audits, capacity building and hotline interventions 
in 2010/11. To complement its auditing programme, 
Burberry has trained workers in confidential worker  
hotline services in select factories to provide an effective 
whistle-blowing mechanism and counselling service.
To achieve long-term improvements in labour conditions, 
Burberry provides support and resources to suppliers to 
empower them to take responsibility for their factory and 
subcontractor conditions. The CR team delivers supplier 
training covering the Group’s ethical trading expectations, 
management systems and counsel on transparency and 
standards for subcontractors.
Stakeholder engagement
Burberry understands that it cannot solve supply chain 
labour issues alone and maintains an open dialogue with 
suppliers, other brands, NGOs and trade unions to bring 
collective action to bear across the supply chain.
OPERATING RESPONSIBLY
Since its foundation in 1856, Burberry has sought to achieve the very highest quality standards.  
Corporate Responsibility is at the heart of Burberry business practices, reinforcing the heritage  
and authenticity of the brand. 
Burberry believes that to be a great brand you also 
need to be a great company. This belief is reflected in its 
continued pursuit of improved Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) performance; its tackling of issues related to climate 
change; and efforts to inspire employees on issues  
of ethical trade, environmental sustainability and 
community investment. 
Burberry is a member of the UN Global Compact and uses 
the Compact’s Ten Principles to guide its CR activities. The 
company is also listed on the FTSE4Good Index, achieved 
the Carbon Trust Standard and is an active member  
of both the Ethical Trading Initiative and Business for  
Social Responsibility.
The following sections outline Burberry’s approach to 
tackling important social and environmental challenges, 
including some key achievements in 2010/11.
Overall highlights of the year
•	 Increased the number of factories with worker hotlines 
by 54% to a total of 33
•	 Joined the Ethical Trading Initiative – the first luxury 
brand to do so
•	 Launched a Sustainability Digital Film to employees 
globally to raise awareness of corporate sustainability 
initiatives
•	 Committed to increase the proportion of the Group’s  
UK electricity purchased from combined heat and 
power sources from 29% to 100% to drive demand  
for renewables in the UK
•	 The Burberry Foundation distributed over 2,500 iconic 
trench coats to partner charities in London, New 
York City, Hong Kong and Seoul, all working with 
disadvantaged youth
CR governance 
Michael Mahony, Senior Vice President Commercial 
Affairs & General Counsel, is accountable for CR matters 
on behalf of Burberry and the Board. He chairs the CR 
Committee, which formally reports to the Group Risk 
Committee. The CR Committee held three meetings  
during the year.
Two supplementary committees, the Global Sustainability 
Committee and Supply Chain Risk Committee met three 
times respectively. 61
To increase engagement with ethical trade stakeholders, 
Burberry joined the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) in 
June 2010. The ETI is a tripartite alliance of companies, 
trade unions and voluntary organisations that work 
collaboratively to improve the lives of workers worldwide. 
The work of the Business for Social Responsibility 
Sustainable Luxury Working Group, of which Burberry  
was a founding member, also continued this year, focusing 
on animal welfare guidelines and the exotic skins supply 
chain. As a result, the release of a common Animal Welfare 
Policy by the Group was communicated to Burberry 
suppliers, detailing its high expectations in respect of 
welfare standards. 
Burberry is also a member of the Leather Working Group, 
supporting its efforts to improve transparency in the  
leather industry. 
Fur
As a luxury brand with a strong outerwear heritage,  
there will be occasions where Burberry design teams  
or consumer tastes expect the use of natural hides  
in Burberry collections. 
Burberry will not use fur if there is any concern that it 
has been produced using the unacceptable treatment of 
animals. Burberry safeguards the correct ethical standards 
and traceability in all fur sourcing. Specifically, it sources fur 
from furriers who want to uphold high standards of ethical 
treatment of animals and who share its concerns about 
animal welfare. Burberry publicly supported the Truth In Fur 
Labelling Act in the US in 2010.
Sandblasting
Burberry does not utilise sandblasting on any of its 
products manufactured by or on behalf of the Group. 
Burberry requires its suppliers to use hand brushing to 
distress denim products, and use all appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment to ensure that workers’ health is 
protected during the process.

Environmental sustainability
Burberry is committed to finding innovative ways to 
minimise environmental impacts from the production, 
distribution and sales of its products, and to reducing its 
environmental footprint throughout its global operations.
In order to embed sustainability further this year Burberry 
strengthened its Global Sustainability Committee to include 
representatives from a wider variety of functions within 
the business. The members are designated Sustainability 
Leaders, responsible for embedding sustainable business 
practices throughout the Group’s operations. In support 
of the Sustainability Leaders’ work, Burberry engaged all 
employees globally via targeted digital communications 
encouraging them to continue to inspire and challenge 
each other towards new ways of operating. 
2010/11 environmental performance results
Carbon Trust:
•	 In April 2010, Burberry was awarded the Carbon Trust 
Standard for its UK operations
Energy:
•	 Solar panels are being installed at the distribution  
centre in Vineland, USA to utilise the energy produced 
to power the centre
•	 Inductive motor optimisation panels were trialled in all 
UK manufacturing sites to reduce energy consumption 
Business travel:
•	 Due in part to executing the Group’s under-penetrated 
markets strategy, air travel for UK employees increased 
by 52% per £1,000 of turnover
Waste:
•	 There was a renewed focus on diverting waste from 
landfill. In Horseferry House there was a 54% increase 
in waste recycled during the year
•	 The closed loop textile recycling system launched in the 
UK last year has been expanded to Europe. Since April 
2010, Burberry’s recycling partner has converted over 
130 tonnes of sample and raw material waste into car 
door insulation 
Logistics transport emissions:
•	 An unprecedented rise in sales coupled with the shift 
from seasonal to monthly deliveries impacted the Group’s 
ability to ship goods by sea. To address this, a number of 
key initiatives have been introduced, including centralised 
logistics decision making, shortening of critical path and 
increasing strategic raw materials pre-buys in order to 
accommodate sea transportation lead times.  62

Community investment
Investing and engaging in the communities where Burberry 
operates remains a key element of the Burberry CR 
strategy. In 2010/11, Burberry dedicated a total of £3m,  
or 1% of profits before tax, to charitable causes around  
the globe, a twofold increase on 2009/10. The majority  
of this giving was a donation to the Burberry Foundation.
Burberry Foundation
The establishment of the Burberry Foundation in 2008  
(UK registered charity number 1123102) marked the 
creation of a strategic philanthropic platform, which 
enabled the Company to refine, focus and accelerate  
its community engagement efforts. 
The Foundation’s mission is an embodiment of company 
founder Thomas Burberry’s core values: to protect, 
explore and inspire. Specifically, it is dedicated to helping 
disadvantaged young people to realise their dreams and 
potential through the power of their creativity. 
The Burberry Foundation supports innovative organisations 
and programmes that leverage Burberry assets, combining 
financial support with the knowledge, creativity and 
dedication of Burberry employees. 
The Foundation receives donations from Burberry and 
other benefactors, which enable it to award strategic 
grants and make targeted donations of in-kind gifts.  
In 2010/11, the Foundation received £2.3m in cash and 
more than £260,000 in-kind donations from Burberry. 
This enabled the Foundation to support thousands of 
young people in Boston, Chicago, Hong Kong, London, 
Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seoul, via key 
partnerships with 17 charity organisations. 
Employee engagement
As part of the Company’s employee engagement 
programme, Burberry employees are encouraged to 
dedicate up to four hours of paid leave per month in 
support of the Foundation’s charity partners. Employees 
provide critical one-off assistance to hundreds of young 
people, as well as long-term support via one-on-one 
mentoring and weekly help with school homework. 
In 2010/11 over 25% of employees located in cities where 
the Foundation is active offered their personal talents and 
business skills to help disadvantaged young people work 
towards realising their full potential. In total, over 3,700 
hours or 490 working days were dedicated to volunteering.  63
A significant proportion of employee engagement 
efforts are dedicated to increasing the employability of 
disadvantaged young people in London, New York City 
and Hong Kong. Over the past three years, 126 young 
people were brought into corporate offices and retail stores 
for job training and hands on work experience, ranging 
from two to ten weeks. Beginning with a week of intensive 
training designed and delivered by Burberry volunteers, the 
entire experience provides participants with the opportunity 
to explore their own creativity and talents whilst developing 
the skills and confidence needed to succeed in today’s 
complex business world. 
Successful programme graduates receive an iconic 
Burberry coat to further boost their confidence as they 
look to enter the job market armed with new skills and 
experiences. This year alone, more than 200 employees 
dedicated over 1,500 hours to help change the lives of  
65 young people through the job training programme. 
In-kind donations
Burberry regularly donates products to the Burberry 
Foundation for strategic distribution through partner 
charities. Donations range from one-off gifts of  
non-trademark fabric and materials for art and design 
courses, to a large scale annual Christmas Coat  
Donation programme. 
In 2010/11, a record number of coats were distributed in 
London, New York City, Hong Kong, and Seoul, to charities 
working with disadvantaged young people to help them 
access employment or re-enter education. 31 organisations 
matched the coats with recipients for size and need, with 
testimonials from recipients confirming that, far from being 
just a gift of warmth, a Burberry coat is a gift of confidence 
and inspiration that will last for years to come. 
Corporate donations
An ongoing part of doing business is to selectively support 
customer and supplier related events and charitable 
causes. Each regional office has a discretionary charity 
budget which is managed and approved locally. 
Disaster relief 
Burberry supported relief efforts following two catastrophic 
events this past year. In support of relief efforts after 
devastating flooding in Pakistan, Burberry contributed to the 
Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella organisation 
for 13 humanitarian aid agencies. In response to the 
earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March, Burberry and its 
employees contributed to Save the Children and British Red 
Cross to assist with relief and reconstruction efforts.

The Strategy and Group Overview sections on pages 22 to 40

specific restrictions on the size of holding nor on the transfer of

Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The directors are 
not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
voting rights. The directors have no current plans to issue shares 
other than in connection with employee share schemes. 
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 27.  
The Burberry Group plc ESOP Trust has waived all dividends

may be construed as ‘political’ by the wide definition of that term 
included in the relevant legislation. Further details are provided in  
the Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting.  
Employment policies  
Equal opportunities  
The Group is committed to ensuring the consistent profitable 
growth of its business and a policy of equal opportunity in 
employment is integral to this commitment. The aims of the 
Group’s policy are to ensure that the most capable job applicants 
are recruited and the most competent employees in the Group 
progress, irrespective of sex, race, ethnic origin, nationality, marital 
status, age, religion, disability and sexual orientation. We are 
committed to making the necessary adjustments to support the 
employment of people with disabilities and provide training and 
development to ensure they have the opportunity to achieve their 
potential. In the situation where an employee becomes disabled 
during their employment, the Group will endeavour to assist the 
employee by offering additional training, adapting the job if 
appropriate or by offering a transfer to another position.  
Health and safety  
The Group has a health and safety policy approved by the Board 
and a Global Health and Safety Committee which is chaired by 
the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Each region 
has a local committee which reports to the Global Committee. 
There have been a number of internal and external audits carried 
out to provide assurance. There has been no enforcement action 
following a routine visit by inspectors.  
Further information regarding the Group’s employment policies  
is provided in the Corporate Responsibility report on pages 58  
to 63.  
Employee involvement  
Employee communication  
The Group believes that employee communication is important  
in building strong relationships with, and in motivating and 
retaining, employees. The Group makes use of various methods 
and channels, all of which are implemented globally, including 
face-to-face briefings, open discussion forums with senior 
management, email and a corporate intranet to ensure that 
matters of interest and importance are conveyed to employees 
quickly and effectively. In addition, quarterly updates which 
highlight the Group’s performance and its ongoing strategic 
initiatives are webcast globally to every employee. Furthermore, 
development of content such as videos and digital webpages to 
communicate key initiatives, events and other brand messages 
has further enhanced internal communication.  
Employee share ownership  
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships with 
employees at all levels and runs incentive schemes and share 
ownership schemes for the benefit of employees. Further details 
of these schemes are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 76 to 85.  
The Group again intends, where possible, to invite employees  
to take part in sharesave schemes. The Group also intends to 
grant free share awards or cash based awards to all employees 
during 2011/12.  
Further details of the Group’s approach to employee involvement 
and communications are provided in the Corporate Responsibility 
Report on pages 58 to 63.  
Financial instruments  
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies  
are set out within note 26 to the financial statements on pages  
119 to 121. Note 26 also details the Group’s exposure to foreign 
exchange, price, interest, credit and liquidity risks. These notes  
are incorporated by reference and are deemed to form part  
of this report.   DIRECTORS’ report continued

Creditor payment policy  
For all trade creditors, it is the Company’s policy to:  
• agree and confirm the terms of payment at the commencement 
of business with that supplier;  
• pay in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations; 
and  
• continually review the payment procedures and liaise with 
suppliers as a means of eliminating difficulties and maintaining  
a good working relationship.  
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 March 2011 (2010: nil). 
Significant contracts – change of control  
Pursuant to the Companies Act 2006, the directors disclose that 
in the event of a change of control in the Company the Group’s 
£300m Revolving Credit Facility (dated 28 March 2011) could 
become repayable.  
In circumstances of change of control of the Company, Angela 
Ahrendts may terminate her employment. Her entitlement in 
respect of remuneration is set out on page 79 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report where Burberry terminates her service 
agreement in circumstances where the Remuneration Committee 
determines that Angela Ahrendts’ performance does not meet  
the financial expectations of the Board or shareholders.  
In circumstances where the Company’s shares cease to be listed, 
Stacey Cartwright may, within three months from the cessation  
of listing, terminate her employment on three months’ notice and 
would be entitled to her base salary for a period of nine months 
following termination.  
Details of the service agreements of the executive directors are  
set out on page 79 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.  
The provisions of the Company’s employee share plans and 
awards may cause options and awards granted under such  
plans to vest upon a change of control.  
Essential contracts  
The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with 
suppliers (both of goods and services), wholesale customers, 
licensees who manufacture and distribute products using the 
Burberry trademarks, and franchisees. In addition, the Group 
occupies leasehold premises for the purpose of conducting its 
business. Whilst these arrangements are important to the 
business of the Group, individually none of them is essential to  
the business of the Group and does not require disclosure under 
section 417(5)(c) of the Companies Act 2006. 
Auditors  
In accordance with section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, 
each of the Company’s directors in office as at the date of this 
report confirms that:  
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and  
• he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to  
have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that  
the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.  
The Group’s auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
auditors to the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.  
Note 31 in the financial statements states the auditors’ fees for 
both audit and non-audit work.  
Going concern  
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely  
to affect its future development, performance and position are  
set out in the Business and Financial Review on pages 44 to 50, 
along with details of the Group’s cashflows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities. Financial risk management objectives, details 
of financial instruments and hedging activities, and exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 26, pages 119  
to 121.  
The directors have reviewed the Group’s forecasts and 
projections. These include the assumptions around the Group’s 
products and markets, expenditure commitments, expected 
cashflows and borrowing facilities. Taking into account reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, and after making 
enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
annual report and accounts.  
Annual General Meeting  
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at the 
offices of Slaughter and May, One Bunhill Row, London, EC1Y 
8YY commencing at 9.30am on Thursday, 14 July 2011. The 
Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting will be available to 
view on the Group’s website www.burberryplc.com.  
The directors consider that all of the proposed resolutions to be 
considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and are most 
likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its 
shareholders as a whole. The directors unanimously recommend 
that shareholders vote in favour of each of the proposed 
resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their  
own beneficial holdings.

  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 71
Corporate Governance Statement 
 
Dear Shareholder, 
Your Board remains committed to high standards of corporate 
governance which it considers to be central to the effective 
management of the business and to maintaining the confidence  
of investors. We take our role of ensuring the long-term success 
of the Company very seriously. 
On the following pages we set out our approach to governance  
at Burberry. We explain how the Board and its Committees are 
structured, how they operate and how their effectiveness is 
evaluated. My role as Chairman is to provide leadership and 
ensure that the Board is effective, which I strongly believe that  
it is, and this was confirmed following an independent external 
evaluation held during the year. 
During the financial year ended 31 March 2011, and as at the 
date of this report, Burberry complied in full with the relevant 
provisions set out in section 1 of the UK Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the ‘2008 Code’). This report, together 
with the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 76 to 85, 
provides details of how we have complied with the 2008 Code.  
The Board intends to comply with the provisions of the new UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘2010 Code’) in full during the 
financial year ended 31 March 2012. We are adopting early the 
provisions relating to the annual re-election of directors and will be 
proposing the relevant resolutions at the Annual General Meeting 
in July. 
 
John Peace 
Chairman 
The Board 
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting the success  
of the Company. The Board provides leadership for the Group 
and concentrates its efforts on strategy, performance, governance 
and internal control. As at the date of this report, the Board  
has eight members: the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer,  
the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and five 
independent non-executive directors.  
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for 
decision and approval which include, but are not limited to: 
• the Group’s business strategy; 
• annual budget and operating plans; 
• major capital expenditure, acquisitions or divestments; 
• the systems of corporate governance, internal control and  
risk management; 
• the approval of the interim and annual financial statements; and 
• any interim dividend and the recommendation of the  
final dividend. 
Any matters that are not within the schedule of matters reserved, and 
do not fall within the terms of reference of the Board’s Committees, 
are subject to the Company’s internal approval processes.  
During the year the Board held six scheduled meetings, including 
an in-depth session on strategic matters, and one ad hoc 
meeting. All directors participate in discussions relating to the 
Group’s strategy, financial and trading performance and risk 
management. The Board considers that it met sufficiently often to 
enable the directors to discharge their duties effectively.  
The table below gives details of directors’ attendance at Board 
and Committee meetings during the financial year ended  
31 March 2011.

  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continued 
 
 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 72 
At the request of any non-executive director, the Chairman will 
arrange meetings consisting of only the non-executive directors  
to allow the opportunity for any concerns to be expressed. During 
the year, the Chairman maintained regular contact and met with 
the Senior Independent Director and other non-executive directors 
outside formal board meetings. 
The Board is chaired by John Peace. The Chairman is responsible 
for leading the Board and for its effectiveness, including ensuring 
there is an open culture which allows debate and constructive 
challenge of the executive directors. Angela Ahrendts is the  
Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for implementing the 
strategy as agreed by the Board. The division of the roles and 
responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is 
formally set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The major 
commitments of the Chairman are detailed in his biography on 
page 67 and have not changed during the year. 
The Senior Independent Director, Philip Bowman, supports the 
Chairman in his role and leads the non-executive directors in the 
oversight of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Senior 
Independent Director has a specific responsibility to be available 
to shareholders if they have concerns which the normal channels 
have failed to resolve or where such contact is inappropriate. 
Board balance and independence 
The non-executive directors are, in the opinion of the Board, 
independent of management and free from any business 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise  
of their independent judgement. During the year under review,  
the majority of the Board (excluding the Chairman) comprised 
independent non-executive directors. 
At the time of the 2011 Annual General Meeting, John Peace, 
Philip Bowman and David Tyler will have served for nine years on 
the Board. The Board does not feel that this compromises their 
effectiveness, as they bring valuable insight and experience to  
the Board’s deliberations. The external performance evaluation 
conducted in the year reviewed the non-executive directors’ 
contributions and found that they continued to be effective.  
The Board believes that Philip Bowman and David Tyler remain 
independent as they continue to provide constructive challenge to 
the Board’s decision making process. The Nomination Committee 
will continue to keep the composition of the Board under review. 
Board appointments 
Board nominations are recommended to the Board by the 
Nomination Committee under its terms of reference. All directors  
have historically been subject to election by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting following their appointment and have 
been re-elected every three years thereafter in accordance  
with the Company’s Articles of Association and the 2008 Code.  
At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, the Company will adopt 
early the provisions of the 2010 Code that relate to annual  
re-election of directors and all of the directors will be offering 
themselves for re-election. 
The biographical details of the directors can be found on  
page 67 of this Annual Report. The Board confirms that, following 
formal performance evaluation conducted by an independent 
external consultant, the performance of each of the directors 
standing for re-election continues to be effective and 
demonstrates commitment to their roles, including commitment  
of time for Board and Committee meetings and any other duties. 
Information and professional development 
On appointment, directors receive a full, formal and tailored 
induction, including meetings with members of the management 
team and briefings on particular issues. In addition, directors are 
furnished with an induction pack of information, which includes 
key Group policies, guidance notes and information on corporate 
governance matters. 
As an ongoing process, directors are briefed and provided with 
information concerning major developments affecting their roles 
and responsibilities. In particular, the directors’ knowledge of the 
Group’s worldwide operations is regularly updated by arranging 
presentations from senior management throughout the Group.  
The Chairman works closely with the Company Secretary  
to ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with 
information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it  
to effectively discharge its duties. Where there are occasions 
when directors are unable to attend a meeting they have the 
opportunity to review meeting papers and submit comments to 
the relevant Chairman. Directors are also supplied with a monthly 
management report, which provides information on operational 
and financial performance and the Group’s business plans. 
All directors have direct access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and all senior management. The appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for 
the Board as a whole. Directors may obtain, in the furtherance of 
their duties, independent professional advice, if necessary, at the 
Group’s expense.  
Board performance evaluation 
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous review of its 
performance and that of its committees each financial year. In  
the year under review the evaluation was led by an independent 
external consultant, Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review. The 
evaluation process involved comprehensive interviews with each 
director and the Company Secretary and covered a range of 
issues around board and committee processes, board roles and 
responsibilities and individual effectiveness.  
Feedback from the evaluation process was provided to the Board 
in the form of a presentation at a Nomination Committee meeting 
and a written report to the Board. The review considered the 
outcomes of previous evaluations, the current composition and 
responsibilities of the Board and each of its committees, together 
with the frequency and structure of meetings. In addition, the 
review considered the contribution and effectiveness of the 
executive and non-executive directors. The review identified that 
the Board had a number of strengths, including: 
• they regularly considered and understood shareholders’ 
expectations; 
• the culture and size of the Board was considered effective and 
open, with a diverse range of skills and providing an appropriate 
level of challenge; and 
• the governance and support framework for the Board was 
considered positive and effective.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 73
The review also suggested areas for further development, including: 
• reviewing the succession planning framework; 
• continuing to develop a wider understanding of the competitive 
landscape and the consumer experience. 
The Board has addressed both of these issues since the review 
and will continue to do so going forward. 
The feedback from the review was considered and it was 
concluded that the Board and its Committees operate efficiently 
and effectively. 
Conflicts of interest 
The Board has authority to approve directors’ conflicts and 
potential conflicts of interest and has adopted a policy and 
procedures to manage and, where appropriate, to approve  
such conflicts, which it believes operates effectively. 
A review of situational conflicts which have been authorised is 
undertaken by the Board annually. Following the review for the 
financial year, the Board concluded that there is currently no 
compromise to the independence of any director arising from  
an external appointment or any outside commercial interest. 
Committees 
The Board is supported by a number of committees including the 
following principal committees: Audit Committee, Remuneration 
Committee and Nomination Committee. All the non-executive 
directors are members of each of the principal committees of the 
Board. The terms of reference of each of the principal committees 
can be viewed on the Group’s website www.burberryplc.com. 
The Committees, if they consider it necessary, can engage with 
third-party consultants and independent professional advisors  
and can call upon other resources of the Group to assist them  
in developing their respective roles. In addition to the relevant 
committee members and the Company Secretary, external advisors 
and, on occasion, other directors attend committee meetings but 
only at the invitation of the chairmen of the Committees. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises five independent non-executive 
directors: 
Philip Bowman (Chairman) 
Ian Carter 
Stephanie George 
John Smith  
David Tyler 
The main roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are  
set out in written terms of reference. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for: 
• reviewing financial statements and formal announcements 
relating to the Group’s performance; 
• reviewing the Group’s internal financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems; 
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function; 
• assessing the independence, objectivity and effectiveness  
of the external auditors; 
• developing and implementing policies on the engagement  
of the external auditors for the supply of non-audit services; 
• making recommendations for the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of the external auditors and approving their 
remuneration and terms of engagement; 
• reviewing arrangements by which employees may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in 
matters of financial reporting and other matters. 
The Board is satisfied, in accordance with the provisions of the 
2008 Code, that at least one member of the Audit Committee has 
recent and relevant financial experience, given the nature of the 
senior management positions held or previously held by Philip 
Bowman, David Tyler and John Smith (see biographical details  
on page 67). 
The Audit Committee met five times during the year with three 
scheduled meetings and two ad hoc meetings. The attendance 
record of Committee members is recorded in the table on  
page 71. At the invitation of the Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, the Director  
of Audit and Risk Assurance, the Senior Vice President Group 
Finance, the Director of Tax and the external auditors regularly 
attend meetings. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing 
and monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
procedures and risk management systems. The Committee 
reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan and approved the internal 
audit plan for the financial year to 31 March 2011. In addition,  
the Committee reviewed the adequacy of the ‘whistle blowing’ 
arrangements in place to enable employees to raise, in 
confidence, any concerns they may have. The Committee  
is satisfied that such arrangements remain appropriate. 
External Audit 
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness 
of the external audit process. The appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company’s auditors predated 
the IPO of the Company in 2002. Further, given the elevation of 
the Company to the FTSE100 Index in 2009 and the significant 
geographical and financial expansion of the Company and the 
Group, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate to 
review the effectiveness of the external audit process by inviting 
each of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG and 
Deloitte to tender for the appointment as the Company’s and  
the Group’s external auditors.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continued 
 
 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 74 
The Audit Committee, supported by senior management, 
conducted a rigorous tender process focusing on quality, 
resources, independence and value. The tendering firms  
were invited to put forward a proposal to the Audit Committee, 
following briefing meetings with key management and the Audit 
Committee Chairman. Following the review of these proposals  
by management and the Audit Committee Chairman, two firms, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young, were selected  
to present to the Audit Committee and such presentations  
were made by the personnel which each firm proposed would 
conduct the external audit. This included partners, directors  
and managers from the respective firms. The team proposed  
by PricewaterhouseCoopers was a different team from the one 
which had conducted the audit for the year ended 31 March 
2010. After careful consideration, the Audit Committee concluded 
that the proposal from PricewaterhouseCoopers was the best 
overall in terms of quality, resources, independence and value and 
would better meet the Group’s requirements for external audit 
services going forward.  
The Audit Committee therefore recommended to the Board that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers be retained as the Group’s external 
auditors and that it should propose to shareholders that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be re-appointed as the Group’s 
external auditors at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The Committee recognises that the independence of the auditors 
is an essential part of the audit framework and the assurance that 
it provides. The Committee monitors the types of non-audit work 
that are undertaken by the external auditors, including receiving 
regular reports on the type of work undertaken, to ensure that 
their objectivity and independence are not compromised. Any 
proposed non-audit assignments require prior approval and the 
Committee receives a report at each meeting providing details  
of non-audit assignments carried out by the external auditors  
in addition to their normal work.  
Details of the fees paid to the external auditors during the  
financial year can be found in note 31 in the financial statements. 
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprises: 
John Peace (Chairman)  
Angela Ahrendts 
Philip Bowman 
Ian Carter 
Stephanie George 
John Smith  
David Tyler 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the  
balance and composition of the Board and its committees and  
for identifying and recommending appointments or renewal of 
appointments to the Board. These regular reviews ensure that  
the Group and the Board are able to draw from a complementary 
balance of skills and experience and that there is in place an 
appropriate plan for orderly succession to the Board. The procedure 
for appointments is set out in the Committee’s terms of reference. 
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year under 
review. The table on page 71 gives details of directors’ 
attendance at these meetings.  
During the year the Nomination Committee considered and 
reviewed the structure and diversity of the Board and its 
Committees, the Group’s succession planning arrangements  
and the results of the performance evaluation. These 
arrangements will be kept under review by the Committee. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive 
directors, including the expected time commitment, are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office and will be made 
available for 15 minutes before the Annual General Meeting and 
during the meeting itself. 
Remuneration Committee 
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on pages  
76 to 85. 
Corporate Responsibility 
Details of the Group’s approach to Corporate Responsibility are 
given on pages 58 to 63. 
Accountability and audit 
The Board acknowledges that it should present a balanced  
and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects. In this context, reference should be made to the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 86, which 
includes a statement in compliance with the 2008 Code regarding 
the Group’s status as a going concern, and to the Report of the 
Auditors on page 87 which includes a statement by the auditors 
about their reporting responsibilities. The Board recognises that  
its responsibility to present a balanced and understandable 
assessment extends to interim and other price-sensitive public 
reports and reports to regulators as well as to information  
required to be presented by law. 
Internal control 
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and the Audit Committee reviews its 
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather  
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives  
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Audit Committee  
has reviewed the effectiveness of the key procedures which  
have been established to provide internal control. As part of the 
process that the Board has in place to review the effectiveness  
of the internal control system, there are procedures designed  
to capture and evaluate failings and weaknesses, and in the case 
of those categorised by the Board as ‘significant’, procedures 
exist to monitor that the necessary actions are being taken to 
remedy failings. 
In accordance with the revised guidance for directors on internal 
control (‘the Revised Turnbull Guidance’), the Board confirms  
that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by the Group. These include 
those relating to social, environmental and ethical matters.  
This process was in place throughout the year under review and 
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The process is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee  
which reports its findings for consideration by the Board, and  
is in accordance with the Revised Turnbull Guidance. The key 
procedures operating within the Group are as follows:   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 75
Risk assessment 
The Group’s business objectives are incorporated into the annual 
budgeting and planning cycle. Progress towards the achievement 
of such objectives is monitored by a variety of financial measures 
and non-financial performance indicators. 
The Group Risk Committee of executive management meets 
formally at least three times a year to re-evaluate risk and to 
consider the work of the Internal Audit and Risk Assurance and 
other assurance teams. During the year, the Committee met  
on three occasions. The Director of Audit and Risk Assurance 
attends these meetings. 
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for considering 
operational, financial, compliance and other risks to the  
business and has delegated responsibility for reviewing the  
risk management procedures to the Audit Committee. 
Control environment and control activities 
The Group consists of a number of businesses, each with its  
own management structure which forms part of the overall 
management structure of the Group. The senior executives  
of these units report to the executive directors. 
The Group has established procedures for the delegation of 
authorities for matters that are considered significant, either 
because of their value or the impact on the Group, to ensure  
that approval is considered at an appropriate level. 
The Group’s trading units operate within a framework of policies 
and procedures which are either already laid down or are being 
established in organisation or authority manuals. Policies and 
procedures cover key issues such as authorisation levels, 
compliance with legislation and physical security. 
The Group has implemented various strategies to deal with the 
risk factors that have been identified. Such strategies include a 
framework of internal control and the use of third-party services to 
assist in monitoring specific issues. In addition, other approaches 
are taken, such as insurance. Further information is set out in the 
Risk section on pages 54 to 56. 
Information and financial reporting 
The Group has procedures in place to ensure that there is appropriate 
internal control and risk management in relation to financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated accounts.  
The Group has a comprehensive system of budgetary control, 
focused on monthly financial performance reporting which is at  
an appropriately detailed level. A summary of results supported by 
commentary and performance measures is provided to the Board 
each month. The performance measures are subject to review  
to ensure that they provide relevant and reliable indications of 
business performance. 
In relation to the preparation of consolidated accounts, the 
procedures include maintaining a dedicated consolidated  
financial reporting system, obtaining representations from  
senior management of the relevant legal entities, and the review  
and reconciliation of reported data at appropriate intervals. 
A summary of the key business risks and relevant control 
measures is submitted by the executive directors at each Audit 
Committee meeting. The Audit Committee meets with both 
external and internal auditors. 
Monitoring 
A range of procedures is used to monitor the effective application 
of internal control within the Group. These include management 
review and management confirmations of compliance with 
standards and procedures as well as internal audit and other 
specialist reviews. The Internal Audit department is responsible for 
reporting to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of internal 
control systems. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining good 
communications with its shareholders and does this through the 
Annual Report, preliminary and interim announcements, interim 
management statements, the Annual General Meeting and 
through the additional processes described below. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President,  
Chief Financial Officer make presentations to institutional 
shareholders and analysts immediately following the release of  
the preliminary and interim results; these presentations are made 
available on the Group’s website www.burberryplc.com. 
The Company communicates with its institutional investors 
frequently and regularly through a combination of formal meetings, 
participation at investor conferences and informal briefings with 
management. The Board is kept abreast of the views of major 
shareholders by briefings from the Director of Investor Relations. 
In addition, analysts’ notes and brokers’ briefings are also used  
to achieve a wide understanding of investors’ views.  
The non-executive directors, including the Senior Independent 
Director, are available to meet with major shareholders to discuss 
issues of importance to them, should a meeting be requested. 
Annual General Meeting 
2010 Annual General Meeting  
In accordance with the provisions of the 2008 Code, the  
Notice of the 2010 Annual General Meeting was sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the Meeting.  
A poll vote was taken on each of the resolutions put before 
shareholders. Shareholders approved a resolution to adopt  
new Articles of Association which had been amended to take 
account of the Companies’ (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 
2009 and the final implementation of the Companies Act 2006.  
All directors attended and the Chairman of the Board and the 
chairmen of each of the committees were available to answer 
shareholders’ questions.  
2011 Annual General Meeting

76 Burberry Group plc annual report 2010/11 
Dear Shareholder 
2010/11 was an outstanding year, capping off an exceptional period for the Group. The Group achieved tremendous growth, outpacing 
the recovery in the luxury sector. The Group delivered financial results very significantly ahead of budget and brokers’ forecasts even 
though a significant amount of investment in the future of the Brand was carried out, which affected the year’s profits. A number of key 
strategic milestones were achieved, providing a strong platform for future sustained performance.  
Throughout the year, the Remuneration Committee considered the effectiveness of its incentive plans in rewarding employees for the 
performance of the Group and ensuring the motivation and retention of a high performing executive team, while maintaining a balance 
between cost and rewards for shareholders. 
Against this background, the Committee awarded salary increases to the executive directors and senior management team for the first 
time since April 2008, and agreed annual bonus pay outs at the maximum level for the 2010/11 year. The Restricted Share Plan and 
Exceptional Performance Share Plan grants partially vested in 2010. 
Much of the success since 2006 has been due to Angela Ahrendts’ leadership and strategic vision, which the Group regards as critical 
over the next phase of its development. Following consultation with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee granted Angela 
an exceptional one-time award to ensure her leadership until 2015, when she will be entering her tenth year as Burberry’s Chief 
Executive Officer. 
As announced in 2010, the Remuneration Committee granted awards under the Freeshare Plan to all eligible employees, whether based 
in the UK or overseas. We believe that this will encourage share ownership as well as giving all employees a stake in the continued 
success of Burberry. 
David Tyler 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee. It has been prepared in accordance with the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the “Regulations”) issued under the 
Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) and it meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rules. 
The Remuneration Committee 
The following directors served as members of the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) throughout the financial year ending  
31 March 2011: 
David Tyler (Chairman) 
Philip Bowman 
Ian Carter  
Stephanie George  
John Peace 
John Smith 
The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Board and monitors the level 
and structure of senior executive pay. The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Group’s website www.burberryplc.com. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole. No director is involved in any discussions as  
to their own remuneration. During the year under review, the Committee met five times. Details of attendance at those meetings is  
set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 71. 
At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, Angela Ahrendts (Chief Executive 
Officer), Stacey Cartwright (Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer), Reg Sindall (Executive Vice President – Corporate 
Resources), Michael Mahony (Senior Vice President – Commercial Affairs and General Counsel) and Anne-Soline Thorndike (Director  
of Reward and Recognition) attended Committee meetings during the period under review and provided advice that materially assisted  
the Committee. 
On 1 February 2011 the Committee appointed Towers Watson following a review of remuneration advisors to assist with its 
considerations. Towers Watson provides advice on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans together with  
advice on executive remuneration. The terms of engagement between the Committee and Towers Watson set out that any additional 
consulting services provided by Towers Watson to management must be reported on a regular basis to the Committee, and where an  
actual or potential conflict may occur that such work is agreed by the Chairman of the Committee prior to commencement. Since their 
appointment Towers Watson has provided market benchmarking information to management in relation to a small number of roles 
which fall below the level subject to review by the Committee. Prior to the appointment of Towers Watson, advice had been provided  
by Kepler Associates.  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Remuneration policy 
The Committee believes the Group’s remuneration should be competitive and strongly linked to performance, taking into account  
the global markets in which it operates. The Group’s remuneration policy is based on the following principles: 
• remuneration should be closely aligned with shareholders’ interests through thoughtful selection of performance measures  
(as described on pages 81 to 83), emphasis on variable pay and delivery of a significant proportion of remuneration in shares,  
some of which are expected to be retained in accordance with the Group’s shareholding policy; 
• the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between short and long-term business objectives. Variable pay for 
executive directors includes (1) an annual cash bonus based on profit before tax (‘PBT’), and (2) long-term share-based incentives 
linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in PBT. Furthermore, the Burberry Co-Investment Plan encourages 
executive directors and other senior executives to invest their annual cash bonus into shares over a further three-year period; and  
• total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent within the global luxury brands sector.  
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore benchmarked against the Group’s main global 
competitors and comparable UK companies. The Committee recognises that for each executive the relative importance of each  
of these benchmarks may be different. Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on 
individual circumstances.  
The Committee reviews the Group’s remuneration policy on a regular basis, taking into account the performance and growth of the 
business and the global luxury goods sector. The Committee also considers the Group’s policy against regulatory developments, 
shareholder expectations and market practice. 
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee took into account the key elements of remuneration policy for  
all employees worldwide, any merit increases and global participation in share schemes, including the Sharesave Scheme and the  
recently reintroduced SIP and Freeshare plans. 
Performance graph

Elements of remuneration 
Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and other senior executives, performance-related elements represent  
the majority of total potential remuneration. The mix of fixed and variable pay at target and maximum performance is illustrated below: 
 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
T arget Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares
Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares Maximum
Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%
T arget Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares
Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares Maximum
0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%
Fixed = Base + Allowances Variable Cash = Annual Bonus Variable Shares = Matching Shares (assuming full co-investment) + RSP
(+ Annualised One-Off Award to Angela Ahrendts)
 
 
The Group implements its remuneration policy through the provision of the following elements: 
Base salary 
The Group aims to provide salaries which are competitive with those of comparable roles at global companies of a similar size and/or 
global reach within the luxury goods sector and to a lesser extent comparable UK companies. These companies are representative of 
Burberry’s competitors for executive talent. When making salary determinations, the Committee takes into account not only competitive 
information but also each executive’s individual performance and overall contribution to the business during the year. 
In 2010, the Committee awarded salary increases to the executive directors and senior management team for the first time since  
April 2008. 
Annual Bonus 
Each year the Committee sets bonus targets by reference to internal and external expectations. Bonuses for executive directors are 
currently based on PBT. The Committee believes that linking incentives to profitability helps to reinforce the Group’s strategy and long term 
growth objectives. Targets are calibrated using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors, latest 
projections for the then current year, budget, strategic plan, and long-term financial goals. Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion 
of the Committee. 
In relation to 2010/11, the Committee agreed annual bonus pay outs for the executive directors at the maximum level, as PBT was 
significantly above the maximum targets set at the beginning of the financial year. 
Share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements 
The Group has a number of share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements in place: 
• The Burberry Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Co-Investment Plan’) 
• The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan (the ‘EPP’) 
• The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan 2004 (the ‘RSP’) 
• The Burberry Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 (the ‘Executive Share Option Scheme’) 
• The Burberry Approved Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘Sharesave Scheme’) 
• The Burberry Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’) and International Freeshare Plan (the ‘Freeshare Plan’) 
• A One-Off Award to Angela Ahrendts 
Further information regarding these schemes can be found on pages 81 to 84 and also in note 27. No new awards were made under 
the EPP and Executive Share Option Scheme in 2010/11.  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

Share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements 
The Co-Investment Plan 
The Group encourages executive directors and other senior executives to hold shares in Burberry Group plc. To facilitate this, executive 
directors and other senior executives may, at the invitation of the Committee, defer receipt of all or part of their annual bonus and invest 
it in Burberry shares, with up to a 2:1 match based on Group performance during the year. The Matching Share awards, which are 
structured as nil-cost options, do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive resigns within that period. To further link pay 
and performance, and to align remuneration with shareholders’ interests, Matching Share awards granted after 31 March 2009 are 
subject to secondary performance conditions: 25% of an award may vest if growth in PBT achieves 5% per annum over three years, 
100% may vest if PBT growth exceeds 7% per annum, with vesting occurring on a straight line basis between these points. None of  
the award shall vest if PBT growth is below 5% per annum.  
For the year ended 31 March 2010, Angela Ahrendts and Stacey Cartwright chose to defer and invest the whole of their bonus after the 
deduction of tax into Burberry shares via the Co-Investment Plan. The Invested Shares are included in the table below and in the table of 
directors’ interests appearing on page 85. The related Matching Share awards under these arrangements are also shown in the table below.

(1) Upon the third anniversary of the date of grant of the Matching Share awards, the Invested Shares are no longer subject to restrictions. 
(2) The Matching Share awards are awarded on a gross basis and are taxed at the point of exercise. The market value of these awards at the date of grant (9 June 2010)  
was 725.77p per share. 
The EPP 
The EPP is a one-off long-term incentive plan introduced in 2007, the purpose of which was to incentivise senior management to 
achieve stretching goals and to help provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance. Awards granted under the EPP, which  
are structured as nil-cost options, are subject to performance conditions based 50% on relative TSR performance and 50% on growth 
in adjusted PBT over the three and four-year performance periods to 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2011. Awards do not vest unless 
Burberry’s TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group or PBT growth exceeds 50% over the four-year performance period to 
2010 or 75% over the five-year performance period to 2011. For the performance period to 2010, maximum vesting required Burberry’s 
TSR to outperform the median of its peers by at least 8% per annum and PBT growth of at least 75%. For the performance period to 
2011, maximum vesting requires Burberry’s TSR to outperform the median of its peers by at least 7% per annum and PBT growth of at 
least 100%. Vesting against each metric occurs on a straight line basis between threshold and maximum. Of the shares which vest 
based on the achievement of the performance conditions, 50% vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant based on performance 
to 2010 and the remaining 50% vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant based on performance to 2011. 
The TSR group for this award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financière Richemont, Estée Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Hermès 
International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph 
Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tod’s. 
In reviewing the EPP award vesting in 2010, the Committee took into account the relative financial performance achieved and the 
excellent progress in implementation of the medium term business plan. The Committee chose, after notifying major shareholders,  
to use a local currency basis to determine vesting of the relative TSR element. The portion of the award due to vest in 2011 will be 
calculated in the same manner.  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

(1) Following the calculation of the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to the awards vesting on 26 July 2010, whereby the relative TSR target was partially met  
and the PBT growth measure was not met, 69.5% of these awards lapsed. 
(2)  The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise (6 August 2010) was 865.1p. 
(3)  The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise (23 November 2010) was 1,017.8p. 
The RSP 
Under the RSP which was introduced in 2004, executives may be awarded shares, structured as nil-cost options, up to a maximum 
value of two times base salary per annum. The vesting of awards granted under the RSP is based 50% on Burberry’s three-year TSR 
relative to its peers and 50% on three-year growth in PBT. 
Awards granted between 2004 and 2007 vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and 
at least 15% per annum PBT growth. A proportion of an award (12.5%) may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer 
group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over three years. Vesting against each metric occurs on a straight line basis between 
threshold and maximum. Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vests after three years. The remaining 50% vests in 
two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. 
Awards granted in 2009 and 2010 will vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at 
least 10% per annum PBT growth. A proportion of an award (12.5%) may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer 
group or if PBT growth exceeds 3% per annum over three years. Vesting against each metric occurs on a straight line basis between 
threshold and maximum. Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vests after three years. The remaining 50% vests in 
two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. The Committee believes that these performance conditions 
were as challenging, given the significant changes in the economic environment, as those set when the RSP was adopted in 2004. 
The Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberry’s peers because it provides an objective measure of the Group’s success 
and aligns with shareholder interests. Growth in PBT was chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by management and 
the Committee believes strong growth in pre-tax profit is key to delivering superior shareholder returns. 
The TSR group for awards granted in 2004 and 2005 comprised Barneys New York, Bulgari, Christian Dior, Coach, Compagnie 
Financière Richemont, Hermès International, Hugo Boss, IT Holding, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Movado, Neiman-Marcus, 
Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, Tod’s, Tommy Hilfiger and Waterford Wedgewood. Barneys New York, Neiman-
Marcus and Tommy Hilfiger ceased to be listed and were replaced in 2006 by Estee Lauder, Fossil, Liz Claiborne and Nordstrom. 
Following review by the Committee in 2007, Christian Dior, IT Holding, Movado and Waterford Wedgewood were replaced by Geox, 
Inditex, Luxottica Group and Nike.   DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

One-Off Award to Angela Ahrendts 
Following consultation with the Company’s major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee granted Angela Ahrendts a one-off nil 
cost option over ordinary shares on 8 December 2010. This option is due to vest on 1 April 2015 and then only if strategic and financial 
objectives linked to the long term growth of the Company have been met. These are specifically: the strategic development of the 
business measured against the strategic plan approved by the Board from time to time; Burberry’s financial performance which will be 
assessed by reference to the PBT condition applied to awards made under the Co-Investment Plan in June 2010 (subject to adjustment 
to reflect the prevailing economic climate during the vesting period if appropriate); the personal contribution made by Angela Ahrendts; 
the shareholder value delivered in the context of the evolution of the luxury goods markets operated in by Burberry during the 
period between grant and vesting and any other performance factors which are appropriate in assessing the fairness of vesting the 
award to the executive and the shareholders. The Committee will review progress against the performance condition at the end of  
each financial year during the vesting period. 
The interests of Angela Ahrendts in shares subject to this award as at 31 March 2011 were as follows:

In the event of a change of control, awards will be performance tested and pro-rated for time, subject to a maximum time based 
reduction of 50%, or may be rolled over subject to Angela Ahrendts’ agreement. If Burberry terminates the agreement without cause,  
or Angela Ahrendts leaves for good reason, the option will be exercisable in full. If Angela Ahrendts ceases to be an employee for cause, 
for performance reasons or as a consequence of voluntary resignation, the option will lapse.  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued

The Sharesave Scheme 
In order to encourage employee share ownership at all levels, the Group offers a Sharesave Scheme. The Sharesave Scheme offers 
executive directors and eligible employees an opportunity to enter into a long-term savings contract to save a portion of their salary 
which can be used to purchase Burberry Group plc shares at up to a 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation.  
Where it is not possible to offer a Sharesave Scheme in countries due to regulatory issues, or where the number of employees based  
in that country would make its introduction financially unviable, the Group offers a cash-based scheme as an alternative. 
The interests of the executive directors in options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below:

The SIP and the Freeshare Plans 
The executive directors do not participate in the Freeshare Plan and elected not to participate in the SIP. 
Dilution Limits 
The Group’s share schemes contain limits that govern the quantum of awards that may be granted and the amount of newly issued 
shares that may be used to satisfy such awards. These limits are in line with the guidance of the Association of British Insurers in that no 
more than 10% of the Group’s issued share capital may be allocated under the Group’s relevant schemes over a rolling ten year period. 
Shareholding Policy 
The Committee believes that share ownership provides an effective way to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.  
The Group introduced a Shareholding Policy in 2007. Certain senior executives are expected to achieve an interest in Burberry shares 
equivalent to at least one times base salary over the five year period to 2012. Executives are expected to retain a proportion of the shares 
acquired on the exercise of options and awards until such guidelines are met. The Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Officer are expected to hold an interest in shares with a value equivalent to at least three times and one and a half times  
base salary respectively by 2012. As at 31 March 2011, both the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial 
Officer have complied with the policy. 
As part of the Group’s Shareholding Policy, the Chairman and non-executive directors are expected to hold shares with a market  
value of a minimum of £6,000 for each year of their appointment. The Chairman and non-executive directors have complied with  
this policy. 
Gains made by directors on share options and awards 
The table below shows notional gains made by individual directors from the exercise of share options and awards during the year  
to 31 March 2011. The gains are calculated by reference to the market value of Burberry’s shares on the date of exercise.

  STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 86 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union, and the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and  
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent Company financial statements respectively; and 
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 67 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
• the Directors’ Report contained on page 68 includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.  INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF  
BURBERRY GROUP PLC 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 87
We have audited the Group financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Group Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 86, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation  
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies  
we consider the implications for our report.  
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Group financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2011 and of its profit and cash flows for the year  
then ended;  
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 70, in relation to going concern;  
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2011  
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 93
1. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group (the Group) is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer. Burberry also licenses third parties to 
manufacture and distribute products using the ‘Burberry’ trademarks. All of the companies which comprise the Group are owned  
by Burberry Group plc (the Company) directly or indirectly.  
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
except as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
The following new standard is mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2010: 
IFRS 3 (Revised) Business combinations  
The standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, but with certain significant changes. All payments  
to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at 
fair value through income. Goodwill and non-controlling interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis. All transaction costs are 
expensed. The amendments have been applied by the Group to all business combinations with effect from 1 April 2010.  
The new standards, amendments and interpretations issued and effective for the financial period commencing on 1 April 2010 which 
have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group include: 
IAS 38 (Amendment) Intangible assets 
IAS 36 (Amendment) Impairment of assets 
IFRS 5 (Amendment) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  
IAS 27 (Revised) Consolidated and separate financial statements 
IAS 39 (Amendment) Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement 
As at 31 March 2011, the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations, which are expected to be relevant  
to the Group’s results, were issued but not yet effective: 
IFRS 9 Financial instruments  
This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and introduces 
new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU. Any potential impact of this new standard will be quantified closer  
to the date of adoption. 
IAS 24 (Revised) Related party disclosures 
The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2011, and the Group will adopt the revised standard from 1 April 2011 subject to EU endorsement. No material 
impact is anticipated. 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 94 
1. Basis of preparation (continued) 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s annual financial statements comprise those of the parent Company and its subsidiaries, presented as a single economic entity. 
The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.  
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred out of the Group. Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for  
the portion of the reporting period during which Burberry Group plc had control. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits  
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements. The Group treats transactions with 
non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference 
between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. 
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.  
Key sources of estimation and judgement  
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial 
statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period  
in which the circumstances change. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas where the estimates and assumptions applied 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below: 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have 
been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to 
arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value. Refer to note 10 for further details of goodwill balances. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  
may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is 
determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. Refer to note 11 
for further details of tangible fixed asset balances. 
Income and deferred taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes  
in each territory. There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes  
will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the period in which such determination is made. Refer to notes 7 and 
13 for further details of income and deferred tax balances. 
Put option liability over non-controlling interest 
The calculation of the net present value of the put option over the non-controlling interest in the Group’s business in China requires  
the application of key assumptions around the future performance of both the Group and the Group’s business in China, the Burberry 
Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise, the risk free rate in China, and China’s future gross domestic product growth. 
Refer to notes 18 and 26 for further details of the put option liability.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 95
2. Accounting policies 
The consolidated financial information of Burberry Group plc and all its subsidiaries has been prepared in accordance with IFRS.  
The principal accounting policies of the Group are: 
a) Revenue 
Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied  
(less returns, trade discounts and allowances) and royalties receivable. 
Wholesale sales are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, with provisions  
made for expected returns and allowances. Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with customers. 
Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated based on historical return levels. Royalties receivable from licensees are 
accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, which is typically on the basis of production volumes. 
b) Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.  
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been identified as  
the Board of Directors. 
c) Business combinations 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition  
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Contingent payments are remeasured at fair value through the Income Statement. All transaction costs are expensed to the Income 
Statement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less 
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement. 
d) Share schemes 
The cost of the share based incentives received by employees (including executive directors) is measured with reference to the fair  
value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair value 
of the award made. The impact of performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant, except  
for conditions linked to the price of Burberry Group plc shares i.e. market conditions. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market 
conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number of options 
expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  
The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. 
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are 
credited to share capital and share premium.  
e) Operating leases 
Burberry Group is both a lessor and lessee of property. Gross rental expenditure in respect of operating leases is recognised on a 
straight line basis over the period of the lease. Certain rental expenses are determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific  
retail locations and are accrued for on that basis. 
Amounts paid to acquire the rights to a lease (lease premiums) are capitalised in intangible assets and written off in equal annual 
instalments over the life of the lease contract. Lease incentives, typically rent free periods and capital contributions, are held on the 
Balance Sheet in accruals and deferred income and recognised over the term of the lease.  
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives are deferred 
and recognised over the term of the lease.  
f) Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 96 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
g) Pension costs 
Defined benefit schemes 
Eligible employees of the Group participate in defined benefit schemes in France and Taiwan.  
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes represents the Group’s share of the present value  
of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised 
past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. 
Defined contribution schemes 
Eligible employees also participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held in an 
independently administered fund. The cost of providing these benefits to participating employees is recognised in the Income Statement 
and comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year. 
h) Intangible fixed assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on acquisition is 
recorded as an intangible fixed asset. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed  
at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are also made to align the accounting policies of acquired 
businesses with those of the Group.  
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful economic life. Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not 
reversed in future periods. 
Trade marks and other intangible assets 
The cost of securing and renewing trade marks and the cost of acquiring other intangible assets such as lease premiums is capitalised 
and amortised by equal annual instalments over the useful economic life of the asset, typically ten years. The useful economic life  
of trade marks and other intangible assets is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying 
agreement and the nature of the asset. 
Computer software 
The cost of acquiring computer software (including licences and separately identifiable external development costs) is capitalised as  
an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for its intended use. Software costs are 
amortised by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives, which are up to five years. 
i) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost, based on historical revalued amounts, less accumulated depreciation 
and provision to reflect any impairment in value. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the assets in 
equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: 
Land Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Leaseholds – less than 50 years expired  Over the unexpired term of the lease 
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3 – 8 years 
Retail fixtures and fittings 2 – 5 years 
Office equipment 5 years 
Computer equipment Up to 5 years 
Assets in the course of construction Not depreciated 
Profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 
Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and net book 
value at the date of sale. Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional. 
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 97
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
j) Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that  
are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).  
k) Investment properties 
Investment properties are freehold properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value. Cost includes the original purchase price plus any 
directly attributable transaction costs. Investment properties are depreciated over an estimated useful life of up to 50 years. Depreciation 
is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the properties. 
l) Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical 
area of operations that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Discontinued 
operations are presented on the Income Statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continued use, and a sale within the next twelve months is considered to be highly probable. They are stated as  
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. 
m)  Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost (including an appropriate proportion of 
production overhead) and net realisable value. Provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard  
to the nature and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability. 
n) Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes  
items which are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised  
or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
o) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that 
an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. 
When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated on the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation. The present value is calculated using forward market interest rates, as measured at the 
balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks reflected in future cash flow estimates. 
p) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued 
or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 98 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
q) Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is no longer recognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire or substantially 
all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is no longer recognised when the obligation specified in the contract 
is discharged, cancelled or expires.  
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for 
derivatives, which are classified as held for trading (except where they qualify for hedge accounting) and are held at fair value. Financial 
liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals, borrowings and put option liabilities over the non-controlling interests. 
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss and loans and 
receivables. Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables and cash and other equivalents. Derivatives are classified as  
held for trading unless in a hedging relationship and are held at fair value.  
The Group’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below.   
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less, held with 
banks and liquidity funds. Bank overdrafts are recorded under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet 
date. Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision  
is recognised in the Income Statement. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet 
date. Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Income 
Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless  
the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date. 
Put option liabilities over non-controlling interests 
Put options over shares in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests that arise on acquisition are recognised initially at fair value 
through equity. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The discount is unwound 
through the Income Statement as a finance charge.   NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 99
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
q) Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivative instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain  
trading transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly 
probable cash flows in relation to future sales, royalty receivables and product purchases. To manage interest rate risk the Group 
manages its proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap derivatives. 
It designates foreign currency borrowings in a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries. 
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its 
risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at 
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective 
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of 
recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of 
the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities 
or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or (3) classified as 
held for trading. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement 
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is deferred in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged 
item affects the Income Statement. If it is expected that all or a portion of a loss deferred in other comprehensive income will not be 
recovered in one or more future periods, or the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount that is not expected  
to be recovered is reclassified to the Income Statement. If a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change 
to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement within operating expenses. 
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the 
retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to the Income Statement when 
the foreign operation that was hedged is disposed of.   NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
r) Foreign currency translation  
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling,  
which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency at the 
exchange rate ruling at the monthly average exchange rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which  
are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise, except where these exchange 
differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries of the Group, in which case such differences are taken directly to the 
foreign currency translation reserve within equity.  
Translation of the results of overseas businesses 
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Group’s presentation currency of Sterling each month at the weighted 
average exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Group’s trading results. The weighted average exchange rate  
is used, as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions. The assets and liabilities of such 
undertakings are translated at the year end exchange rates. Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in 
subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.  
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the closing rate.

s) Adjusted profit before taxation and exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that are largely one-off and material in nature, as well as the unwind of the discount and any fair  
value movements on put option liabilities. These items are added back/deducted from profit/loss before taxation to arrive at adjusted 
profit/loss before taxation which is disclosed in order to provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of

3. Segmental analysis 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors. The Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting  
in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports 
used by the Board. 
The Board considers Burberry’s business through its two channels to market, being Retail/Wholesale and Licensing. Retail/Wholesale 
revenues are generated by the sale of luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions, outlets and digital commerce as  
well as Burberry franchisees, prestige department stores globally and multi-brand specialty accounts.  
The flow of global product between Retail and Wholesale channels and across our regions is monitored and optimised at a corporate level 
and implemented via the Group’s inventory hubs situated in Asia, Europe and the US. Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt 
of royalties from Burberry’s partners in Japan and global licensees of fragrances, eyewear, timepieces and European childrenswear. 
The Board assesses channel performance based on a measure of adjusted operating profit. This measurement basis excludes the 
effects of non-recurring events and exceptional items. The measure of earnings for each operating segment that is reviewed by the 
Board includes an allocation of corporate and central costs. Interest income and charges are not included in the result for each 
operating segment that is reviewed by the Board.

No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill balance as the recoverable amount of goodwill  
for each cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value. The recoverable amount of all cash generating units have been determined on 
a value-in-use basis. The value-in-use calculations were performed using pre-tax cash flow projections for 2011/12 based on financial 
plans approved by management. The value-in-use calculations comprise three years of discounted cash flows and a discounted 
terminal value at the end of the third year. No growth has been assumed for the China and Korea cash flows beyond the year ending  
31 March 2012 and the cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates reflecting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
adjusted for country specific tax rates and risks. The adjusted weighted average cost of capital rates for China and Korea were 13.5% 
and 14.1% respectively (2010: n/a, 16.3%). 
At 31 March 2010, an impairment of £1.4m was recognised in respect of the carrying value of goodwill in the Guam business.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

During the year to 31 March 2011, a net impairment charge of £nil (2010: £6.3m) was identified as part of the annual impairment review 
relating to both the continuing and discontinued operations. 
Where indicators of impairment were identified, the impairment review compared the value-in-use of the assets to the carrying values  
at 31 March 2011. The pre-tax cash flow projections were based on financial plans approved by management and extrapolated beyond 
the budget year to the lease exit dates using growth rates and inflation rates appropriate to each country’s economic conditions.  
The pre-tax discount rates used in these calculations were between 12.2% and 18.5% (2010: between 11.6% and 17.3%), based  
on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific tax rates and risks.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit through the 
future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of £15.2m (2010: £45.7m) in respect of losses and 
temporary timing differences amounting to £45.1m (2010: £151.1m) that can be set off against future taxable income. There is a time 
limit for the recovery of £9.0m of these potential assets (2010: £41.3m) which ranges from nine to ten years (2010: five to fifteen years). 
Included within other temporary differences above is a deferred tax liability of £0.6m (2010: £0.8m) relating to unremitted overseas 
earnings. No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries where the Group  
is able to control the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future, or  
where no liability would arise on the remittance. The unrecognised deferred tax liability on unremitted earnings is £1.0m (2010: £nil).  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

The individually impaired receivables relate to balances with trading parties which have passed their payment due dates or where 
uncertainty exists over recoverability. As at 31 March 2011, trade receivables of £18.4m (2010: £24.0m) were impaired. The amount  
of the provision against these receivables was £12.1m as of 31 March 2011 (2010: £16.8m). It was assessed that a portion of the 
receivables is expected to be recovered. Individually impaired receivables of £3.7m (2010: £6.8m) relate to the discontinued Spanish

14. Trade and other receivables (continued) 
There are no impaired receivables within other receivables (2010: £0.1m). The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
with respect to trade receivables is the carrying amount on the Balance Sheet. The Group does not hold any collateral as security. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

31 March

In the year to 31 March 2011, the Group reversed £4.6m of previous inventory writedowns in relation to the stock held in the 
discontinued Spanish operations. The cost of inventories physically destroyed in the year is £6.6m (2010: £1.5m). 
16. Derivative financial instruments 
The Group Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To reduce exposure to currency 
fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange 
contracts. These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges. 
Cash flow hedges 
The Group’s foreign currency denominated transactions arise principally from royalty income, sales and purchases. The Group manages 
these exposures through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Following the acquisition of the Burberry retail and distribution business in China, Sparkle Roll Holdings Limited, a non-Group company, 
retains a 15% economic interest in the Group’s business in China. Put and call options exist over this interest stake which are 
exercisable after 5 years from acquisition date in the case of the call option, and 10 years from acquisition date in the case of the put 
option. The net present value of the put option has been recognised as a non-current financial liability under IAS 39. 
The key assumptions in arriving at the value of the put option are the future performance of the Group and that of the Group’s business 
in China, the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise, the risk free rate in China and China’s future gross 
domestic product growth. 
The maturity of the other non-current creditors, accruals and deferred income, all of which do not bear interest, is as follows:

The non-current provisions relate to provisions for onerous leases and property reinstatement costs which are expected to be utilised 
within nine years. Onerous leases of £0.5m (2010: £1.2m) are included within restructuring costs of which £0.2m (2010: £0.6m) are 
non-current. The remaining restructuring provision of £13.4m (2010: £29.6m) represents a current liability. The majority of this relates  
to the closure of the Spanish operations.

Included within bank overdrafts is £166.1m (2010: £205.0m) representing balances on cash pooling arrangements in the Group.  
On 28 March 2011, a £300m multi-currency revolving credit facility was agreed with a syndicate of third party banks. At 31 March 2011, 
there were no outstanding drawings (2010: £nil). Interest is charged on this facility at LIBOR plus 0.90% on drawings less than £100m, 
at LIBOR plus 1.05% on drawings between £100m and £200m and at LIBOR plus 1.20% on drawings over £200m. The facility matures 
on 30 June 2016. This facility replaces the £200m three year multi-currency revolving facility in place as at 16 March 2009 which had 
been due to mature on 30 June 2012, and the two bilateral multi-currency revolving credit facilities, totalling £60m which had been due 
to mature on 13 June 2011.  
On 1 October 2010, a Yen 145m bilateral facility was agreed with a third party bank. At 31 March 2011, the amount drawn down  
was Yen 100.8m (2010: Yen 100.8m). Interest is charged on this facility at the Japanese short-term prime rate plus 0.5%. The facility 
matures on 1 October 2011. The undrawn facility at 31 March 2011 was Yen 44.2m. 
Other borrowings relate to a loan provided by a minority interest partner totalling £0.5m due to mature on 8 November 2011. Interest  
is charged on this loan at the Japanese short-term prime rate plus 0.5%.  
The fair value of borrowings and overdrafts approximates the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

At 31 March 2011, 77,215 of the 0.05p ordinary shares in issue are held as treasury shares (2010: 77,215). As permitted by the 
Companies Act 2006 the Company no longer has an authorised share capital having adopted new Articles of Association at the  
Annual General Meeting in 2010. 
The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum  
of 10% of its issued share capital. During the year to 31 March 2011, no ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company under  
this authority.  
The cost of own shares held by the Group has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce the profits 
available for distribution by the Company. As at 31 March 2011 the amounts offset against this reserve are £2.8m (2010: £2.0m).  
In the year to 31 March 2011 the Burberry Group plc ESOP trust has waived its entitlement to dividends of £nil (2010: £0.2m). 
During the year profits of £1.7m (2010: £nil) have been transferred to capital reserves due to statutory requirements of subsidiaries.  
The capital reserve consists of non-distributable reserves and the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares.

The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of revenue (‘revenue leases’) have been based on 
the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease. Under certain revenue leases, there are no minimums and 
therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above. As a result, the amounts charged to the Income Statement may be 
materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.  
The total of future minimum payments to be received under non-cancellable leases on investment properties and subleases on land and 
buildings is as follows:

25. Contingent liabilities 
Under the GUS Group UK tax payment arrangements, the Group was jointly and severally liable for any GUS liability attributable to the 
period of the Group’s membership of this payment scheme. The Group’s membership of this scheme was terminated with effect from 
31 March 2002.  
26. Financial risk management 
Other than derivatives, the Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, external borrowings, trade 
receivables, and trade and other payables arising directly from operations.  
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and interest rate 
risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. 
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably. This is done in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. 
Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements. The policies 
of the Group Treasury department are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Group uses derivative instruments to 
hedge certain risk exposures. 
Market risk 
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.  
The Group’s Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency 
fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange 
contracts (see note 16). The Group’s accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments is set out in note 2. 
The Group’s Treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify as ‘highly 
probable’ forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes. 
The Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for reporting 
purposes. It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose.  
At 31 March 2011, the Group has performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of non-Sterling currencies 
strengthening/weakening by 20% (2010: 20%) against Sterling with all other variables held constant. The effect of translating foreign 
currency denominated net debt, receivables, payables and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss would have 
decreased/increased post-tax profit for the year by £0.1m (2010: decreased/increased £0.8m). The effect of translating forward foreign 
exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and Sterling denominated loans held in overseas subsidiaries would have 
decreased/increased equity by £11.4m (2010: £12.5m). 
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other than the 
local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage currency 
exposure. Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and amounts to be received or paid in cash. Foreign 
exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement. 
Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities) held in currencies other than the local currency of operation:

26. Financial risk management (continued) 
Price risk 
The Group is exposed to employer’s national insurance liability due to the implementation of various employee share based  
incentive schemes. 
To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national insurance liability due to movements in the Group’s share price, the  
Group has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options and awards. The Group does not seek hedge 
accounting treatment for equity swaps. The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national insurance liability  
on an ongoing basis. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits and external borrowings. 
The external borrowings are linked to the LIBOR rate, while cash and short-term borrowings are affected by local market rates around 
the Group. The borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. To manage interest rate risk the Group 
manages its proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap derivatives. 
The Group has no outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 March 2011. During the prior year, the Group closed out an interest rate swap, 
with a notional principal of US $65m, to convert floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings, at a fixed interest rate of 3.545%.  
The interest rate risk profile of the Group’s fixed and floating rate financial liabilities by currency is as follows: 
 As at 31 March 2011 As at 31 March 2010

Sterling 0.2 – – – 
Other currencies 2.1 – 1.4 – 
Total financial liabilities 2.3 – 1.4 – 
The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2011 and 2010 exclude cash pool overdraft balances of £166.1m (2010: £205.0m).  
At 31 March 2011, if interest rates on Sterling denominated borrowings had been 200 basis points higher/lower (2010: 200 basis points) 
with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £nil (2010: £0.1m) lower/higher, as a result of 
higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings. 
The Group has no other significant floating rate foreign currency borrowings and therefore is not exposed to movements in foreign 
currency interest rates. 
Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers  
with an appropriate credit history. Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards. In addition, receivables balances are 
monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant and default rates have historically 
been very low. An ageing of overdue receivables is included in note 14. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum 
credit exposure to the Group.  
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain derivative 
instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the 
carrying value of these instruments. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution and  
only deposits funds with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of ’A’. 
The Group has deposited €1.1m (2010: €0.2m), CHF 0.3m (2010: CHF 0.3m), BRL 0.6m (2010: BRL nil), INR 0.2m (2010: INR nil)  
and TWD 10.0m (2010: TWD nil) which is held as collateral at a number of European banks.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 121
26. Financial risk management (continued) 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs and close out 
market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping 
committed credit lines available. For further details of this, see note 21.  
All short-term trade creditors, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less. The carrying value of all financial 
liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows. 
The contractual maturity profile of non-current financial liabilities is as follows:

Total financial liabilities 0.2 5.7 5.9 
Other non-current financial liabilities relate to lease liabilities, property-related accruals and the put option liability over non-controlling 
interests. The put option liability is subject to a contractual cap of £200m. 
Capital risk 
The Group manages its capital (defined as net cash plus equity excluding non-controlling interests) to ensure that entities in the Group 
are able to operate as going concerns and optimise returns to shareholders. At 31 March 2011, the Group had net cash of £297.9m 
(2010: £262.0m) and total equity excluding non-controlling interests of £713.6m (2010: £590.1m). 
Cash is used to fund the continued investment in the Group and growth of the global brand. It is also used to make routine outflows of 
capital expenditure, tax and dividends. The Group’s dividend policy sets its payout target as 40% of adjusted EPS. The Board reviews 
the Group’s dividend policy and funding requirements annually. 
The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in 
compliance throughout the financial year. 
27. Employee costs  
Staff costs, including the cost of directors, incurred during the year are as shown below. Directors’ remuneration, which is separately 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 76 to 85 and forms part of these financial statements, includes the notional 
gains arising on the exercise of share options and awards but excludes the charge in respect of these share options and awards 
recognised in the Group Income Statement.

Share options granted to directors and employees 
The share option and award schemes have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Senior Executive Restricted 
Share Plan and the Exceptional Performance Share Plan, both of which have market-based performance conditions attached, have 
been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with a discount applied to this value, based on information obtained by 
running a Monte Carlo simulation model on the scheme.  
Where applicable, equity swaps have been entered into to cover future employer’s national insurance liability (or overseas equivalent) 
that may arise in respect of these schemes. 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme  
In the financial year ended 31 March 2007, a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave) offering Burberry Group plc ordinary 
shares was introduced for employees. 
On 30 June 2010, further options were granted under this scheme with a three-year and five-year vesting period offered to employees. 
The contract commencement date of the grant was 1 September 2010. These options are exercisable for a period of up to six months 
from 1 September 2013 and 1 September 2015 for the three-year and five-year schemes respectively, with vesting dependent on 
continued employment, as well as a saving obligation over the vesting period. The exercise price for these options is calculated at a 
20% discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding the invitation date. Three day averages are calculated by taking 
middle market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from the London Stock Exchange.  
The fair value of the options granted in the year has been calculated using a risk-free rate of 1.1%, expected volatility of 46.5% and  
an expected dividend yield of 2.2%. The fair value per option for the grant was determined as £3.64. The Burberry share price at the 
contract commencement date was £8.55. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical annualised standard deviation of the market price of the shares over  
a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option.

Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan 2004 (the RSP)  
In June and November 2010, further awards of 2,439,400 and 61,555 ordinary shares respectively were made to executive directors 
and management under the RSP (2010: 5,475,895). Under the Plan, executive directors may be awarded shares, structured as nil-cost 
options, up to a maximum value of two times base salary per annum. 
Awards granted between 2004 and 2007 vest in full only if Burberry Group plc achieves at least upper quartile Total Shareholder  
Return (TSR) relative to its global peers and at least 15% per annum profit before tax (PBT) growth. A proportion of an award (12.5%) 
may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over three years. Vesting 
against each metric occurs on a straight line basis between threshold and maximum. Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 
50% vests after three years. The remaining 50% vests in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. 
Awards granted in 2009 and 2010 will vest in full only if Burberry Group plc achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global 
peers and at least 10% per annum PBT growth. A proportion of an award (12.5%) may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median  
of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 3% per annum over three years. Vesting against each metric occurs on a straight line basis 
between threshold and maximum. Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vests after three years. The remaining 50%

Burberry Restricted Share Reinvestment Plan  
On 21 July 2005, awards in respect of a total of 782,500 ordinary shares were made to senior management under the Burberry 
Restricted Share Reinvestment Plan.  
The awards vested in two stages: 50% were exercisable after three years and the remaining 50% became exercisable after four years. 
The vesting of these share awards was dependent on the employee continuing to hold the original IPO RSP shares which were awarded 
and which vested on 11 July 2005. The vesting of these share awards was also dependent on continued employment over the vesting 
period. The exercise price of these share awards was £nil. 
At 1 April 2009, 278,750 share awards were outstanding, all of which were exercised during the year ended 31 March 2010 at  
a weighted average share price of £4.94. No more share awards remain outstanding in relation to the Burberry Restricted Share

All Employee Share Plan 
Employees are offered awards of ordinary shares in the Company at a nil exercise price under an All Employee Share Plan. In June and 
July 2010, 182,280 and 84,600 ordinary shares respectively were granted under this scheme. All awards vest after three years and the 
vesting of these share awards is dependent on continued employment over the vesting period. 
The fair value of the awards was determined as £7.04 and £8.05 by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
The key factors used in determining the fair value were as follows:

The Burberry Co-Investment Plan  
Executive directors and certain senior management are able to defer receipt of all or part of their annual bonus and invest it in ordinary 
shares in the Company with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and Group performance during the year. The matching share awards 
do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves within that period. The exercise price of these share awards is £nil. 
During the year to 31 March 2011 2,283,340 shares were awarded (2010: nil). 
The 2010 awards are subject to secondary performance conditions: 25% of an award may vest if growth in PBT achieves 5% per 
annum growth over three years, 100% may vest if growth in PBT exceeds 7% per annum, with vesting occurring on a straight line basis 
between these points. None of the award shall vest if PBT growth is below 5% per annum.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan  
In 2007, awards in respect of a total of 4,210,000 ordinary shares were made to executive directors and senior management under  
the Exceptional Performance Share Plan which was introduced as a one-off long-term incentive plan.  
The awards vest in two stages: 50% are exercisable after three years and 50% are exercisable after four years. The vesting of these 
share awards is dependent on two performance conditions. The award is based 50% on relative TSR and 50% on growth in profits  
over the three and four year performance periods to 2010 and 2011. No awards vest unless Burberry’s TSR exceeds the median of the 
comparator group or growth in adjusted PBT per share exceeds 50% over the four year performance period to 2010 or 75% over the 
five year performance period to 2011. The vesting of these share awards is also dependent on continued employment over the vesting 
period. The exercise price of these share awards is £nil.

28. Business combinations 
Burberry (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd  
On 16 July 2010, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire the Burberry retail and distribution business within China from its 
master franchisee in Hong Kong, Kwok Hang Holdings Ltd. The acquisition allows the Group to further leverage its proven brand in 
China’s high growth luxury market. 
On 1 September 2010, Burberry (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd, a wholly owned Group company incorporated in the People’s Republic  
of China, took control of key store assets and inventory across 50 retail stores. Daily operations at 43 of the stores fully transferred to

Fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  29.1 
Goodwill 37.6 
Sparkle Roll Holdings Limited, a non-Group company, retains a 15% economic interest in the Burberry retail and distribution business 
within China. Recognition of this interest at acquisition date has given rise to additional goodwill of £2.5m. Put and call options exist  
over this interest stake which are exercisable after five years in the case of the call option, and ten years in the case of the put option. 
Refer to note 18 for further details of the carrying value of the put option liability. 
In total, goodwill of £40.1m arose on the acquisition of the Chinese retail and distribution business and is included within intangible 
assets. This is attributable to the acquisition of the distribution rights and the benefits expected from further expansion in this region.  
The goodwill is not tax deductible. 
The assets and liabilities arising from the acquisition are as follows:

Inventories 23.1

The acquired China retail assets generated revenue of £77m and operating profit of £28m for the Group for the period to 31 March 
2011, excluding any allocation of regional and corporate costs. 
Pro forma full year information 
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2010, it would have contributed approximately £26m of additional Group revenue and

TO THE MEMBERS OF BURBERRY GROUP PLC 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 135
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise 
the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 86, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2011; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and  
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the parent Company financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the parent Company financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:  
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or  
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or  
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2011.

Chairman  Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer   NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 137
A. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc (‘the Company’) is the parent Company of the Burberry Group. Burberry Group plc is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and its principal business is investment.  
Burberry Group is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer. Retail/Wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of 
luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions and outlets as well as Burberry franchisees and prestige department stores 
globally. Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt of royalties from Burberry’s licensees in Japan and global licensees of 
fragrances, eyewear, timepieces and European childrenswear. All of the companies, which comprise Burberry Group, are controlled by 
the Company either directly or indirectly.  
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, with the exception of 
financial instruments which are included in the financial statements at fair value, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006.  
B. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  
Share schemes 
Employees in Burberry Group (including executive directors) receive certain share incentives relating to Burberry Group plc shares. 
The cost of the share incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant.  
The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair value of the award made. The impact of performance conditions  
is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant, except for conditions linked to the price of Burberry Group plc 
shares, i.e. market conditions. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions about the 
number of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date. 
The cost of the share based incentives is recharged to the relevant entity via a capital contribution. A corresponding increase  
is recognised in equity. 
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction costs,  
are credited to share capital and share premium. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends  
are approved by the shareholders in the case of final dividends or when they are paid in respect of interim dividends. 
Investments in Group companies 
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value. 
Impairment of assets 
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount  
is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (income-generating units).  
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at  
the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
measured on an undiscounted basis.  NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2010/11 138 
B. Accounting policies (continued) 
Derivative financial instruments 
Financial instruments are reported and measured in accordance with FRS 25 and FRS 26 respectively. The Company used the 
exemption not to present FRS 25 disclosures in the notes to the entity financial statements as full equivalent disclosures are presented 
within the consolidated financial statements.  
Equity swap contracts are marked to market with gains and losses arising on these contracts recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated into Sterling at the 
exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the profit and loss account  
in the period in which they arise.  
Related party transactions 
FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ requires the disclosure of the details of material transactions and balances between the reporting 
entity and related parties. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under the terms of FRS 8 not to disclose details of 
transactions with entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries.

earned is based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents plus 0.177%. The change in maturity of amounts owed by Group companies is 
principally due to the renewal of loan agreements under extended terms.

Profit on ordinary activities, but before dividends payable, was £8.7m (2010: £146.2m). As permitted by section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum  
of 10% of its issued share capital. During the year to 31 March 2011, no ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company under  
this authority.  
The cost of own shares held by the Group has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce the profits 
available for distribution by the Company. As at 31 March 2011 the amounts offset against this reserve are £2.8m (2010: £2.0m).  
In the year to 31 March 2011 the Burberry Group plc ESOP trust has waived its entitlement to dividends of £nil (2010: £0.2m). 
The capital reserve consists of non-distributable reserves and the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares.  NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

has been proposed for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting subsequent to the balance sheet date. The final 
dividend has not been recognised as a liability at the year end and will be paid on 4 August 2011 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 8 July 2011. 
H. Financial guarantees 
Burberry Group plc, together with Burberry Limited, Burberry Treasury Limited, Burberry Asia Limited, Burberry (Wholesale) Limited (US) 
and Burberry Limited (US) make up the Guarantor Group for a £300m multi-currency revolving facility agreement which commenced  
28 March 2011 and matures 30 June 2016. Interest is charged on this facility at LIBOR plus 0.90% on drawings less than £100m, at 
LIBOR plus 1.05% on drawings between £100m and £200m, and at LIBOR plus 1.20% on drawings over £200m. 
This facility replaces the £200m three year multi-currency revolving facility in place from 16 March 2009, which was due to mature on  
30 June 2012, and the two bilateral multi-currency revolving credit facilities, totalling £60m, which were due to mature on 13 June 2011. 
The fair value of the financial guarantee as at 31 March 2011 is £nil (2010: £nil). 
A potential liability may arise in the future if one of the Group members defaults on the loan facility. Each guarantor, including  
Burberry Group plc, would be liable to cover the amounts outstanding, including principal and interest elements. 
I. Audit fees 
The Company has not been recharged audit fees of £0.1m for the current year which are borne by Burberry Limited (2010: £0.1m).  SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

ShareGift  
Shareholders with a small number of shares, the value of which 
makes them uneconomic to sell, may wish to consider donating 
their shares to charity through ShareGift, a donation scheme 
operated by The Orr Mackintosh Foundation. A ShareGift donation 
form can be obtained from Equiniti. Further information is available 
at www.sharegift.org or by telephone on 020 7930 3737.  
Share price information  
The latest Burberry Group plc share price is available on the 
Company’s website www.burberryplc.com.  
Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams)  
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company 
reports. These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who 
target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out  
to be worthless or high-risk shares in US or UK investments. 
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms. 
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: 
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person  
and organisation 
• Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before 
getting involved by visiting: 
 www.fsa.gov.uk/register/ 
• Report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 
 www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/consumerinformation 
• If the calls persist, hang up. 
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form 
at http://www.fsa.gov.uk/Pages/Doing/Regulated/Law/Alerts/ 
form.shtml 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the company endorses 
will be included in company mailings. 
More detailed information can be found on the FSA website at

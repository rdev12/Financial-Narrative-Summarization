Governance Financial Statements Other Information 01 Strategic Report Chairman’s introduction
Restoring Balfour Beatty to strength
The 2016 results demonstrate that the Build to 
Last transformation programme is delivering 
positive change and we now have a solid 
foundation for future profitable growth. 
By focusing on our selected markets, we have 
been winning new business on improved 
terms, the legacy issues which have held back 
the Group are being steadily worked through 
and we have maintained one of the strongest 
balance sheets in the sector. Importantly, for 
many shareholders, we reinstated payment of 
a dividend.
The UK and US Governments have both stated 
their commitment to significant additional 
improvements to core infrastructure; our 
clients are supportive of our transformation 
and we have a talented and dedicated 
workforce. We also have the confidence that 
our strengths are now underpinned by the 
improved governance and controls which  
have been put in place during the first phase  
of Build to Last.
Performance
Balfour Beatty has maintained its disciplined 
approach to bidding for, and winning, new 
business. This involves ensuring that work 
we take on is of the type we want to do, 
in the geographies that we have chosen to 
concentrate. In short, this is about bidding for 
long-term profitable work rather than chasing 
revenue growth.
As a result – underlying revenue for 2016 
is up 4% in absolute terms, at constant 
exchange rates (CER) there is a 3% reduction. 
Nevertheless, the year-end order book stands 
at £12.7 billion – a rise of 15% (4% at CER) over 
the course of the year. 
The year also saw the business return 
to profit after two years of heavy losses. 
Underlying profit from operations was 
£67 million (statutory profit from operations 
£15 million). Whilst the UK construction 
business made a loss for the full year, the 
division made a modest profit in the second 
half, demonstrating the positive trend required 
as we enter 2017.
Once again, our Investments portfolio 
continued to perform strongly, delivering both 
cash and profit to the Group, whilst maintaining 
the value of the asset portfolio.
The benefits of the Build to Last transformation 
programme are visible in the financial 
performance of the Group. As the benefits 
of the simplified structure, upgraded 
management and improved systems and 
controls continue to work through, I am 
confident that the performance of the Group 
will continue on this trajectory.

Markets
The strengthening of Balfour Beatty’s 
operational processes coincides with the 
governments in our core markets, the UK and 
US, laying out plans for wide-scale investment 
in improved infrastructure.
The UK Government has reaffirmed its 
commitment to HS2 and new nuclear power 
stations in addition to a general increase in 
infrastructure spending announced in the 
Autumn Statement. The Group is working 
constructively with industry bodies and the 
UK Government to identify and manage any 
direct challenges caused by the UK’s exit from 
the European Union. At this stage we have 
not seen an impact on the building market; 
however we remain vigilant to respond to any 
changes in market conditions.
In the US, the new administration has highlighted 
infrastructure repairs and improvements as one 
of its priorities, building on the US$305bn of 
spending authorised by the Fixing America’s 
Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.
In both the UK and the US, we continue to 
see growing opportunities for our Investments 
business to finance and deliver projects both in 
the private and public sectors.
The Board
It is with great sadness that I report, Graham 
Roberts, who had served on the Board since 
2009, passed away in July. Graham was a 
highly valued colleague and I would like to 
place on record my thanks to him and our 
condolences to his family.
Maureen Kempston Darkes will be retiring 
from the Board at the AGM. Maureen has 
served since July 2012 and chairs our Safety 
and Sustainability Committee and I thank her 
for her service.
We are in the middle of our Board renewal 
phase and are looking in the coming months 
to the appointment of up to three new non-
executive Directors. I consider the balance of 
the disciplines and diversity on the Board to be 
most important and believe a well-structured 
Board is essential in setting the agenda for the 
Group’s future.
Our people
As we have seen from the progress that has 
been made by Balfour Beatty during 2016, 
this is a period of immense change within the 
business. This can only be achieved due to the 
hard work and dedication of so many of our 
colleagues. As I visit sites in the UK and US, I 
am continually delighted to see the enthusiasm 
and dedication of our team as they strive 
to deliver amazing projects for our clients. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all 
of our employees for the commitment they 
have again shown this year.
Much of the work that Balfour Beatty 
undertakes is inherently dangerous. So it 
is crucial that at every level in our business 
we look to understand and mitigate the 
risks. Our objective is to reduce accidents 
to zero. Where incidents occur they are 
fully investigated and steps are taken to 
avoid repetition. We understand our safety 
responsibilities to everyone that Balfour 
Beatty comes into contact with – workers, 
subcontractors, suppliers, clients and 
members of the public. We do all we can to 
ensure that everyone is kept safe.
During the year, five people were killed whilst 
working on Balfour Beatty’s projects: one 
in each of the UK and US and three in the 
Far East. I use this letter to formally send 
condolences to their families on behalf of the 
Board. However, I recognise that words are 
inadequate to express our regret that five 
families are living with the consequences 
of bereavements. Each of these deaths is a 
reminder as to why we must never cease to 
make our industry safer.
Dividend
This year has demonstrated continued 
progress in restoring Balfour Beatty to financial 
strength. The Build to Last Phase One targets 
of £200 million cash in and £100 million 
cost out have been comfortably exceeded. 
In addition we have a growing order book. 
As a result the Board were able to reinstate 
a dividend at the half year and commit to 
a progressive dividend policy. We have 
recommended a final dividend of 1.8p, 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 2.7p. 
Conclusion
As you read this Annual Report, you will be 
able to see evidence of the positive change 
which is happening across the Group. 
Whilst there remains much to be done in order 
to get Balfour Beatty to its full potential and to 
finally put all the legacy challenges behind us, 
your company enters 2017 better positioned 
than has been the case for many years.

Transforming the business
“
The Group’s results for 
2016 demonstrate that the 
fundamental changes made 
under Build to Last are driving 
positive and sustainable 
improvements. 
Leo Quinn
Group Chief Executive
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
04 The Group’s results for 2016 demonstrate 
that the fundamental changes made 
under Build to Last are driving positive and 
sustainable improvements. Balfour Beatty 
has returned to profit, while increasing both 
the value and the quality of its order book 
through disciplined bidding. The £200 million 
cash in and £100 million cost out targets 
have been delivered – enabling the Board 
to reinstate the dividend as promised – and 
were significantly exceeded by the end of 
Phase One.
The Build to Last transformation programme 
launched at the start of 2015 addresses 
Balfour Beatty’s performance with all 
stakeholders – customers and suppliers, 
employees and subcontractors, investors and 
communities. Targets were set against four 
objectives: building a business which is Lean, 
Expert, Trusted and Safe. The first phase – a 
24-month self-help plan – has just delivered 
its goals, tackling the root causes of previous 
poor performance in order to provide a strong 
platform for future profitable growth.
In UK construction, the Group met its year-
end target, with 90% of the legacy projects 
having reached practical completion and over 
70% having reached financial completion. 
Importantly, the UK construction business 
reported an underlying profit from operations 
in the second half of the year. 
By 2014 Balfour Beatty had become overly 
complex following more than a decade of 
acquisition-led forced growth. There was 
an overall lack of leadership and strategic 
direction. Operationally, project bidding and 
delivery lacked standard processes and 
internal systems and controls were weak with 
little focus on cash management. A federated 
culture had resulted in layers of unnecessary 
cost and a tendency for elements of the 
business to compete with one another. 
Inevitably, performance had deteriorated not 
only financially but in terms of customer and 
employee satisfaction.
The decisions and actions taken under Build 
to Last were often, in themselves, simple and 
straightforward. However, taken early and 
in combination, they are now transforming 
Balfour Beatty. The introduction of new 
standardised disciplines has strengthened 
governance and transparency. The upgrade 
in leadership and the Group’s simplified 
structure, with shared back office functions, 
have enabled the business units to focus on 
their core markets while benefiting from a 
more competitive cost base. Stronger finance 
and IT systems have helped drive leaner 
management of cash and spending, and 
better project visibility. Overall, the ability to 
forecast, manage and control performance 
has been greatly enhanced and customer 
satisfaction has risen significantly. A more 
unified culture is beginning to develop, with 
increased collaboration starting to leverage 
the Group’s strengths.
Strategically, this provides the framework 
for the Group to enter its second two-year 
phase of Build to Last with confidence. 
In each business we will build carefully on 
the positive trajectory to date. The Group 
will apply appropriate criteria to invest in 
people and capabilities of our Construction 
Services and Support Services businesses 
to grow earnings, and in the assets of our 
Investments portfolio to grow overall returns. 
In this way the Group intends to drive value, 
achieving industry-standard margins by the 
end of 2018 and thereafter market-leading 
performance in its third phase of Build to Last.

Why is it important?
Customers must have confidence 
in our ability to deliver and to do 
what we say we will do. A robust 
risk framework ensures that 
challenges are mitigated and projects 
are delivered in the right way. 
Satisfied customers provide us with 
the opportunities and projects for the 
future. Trusted is measured against 
customer satisfaction.

Why is it important?
Health and safety is at the heart of 
everything we do – we must protect 
our employees, our supply chain 
partners, our customers and the 
public. Construction is an inherently 
dangerous business and without the 
highest standards of safety we don’t 
have a licence to operate. A safe and 
healthy workplace is also happier, 
more motivated and more efficient. 
Safe is measured against our 
commitment to Zero Harm.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 13 Strategic Report Balfour Beatty launched its 
Build to Last transformation 
programme in early 2015 
as a framework to drive 
continuous improvement for 
all stakeholders against four 
goals – Lean, Expert, Trusted 
and Safe – as measured 
by cash flow and profits 
from operations, employee 
engagement, customer 
satisfaction and Zero Harm. 
Our priorities
Build to Last continued
Lean
Phase One consisted of 24 months self-
help. Rapid action was taken to remove 
management layers, upgrade leadership 
and strengthen governance within a 
simplified Group structure. In Phase Two 
(2017-2018) Balfour Beatty will return to 
industry-standard margins and in Phase 
Three deliver a Group with market-leading 
strengths and performance.
During Phase One, Balfour Beatty made 
significant progress on its four goals:
 – Deliver value to customers by improving 
operational efficiency and eliminating 
waste right through the supply chain.
 – The Group metric is cash flow and 
underlying profit from operations – in 
Phase One, delivering £200 million of 
cash in and £100 million of cost out in 
the first 24 months.
Group net cash at 31 December 2016 was 
£173 million, a £10 million improvement 
on 2015.
Overall in Phase One the Group exceeded 
the £200 million cash in target: cash flow in 
2016 was £439 million better than in 2014, 
excluding the proceeds from the sale of 
Parsons Brinckerhoff. This is the result of 
the continuing focus on tight management 
of cash and working capital, improvements 
to financial systems and controls, 
employee training and aligning incentives to 
deliver better performance. 
A new Group financial consolidation 
system has been introduced and the 
process to transfer data from the ERP 
system to the consolidation system has 
been automated, building on the progress 
made in 2015. Improved weekly cash flow 
performance reconciliations are leading to 
significant improvement in the business’ 
ability to forecast cash flow, enabling more 
effective management of draw-down of 
the Company’s debt facility.
Further progress was made on the 
£60 million of annualised cost savings 
achieved in 2015. By the end of 2016, 
£123 million of annualised savings 
(compared to 2014) had been achieved, 
exceeding the £100 million target. 
The business continues to exploit 
opportunities to make further savings 
through standardisation and leaning 
out processes.
Savings have been driven by simplifying 
the business, including creating unified 
back office operations, eliminating waste, 
standardising working practices and 
moving the culture of the organisation to 
encourage and reward efficient practices. 
During 2016:
 – The US construction and infrastructure 
businesses have been brought together 
under a single leader with back office 
functions (IT, legal, finance etc.) unified 
to provide high-quality, efficient support 
(in a similar model to that deployed in the 
UK during 2015) and leadership across 
the business has been upgraded;
 – The IT service which had previously 
been delivered through a sub-optimal 
outsourcing agreement was successfully 
brought back in-house. This continues to 
deliver a more responsive and efficient 
IT operation with annualised savings of 
approximately £5 million;
 – The Site Mobilisation Hub was 
introduced for all UK contract start-ups 
in the summer. By centralising and 
standardising this process, resources can 
be efficiently redeployed from one job 
to the next. This reduces wastage, cost 
and delays caused by sites not being 
operationally ready. At the same time, 
project managers are freed up to focus 
on their project rather than site set-up. 
The Hub has engaged with 445 projects, 
of which 45 mobilisations have now 
been delivered, all on time and to budget 
or better, achieving significant savings;
 – Framework agreements have been 
developed with a shortlist of preferred 
design consultants with the express 
aims of strengthening business 
relationships and providing greater 
consistency in the way that design 
services are provided, reducing cost and 
delivering greater value to customers;
 – The US strategic procurement group 
established over 40 national agreements 
with suppliers selected on their ability to 
deliver superior products and services to 
all major US geographies, as well as offer 
highly competitive pricing; and
 – Further progress has been made in 
rationalising the property portfolio, 
bringing business units together in 
shared offices, thus aiding collaboration, 
reducing floor space requirements by 
35% and providing more productive 
working environments. Over the 
first two years of Build to Last, UK 
property costs have been cut by 
approximately 25%. 
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
14 Lean
The Group has made considerable 
progress in simplifying its portfolio with 
the disposal of non-strategic businesses, in 
order to focus on its core markets:
 – Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners, an 
independently managed infrastructure 
fund business focusing on secondary 
opportunities, was disposed of to Wafra 
Investment Advisory Group, Inc; 
 – Balfour Beatty Investments’ sole project 
in Australia was sold and Balfour Beatty 
staff and pipeline transferred to Infrared; 
 – Balfour Resource Group, a healthcare 
facilities planning consultancy that 
became part of Balfour Beatty through 
the Centex acquisition, was sold 
to management; 
 – The sale of Balfour Beatty’s share of its 
Indonesian joint venture, Balfour Beatty 
Sakti, to its joint venture partner; 
 – In early 2017, Balfour Beatty’s entire 
share of its Middle Eastern joint 
ventures, Dutco Balfour Beatty and 
BK Gulf, were sold to its joint venture 
partner; and
 – Following completion of the sole 
rail maintenance contract in Chile, 
the decision was taken to wind up 
that business.
Expert
 – Ensure that Balfour Beatty is attracting, 
retaining and motivating employees 
to enable it to offer customers the 
best engineering, design, project 
management and delivery capabilities.
 – The Group metric is average 
employee satisfaction.
Quality of leadership is the number one 
factor in driving a world-class organisation. 
During 2016, the Group built on its 
progress in 2015 by further upgrading the 
quality of senior management, particularly 
through promotion. 
In addition to the unification of the US 
businesses described in the previous 
section: in the UK, Engineering Services 
and Engineering Construction were 
brought together under the banner of 
Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick and a unified 
leadership; and a new leadership team was 
put in place in the UK Power business.
The model of centralised support functions 
(HR, IT, finance etc) as first rolled out 
in the UK continues to provide higher 
service levels to the business compared 
to the previous devolved model, whilst 
continuing to outperform with respect to 
re-engineering process and reducing cost.
During the year, further work has been 
completed to build communities of 
practice for key skills across the business. 
These communities allow the sharing of 
best practice across the Group and provide 
opportunities for career development to the 
staff involved.
 – A Group-level Project Management 
Academy has been developed, aligned 
to international standards through 
an accredited training programme, 
to provide a common approach to 
professional development and practice. 
This initiative provides clarity on the 
competence level required for each 
project manager (PM) role and provides 
an Assignment Database to match 
PM competence to contract risk and 
complexity, greatly enhancing the 
probability of a successful outcome 
for customers.
 – Building on the success of the Project 
Management Competency Assessment 
carried out across all levels of Balfour 
Beatty’s project management 
employees, work is underway to extend 
the assessment process into several 
key Alliances.
 – A new strategic approach to bidding 
and winning key business has been 
introduced to co-ordinate major 
opportunities which straddle business 
units, in order to ensure that Balfour 
Beatty has a unified and compelling 
offer. Business Acquisition Method 
training has been rolled out to 200 
employees across the UK and US 
businesses, introducing a common 
and systematic approach to winning 
business. The new training programme 
boosts estimating skills and improves 
the quality of proposals, reducing the risk 
of underbidding. 
 – A similar focus on the commercial 
expertise within the business has 
enabled better sharing of best practice 
and a forum for senior commercial 
professionals to identify training and 
development opportunities. As a result 
an extensive programme of training has 
commenced to give the Commercial 
team the skills to work more productively 
with customers on more collaborative 
forms of contract.
During 2016, Balfour Beatty made 
significant progress towards becoming 
a digitally empowered business. 
Development of staff capabilities such as 
the training of six new drone pilots, a digital 
surveying team with full laser scanning 
service, a high-end visualisation team and 
a significant increase in BIM support have 
all led to an increase in quality, a leaner 
approach and a safer working environment. 
As a result of Balfour Beatty’s investment 
in BIM, in 2016 it became one of the first 
companies to receive the British Standards 
Institute’s BIM Kitemark, an accolade only 
three other companies have achieved. 
The Group also achieved another first 
during the year by winning the V3 Digital 
Technology Leaders Award for best 
Public Sector Project in partnership with 
Southampton Council.
2016 also saw global collaboration in the 
fields of Virtual Reality and construction 
robotics, utilising skills from the UK, US 
and Hong Kong. Both technologies are 
vital to the future of Balfour Beatty as an 
industry leader.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 15 Strategic Report Trusted Expert continued
Training and retaining staff remain critical 
to the long-term success of Balfour 
Beatty and is therefore a central tenet 
of Build to Last. A new redeployment 
tool was introduced during the year 
to identify appropriate opportunities 
for staff when their current project 
concludes, keeping skilled workers in the 
business and reducing redundancy and 
recruitment costs.
Two leadership development programmes 
have been launched, with 50 delegates 
in 2016. One works with the leadership 
teams to actively improve and measure 
the culture and climate they create in their 
business. The second identifies high-
potential employees to join a 12-month 
programme to develop their management 
skills and capabilities and their transition to 
leadership roles.
Skills shortages within construction 
have been a challenge for several years. 
The UK’s decision to leave the European 
Union with the potential for reduction 
in free movement of people is likely to 
exacerbate the situation at a time when 
demand for skilled workers will increase 
given the pipeline of projects due to start in 
the coming years. 
Balfour Beatty believes that employers are 
best placed to determine and train their 
required future capabilities and therefore 
must take the lead by making a long-
term commitment to invest in the next 
generation workforce. 
For this reason, Balfour Beatty belongs 
to and is sponsoring The 5% Club, an 
employer-led organisation whose members 
commit to striving to achieve 5% of their 
UK workforce in ‘earn and learn’ positions 
within five years of joining. 
During 2016 Balfour Beatty recruited 114 
apprentices and 110 graduate trainees. 
The percentage of the workforce in ‘earn 
and learn’ positions at year end stood 
at 4.3%, a slight reduction on the 2015 
number as a result of an unusually high 
level of recruitment to these positions in 
the previous two years, where participants 
have now been appointed into mainstream 
roles. Balfour Beatty’s aspiration remains to 
reach 5% or above.
My Contribution is the mechanism which 
directly engages all staff in Build to Last by 
enabling employees to suggest and drive 
changes in the business to help deliver 
on Build to Last’s Lean, Expert, Trusted 
and Safe goals. In 2016, 3,114 ideas for 
business benefits were logged by Balfour 
Beatty employees, of which 417 were 
progressed as projects and delivered with 
financial savings of £19 million and over 
230,000 hours of time savings.
For the second year a company-wide 
employee engagement survey was 
carried out. This is the first time that 
all the necessary questions have been 
asked which allows for Balfour Beatty’s 
performance to be benchmarked against 
other businesses by Best Companies. 
Balfour Beatty’s employee engagement 
score was 626.4, which is regarded 
by Best Companies as demonstrating 
good levels of employee engagement. 
Response rate for the survey at 67% was 
up on the 2015 survey (61%). The Group 
employee satisfaction score for 2016 was 
58% (2015: 60%).
Our priorities
Build to Last continued
 – Be the construction partner of choice for 
customers and supply chain by delivering 
on promises.
 – The Group metric is customer 
satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction is achieved by doing 
what we say we will do. Balfour Beatty 
continued to win landmark contracts in all 
its selected markets with the order book up 
15% (4% at CER) at £12.7 billion.
During 2015, the 8-Gated Lifecycle was 
introduced across Balfour Beatty. In 2016, 
the framework has been further refined 
with the addition of a ‘make or buy’ 
decision step to promote greater use of 
internal capabilities. Internal reviews of the 
bidding Gates (1-4) across all UK and US 
business units demonstrate compliance 
with all new processes. As a result of the 
early qualification Gates (1-2) there has 
been a sharp reduction in the value of work 
tendered and lost. The UK win rate for 2016 
was almost double that of 2015. 
To further enhance the control and rigour 
of the Gated Lifecycle, a secure web-
based platform effectively digitises the 
governance and document control through 
all stages and gates of acquiring contracts 
and delivering projects. This Digital 
Briefcase was released at the end of 
2016 and is now installed across UK 
business units with over 500 key users 
and approvers trained and utilising the 
functionality successfully.
Within the industry there continues to be 
a strong dependence on joint ventures 
to execute major projects. A key area of 
focus going forward will be to ensure the 
Group can exercise the same degree of 
governance and control in these instances 
as it is gaining through its Build to Last 
transformation on sole projects.
The rationalisation, upgrade and 
standardisation of the ERP systems 
continues. The use of data analytics 
and automated risk scoring is now 
fully embedded in both UK Regional 
Construction and Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick 
where the majority of legacy losses have 
previously been recorded. Following a 
successful pilot in 2016 this is now being 
rolled out across buildings and civils in the 
US in conjunction with a simplification of 
their associated legacy system architecture. 
This now provides management with 
consistent and timely information in

Balfour Beatty’s strategic priority is to 
invest to attract, retain and develop 
the best employee and subcontractor 
talent.

16 Trusted Safe
 – Ensure the health and safety of everyone 
who comes into contact with Balfour 
Beatty’s activities.
 – The Group metric is Zero Harm.
Many of the activities carried out by Balfour 
Beatty can be, by their nature, potentially 
dangerous. It is therefore essential that 
the health, both physical and mental, and 
safety of employees, and those who come 
into contact with Balfour Beatty, including 
subcontractors and the general public, are 
always Balfour Beatty’s first priority.
Health and Safety takes a risk-based 
approach to identify and prioritise action 
plans, focused on communicating the 
Zero Harm vision, leadership, learning and 
sharing, clear co-ordinated governance, 
supply chain engagement, health and 
safety by design (including offsite modular 
assembly), simplifying and improving 
management systems and processes, 
training and competence, behavioural 
safety, innovation, recognition and reward, 
clear performance indicators and locally 
sponsored initiatives. Group initiatives 
are proactive and evidence-based and 
include quarterly campaigns and Group-
wide stand downs. In 2016 fatal risk 
groups were reviewed with leadership at 
managing director level and initiatives taken 
to increase skills and awareness, improve 
performance and promote employee and 
supply chain engagement. 
Each week senior management report 
and consider any accident or near misses 
that have occurred and a weekly report, 
available to all employees, shares safety 
best practice as well as reporting on 
significant incidents and learning which can 
be drawn from Balfour Beatty or elsewhere 
in the industry.
In May 2016, a Balfour Beatty company 
was sentenced in connection with its 
conviction and guilty plea to breaches of 
Section 3 of the Health & Safety at Work 
Act 1974 and related health and safety 
regulations. The HSE prosecution was 
in relation to a fatality on the Heysham 
Power Station project in Lancashire on 
14 April 2010. Balfour Beatty received a 
fine of £2.6 million. The fine was judged 
on the basis of the new sentencing 
guidelines published by the Department of 
Justice and demonstrates the increasingly 
heavy financial consequences for failures 
to meet the necessary safety and 
environmental standards. 
Safety is monitored through a combination 
of leading and lagging performance 
indicators. The Group Lost Time Incident 
Rate excluding international joint ventures 
fell to 0.22 (2015: 0.24), however, very 
regrettably there were a number of serious 
incidents which resulted in a total of five 
fatalities, one in each of the UK and US and 
three in the Far East. 
regards to project performance (Project 
on a Page) based on an increasingly 
broadening balanced scorecard of metrics. 
Looking forwards, with further planned 
improvements and development, it is 
expected that integrating multiple key 
operational data sources in 2017 will 
maximise the ability to influence project 
performance at the earliest possible stage.
A major review of the Business 
Management System (BMS) was 
undertaken in 2016 to create a single 
refreshed and improved system across 
all UK businesses. The BMS provides 
guidance and rules about how Balfour 
Beatty delivers tasks. The new system 
includes offline access and simplified 
access to information. The BMS will 
continue to be improved throughout 
the year and will define how the Group 
manages and delivers activities.
During the year 2,107 customer satisfaction 
reviews were carried out, primarily in the 
UK. The Group customer satisfaction 
average was 91% (2015: 82%). Scores in 
the UK were generally significantly higher 
than those in the US.

Construction Services made significant 
progress in 2016. The order book 
increased from £7.9 billion to £9.6 billion. 
Underlying revenue increased from 
£6.4 billion to £6.9 billion, and although 
the business still reported underlying 
losses from operations of £23 million the 
trajectory is positive.
Progress continued to be made on 
returning the business to profitability, 
with the second half seeing a £37 million 
underlying profit, after the loss of 
£60 million in the first half. Included within 
the £37 million profit in the second half, 
UK construction continued its recovery as 
it returned to a £2 million underlying profit 
from operations. 
Despite the increase in order book, the 
construction business continued to be 
more selective in the work that it bid, 
through increased bid margin thresholds, 
improved risk frameworks and better 
contract governance. Following the 
introduction of the Gated Lifecycle there 
has been a much narrower range of 
outcomes as a direct result of the tighter, 
more effective control environment. 
In addition, there has also been a shift 
towards a lower risk contract portfolio. 
Approximately 45% of the value of new  
UK regional orders won in 2016 were 
two-stage tender projects. This represented 
a material increase on 2015 with two-stage 
tenders generally replacing standard 
project contracts.
Underlying revenue increased by 7% to 
£6,852 million (2015: £6,388 million), 1% 
decrease at CER. Underlying revenues in 
the UK fell by 6% as forecast, as improved 
bidding disciplines and selectivity adopted 
in 2015 resulted in lower levels of contracts 
in previous problem areas. This was more 
than offset by an underlying revenue 
increase of 11% in the US (2% decrease 
at CER) and a 21% increase in the Far East 
(8% increase at CER).
The underlying loss was £23 million 
(2015: £229 million) as underlying profits in 
the US (£33 million) were offset by losses 
in the UK (£64 million). The losses in the 
UK, caused by historical contracts which 
are still being traded through to completion, 
are substantially lower than the prior 
year, and in the second half of 2016, UK 
construction continued its positive trajectory 
as it delivered an underlying profit from 
operations of £2 million. 
The order book increased by 22% (5% 
at CER) due to growth in both the UK 
and the US core markets. The UK order 
book increased by 11% to £2.1 billion, 
despite the more disciplined and selective 
approach to bidding. The US order book 
increased by 34% (10% at CER) due to 
strong levels of order intake, such as the 
Caltrain rail corridor electrification contract. 
The Far East order book increased by 
25% (14% at CER) with a number of 
notable awards during the year including 
the redevelopment of Somerset House, 
Hong Kong.
Across the construction portfolio there 
remain a small number of long-term and 
complex projects where the Group has 
incorporated significant judgements 
over contractual entitlements. The range 
of potential outcomes could result in 
a materially positive or negative swing 
to profitability and cash flow. In the 
UK, the majority of these contracts are 
within the Major Projects business unit. 
Outside the UK, the Group still has a 
number of significant contracts in Hong 
Kong where the range of potential 
outcomes could result in a materially 
positive or negative swing to profitability. 
Operational review
UK
£1,894m underlying revenue
^
£2.1bn order book
^
The UK construction business is organised 
into two business units consisting of:
 – Major Projects: focused on complex 
projects and ground engineering 
services in key market sectors such 
as transportation, heavy infrastructure 
and energy.
 – Regional: private and public, civil 
engineering, mechanical and electrical 
engineering and building, providing 
customers with locally delivered, 
flexible and fully integrated civil and 
building services. 
During the year, the business continued 
to simplify. Engineering Construction and 
Engineering Services (mechanical and 
electrical engineering) merged in August 
2016, with the new business rebranded 
as Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick, led by a new 
managing director and standardised on a 
single ERP system. Within Regional, the 
number of live projects continued to fall 
from around 400 at December 2015 to 
around 250 by December 2016. Over  
150 of the current live projects have been 
through the Gated Lifecycle process. 
Underlying revenue in the UK fell by 6% 
to £1,894 million (2015: £2,024 million), 
predominantly due to a decline in the 
Regional construction business. The UK 
business continued to be more selective 
in the work that it bid, through increased 
bid margin thresholds, improved 
risk frameworks and better contract 
governance. The Group qualified out nearly 
£7 billion worth of projects in 2016, whilst 
at the same time almost doubling the 
win rate.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 19 Strategic Report Despite the focus on improving the quality 
of new orders, the UK order book increased 
by 11% to £2.1 billion (2015: £1.9 billion) 
following a number of notable awards 
including: a contract to widen a 10-mile 
stretch of the existing A14; a contract to 
upgrade baggage screening and handling 
systems for Heathrow airport; the main 
construction works for The Madison Tower, 
a 53-storey residential building in Canary 
Wharf; and construction of engineering and 
training facilities at RAF Marham in Norfolk.
The underlying loss from the UK 
construction business was £64 million 
(2015: £187 million), representing an 
improvement from the prior year. The loss 
in the period was caused by three main 
factors: additional losses incurred on 
historical contracts; lower overhead 
absorption due to the lower revenue base; 
and newer projects not being progressed 
to a stage where it is appropriate to begin 
to recognise gross margin. 
There is a positive trajectory, with the 
£64 million underlying loss from operations 
in 2016 split between a £66 million loss in 
the first half and a £2 million profit in the 
second half of the year. 
The business is continuing to manage 
historical problem contracts through to 
completion. At the 2015 half year 89 
historical contracts were identified that had 
a material negative impact on profitability 
and cash. As at the end of December 2016, 
and in line with previous guidance given, 
90% of these projects were at practical 
completion (60% at end December 2015) 
with over 70% at financial completion. 
Four of the remaining nine contracts are 
expected to reach practical completion in 
2017, with the remainder in 2018. 
The Group is working constructively with 
industry bodies and the UK Government to 
identify and manage any direct challenges 
caused by the UK’s exit from the European 
Union. At this stage Balfour Beatty 
has not seen an impact on the building 
market; however the Group remains 
vigilant to respond to any changes in 
market conditions.
In 2016, the Major Projects business 
successfully completed the complex 
engineering transformation of the former 
London Olympic stadium, to allow West 
Ham United FC to start using the multi-
purpose venue in time for the new football 
season. Work was also completed on 
the upgrade to Junction 30 of the M25 
in Essex. 
On Crossrail, Balfour Beatty’s three 
major projects: C510 (Liverpool Street 
and Whitechapel Station tunnels); 
C512 (Whitechapel Station); and C530 
(Woolwich Station) all made significant 
progress during the year. At the Thames 
Tideway Tunnel work has commenced on 
the 6-kilometre ‘West’ section which runs 
from Acton to Wandsworth. In Highways, 
material ongoing work includes the 
conversion of the M3 Motorway  
(J2–J4) into a Smart Motorway and the 
construction of dual carriageways for the 
A21 between Tonbridge and Pembury, the 
Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and 
the Norwich Northern Distributor Road. 
Notable new contract awards in the 
period include a £146 million construction 
package to widen a critical and complex 
10-mile stretch of the existing A14 and a 
contract to build an energy from waste 
facility for Gloucestershire County Council. 
Included within awarded but not contracted 
(ABNC), the Highways business has been 
selected to deliver a Smart Motorway 
package to upgrade sections of the M6 and 
M4 (J3–J12). Additionally, a contract from 
Highways England for the construction of 
a proposed lorry area near the M20, worth 
up to £130 million, has been awarded but is 
currently under consultation.

Balfour Beatty is 
working in a three-way 
joint venture on the 
£416 million West 
section of the Thames 
Tideway Tunnel project. 
Two new tug boats are 
being used to haul barges 
up and down the Thames 
carrying materials to

of spoil from the tunnel 
excavation. 
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
20 The Major Projects business continues to 
pursue a number of major infrastructure 
opportunities across core transportation 
and energy markets. Over the next 
few years High Speed 2 (HS2) rail, new 
nuclear power stations at Hinkley Point C 
and Wylfa and the third runway at 
Heathrow airport will all contribute to the 
Government’s investment in infrastructure 
target, which is forecast to rise to over 1% 
of GDP by 2020-21.
The proposed HS2 rail route will connect 
London, Birmingham, Leeds and 
Manchester with total estimated costs 
of over £50 billion. Balfour Beatty and 
VINCI are in a joint venture pursuing work 
on HS2, utilising the expertise acquired 
by both companies on High Speed 1, 
VINCI’s involvement on the €8 billion 
Tours-Bordeaux high-speed rail project 
in France, and Balfour Beatty’s extensive 
work on transport networks across the 
UK and overseas. Balfour Beatty VINCI 
were unsuccessful in tendering for the 
enabling works packages during the year, 
but the joint venture has recently tendered 
for four major civil engineering works 
packages (two in the Central section, two 
in the North section), with contract awards 
expected in 2017. In addition, the highways 
market continues to provide good growth 
opportunities following the Government’s 
commitment of £15 billion to Highways 
England in order to deliver the first Roads 
Investment Strategy.
The Regional business is organised into 
four regions and Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick, 
following the merger of Engineering 
Construction and Engineering Services in 
August 2016.
 – Regional Construction: four regions 
(Scotland, North & Midlands, South and 
London) providing public and private 
customers with locally delivered, 
flexible and fully integrated civil and 
building services. 
 – Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick: heavy 
mechanical and electrical (M&E) 
installations and building services.
As a result of the focus on bidding for 
contracts with increased margins and 
more favourable contract terms, the 
Regional business is now focused on 
fewer, larger contracts and continues to 
reduce its exposure to contracts under 
£5 million. This allows the business to 
focus on projects with better pricing and 
risk dynamics, but also improves the span 
of control as it operates fewer sites. As a 
result, the total number of live jobs in the 
Regional business has reduced from over 
400 at December 2015 to approximately 
250 at December 2016. Over 150 of the 
current live projects have been through the 
Gated Lifecycle process. 
In 2016, the Regional business successfully 
completed the A1 improvement scheme 
where lane capacity was increased from 
two lanes to three lanes in each direction 
from the Metro Centre to Coal House 
junction. Other key milestones included the 
completion of the Kent bound platform at 
the new Abbey Wood Crossrail station and 
the North Ayrshire community hospital. 
Material ongoing projects include the 
Kennedy Street student accommodation 
project in Glasgow, Clyde and Pen y 
Cymoedd windfarms, Redwood luxury 
retirement village for Audley and the 
renovation and new build scheme at No. 
1 Palace Street in St James’, London.
The Regional business had a number of 
landmark successes in 2016. Notable new 
contract awards in the period included: 
 – £170 million contract to upgrade 
baggage screening and handling 
systems for Heathrow airport; 
 – £150 million contract to deliver the main 
construction works of The Madison 
Tower, a 53-storey residential building in 
Canary Wharf, London;
Madison Tower, 
London, UK
Balfour Beatty has 
been awarded a 
£150 million contract by 
LBS Properties to deliver 
the main construction 
works of The Madison 
Tower in Canary Wharf, 
London. Following 
its initial £1 million 
pre-construction services 
agreement in 2016, 
the main construction 
contract will see Balfour 
Beatty deliver this 
53-storey landmark 
tower to include 423 
residential apartments, 
residents’ lounge and 
business facilities.

Caltrain, US
Balfour Beatty was 
awarded a $697 million 
contract to undertake 
electrification of the  
52-mile Caltrain rail 
corridor between San 
Francisco and San Jose, 
laying the foundations 
for the future operation 
of high speed trains. 
This is the largest contract 
secured by Balfour Beatty 
in the US.
 – £82 million contract to build engineering 
and training facilities at RAF Marham in 
Norfolk, in readiness for the arrival of the 
UK’s first F-35 Lightning aircraft in 2018;
 – £47 million contract to deliver a 1,350 
pupil academy on behalf of Hub North 
Scotland and Aberdeen City Council; and
 – Having previously delivered 2,520 units 
across five Central London student 
accommodation schemes, the latest 
contract with Urbanest is a £42 million 
development in Vauxhall, London. 
Following its reorganisation, Balfour Beatty 
Kilpatrick has been awarded a contract in 
excess of £20 million for the mechanical 
and electrical services for a pharmaceutical 
research and innovation facility being built 
in Hull. The Government’s approval for 
Hinkley Point C formalised the selection 
of a 50:50 joint venture between Balfour 
Beatty and NG Bailey for the £460 million 
power station electrical package. The work 
will deliver the critical infrastructure to 
power the station, including cabling totalling 
over 3,000 kilometres in length, fire and 
environmental sealing and specialist 
packages associated with data acquisition 
and plant control. 
The Regional business also continues to 
secure a number of significant projects 
operated by Scape Group, which is open 
to all public sector bodies in the UK and 
covers projects ranging from road repairs, 
new bridges and coastal defence works 
to light rail schemes and major road 
projects. In 2016, the Group was awarded 
a £35 million contract to deliver the first 
phase of the Perth Transport futures 
project and a £14 million contract to deliver 
the second phase of the Almond Bank 
flood defence scheme. 
Included within ‘awarded but not 
contracted’, Balfour Beatty has been 
selected as construction partner on 
Manchester University’s flagship project, 
the £350 million Engineering Campus 
development and has also been awarded 
the Eastwick and Sweetwater residential 
development project.
The Regional business continues to pursue 
a number of opportunities across its core 
defence, education, health, residential-led 
neighbourhoods, student accommodation 
and transportation markets. 
US
£3,427m underlying revenue
^
£5.5bn order book
^
Underlying revenues in the US grew by 
11% in the period (2% decline at CER) and 
the order book increased by 34% (10% 
increase at CER). The business reported 
an underlying profit from operations for the 
year of £33 million (2015: £22 million loss), 
as the US returned to profitability following 
a number of write-downs in the prior year. 
The underlying operating profit margin at 
1.0% is at the low end of the Group’s Build 
to Last Phase Two target of 1%-2% for 
US construction, as the effects of legacy 
contracts trade out, but the trajectory 
is positive and market conditions are 
considered favourable. 
The US business continued to drive 
operational focus and business 
simplification. The general building 
business and the infrastructure business 
have now been united under a single 
leader, which further develops and 
complements the move to a leaner 
organisational structure. The business has 
been refocused on certain geographies, 
known as ‘The Southern Smile’. This starts 
in the Pacific North West, runs through 
California, Texas, Florida and up through 
Georgia and the Carolinas to Washington 
DC. In the US approximately 85% of 
revenues are generated from the general 
building market, with the infrastructure 
market (rail, road and water) accounting for 
the remaining 15%. 
In the building business, underlying 
revenues were up 12% (stable at CER). 
The order book increased by 30% (5% at 
CER), as the business continued to see 
strong order intake, notwithstanding the 
improved bidding disciplines. The business 
remains focused on working with repeat 
customers, in known geographies where 
it can deliver value. It has therefore 
intentionally withdrawn from bidding on 
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
22 most stick frame multi-family housing, 
in order to switch to better quality revenues 
in core markets such as office, education, 
hospitality, residential and healthcare. 
Notable awards in the period included a 
US$276 million contract for a 42-storey 
mixed-use residential project in downtown 
San Francisco; a US$199 million contract 
for a mixed-used development in Dallas, 
comprising a 20-storey office tower 
and a second 34-storey tower with 253 
residential units; a US$196 million contract 
in Washington for the construction of two 
12-storey office towers to be built on top 
of an existing platform; a US$126 million 
contract for Ohlone College, in California, 
for the development of three new 
multi-storey academic core buildings 
that will house classrooms, laboratories, 
offices, conference rooms and a library; a 
US$110 million contract to construct four 
new elementary schools and renovate 
a fifth school for the Highland Park 
Independent School District in Texas; a 
US$99 million contract for the BPM Real 
Estate Group in downtown Portland to 
construct a 19-storey office and hotel 
development; and a US$84 million contract 
to build a luxury mixed-use residential 
tower in midtown Atlanta. 
In the infrastructure business, underlying 
revenues were up 4% (8% down at 
CER). The order book increased 38% 
(12% up at CER) following the notable 
award of a US$697 million contract for 
the electrification of the 52-mile Caltrain 
rail corridor between San Francisco and 
San Jose, laying the foundations for 
the operation of high-speed trains from 
2020. This award leverages expertise 
demonstrated in constructing the extension 
of Regional Transport District’s light-rail line 
across Denver’s south-east suburbs, which 
was successfully opened in April 2016.
The infrastructure business continues to 
pursue design-build and alternative delivery 
projects in its key rail, highway and water 
markets to reflect ongoing changes in 
procurement trends in the marketplace. 
Even before the election of the new 
President, there was a strong market 
outlook for construction in the US. 
In December 2015, the FAST Act (Fixing 
America’s Surface Transportation), a 
US$305 billion transportation bill was 
signed, providing guaranteed funding for 
a five-year period. This bill permits longer 
term project planning horizons in the 
public market and is leading to improved 
visibility for public funded projects that had 
been slow to come to market. There are 
further opportunities being created with 
the number of state backed infrastructure 
bonds (US$30 billion of education 
bonds in California, US$190 billion 
multi-state transportation bonds), and 
potentially an increase in US private public 
partnership schemes. 
Rail
£249m underlying revenue
^
£0.2bn order book
^
Underlying revenue in the rail business 
fell by £25 million to £249 million 
(2015: £274 million). Underlying losses in 
the year were £1 million (2015: £5 million) 
as the business continued to be impacted 
by poor contract performance on a small 
number of historical rail projects. The order 
book was stable at £0.2 billion. Given the 
materiality of the segment, future reports 
will include Rail within UK construction. 
International
£1,282m underlying revenue
^
£1.8bn order book
^
Underlying revenue in the Group’s Hong 
Kong and Singapore joint venture, Gammon 
Construction, increased by 21% (8% at 
CER), due to growth in major building 
projects including the construction of seven 
towers at the TW5 Cityside residential 
property development, 33 Tong Yin Street 
(residential towers and retail areas) and the 
conversion of the ex-government Murray 
building into a hotel.
Underlying profit from operations 
in the region reduced to £11 million 
(2015: £19 million) as new contracts are yet 
to meet the required revenue recognition 
milestones. In Hong Kong there are a 
number of significant contracts where the 
range of potential outcomes could result 
in a materially positive or negative swing 
to profitability.
The order book grew by 25% (14% at 
CER), following the award of a number 
of notable major building projects: a 
HK$4 billion contract for the redevelopment 
of Somerset House into a 48-storey 
office building; a HK$2.6 billion contract 
for a residential development project for 
12 residential towers and five four-storey 
houses, which together will provide 
857 new homes; and a HK$1.6 billion 
contract for the construction of the Lee 
Garden Three Project, which will include 
20 floors of office space atop a five-level 
retail podium. 
In the Middle East, underlying 
revenue increased to £315 million 
(2015: £197 million). However, the business 
continued to make underlying losses, 
£2 million in the year (2015: £34 million), 
reflecting the challenging nature of the 
region. In early 2017, Balfour Beatty sold 
the Group’s entire share in Dutco Balfour 
Beatty and BK Gulf, for a total cash 
consideration of £11 million, to its joint 
venture partner. As part of the transaction, 
the local partner assumed responsibility 
for Balfour Beatty’s guarantees of bonding 
obligations in the joint ventures. 
Since the start of 2015, Balfour Beatty 
has exited the Middle East, Indonesia and 
Australia in order to focus on its chosen 
markets, in the UK, US and Far East.

The Support Services segment comprises 
utilities and transportation businesses. 
Utilities operates across power transmission 
and distribution and the gas and water 
sectors. Transportation operates across rail, 
highways and managed road schemes for 
local authorities.
Underlying revenue for the division 
reduced by 12% to £1,103 million 
(2015: £1,259 million), due to the phasing 
of contract and regulatory cycles. However, 
underlying profit from operations increased 
to £34 million (2015: £24 million), as the 
3.1% (2015: 1.9%) underlying profit from 
operations margin in 2016 returned Support 
Services to the bottom end of the Build to 
Last Phase Two industry‑ standard margin 
target of 3%‑ 5%.
Track partnership
The Rail business was awarded a £170 million two‑ year extension to its 
Track Partnership contract with London Underground, to deliver essential 
track renewal work across the London Underground network.
The order book was stable at £3.1 billion 
(2015: £3.1 billion) as growth in transportation 
was largely offset by a decline in utilities. 
Operational review
Underlying utilities revenue reduced by 6% 
to £590 million, with power transmission 
and distribution down 10% and gas and 
water down 3%. The utilities order book 
reduced by 10%, with power transmission 
and distribution down 13% and gas and 
water down 9%. 
Volumes in power transmission and 
distribution saw a decline in cabling and 
distribution network operator works, with 
2015 also having significant one‑ off repair 
works in offshore transmission.
The power business has undertaken a 
significant restructure and cost removal 
during 2016, including the internal 
appointment of a new managing director, 
along with several other senior changes. 
The business has also focused on qualifying 
out low‑ value works and areas which do not 
align to its risk profile, including significantly 
reducing its reliance on volume‑ based and 
second‑ tier subcontracting projects.
In March 2016, power transmission and 
distribution was awarded contracts worth 
£35 million by Scottish Hydro Electric for the 
design and construction of the Bhlaraidh and 
Beinnuen wind farms connections project 
near Fort Augustus, in Scotland. Most of 
the project was successfully delivered 
during 2016.
In November 2016, the power business was 
awarded a £120 million contract by ElecLink 
Ltd to install two 50‑ kilometre electricity 
cables between France and Great Britain 
through the Channel Tunnel. This will be the 
first ever installation of a High Voltage Direct 
Current (HVDC) interconnector in a live rail 
tunnel environment.

The slight reduction in gas and water 
underlying revenue was caused by the dip 
in the UK water regulatory cycle between 
the completion of Asset Management 
Period 2010‑ 2015 (AMP5) and new 
contracts continuing to mature under 
AMP6 (2015‑ 2020). The reduction in the 
order book was as expected, given the 
progress of the AMP6 delivery cycle. 
Many water contracts are extended over 
multiple AMP periods and the Group has 
already started to engage on the AMP7 
planning cycle. 
In 2016, gas and water secured an 
extension, through to 2020, to the gas 
transmission and distribution contract 
worth £130 million for Bord Gais, in 
Ireland, and also won a £38 million water 
treatment scheme for South West Water. 
The delivery of key and complex schemes 
remains on track. Gas and water expect a 
peak volume year in 2017, as it represents 
the middle of the current AMP6 cycle.
Underlying transportation revenues 
reduced by 18% to £513 million, due 
to expected volume declines from rail 
and highways. Underlying rail revenues 
were lower following the completion of 
a rail grinding contract in the prior year. 
Underlying highways revenues declined 
due to lower capital spend on a number 
of contracts for Highways England and 
completion of the contract for Area 4 during 
the period. 
The transportation order book grew by 
14%, due to strong order intake in rail and 
from local authorities. The rail business 
was awarded a £170 million two‑ year 
extension to its Track Partnership contract 
with London Underground, to deliver 
essential track renewal work across the 
network. In local authorities Balfour Beatty 
was awarded a £245 million seven‑ year 
highways maintenance contract for 
Coventry City Council, Solihull Metropolitan 
Borough Council and Warwickshire 
County Council. This unique collaborative 
arrangement will deliver better value for 
money, improved service resilience and 
flexibility in services. Additionally the 
Group was awarded a £55 million two‑ year 
extension by West Sussex County Council 
to continue its highways maintenance 
and improvement scheme works and 
Connect Roads signed a £36 million, 
10‑ year extension to its Balfour Beatty 
Major Projects Highway Services contract 
to deliver the essential maintenance 
works on the A50. The contract covers a 
56‑ kilometre section of the A50 between 
Stoke and Derby which acts as a strategic 
east to west link between the M1 and M6. 
In September, the Group acquired 
Omnicom Engineering Ltd. Omnicom

technology business by bringing remote 
surveying hardware and software to 
enhance the Group’s Digital Rail strategy.

Financial review
The Investments business delivered 
another strong performance, having 
continued its strategy of optimising value 
through the disposal of mature assets, 
whilst also continuing to invest in new 
opportunities and expanding the breadth 
of assets. 
During the year Investments made 
significant progress in simplifying its 
operations by exiting Balfour Beatty 
Infrastructure Partners (BBIP), an 
infrastructure fund run at arm’s length and 
focused on secondary opportunities, and 
exiting from the Australian market. In total 
16 assets were either sold or part sold in 
the period, with all transactions either at, or 
above, the Directors’ valuation.
Underlying profit from operations at 
£89 million (2015: £132 million) was 
lower than the prior year, predominantly 
due to a reduction in profit on disposals 
as a different mix of assets was sold. 
Despite an increase in proceeds to 
£189 million (2015: £145 million) the 
reduction in profit on disposals reflected 
the accounting profile of the assets 
sold in 2016. Pre-disposals underlying 
operating profit decreased to £24 million 
(2015: £37 million) due to lost income from 
previous disposals. Net interest income 
remained broadly consistent year on year 
at £26 million (2015: £29 million). The lower 
underlying profit from operations resulted 
in a lower profit before tax at £115 million 
(2015: £161 million).

The Investments business continued 
to grow with four wins on new projects 
where equity will be invested, comprising: 
three private rental housing projects and 
one data centre project. In addition, the 
Investments business was appointed as 
third-party manager on two fee-based 
projects located in Pennsylvania and 
Florida. In these fee-based projects no 
equity will be invested.
In the private rented and regeneration 
sector, the North American business 
continues to expand and successfully 
acquired a stake in two private rental 
housing projects in Mobile, Alabama and 
Atlanta, Georgia. The Mobile portfolio 
consists of three properties totalling 320 
units and the Atlanta property consists of 
437 units. Balfour Beatty Communities 
will perform property management 
services for the properties, leveraging its 
existing capabilities. In the UK the business 
acquired its first private development site 
at Manchester New Cross. This project will 
provide a number of units to the private 
rented housing sector and construction 
is expected to begin following financial 
close in 2017. The Investments business 
also won a data centre project in Ontario, 
Canada. The project is located on the 
Canadian Forces Base in Borden, Ontario 
and covers the design and construction, 
financing and maintenance for a new 
10,000m

 data centre. 
Financial close was reached on seven 
projects: a primary care centres project in 
Ireland; a student accommodation project 
in Glasgow; an offshore transmission 
project in the North Sea; an energy from 
waste facility in Gloucestershire; the two 
US private rental housing projects; and the 
data centre in Canada. Five projects have 
not yet reached financial close.
The Investments business continued to 
make substantial equity investments in 
the portfolio, with £65 million invested in 
the period (2015: £102 million), of which 
£8 million was invested in the BBIP

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 29 Strategic Report Directors’ valuation of the Investments portfolio
Overview
The Directors’ valuation was 
broadly maintained at £1,220 million 
(2015: £1,244 million) despite material 
disposals in the period, as the number of 
projects in the portfolio decreased from 
73 to 69. Two of these projects, Houston 
Baptist University in Texas and West 
Florida University, were won in previous 
years and have now been included in the 
project count at December 2015. 
The Group continued to make substantial 
investments, with £65 million invested in 
new and existing projects. This reflected 
continued success in targeted sectors with 
four new projects included in the Directors’ 
valuation for the first time.
The business continued its strategy of 
realising value through recycling equity 
from mature, operationally proven assets, 
whilst preserving interests in strategic 
projects that offer opportunities to the 
wider Group. 16 investments were sold 
or part sold during the year, including the 
Group’s interest in the fund managed by 
Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners 
(BBIP). In total these sales generated 
£189 million in proceeds. All sales 
were transacted either at, or above, the 
Directors’ valuation. Cash yield from 
distributions amounted to £64 million 
(2015: £82 million). The portfolio again 
generated cash flow to the Group net 
of investment.
The methodology used for the Directors’ 
valuation is unchanged, producing a 
valuation that more closely reflects market 
value and which therefore changes with 
movements in the market. Cash flows 
for each project are forecast based on 
historical and present performance, future 
risks and macroeconomic forecasts 
and which factor in current market 
assumptions. These cash flows are then 
discounted using different discount rates 
based on the risk and maturity of individual 
projects and reflecting secondary market 
transaction experience. As in previous 
years, the Directors’ valuation may 
differ significantly from the accounting 
book value of investments shown in the 
financial statements, which are produced 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards rather than using a 
discounted cash flow approach.

Valuation – The portfolio value at a range of discount rates
UK portfolio
■ December 2016     ■ December 2015
UK portfolio
In 2016 £57 million of equity investment 
was made in projects across the portfolio: 
in the student accommodation project at 
Aberystwyth University; the Ayrshire & 
Arran community hospital; the regeneration 
development at Eastwick & Sweetwater; 
and waste projects at Gloucester and 
Welland. One new project, a property 
development at New Cross in Manchester, 
has been added to the UK portfolio.
Demand for high-quality infrastructure 
investments in the secondary market 
remained strong and the Group took 
advantage of this through further sales of 
mature assets. Investor appetite for yield in 
the ongoing, low interest rate environment 
continues unabated and pricing in the 
secondary market is therefore expected to 
remain strong for the foreseeable future. 
Interests in 16 assets were sold in the 
period, seven of which were partial sales, 
generating total proceeds of £189 million. 
The business sold its entire 50% interest 
in the Wollongong project in Australia, a 
30% interest in the M1/A1 project (where 
the Group retains a 20% interest), a 40% 
interest in the Humber Gateway OFTO 
(where the Group retains a 20% interest), 
its entire interest in the BSF portfolio 
comprised of seven schools projects and 
an 80% interest in five street lighting 
projects (where the Group retains a 20% 
interest). The Group’s interest in Balfour 
Beatty Infrastructure Partners (BBIP), 
which was included in the Directors’ 
valuation but not as a line item in the 
project total, was sold during the year. 
All disposals were either at, or above, the 
Directors’ valuation.
Operational performance movements 
resulted in a £27 million reduction in value. 
The most significant components of 
this were lower inflation, lower forecast 
deposit interest rates, and an increase 
in the assumed tax burden for potential 
purchasers. The operational movement 
reflects lower inflation in 2016 followed 
by a step-up in 2017 before reaching a 3% 
long-term assumption in 2018. The change 
to interest rates incorporates a lowering of 
the long-term rate to 2% as a consequence 
of the Bank of England’s 0.25% reduction 
in base rates in the second half of 2016. 
In line with government announcements in 
the year the corporation tax rate has been 
further reduced from a long-term rate of 
18% to 17% from April 2020. 
Discount rates applied to the UK portfolio 
range between 7% and 14% depending 
on project risk and maturity. The implied 
weighted average discount rate for the UK 
portfolio is 8.3% (2015: 8.3%). The impact 
of selling mature assets has been offset 
by a number of investments moving from 
construction to operations phase. A 1% 
change in discount rate would change the 
value of the UK portfolio by approximately 
£80 million.
Consistent with other infrastructure 
funds, Balfour Beatty’s experience is that 
there is limited correlation between the 
discount rates used to value PPP (and 
similar infrastructure investments) and 
long-term interest rates. In the event that 
interest rates increased in response to 
rising inflation, the impact of any increase 
in discount rates would be mitigated by the 
positive correlation between the value of 
the UK portfolio and changes in inflation.
Following on from the OECD BEPS 
project’s recommendations on the tax 
deductibility of interest expense in 2015, 
HM Treasury and HM Revenue and 
Customs issued their consultation on policy 
design and implementation in May 2016 
and published detailed draft legislation in 
early 2017. The draft legislation preserves 
the concept of the public infrastructure 
exemption put forward by the OECD and 
also includes other helpful measures to 
protect such projects. The proposals and 
their application are complex and remain 
subject to further review, but the initial 
assessment is that the impact on the 
Directors’ valuation will not be material. 
Balfour Beatty will remain engaged with 
the UK Government to clarify and evaluate 
the impact of the draft legislation.

Atlanta in Georgia and a PPP data centre 
in Borden, Canada. In addition, a second 
phase of the project at University of Texas, 
Dallas has been included in the Directors’ 
valuation.
Operational performance movements 
resulted in an £88 million increase in the 
value of the portfolio, of which £85 million 
was due to the fall in the value of sterling. 
Discount rates applied to the North 
American portfolio range between 7.5% 
and 10%. The implied weighted average 
discount rate is 8.2% (2015: 8.2%) and a 
1% change in the discount would change

32 Creative solutions  
driven by innovation
Building a sustainable business
Innovation, research and 
development
Innovation plays an important role in 
creating additional value for Balfour 
Beatty’s customers and ultimately the 
Group. Innovation is driven by Balfour 
Beatty people, working in collaboration 
with customers, joint ventures and the 
supply chain, and internally across the 
business. The examples below illustrate 
how the Group has used creative solutions 
on its projects and services, to deliver 
savings and benefits to customers.
My Contribution – ideas from 
our people
As a specific stream of the Build to 
Last programme the Group-wide My 
Contribution initiative was launched in 
H2 2015 and is now embedded in the 
business. My Contribution encourages 
staff to share ideas and solutions. 
Integration of the EZiCat cable avoidance 
tool was initiated through My Contribution 
to avoid service strikes. Improved safety 
and savings of £250,000 resulted in 
our Area 10 contract being awarded 
the Chartered Institution of Highways 
& Transportation NW 2016 Safety 
Project of the Year and it is now used by 
other contractors. 
Digital Balfour Beatty
The Group is integrating and combining 
digital technologies to create a Digital 
Balfour Beatty which results in better 
project outcomes throughout the 
project lifecycle.
Applications have been developed both 
in-house and with small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) which work in 
other sectors: 
 – A mobile application that allows safety 
observations to be made on site using 
any mobile device. This also allows the 
recording and disseminating of best 
practice and areas of improvement. 
It is accessible on all mobile platforms 
and is being adopted across the 
whole business. 
 – Current roll-out of an application that 
captures all utility service mapping from 
all the different providers at the touch of 
a button.
The Group is improving the capture, 
storage, accessibility and distribution 
of information, at bid stage, throughout 
project delivery and into the asset 
lifecycle. Expert knowledge of information 
sharing and database configuration is 
a differentiator, as evidenced by the 
adoption of Balfour Beatty information 
management systems on the wider A14 
Cambridge to Huntingdon programme. 
The vision and drive to introduce various 
mobile information sharing applications 
and contract administration software adds 
value to the business.
Collaboration has been improved by 
harnessing technology. Initiated and co-
ordinated by the US business, colleagues 
across the globe collaborated together 
during a 24-hour Virtual Reality (VR) 
‘storm’ – a rapid collaborative sharing 
session. A dozen work teams across 
multiple time zones and continents – 
including the Group’s businesses in Asia, 
Europe and North America – advanced 
their understanding of VR capabilities and 
shared their experiences with each other. 
The storm started early morning in Hong 
Kong, engaged India, then transferred to 
teammates in the UK at mid-day and ended 
in the US late in the day. In a 24-hour cycle 
it made Balfour Beatty’s large company 
feel small – the ‘perfect storm’.
People capability 
Balfour Beatty has led the delivery of 
over £2 million of Innovate UK research 
grants, delivering cutting edge technology 
that builds a competitive advantage and 
potential step change in productivity in 
design and construction. Balfour Beatty 
worked in partnership with University 
College London spin-off start-up, 3D 
Repo, to develop an open-source platform 
for managing and optimising design 
during tenders. Innovate UK feedback 
was: “Balfour Beatty delivered an 
exemplary project – a leading example 
of how large organisations collaborate 
with small enterprises to deliver cutting 
edge innovation.” 
The Group is in the final phase of delivering 
an Innovate UK project that uses machine 
learning to provide insight on the root 
causes of waste in construction and 
provides a technical solution to reducing 
waste proactively in the design phase. 
A value-led business that 
operates safely and ethically. 
Balfour Beatty acts responsibly 
to protect and enhance the 
physical and social environment 
in which it operates.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 33 Strategic Report The Balfour Beatty UK Build to Last Expert 
individual winner in 2016 led the production 
of a 3D model at an early stage of the 
Aberdeen Airport Terminal Transformation 
Phase 1 project which resulted in the award 
of the £10 million Phase 1 contract, and 
negotiations are in progress for Phase 2.
The Balfour Beatty India design team has 
grown to a 55-strong technical team of 
experts. Specific specialisations include 
the production of detailed 4D visualisations 
for many different areas of the business 
worldwide to maintain programmes, 
delivery and customer satisfaction and 
engage the whole team.
Innovation
Balfour Beatty harnesses innovation that 
delivers value and efficiencies, improves 
safety, develops engineering capability and 
increases the pace of delivery. The Group 
is involved with a large number of industry 
bodies sharing knowledge and learning 
within the industry. 
Direct involvement with industry groups 
such as i3P (Infrastructure Industry 
Innovation Platform) and Crossrail’s 
Innovate18 provide a platform for Balfour 
Beatty to influence the industry and share 
knowledge with peers. 
In Hong Kong, Gammon became the 
first company to bring Exoskeleton 
technology to the Hong Kong construction 
market. Improving operative endurance 
and reducing the likelihood of injuries, 
this technology is helping to address the 
challenges of an ageing workforce and 
redefine the limits of operative capability.
On Highway projects laser scanning, 
mobile ground penetrating radar, and 
4D visualisations have been used. In the 
Highways Services sector the Group has 
developed the use of drones for bridge 
inspections and is focusing on ways to use 
them for ecological inspections. 
Balfour Beatty has developed its own in-
house laser scanning teams and capabilities 
to service the whole of the UK business. 
These teams deliver true ‘as-is’ models of 
existing infrastructure to inform the design, 
and then create the true ‘as-built’ to inform 
the asset management on completion of 
a project, integrating laser scanning with 
Building Information Modelling (BIM).

Regular online forums across the Group’s 
business allow developments to be shared. 
Modular construction is being taken from 
one sector to another. Using the knowledge 
gained from delivering mechanical and 
electrical installations in the buildings 
sector, Balfour Beatty has developed, 
patented and fabricated modular subsurface 
roadside infrastructure pods in-house, 
and is now trialling them to speed up 
installation of technology on the UK SMART 
motorways programme.
Using 4D visualisations, a Balfour Beatty 
Manual has been created for construction: 
a full 4D visualisation of critical and repeat 
activities which has enhanced peer reviews 
of critical activities and enabled simple and 
clear communication across all stakeholders.
In Power Transmission and Distribution 
a new skycradle system has been 
developed to support cables on overhead 
powerlines when they are being replaced. 
This eliminates working at height and is a 
first in the industry.
Value engineering
We have developed a value engineering 
management system (VE) which outlines 
how we will meet the savings mandated 
by the UK Government for centrally 
procured projects.
On the Norwich Northern Distributor 
Road, we achieved nearly a 20% saving 
through our VE process. The business ran 
VE workshops jointly with the client and 
designers, and generated over 100 ideas 
which were scored against the criteria of 
viability, cost saving and schedule creating 
a shortlist of more than 20 ideas that 
were implemented.

Balfour Beatty continues its collaboration 
with world-leading research 
establishments, including Bristol University 
(systems engineering), Liverpool John 
Moores University (condition monitoring), 
Sheffield University (smart buildings), 
University College London (UCL; future 
leaders in infrastructure, radar and 3D 
Repo), Manchester University (overhead 
line structures and composite crossarms), 
and Loughborough University (accounting 
for whole-life carbon emissions from 
highways maintenance contracts), 
Cambridge University (e-luminate – 
merging art, music and light), and Queen’s 
University Belfast (resource efficiency 
through BIM).
Partnerships have also been established 
with UCL via an Honorary Research 
Associate post awarded to a member of 
the Digital Transformation team which 
supports the research of digital impact on 
business models in delivering social and 
economic infrastructure. A member of 
that team was invited to join the Chartered 
Institute of Building’s Innovation and 
Research Panel which sets the innovation 
and research agenda and funding focus for 
industry and academia. 
Balfour Beatty provides guest lecturers 
on BIM and Construction Economics to 
UCL, University of Middlesex, Abertay 
University and Ulster University for their 
BIM management courses.
Awards
Balfour Beatty undertakes a wide variety of 
works and is recognised by many diverse 
industry awards for the breadth of the work 
it undertakes. 
Ground Engineering was awarded 
Project of the Year at the UK Ground 
Engineering Awards 2016. The award 
was for the unique works to stabilise 
a landslide in Lyme Regis, ensuring 
the work did not impact on the area’s 
UNESCO World Heritage Site status 
and ecological requirements of Natural 
England. The £13.5 million works included 
the construction of a 400m wave wall and 
walkway built below the landslide areas, 
and the stabilisation of the major slope 
to ensure the protection of 480 homes.
Highway Services won the Best Public 
Sector Digital Project at the V3 Digital 
Technology Leaders Awards 2016. 
Working with Southampton City Council, 
Balfour Beatty used live data to analyse 
traffic flows to alleviate congestion, 
specifically around major events such 
as Southampton Football Club matches. 
Balfour Beatty’s joint submission ‘Shaping 
Southampton through Digital Excellence’ 
was the culmination of five years of 
investment and continuous improvement 
in digital technologies, in partnership with 
Southampton City Council, to drive greater 
customer satisfaction and more efficient 
operational delivery. The judges praised 
the project as: “an excellent example of 
exactly how councils should be looking 
at using technology, visualisations and 
data to improve the services they offer 
to their citizens and a model that other 
councils should look at when considering 
implementing similar strategies.”
Gammon has been awarded the 
Innovation and Creativity Grand Award 
at the 2016 Hong Kong Awards for 
Industries. The award attributes to the 
effective strategy of Build to Order Full 
Modular Mechanical Electrical Plant 
(MEP) Construction. Important features 
of this strategy solution include off-site 
standardisation of MEP module design, 
weldless assembly and the extensive 
specialisation possibilities offered by 
the build to order model. The concept 
is effective in increasing productivity, 
improving the work environment, raising 
general safety levels and addressing 
the labour shortage that is facing the 
construction industry.
Gammon has already used and will use this 
solution in many other high-profile projects, 
including the China Mobile Network 
Centre, the Global Switch Data Centre and 
the Murray Building.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 35 Strategic Report Focused on a safe 
and ethical place of work
Health and safety
‘Safe’ is one of the four Build to Last 
goals and all operations must ensure the 
health and safety of everyone who comes 
into contact with the Group’s activities. 
Zero Harm is Balfour Beatty’s vision which 
means, no injury or ill health caused by 
work activities. All operations are charged 
with constantly improving performance, 
sharing learning and best practice.
The Zero Harm objective is supported 
by risk-based prioritised action plans. 
These are formed around 12 key areas: 
communicating the vision; leadership; 
learning and sharing; co-ordinated 
governance; supply chain engagement; 
health and safety by design; improving 
management systems and processes; 
training and competence; behavioural 
safety; innovation, recognition and reward; 
performance indicators; and local initiatives. 
Group initiatives, linked to the Zero Harm 
calendar are proactive and evidence-based. 
These include quarterly campaigns and 
Group-wide stand downs on key topics. 
In 2016 these included work at height, 
interfaces between people and plant and 
treating health like safety.
Many parts of Balfour Beatty’s business 
achieved millions of hours incident 
free, demonstrating that Zero Harm is 
achievable. Group-wide leading and 
lagging key performance indicators 
trended positively, with particularly strong 
performance in the UK. The Group’s Lost 
Time Injury Rate (LTIR) improved from 0.32 
to 0.31, 0.24 to 0.22 excluding the Group’s 
international joint ventures. 
Central to sustainable delivery of 
Zero Harm is Balfour Beatty’s Making 
Safety Personal (MSP) programme, 
based around four simple golden rules. 
In 2015 the focus was engagement 
through workforce observations, which 
achieved a dramatic increase and this 
trend has continued in 2016. In 2016 the 
Group piloted and launched the MSP 
1 foundation programme for everyone 
on making safe choices and an MSP 4 
leadership programme.
Balfour Beatty’s industry-leading 
commitment to treating health like safety 
focuses on eliminating occupational 
disease and ill health. In the UK, Balfour 
Beatty is a founder and active member 
of the Health in Construction Leadership 
Group (HCLG). In 2016 the HCLG 
brought industry leaders, clients and 
contractors, together in a ground-breaking 
summit – Committing Construction to a 
Healthier Future.
The business continued to win awards for 
its health and safety performance. In the 
UK, the Sellafield Silo Maintenance Facility 
team won RoSPA’s Order of Distinction 
and clients award for safety. Balfour Beatty 
won several national awards too such 
as the National Joint Utilities Group to 
support visually impaired members of the 
community navigate around utility street 
works. In the US, the Group received 
the national AGC Safety Award for its 
outstanding safety record in Highways.
Employee survey results across the 
Group rated consistently highly on health 
and safety questions, a strong indicator 
of engagement.
Sadly, despite these positive 
improvements, five workers lost their lives 
across the Group in 2016, one in the UK, 
one in the US and three in the Gammon 
joint venture in Hong Kong/Singapore. 
Three of the workers were subcontractors, 
two were direct employees. 
Each fatal accident is subject to a thorough 
investigation and a detailed review by the 
Group Chief Executive and further review 
by the Safety and Sustainability Committee 
to ensure lessons are promulgated 
across the business and wider industry. 
Lessons from the UK fatality involving 
plant have resulted in industry-wide 
improvements in the understanding and 
application of the hierarchy of risk controls.
In 2017 the Group will continue its 
relentless focus on health and safety 
within the business and working with the 
wider industry.

People and leadership
In 2015 the Group set out its people 
strategy based on inspiring people to 
excel as part of the Group’s transformation 
programme – Build to Last. This delivered 
significant successful results and 
continued to be the foundation of the 2016 
people plan. As part of the Build to Last 
transformation, Balfour Beatty continues to 
improve and enhance systems, policies and 
procedures. This has included simplifying 
the number of core UK policies from 200 
down to 50 and reducing the number of 
payrolls by 60%, as well as other system 
changes such as creating an onboarding 
portal to enhance the joining experience for 
new employees.
During 2016 Balfour Beatty has invested 
in training and development of employees, 
through the Balfour Beatty Academy, and 
developed new strategic and business-
specific programmes. 
These training and development 
programmes operate within the context 
of a Group-wide talent review process, 
which ensures consistent methodology 
and visibility of talent, so that succession 
planning, leadership training and 
development interventions are applied 
in the most effective way possible by 
leveraging the Group’s scale.
The first Group-wide employee 
engagement survey was completed in 
2015 and followed up with a number 
of actions following the survey results. 
A second Group-wide survey was held in 
2016 using Best Companies again in order 
to provide consistency in measurement and 
benchmarking against other companies. 
Employee engagement remains a key 
focus, to support and enhance business 
performance and Balfour Beatty has been 
awarded ‘Ones to Watch’ status under the 
Best Companies Index.
Emerging talent
The 5% Club works with UK employers 
and key influencers to inspire, educate and 
retain a growing number of apprentices, 
sponsored students and graduates 
through ‘earn and learn’ placements. 
The goal of The 5% Club is to increase 
the employment and career prospects of 
today’s youth and equip the UK with the 
skilled workforce it needs to safeguard 
Britain’s economy.
Members pledge to work towards having 
a minimum of 5% of their employees in 
‘earn and learn’ positions – apprentices, 
sponsored students and graduate trainees 
– within five years of joining.
Balfour Beatty has been a member of The 
5% Club since December 2013, and was 
the first in the infrastructure industry to join. 
Group Chief Executive Leo Quinn has 
personally donated £40,000, equivalent 
to 5% of his salary, to secure the ongoing 
work of The 5% Club and committed to 
underwrite up to £100,000 of costs while 
wider fundraising gets underway.
The proportion of the UK workforce in ‘earn 
and learn’ positions has increased from 
3.1% in 2014, to 4.3% in 2016.
In 2016, the Group recruited 110 graduates 
and 114 apprentices across the UK, and 
current plans are seeing the business move 
towards the 5% target. 
The Group’s UK businesses are also 
supporting nearly 200 people studying part-
time at local colleges and universities. 
Balfour Beatty continues to lead a 
consortium on behalf of the sector 
to support government reforms on 
apprenticeships for the construction 
industry, gaining approval of 14 new 
Apprenticeships Standards for craft and 
technical/professional job roles and aiming 
for delivery to start in September 2017.
Upskilling the UK’s infrastructure 
workforce
The Balfour Beatty Academy continues 
to provide a range of management, 
leadership and professional-level technical 
development programmes as a focus 
for the Group’s UK activities and aims to 
ensure co-ordinated and cost-effective 
development in line with its Build to 
Last goals.
During 2016: investment continued into key 
training initiatives; over 230 places were 
occupied on one of the Group’s commercial 
management modules; 70 senior win 
business staff attended the high-value 
selling programme and an additional 
35 were trained on a new programme 
of business acquisition methodology 
that the Academy is collaborating on 
with colleagues from the US business; 
another 100 people started their APM 
project management qualification journey; 
240 people attended negotiation skills 
training and over 290 people attended 
a programme to develop their people 
management skills. To complement Balfour 
Beatty’s portfolio, additional offerings 
in the project management suite were 
developed, as were programmes to 
enhance leadership, diversity and inclusion, 
and client-focused work-winning, which 
were piloted in 2016 ready for 2017 launch. 
Balfour Beatty works in partnership 
with The Prince’s Trust, which trains 
unemployed young people through its Get 
into Construction programme. Over the last 
five years, 400 young people completed 
this programme, learning while working on 
Balfour Beatty sites. About 70% of these 
people gained employment with the Group 
directly or with its supply chain.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 37 Strategic Report Diversity and inclusion
Leo Quinn, Group Chief Executive, is 
the Board-level sponsor for diversity and 
inclusion. In 2016, the Board established 
a steering committee to govern the 
strategic activities across the UK and to 
track progress against a new three-year 
blueprint. This blueprint serves to outline 
the key deliverables and metrics necessary 
to attract diverse talent and create a 
more inclusive working environment. 
Each strategic business unit produces a 
plan to align with the overarching strategy 
to ensure that diversity and inclusion 
activities are embedded to meet local 
employee and customer needs.
In 2016, four new Affinity Networks were 
launched to enable employee groups 
to network, share information and gain 
support. The aim of these networks is 
to improve individual and organisational 
understanding of the different aspects 
of diversity and inclusion, in addition to 
supporting the Group’s strategy to be 
a great place to work. In 2016, Balfour 
Beatty’s longstanding LGBT network 
secured the Civil Engineering Contractors 
Association (CECA) award for ‘Inspiring 
Change in the Workplace’ in recognition 
of their work, which offers confidential 
support to LGBT employees and their 
‘allies’. Balfour Beatty was one of the first 
infrastructure companies to set up an 
LGBT professional network and is proud 
to be represented in the 2016 Financial 
Times’ Top 50 Future LGBT Leaders 
list. The network, which has doubled 
its membership in two years, has over 
100 members spanning the UK and the 
US, ranging from senior sponsorship to 
frontline construction workers.
Given that the proportion of female 
employees has reduced in recent 
years with the disposals of Balfour 
Beatty WorkPlace in 2013 and Parsons 
Brinckerhoff in 2014, a strategic priority 
for the Group is to increase the number of 
females across the business, particularly 
in middle and senior management roles. 
The Women in Business network has 
recently developed a new three-day career 
development programme specifically 
designed to support women in accelerating 
their careers which will be rolled out 
across the organisation in 2017, following 
a successful pilot. A new Returners’ 
Programme, which provides career 
placements to women who have been 
on a career break of two years or more, 
was also launched in 2016. Through this 
programme, women will gain invaluable 
support and mentoring to support their 
pursuit of permanent employment. 
Balfour Beatty has diversified its supply 
chain, spending more than 40% of total 
spend with SMEs over each of the last four 
years. The percentage spend with Social 
Enterprises has doubled, and since 2014, a 
year-on-year increase in percentage spend 
with female-owned businesses has been 
delivered (0.11% in 2014, 2% in 2015 and 
3.37% in 2016). In recognition of delivering 
a diverse culture across its supply chain, 
Balfour Beatty was awarded Minority 
Supplier Development UK’s Inclusive 
Procurement award for 2016.
To enhance the Group’s diversity and 
inclusion offering, strategic partnerships 
are in place with WISE, the Leonard 
Cheshire Disability Society, Business in the 
Community and Stonewall. Balfour Beatty 
is also a signatory to the Armed Forces 
Corporate Covenant and progressed to 
Silver Award winners in 2016.
The Group remains committed to investing 
in industry-leading people throughout 
a period of considerable change. 
It is this commitment and the continued 
engagement of employees that will provide 
the foundations for Balfour Beatty’s 
recovery and future growth.

38 Business Integrity
Balfour Beatty has a well-developed 
Business Integrity programme which 
was originally launched in 2009. 
The programme adopts a behaviours-
based approach to ensure that the Group’s 
culture enables people to make the right 
choices and empowers them to speak 
up where others have not. In 2016, the 
whole programme and its effectiveness 
were evaluated and a number of initiatives 
updated and re-launched:
 – the Code of Conduct has been 
updated and launched as a website 
(www.balfourbeattycodeofconduct.com). 
As a result, the Code is now available on 
phones, tablets and laptops so everyone 
can access and understand what is 
expected of them
 – a new online assessment has been 
created to evaluate a person’s 
understanding of the Code of Conduct 
and what is expected of them, which will 
inform the training they receive. 
Previously a standard training programme 
was mandatory and effectiveness 
measured through completion rates
 – training for on-site operatives was 
relaunched and forms part of the Site 
Mobilisation Hub so that sites start with 
the right Business Integrity resources 
and support 
 – several manual processes are being 
automated to make better use of 
technology. This will ensure that 
processes are followed in a consistent 
manner and decisions taken will be 
documented and available in a uniform 
way. Examples include the annual 
compliance declaration and the due 
diligence process undertaken when 
working with new clients or partners. 
Technology also enables the better 
collection of data which can be shared to 
improve behaviour and mitigate risk.
All of the improvements made to the 
programme are designed to make it 
more accessible and compliance with 
it easy to understand and implement. 
The embedding of the programme through 
the usual channels of training, workshops 
and constant communication also 
continued during the year. 
In addition to improvements in the 
programme, the Business Integrity function 
also increased the team to ensure all in-
scope cases are investigated in a timely

manner. Investigating cases and taking 
appropriate action are key to reinforcing 
the behaviours expected of everyone and 
supporting those who raise concerns. 
Speak up
Balfour Beatty encourages its staff and 
wider community to report any concerns 
about unethical conduct. Trends and, where 
appropriate, details of cases raised are 
reported to the Audit and Risk Committee 
and each business unit. Whilst action is 
taken in respect of the immediate issues 
raised, this data also informs the longer 
term strategic direction of the programme. 
There has been an increase in the total 
number of reported cases in 2016 
compared with 2015, which reflects the 
benefits of reinvigorating the programme. 
There has also been an increase in the 
number of cases per 1,000 employees. 
Areas of focus in 2017
The implementation of the changes to 
the Business Integrity programme will 
continue in 2017 with a particular focus 
on technology. The benefits of the 
changes made in 2016 are borne out in 
the increased awareness of the Code 
of Conduct and the numbers feeling 
empowered to challenge. However, 
there is still a significant amount of work 
to do to ensure the programme is fully 
embedded throughout the Group in a 
consistent manner.
Modern slavery 
Modern slavery is a brutal form of 
organised crime in which people are 
treated as commodities and exploited for 
criminal gain. The International Labour 
Organisation estimates that 21 million 
men, women and children are working in 
conditions of modern slavery, including 
trafficked persons. The vast majority of 
these people are in the supply chains of 
legitimate industries. Balfour Beatty is 
committed to working within the business 
and its supply chain to ensure a proactive 
approach is taken to tackling hidden labour 
exploitation and eliminating these practices.

to modern slavery and its Modern Slavery 
Act transparency statement for 2016 can

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 39 Strategic Report Environmental performance
The Group’s sustainability strategy, Our 
Blueprint, sets out how Balfour Beatty will 
deliver long-term economic, social and 
environmental outcomes for its employees, 
customers, society and shareholders. 
It seeks to further embed sustainability 
throughout Balfour Beatty’s operations by 
providing a robust framework. For details 
on Our Blueprint and the Group’s wider 
sustainability performance, please visit:
  w w w . b a l f o u r b e a t t y .c o m / su s t a i n a b i l i t y/
sustainability-dashboard/
Optimising environmental performance 
forms a key component of Our Blueprint 
and is essential for driving efficiencies and 
winning work. Balfour Beatty has been 
taking steps to reduce its carbon emissions 
and mitigate against the business risks of 
climate change. 
The Group has continued to automate 
the collection of sustainability data by 
investing in software and developing 
in-house solutions. This has improved 
the completeness and accuracy of 
environmental performance data such as 
its Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
Standards
Sustainability is an integral part of 
modern infrastructure projects: public 
sector customers require conformance 
to standards such as BREEAM, LEED
®
, 
BEAM, ESTIDAMA, Green Mark, and 
CEEQUAL and these are important to 
planning authorities. Meeting these 
standards has resulted in a £2.2 billion 
revenue on green infrastructure projects 
in 2016. The Group’s certifications in this 
area and its technical knowledge improve 
the whole life performance of customers’ 
built assets.
Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions
The Group has seen a decrease in carbon 
emissions intensity in 2016 compared to 
2015 from 35.2 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent 
(CO 2e)/£m revenue to 30.1 tonnes of 
CO 2e/£m revenue. Since establishing 
the baseline in 2010, tonnes of CO 2e/£m 
revenue have dropped by 27% from 41.5 
tonnes of CO 2e/£m revenue to 30.1 tonnes 
of CO 2e/£m revenue.
The Group’s total CO 2e figure for Scope 1 
and 2 emissions, has dropped by 53,841 
tonnes of CO 2e (15%) from 357,983 tonnes 
of CO 2e to 304,142 tonnes of CO 2e over 
the same period.
Over the last year the energy management 
unit has made significant progress in 
reducing energy and fuel consumption and 
associated Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
Balfour Beatty’s 2020 goal is to achieve 
a 50% reduction per £ million revenue of 
its Scope 1 and 2 emissions (against a 
2010 baseline). 
Achievement of this target will mean 
reduced operating costs and therefore 
improved value to customers and 
shareholders. Additionally, a number of 
customers have expressed an intention to 
prequalify contractors on the basis of their 
carbon performance in the future. 
Gammon Construction, the Group’s 
joint venture in Hong Kong/Singapore, 
accounts for approximately 37% of 
the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
In 2014, it became the first construction 
company in Hong Kong to be awarded 
the CarbonCare® Label that covers all of 
its operations in Hong Kong (except joint 
venture projects). This is in addition to the 
ISO 14064-1 international standard for 
quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions it holds. Its Scope 1 and 2 
GHG emissions are independently verified 
by SGS.
 www.balfourbeatty.com/showcase
GHG reporting and assurance
Balfour Beatty’s GHG emissions are 
reported in accordance with the UK 
Government’s GHG reporting requirements 
covering all six Kyoto gases. 
The Group uses the operational control 
approach under the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard as at 31 December 2016 to report 
emissions from its operations around the 
world. However, Balfour Beatty has chosen 
not to report against the market-based 
approach. Even though Balfour Beatty does 
procure significant amounts of renewable 
electricity, the average DEFRA conversion 
factors have been used for carbon 
reporting purposes in order not to detract 
from reducing energy intensive operations. 
Balfour Beatty’s energy consumption in 
MWh is shown on page 41 to allow readers 
to make more informed comparisons of its 
energy use.
Although Balfour Beatty’s Scope 1 and 2 
CO 2e emissions dropped by 2% (6,726 
tonnes) over the period from 2015 to 2016, 
the number of MWh of energy dropped 
by approximately 1% (10,736 MWh 
for energy).
This difference can be explained by the 
fact that different fuels have different 
carbon conversion factors, with some fuels 
attracting greater carbon conversion factors 
than others. Furthermore, the MWh table 
does not include fugitive emissions. 
The Energy Use table illustrates that there 
has been a greater switch towards biofuel 
blends for petrol and diesel accompanied 
by a reduction in both mineral petrol 
and diesel.
Balfour Beatty’s Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e 
emissions include emissions from assets 
that are otherwise not referred to across 
the rest of the financial statements such as 
energy provided by landlords or clients that 
Balfour Beatty does not pay for.

Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
40 The Group has determined and reported 
the emissions it is responsible for within 
this boundary and does not believe there 
are any material omissions. The Group uses 
the UK Government’s carbon conversion 
factors that were updated in 2016 to 
calculate its emissions into equivalent 
tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2e) and the 
IEA’s September 2016 set of international 
conversion factors for electricity (Scope 
2) except for the UK where the UK 
Government’s conversion factors were 
used as they are more up to date. 
The Group has removed the Scope 1 and 
2 data for Sakti, Dutco Balfour Beatty and 
BK Gulf from the original 2010 baseline and 
subsequent years.
KPMG were engaged to undertake 
an independent limited assurance 
engagement, reporting to Balfour Beatty 
plc, using the assurance standards ISAE 
3000 and ISAE 3410 over the GHG data 
that have been highlighted in this report 
with the symbol Δ. Their full statement is 
available at:
 www.balfourbeatty.com/IIA
The level of assurance provided for 
a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially lower than a reasonable 
assurance engagement. In order to reach 
their opinion, KPMG performed a range of 
procedures over the GHG data including:
 – interviewing management responsible 
for the data
 – agreeing a selection of the data to the 
corresponding source documentation at 
business unit level
 – performing analytical procedures over 
the aggregated data at Balfour Beatty 
Group level. 
A summary of the work they performed is

Non-financial performance information, 
GHG quantification in particular, is subject 
to more inherent limitations than financial

CDP
The Group is committed to addressing 
climate risk and reducing the lifetime 
emissions of the assets it builds, as 
evidenced by its performance in the 
global evaluation standard, the Climate 
Disclosure Project (CDP), where a B rating 
was achieved in 2016, compared to the 
Construction and Engineering average 
rating of C.
The annual rating is based on CDP’s 
evaluation of the Company’s strategy, goals 
and actual emissions reductions, as well as 
transparency and verification of reported 
data. It assesses the completeness and 
quality of Balfour Beatty’s measurement 
and management of carbon footprint, 
climate change strategy, risk management 
processes and outcomes. The score’s 
purpose is to provide a summary of the 
extent to which companies have answered 
these questions in a structured format. 
Balfour Beatty’s B rating indicates that 
its team has provided comprehensive 
information in a transparent and 
open manner.

Engaging local communities
Community engagement
In many markets the ability to demonstrate 
the social value of the Group’s operations 
in economic terms is vital. To benefit local 
areas, the Group uses local suppliers, 
employees and materials wherever 
possible, and invests in future talent 
through apprenticeship schemes and work 
placement opportunities.
Involved (Balfour Beatty’s community 
investment programme in the UK) was 
established in 2015 and focuses on three 
key areas where the Group can add value 
to its customers and the local community:
 – local employment and skills
 – supporting local businesses
 – community engagement through 
charitable fundraising, volunteering 
and mentoring.
Wherever the Group operates it seeks 
to integrate within the neighbourhood, 
supporting the local community, 
its businesses and its workforce. 
Involved gives Balfour Beatty the 
opportunity to work within a framework 
whereby the results of its interventions 
are captured and the benefit to society 
shared with its customers and other 
interested parties.
Community investment through 
charitable fundraising
The Balfour Beatty Building Better Futures 
Charitable Trust was formed in 2009 to 
help the most disadvantaged young people 
in society.
Through a mix of employee fundraising and 
financial support provided by the Company, 
the Trust currently supports three charities: 
Barnardo’s, Coram and The Prince’s Trust.
In 2016, employees raised over 
£66,000 through the Building Better 
Futures fundraising activity programme. 
An additional £18,000 was raised by 
employees for charities separately. 
The Company matched this funding with 
an additional contribution and donated a 
total of £100,000 to the Trust.
To help tackle youth unemployment and 
the skills gap in the construction sector, 
many of Balfour Beatty’s programmes have 
been focused on improving employment 
opportunities and employability 
of individuals. 
 – Since 2006, the Trust has helped 
transform the lives of nearly 4,000 young 
people by working together with The 
Prince’s Trust. 
 – Since 2013 the Trust has contributed 
£136,000 to support Barnardo’s work 
with unemployed young people; helping 
over 1,300 young people to gain new 
skills, qualifications and stable work.
 – Since 2010, the Trust has contributed 
over £420,000 to Coram. This has 
funded three of Coram’s vital services for 
children and young people. With Balfour 
Beatty’s support– Coram has helped 
26 children to find their ‘forever family’ 
through Coram Adoption; provided 
art and music therapy to 144 children 
helping them to overcome trauma; and 
enabled 40,138 vulnerable schoolchildren 
to experience Coram’s interactive health 
education programme.
In 2016, 48 Balfour Beatty employees took 
to the saddle and raised over £203,000 
for charitable causes, of which £86,000 
(including matched funding from the 
Company) was directed to the Balfour 
Beatty Charitable Trust. The Deloitte Ride 
Across Britain route covered an impressive 
969 miles, beginning in Land’s End and 
finishing in John O’Groats. 
Balfour Beatty completed its support 
for the London Youth Games in 2016, 
facilitating another record year of 
participation for young people in London, 
with 139,786 taking part. Balfour Beatty 
staff again played a key role among 4,173 
volunteers and supported the successful 
delivery of the Games. Since Balfour 
Beatty started sponsoring the Games 
in 2006, participant numbers have 
increased fivefold.
This has brought multiple benefits, 
including engaging employees in 
volunteering, helping customer 
relationships and supporting communities 
in and around London where Balfour 
Beatty operates.
The US construction business contributed 
over US$450,000 to charitable causes in 
2016. Some of the organisations receiving 
donations are:
 – Make-A-Wish Foundation
 – Sharefest
 – Habitat for Humanity
 – Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
 – Carpenter’s Shelter
 – Kay Yow Cancer Fund
 – United Way
 – Urban Ministry Center.

change the quality of life for its residents. 
Since its inception in 2013, Balfour 
Beatty’s Golf Classic outing has raised 
more than US$360,000 to support annual 
Workday activities. 
For Make-A-Wish
®
 Foundation’s 
Walk for Wishes event in Georgia, the 
Balfour Beatty team in Atlanta raised 
over US$65,000 for children in Georgia 
who have been afflicted with life-
threatening illnesses.
In Texas, Balfour Beatty continued with 
its High School Mentoring Program 
that started in 2009. The programme 
enhances the educational and professional 
development experience of high school 
students in the Dallas/Fort Worth area 
by raising the awareness of professional 
opportunities within the construction 
industry. Through one-on-one mentoring 
relationships, Balfour Beatty facilitates 
sustainable academic enrichment, 
encourages leadership, and provides 
exposure to the construction industry. 
Since inception, the programme has hosted 
numerous High School interns, awarded 
several scholarships for students pursuing 
careers in construction management and 
sponsored college interns. Offers are 
extended to interns with successful 
internships upon graduation. 
In 2016, staff from Gammon Construction 
took part in a total of 116 community 
events in Hong Kong, mainland China and 
Singapore and raised over HK$1.9 million 
through sponsorships and charitable 
donations. Many of the community 
focused events promoted health and 
wellbeing including Gammon being the title 
sponsor of the ‘China Coast Marathon’ and 
participating in ‘Swim for a Million’, both in 
aid of the Community Chest of Hong Kong. 
Staff also participated in the Hong Kong 
Federation of Trade Unions’ Occupational 
Safety and Health walkathon for injured 
workers, and the Central Rat Race in aid of 
mental health charity, Mindset, as well as 
the annual three-day Gammon Walkathon 
2016 to raise funds for people with 
learning disabilities. In 2016, Gammon was 
recognised by the Hong Kong Council of 
Social Services as a ‘Caring Company’ for 
over 10 years.
Taxation
The Group’s tax strategy, approved by 
the Board, is to sustainably minimise 
tax cost whilst complying with the law. 
In doing so, it ensures it acts in accordance 
with Balfour Beatty’s ethics, values and 
compliance programme. 
Balfour Beatty has clear tax policies, 
procedures and controls in place which 
are overseen by the Chief Financial Officer 
and monitored and reviewed by internal 
tax specialists. 
The Group manages tax affairs in a 
proactive manner that seeks to maximise 
shareholder value. However, it does not 
enter into artificial arrangements that lack 
commercial purpose in order to secure a 
tax advantage. If a position is uncertain 
the Group may obtain third-party advice 
in order to gain clarity or support for a 
particular stance or approach. The aim is 
to ensure full compliance with all statutory 
obligations and as a consequence attempt 
to minimise risk wherever possible.
This approach is supported by an open, 
honest and positive working relationship 
with the tax authorities. Should any dispute 
arise with regard to the interpretation 
and application of tax law, the Group 
is committed to addressing the matter 
promptly and resolving it in an open and 
constructive manner.
The Group makes a major contribution to 
the tax revenues of governments in the 
numerous territories in which it operates. 
For example, the Group’s tax contribution 
extends significantly beyond corporation 
tax and the collection of substantial 
amounts of income tax and includes the 
payment of significant employer social 
security contributions.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 43 Strategic Report Measuring our performance
Providing clarity on the Group’s  
alternative performance measures
Following the issuance of the Guidelines 
on Alternative Performance Measures 
(APMs) by the European Securities and 
Markets Authorities (ESMA) in June 2015, 
the Group has included this section in its 
Annual Report with the aim of providing 
transparency and clarity on the measures 
adopted internally to assess performance. 
Throughout this report, the Group has 
presented financial performance measures 
which are considered most relevant to 
the Group and are used to manage the 
Group’s performance. 
These measures are chosen to provide a 
balanced view of the Group’s operations 
and are considered useful to investors 
as these measures provide relevant 
information on the Group’s past or future 
performance, position or cash flows. 
The APMs adopted by the Group are also 
commonly used in the sectors it operates 
in and therefore serve as a useful aid for 
investors to compare Balfour Beatty’s 
performance to its peers. 
The Board believes that disclosing 
these performance measures enhances 
investors’ ability to evaluate and assess 
the underlying financial performance of 
the Group’s continuing operations and the 
related key business drivers. 
These financial performance measures are 
also aligned to measures used internally 
to assess business performance in the 
Group’s budgeting process and when 
determining compensation. 
Equivalent information cannot be presented 
by using financial measures defined in the 
financial reporting framework alone. 
Readers of the Annual Report and 
Accounts are encouraged to review the 
financial statements in their entirety.
Performance measures used to assess 
the Group’s operations in the year 
Underlying profit from operations (PFO) 
Underlying PFO is presented before 
finance cost and interest income and is the 
key measure used to assess the Group’s 
performance in the Construction Services 
and Support Services segments. This is 
also a common measure used by the 
Group’s peers operating in these sectors. 
This measure reflects the returns to the 
Group from services provided in these 
operations that are generated from 
activities that are not financing in nature 
and therefore an underlying pre-finance 
cost measure is more suited to assessing 
underlying performance. 
Underlying profit before tax (PBT)
The Group assesses performance in its 
Infrastructure Investments segment using 
an underlying PBT measure. This differs 
from the underlying PFO measure used 
to measure the Group’s Construction 
Services and Support Services segments 
because in addition to margins generated 
from operations, there are returns to the 
Investments business which are generated 
from the financing element of its projects. 
These returns take the form of 
subordinated debt interest receivable and 
interest receivable on PPP financial assets 
which are included in the Group’s income 
statement in investment income. These are 
then offset by the finance cost incurred on 
the non-recourse debt associated with the 
underlying projects, which is included in the 
Group’s income statement in finance costs. 
Measuring the Group’s performance
The following measures are referred to 
in this Annual Report when reporting 
performance, both in absolute terms and 
also in comparison to earlier years: 
Statutory measures 
Statutory measures are derived from the 
Group’s reported financial statements, 
which are prepared in accordance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). 
Where a standard allows certain 
interpretations to be adopted, the Group 
has applied its accounting policies 
consistently. These accounting policies can 
be found on pages 112 to 118. 
The Group’s statutory measures take 
into account all of the factors, including 
those that it cannot influence (principally 
foreign currency fluctuations) and also large 
non-recurring items which do not reflect 
the ongoing underlying performance of 
the Group. 
Performance measures 
In assessing its performance, the Group 
has adopted certain non-statutory 
measures because, unlike its statutory 
measures, these cannot be derived directly 
from its financial statements. 
The Group commonly uses the following 
measures to assess its performance: 
a) Order book
The Group’s disclosure of its order book is 
aimed to provide insight into its pipeline of 
work and future performance. The Group’s 
order book is not a measure of past 
performance and therefore cannot be 
derived from its financial statements. 
The Group’s order book comprises the 
unexecuted element of orders on contracts 
that have been secured. Where contracts 
are subject to variations, only secured 
contract variations are included in the 
reported order book.
Where contracts fall under framework 
agreements, an estimate is made of orders 
to be secured under that framework 
agreement. This is based on historical 
trends from similar framework agreements 
delivered in the past and the estimate of 
orders included in the order book is that 
which is probable to be secured. 
b) Underlying performance
The Group adjusts for certain non-
underlying items which the Board 
believes assists in understanding the 
performance achieved by the Group. 
These items include: 
 – gains and losses on the disposal of 
businesses and investments, unless 
this is part of a programme of releasing 
value from the disposal of similar 
businesses or investments such as 
infrastructure concessions
 – costs of major restructuring and 
reorganisation of existing businesses
 – acquisition and similar costs related 
to business combinations such as 
transaction costs
 – impairment and amortisation charges 
on intangible assets arising on business 
combinations (amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets). These are non-
underlying costs as they do not relate 
to the underlying performance of 
the Group. 
From time to time, it may be appropriate 
to disclose further items as non-underlying 
items in order to reflect the underlying 
performance of the Group. 
The results of Rail Germany and certain 
legacy ES contracts have been treated 
as non-underlying items as the Group 
is committed to exiting these parts of 
the business. 
Further details of these non-underlying 
items are provided in Note 10.

d) Underlying earnings per share 
In line with the Group’s measurement of underlying performance, the Group also presents its earnings per share on an underlying continuing 
basis. The table below reconciles this to the statutory earnings per share. 
Reconciliation from statutory EPS to performance EPS

Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 0.9 0.8
Other non-underlying items 6.1 9.7
Underlying earnings/(loss) per ordinary share from continuing operations (performance) 7.0 (19.7)
e) Revenue including share of joint ventures and associates (JVAs)
The Group uses a revenue measure which is inclusive of its share of revenue generated from its JVAs. As the Group uses revenue as a 
measure of the level of activity performed by the Group during the year, the Board believes that including revenue that is earned from its 
JVAs better reflects the size of the business and the volume of work carried out and more appropriately compares to PFO. 
This differs from the statutory measure of revenue which presents Group revenue from its subsidiaries. 
A reconciliation of the statutory measure of revenue to the Group’s performance measure is shown in the tables in section (b). A comparison 
of the growth rates in statutory and performance revenue can be found in section (i).
f) Recourse net cash/borrowings
The Group also measures its performance based on its net cash/borrowings position at the period end. This is analysed using only elements 
that are recourse to the Group and excludes the liability component of the Company’s preference shares, which is debt in nature according 
to statutory measures, as this is excluded from the definition of net debt in the covenants set out in the Group’s facilities. 
Non-recourse elements are cash and debt that are ringfenced within certain infrastructure concession project companies.

Providing clarity on the Group’s alternative performance measures continued
g) Average net cash/borrowings
The Group uses an average net cash/borrowings measure as this reflects its financing requirements throughout the period. The Group 
calculates its average net cash/borrowings based on the average opening and closing figures for each month through the period. 
The average net cash/borrowings measure excludes non-recourse cash and debt and the liability component of the Company’s preference 
shares, and this performance measure shows average net borrowings of £46 million for 2016. 
Using a statutory measure (inclusive of non-recourse elements and the liability component of the Company’s preference shares) gives 
average net borrowings of £230 million for 2016. 
h) Directors’ valuation of the Investments portfolio
The Group uses a different methodology to assess the value of its Investments portfolio. As described on pages 30 to 32 the Directors’ 
valuation has been undertaken using forecast cash flows for each project based on progress to date and market expectations of future 
performance. These cash flows have been discounted using different discount rates depending on project risk and maturity, reflecting 
secondary market transaction experience. As such, the Board believes that this measure better reflects the potential returns to the Group 
from this portfolio. 
The Directors have valued the Investments portfolio at £1.2 billion at the year end. The Directors’ valuation will differ from the statutory 
carrying value of these investments, which are accounted for using the relevant standards in accordance with IFRS rather than a discounted 
cash flow approach. 
i) Constant exchange rates (CER) 
The Group operates across a variety of geographic locations and in its statutory results, the results of its overseas entities are translated 
into the Group’s presentational currency at average rates of exchange for the period. The Group’s key exchange rates applied in deriving its 
statutory results are shown in Note 3. 
To measure changes in the Group’s performance compared with the previous period without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the 
Group provides growth rates on a CER basis. These measures remove the effects of currency movements by retranslating the prior period’s 
figures at the current period’s exchange rates, using average rates for revenue and closing rates for order book. A comparison of the Group’s 
statutory growth rate to the CER growth rate is provided in the table below:

Repositioning Balfour Beatty  
for profitable growth
Group financial summary
In 2016, the Group returned to both 
underlying and statutory profitability. 
On an underlying basis, order book, 
revenue, profit from operations, earnings 
and net cash all improved year-on-year 
as the progress made with Phase One 
of Build to Last translated into improved 
financial metrics. 
Underlying revenue increased by 4% to 
£8,530 million (2015: £8,235 million). 
Underlying revenue at constant exchange 
rates (CER) fell by 3% as the Group 
continued with its more disciplined 
and selective approach to bidding. 
Statutory revenue, which excludes 
joint ventures and associates, was 
£6,923 million (2015: £6,955 million). 
Construction Services underlying 
revenue was up 7% at £6,852 million 
(2015: £6,388 million) as growth in 
the US offset an expected decline in 
the UK; underlying revenue at CER fell 
by 1%. Support Services underlying 
revenue declined 12% at £1,103 million 
(2015: £1,259 million) due to the phasing 
of contract and regulatory cycles.
The Group returned to profitability in 2016 
with underlying profit from operations 
at £67 million (2015: £106 million loss). 
Statutory profit from operations improved 
from a loss of £182 million to a profit of 
£15 million primarily driven by the increase 
in underlying profit and a reduction in 
non-underlying costs. 
Infrastructure Investments continued to 
deliver excellent results with underlying 
profit from operations of £89 million 
(2015: £132 million), including the 
benefit of £65 million of profits from 
investment disposals (2015: £95 million). 
Support Services rebounded to more 
normal levels, compared to the prior year, 
with underlying profit from operations 
of £34 million (2015: £24 million). 
Underlying loss from operations in 
Construction Services reduced to 
£23 million (2015: £229 million loss), 
where losses in the UK of £64 million 
(2015: £187 million loss) were only partially 
offset by profits in the US of £33 million 
(2015: £22 million loss).

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 49 Strategic Report Chief Financial Officer’s review
Repositioning Balfour Beatty for profitable growth continued
The half-yearly contribution of the 
Group’s £67 million underlying profit 
from operations was £5 million in the first 
half, with £62 million in the second half 
of the year. Infrastructure Investments, 
Support Services and Construction 
Services all reported underlying profit from 
operations in the second half of 2016, with 
UK construction continuing its positive 
trajectory as it returned to underlying 
profitability, a modest £2 million in the 
second half of the year. 
Net finance costs decreased to £7 million 
(2015: £17 million) predominantly due 
to a £19 million gain on foreign currency 
deposits. The taxation charge on 
underlying profits increased to £12 million 
(2015: £11 million). 
Underlying profit after tax for the year 
at £48 million (2015: £135 million loss) 
represents a material improvement over 
the previous year, primarily driven by the 
improvement in Construction Services. 
Total statutory profit after tax for the year 
was £24 million (2015: £206 million loss). 
The order book increased by 15% to 
£12.7 billion (2015: £11.0 billion), up 4% 
at CER, despite the more disciplined and 
selective approach to bidding. Additionally, 
the quality of the order book improved 
as the business increased bid margin 
thresholds and focused on jobs where the 
Group can deliver value.
The improved order book was 
predominantly due to Construction 
Services at £9.6 billion (2015: £7.9 billion), 
with increases in all material geographical 
regions: UK construction up 11%; US 
construction up 10% at CER; and Far East 
construction up 14% at CER. The Support 
Services order book was stable at 
£3.1 billion (2015: £3.1 billion). 
Non-underlying items
The Board believes non-underlying items 
should be separately identified on the 
face of the income statement to assist 
in understanding the underlying financial 
performance achieved by the Group. 
Non-underlying items from continuing 
operations before tax of £52 million were 
charged to the income statement in 2016. 
Items included £25 million of costs related 
to the reassessment of potential liabilities 
on historical health and safety breaches, 
following new sentencing guidelines, and 
£14 million of restructuring costs incurred 
relating to the Group’s Build to Last 
transformation programme which was 
launched in early 2015. 
In 2016, the Group also commissioned 
a revised independent actuarial report 
on its historical exposure to industrial 
disease related liabilities. As a result, the 
Group has increased its provision with a 
£14 million charge to the income statement 
in the year. Other non-underlying items 
included amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets of £9 million, the profits from Rail 
Germany of £1 million, and losses resulting 
from legacy ES contracts of £6 million. 
The non-underlying charges recognised in 
2016 were partially offset by a £9 million 
gain following the release of all remaining 
provisions relating to Trans4m Ltd 
(Trans4m). Trans4m went into creditors’ 
voluntary liquidation on 27 June 2016.
Taxation
The Group’s underlying profit before tax 
from continuing operations for subsidiaries 
of £5 million (2015: £170 million loss) 
resulted in an underlying tax charge of 
£12 million (2015: £11 million). The tax 
charge principally arises due to significant 
non-recognition of deferred tax assets 
on losses incurred in the year. In addition 
tax is levied at the subsidiary level for US 
and Canada joint ventures and associates, 
rather than within the share of joint 
ventures and associates. 
Discontinued operations
In 2016, Balfour Beatty reached a 
settlement with the purchaser of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff (PB), the Group’s former 
professional services business disposed 
in October 2014, in relation to outstanding 
tax matters and indemnities. The Group 
received an additional £9 million as a result 
of the settlement. Provisions in relation 
to these matters have been released, 
resulting in an overall non-underlying gain 
to the Group of £24 million.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share from 
continuing operations was 7.0 pence 
(2015: 19.7 pence loss), which along 
with a non-underlying loss per share 
from continuing operations of 7.0 pence 
(2015: 10.5 pence loss) resulted in earnings 
per share from continuing operations 
of nil pence (2015: 30.2 pence loss). 
Statutory earnings per share was 3.5 pence 
(2015: 30.1 pence loss). 
Cash flow performance
The total cash movement in the period 
resulted in a £10 million increase to the 
Group’s net cash position, excluding non-
recourse net borrowings, to £173 million. 
This compares to a decrease in the 
Group’s net cash position of £56 million 
in 2015. The increase in net cash was 
driven by proceeds from investment 
disposals and favourable US dollar foreign 
exchange movements, partly offset 
by new investments in infrastructure 
assets, negative operating cash flows, 
working capital movements and pension 
deficit payments.
Operating cash flows, before movements 
in working capital and pension deficit 
payments, improved to an outflow of 
£58 million (2015: £247 million outflow). 
This reduced outflow is predominantly 
as a result of the improved financial 
performance from Construction Services. 
Working capital had an outflow of 
£48 million (2015: £178 million inflow) 
and pension deficit payments were an 
outflow of £41 million (2015: £66 million). 
Total cash used in operations before tax 
was £147 million (2015: £135 million), a 
decline of £12 million compared to the prior 
year. Currency translation differences on 
net cash generated a positive movement of 
£30 million (2015: £12 million negative).
The total cash movement in the 
period excluding Parsons Brinkerhoff 
(PB) proceeds resulted in a £1 million 
increase in the Group’s net cash position. 
This represented an £82 million 
improvement on 2015, and a £439 million 
improvement on 2014 – an excellent 
performance against the Build to Last 
Phase One target of £200 million cash flow 
improvement versus 2014. 
“
In 2016, the Group returned  
to both underlying and 
statutory profitability.

On statutory basis the Group reported net debt of 
£160 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: £300 million 
net debt).
Working capital
In 2015, there were large working capital 
inflows of £178 million as a result of 
the focus on all areas of working capital 
management and risk contingencies 
booked against legacy contracts. In 2016, 
the cash outflow on legacy contracts has 
been lower than anticipated, which resulted 
in a lower than expected working capital 
outflow of £48 million. The Group is still in 
a materially favourable (negative) working 
capital position following the completion of 
Build to Last Phase One.
The continued focus on reducing inventory 
and work in progress (WIP) balances 
generated a working capital inflow of 
£42 million. Movements in the Group’s 
due from / due to construction contract 
customers’ balances, which reflect the net 
unbilled contract position and traded profit 
and loss for each individual construction 
contract, generated a working capital inflow 
of £36 million. This inflow was mainly 
derived from an improvement in billing, 
offset by an outflow of cash expenditure on 
contract losses from prior years.
Trade and other payables generated a 
£60 million outflow partially as a result 
of the expected cash outflows on 
historical loss-making jobs. Trade and 
other receivables generated an outflow 
of £134 million, due to more efficient 
billing of construction contract amounts, 
an increase in mature projects leading 
to higher retentions and also a reflection 
of the large receipts into the business in 
December 2015.
Provisions generated a working capital 
inflow of £68 million primarily due to 
additional provisions taken on defects, 
health and safety breaches and industrial 
disease related liabilities. 
Including the impact of foreign exchange 
and disposals in the year, favourable 
working capital increased to £894 million at 
December 2016 (2015: £890 million).

Pensions
The Group’s balance sheet includes 
aggregate deficits of £231 million 
(2015: £146 million) for pension schemes. 
The increase in pension deficit in the year 
is largely due to a reduction in long-term 
interest rates and a contraction in credit 
spreads. Although the scheme obligations 
increased, the hedging programmes put 
in place offset a significant element of this 
change with an increase in scheme assets.
A formal triennial funding valuation of 
the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (BBPF) 
was carried out as at 31 March 2016. 
The Company and the trustees agreed 
the key commercial principles of the plan 
for the BBPF to reach self-sufficiency 
during 2027 (some three years earlier 
than previously planned). Balfour Beatty 
will make cash contributions totalling 
£182 million over the next eight years; 
under the previous agreement cash 
contributions totalled £376 million over 
the same period. These payments include 
contributions related to the Scottish Limited 
Partnership (SLP) structure established 
in 2015. The Company will also transfer 
additional assets into the SLP worth up 
to £87 million by 2019. The Company has 
agreed to amend the existing dividend 
sharing mechanism such that if the 
dividend cover ratio falls below 3x in 2016, 
2.5x in 2017 or 2x from 2018 onwards, 
funding to the BBPF will be accelerated. 
The Group also completed the formal 
triennial funding valuation for the Railways 
Pension Scheme carried out as at 
31 December 2013. As a result, the Group 
agreed to make ongoing fixed deficit 
contributions of £6 million per annum 
which should reduce the deficit to zero by 
2031. The triennial funding valuation as at 
31 December 2016 is now underway. 
Goodwill 
The goodwill on the Group’s balance 
sheet at 31 December 2016 increased to 
£937 million (2015: £844 million), primarily 
relating to movements in foreign exchange 
rates. Impairment reviews have been 
carried out, and none of the carrying values 
have been impaired.
In light of the significant, albeit reduced, 
losses incurred within the UK construction 
business in 2016 the Group has considered 
whether a reasonable possible change in 
assumptions would lead to an impairment 
of the goodwill in the related cash-
generating units and concluded that it is 
not the case. The stabilisation and recovery 
of the Group’s UK construction business 
to more normal levels of performance is, 
however, a key assumption underpinning 
the cash flow forecasts used to assess the 
recoverable amount of the related goodwill. 
Banking facilities
Balfour Beatty’s committed banking 
facility totals £400 million. The purpose 
of this syndicated revolving credit facility 
is to provide liquidity from a set of core 
relationship banks to support ongoing 
activities. The Company completed 
its refinancing in December 2015 with 
the facility extending through to 2018. 
In November 2016, £375 million of the 
facility was extended until December 2019. 
A further one-year extension, through to 
2020, is available, subject to bank approval. 
At 31 December 2016, £350 million of this 
facility was undrawn. 
balfourbeatty.com/AR2016
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 51 Strategic Report Net cash/borrowings
The Group’s net cash position at 
31 December 2016, excluding 
non-recourse net borrowings, was 
£173 million (2015: £163 million). 
Average net debt during the year at 
£46 million (2015: £3 million net cash), 
was ahead of expectations. Non-recourse 
net borrowings, held in wholly-owned 
infrastructure concessions, reduced 
to £233 million (2015: £365 million). 
The balance sheet also includes 
£100 million (2015: £98 million) for the 
liability component of the preference 
shares. Statutory net debt at 31 December 
2016 was £160 million (2015: £300 million).
Outlook 
Build to Last is a long-term transformation 
programme designed to deliver superior 
returns for all stakeholders from a Group 
which is Lean, Expert, Trusted and Safe. 
As a result of the actions taken during the 
24-month self-help phase, Balfour Beatty 
now has a solid platform on which to 
build. The Group exceeded its Phase One 
financial targets with £439 million cash in 
(Target: £200 million) and £123 million cost 
out (Target: £100 million). 
Over the next 24 months, Phase Two, the 
Group expects each of its Construction 
Services and Support Services businesses 
to continue their positive trajectory to reach 
industry-standard margins. 
Specifically, for these earnings-based 
businesses the underlying profit margin 
from operations targets for Build to Last 
Phase Two are as follows:
UK construction 2%-3%
US construction 1%-2%
Support Services 3%-5%
For Investments, which is an asset-based 
business, during Phase One there were 20 
partial or full disposals from the portfolio, 
all of which were at or above the Directors’ 
valuation. The liquidity which this provided to 
the Group was an integral part of the self-help 
Phase One of Build to Last. 
As Balfour Beatty’s financial performance 
continues its positive trajectory, the Group will 
have greater flexibility over the timing of the 
sale of infrastructure assets. During Phase 
Two of Build to Last, the Group will continue 
to sell these assets timed to maximise value 
to shareholders. There are not expected to be 
material disposals in the first half of 2017.
The trading environment in the Group’s core 
UK and US markets remains positive. In the 
UK, government policy is helping to drive a 
strong pipeline of major infrastructure projects 
in transport and energy. In the US, the new 
administration has made infrastructure one 
of its key priorities. This positive market 
backdrop supports the Group’s commitment 
to be more selective, targeting contracts 
with improved profitability and cash 
flow dynamics. 
By Phase Three (2019+), Balfour Beatty 
aims to command a premium to industry-
standard margins as market-leading 
strength should be matched by market-
leading performance.
Dividend
The Board took the decision to suspend 
the dividend in 2015, to ensure balance 
sheet strength was maintained during 
the initial stages of Build to Last. 
Following the demonstrable progress 
made by the Group in the first year of the 
transformation programme and in the 
expectation of further solid and measurable 
improvements, it was decided to reinstate 
the dividend at an appropriate level in 2016. 
Following the 0.9 pence per share 
dividend declared at the half year, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 1.8 pence per share, giving a total 
recommended dividend for the year of 2.7 
pence per share. The Board recognises the 
importance of dividends to shareholders 
and anticipates a progressive dividend 
policy going forward. 
Financial risk factors and going concern
The key financial risk factors for the Group 
remain largely unchanged. Some elements 
of the Group’s markets are recovering, 
and this can lead to increased risk of 
subcontractor failures, due to their cash 
requirements for increased working capital, 
and also the potential for inflationary 
pressures in some areas. On the other 
hand, this should also reduce pressure on 
bidding margins.
The Group’s US private placement and 
committed bank facilities contain certain 
financial covenants, such as the ratio of 
the Group’s EBITDA to its net debt which 
needs to be less than 3.0 and the ratio of its 
EBITA to net borrowing costs which needs 
to be in excess of 3.0. These covenants 
are tested on a rolling 12-month basis 
as at the June and December reporting 
dates. At 31 December 2016, both these 
covenants were passed as the Group had 
net cash and net interest income from a 
covenant test perspective. 
The Group is forecasting to remain 
within its banking covenants during 2017. 
While recognising that there can be no 
absolute certainty, the Directors believe 
that these covenant tests will be met.
The Directors have acknowledged the 
guidance ‘Going Concern and Liquidity 
Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK 
Companies 2009’ published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in October 
2009. In reviewing the future prospects 
of the Group, the following factors 
are relevant:
 – the Group has a strong order backlog
 – there continues to be underlying demand 
in infrastructure markets in the countries 
in which the Group operates
 – excluding the non-recourse net 
borrowings of PPP subsidiaries, 
the Group had net cash balances of 
£173 million at 31 December 2016 
 – the Group’s committed bank facility 
totals £400 million, of which £350 million 
was undrawn at 31 December 2016. 
Based on the above, and having made 
appropriate enquiries and reviewed 
medium-term cash forecasts, the Directors 
consider it reasonable to assume that the 
Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue for the foreseeable 
future and, for this reason, have continued 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
To appreciate the prospects for the Group 
as a whole, the complete Annual Report 
and Accounts 2016 needs to be read.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 53 Strategic Report Risk management framework
Strengthening our risk management culture continued
Significant steps were taken throughout 2016 to continue the evolution of the Group’s risk 
management processes. These actions included enhancements to risk assessment, leading 
to increased understanding of the principal risks and opportunities faced by the business 
and provided the context for more informed decision making across the Group.
The Group recognises that consistent and effective risk management is vital to the delivery 
of its strategic development and business objectives.
Oversight
Consistent with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Board has overall responsibility for risk management and determines the nature 
and extent of the principal risks to be taken as well as assessing the effectiveness 
of the risk management and internal control systems that are in place to 
mitigate impacts.
The main area of focus in 2016 was to build on the existing risk management 
framework and to increase the visibility of risk to senior leadership and the wider 
business as well as aligning the way in which assessment of risk is undertaken.
Common risk infrastructure
The Executive Risk Steering Group reports directly to the Group Chief Executive and 
has oversight of and monitors the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
process. Members of the steering group act as the executive sponsor for risk 
management within their business and functions and as such are in a position to 
directly influence custom and practice. In 2016 this steering group has overseen a 
comprehensive review and redrafting of the Group Risk Register which has been 
reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board and will drive 
business improvements throughout 2017. 
Risk process
A Group-wide Risk Management Community of Practice (CoP) is in place to provide 
cross-functional and business perspective on the practical implementation of 
risk management and provide practitioner level input to the Group Risk Register. 
Additionally the CoP provides a forum for sharing best practice, knowledge and 
collaboration on risk management across the functions and businesses.
A comprehensive training programme has been undertaken throughout the UK 
business during 2016. This has raised risk consciousness across the organisation 
and allowed risk management to be built into activities from project pursuit, through 
design, delivery and completion. 
Assessment
The Gated Lifecycle remains central to Balfour Beatty’s risk management process 
with a mandatory assessment of risk and risk appetite being made at each 
review gate. 
Work continues on the roll-out of project manager training delivered through the 
Balfour Beatty Academy, increased cascade and promotion of minimal commercial 
expectations and continued adherence to Group commercial policies and process.

The Group recognises that

risk management is vital to

Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
54 Risk appetite
The ongoing development of Balfour Beatty’s risk management processes has included an evaluation of the Group’s willingness to take risks 
based on informed decision making in order to meet strategic priorities. 
The Group’s risk appetite has been set in the context of the interaction between risk assessment processes and Balfour Beatty’s ability to 
mitigate and exert control over existing and emerging risks. 
Risk appetite within any organisation must be dynamic. Changes to the business environment and the Group’s strategic priorities will require 
a reassessment of tolerances. The tone and direction for any such revision is led by the Board and implemented by senior leaders and 
practitioners to ensure it is embedded in critical business processes.
Strategic priority – Build to Last

Committee
Risk description
Failure to identify, price, and execute the right volume 
and quality of bids and investment opportunities to 
maintain a profitable, sustainable order book and deliver 
value to stakeholders. 
Causes
Inaccuracy in:
 – assumptions behind investment decisions 
 – costs versus scope calculations
 – project duration estimates
 – assessment of the impact of inflation
 – contract management
 – negotiation of terms
 – Quick Qualifier assumptions
 – assessment of customers’ liquidity/credit worthiness
 – assessment of joint venture partners.
What impact it might have
Failure to estimate accurately the risks, costs versus 
scope, time to complete, impact of inflation and 
contractual terms and how best to manage them could 
cause financial losses.
In the event of disagreement with, failure of, or poor 
delivery performance by a joint venture partner, the 
Group could face financial and reputational risks.
If any of the assumptions behind investment decisions 
prove incorrect, the profitability of those investments 
could be reduced.
How it is mitigated
Consistent and shared policies and minimum 
commercial expectations including acceptable margins. 
A wide and ongoing range of training initiatives across 
all disciplines within the Group including Cash is our 
Compass and High Value Selling to drive increased 
commercial awareness and an understanding of 
expectations on margins and cost.
All bids are subject to rigorous estimating and tendering 
processes as part of the gateway review process.
Defined delegated authority levels are in place for 
approving all tenders and infrastructure investments.
Reviews are conducted following all tenders to ensure 
lessons are learnt and applied to future tenders.
Before entering into a joint venture agreement, the 
Group reviews the relevant skills, experience, resources 
and values of joint venture partners to understand how 
they complement its own.
Investment appraisals are performed and reviewed by 
experienced professionals. The Group analyses the 
risks associated with revenues and costs and, where 
appropriate, establishes contractual and other risk 
mitigations.
Build to Last pillar:

The Board has made a robust assessment of the principal risks which the Group faces, the controls in place to remove or mitigate these 
risks and also whether these risks represent new, increased or decreased threats. The assessment of these risks and controls is part of the 
ongoing management of the business.
The principal risks that could adversely impact the Group’s profitability and ability to achieve its strategic objectives are set out below.

Owner: 
Safety and

Committee
Risk description
The Group works on significant, complex and 
potentially hazardous projects which require continuous 
monitoring and management of health and safety risks.
Causes
Some common themes where health and safety 
risks have arisen are recognised and communicated, 
including:
 – poor risk identification/assessment
 – having processes that fail to promote risk elimination 
or mitigation
 – failure to deliver leadership
 – management of subcontractors
 – not briefing people properly before setting them  
to work
 – failure to follow procedures
 – debarment for safety failures
 – ongoing change programme and performance 
pressures, which may have an effect on people  
and their ability to remain focused on health and 
safety risks.
What impact it might have
Failure to manage these risks gives the potential for 
significant harm to, or even the death of, employees, 
subcontractor staff or members of the public, as well as 
the potential for criminal prosecutions, significant fines, 
debarment and reputational damage.
How it is mitigated
Balfour Beatty has detailed health and safety policies 
and procedures to minimise such risks. These are 
reviewed and monitored by management and external 
verification bodies.
Each business has experienced health and safety 
professionals in place who provide advice and support 
and undertake regular reviews.
The Safety and Sustainability Committee of the Board, 
as well as business-level Health and Safety executive 
leadership teams, meet regularly throughout the year 
to develop a consistent approach to health and safety 
best practice.
Training programmes (including behavioural)  
are in place.
Zero Harm action plans continue to be implemented.

delivery performance by a joint venture partner, the 
Group could face financial and reputational risks.
If any of the assumptions behind investment decisions 
prove incorrect, the profitability of those investments 
could be reduced.
How it is mitigated
Consistent and shared policies and minimum 
commercial expectations including acceptable margins. 
A wide and ongoing range of training initiatives across 
all disciplines within the Group including Cash is our 
Compass and High Value Selling to drive increased 
commercial awareness and an understanding of 
expectations on margins and cost.
All bids are subject to rigorous estimating and tendering 
processes as part of the gateway review process.
Defined delegated authority levels are in place for 
approving all tenders and infrastructure investments.
Reviews are conducted following all tenders to ensure 
lessons are learnt and applied to future tenders.
Before entering into a joint venture agreement, the 
Group reviews the relevant skills, experience, resources 
and values of joint venture partners to understand how 
they complement its own.
Investment appraisals are performed and reviewed by 
experienced professionals. The Group analyses the 
risks associated with revenues and costs and, where 
appropriate, establishes contractual and other risk 
mitigations.

Risk description
Failure to deliver projects at the required specification 
on time and on budget to meet the expectations of 
customers and minimise the risk of defect liability.
Causes
Failure to implement, maintain and challenge 
operational and commercial controls (as detailed within 
checklists at Gate reviews (4-6)) allowing:
 – unrealistic programming targets
 – unrealistic progress assessments and cost to 
complete judgements
 – optimistic claims recovery assumptions
 – incomplete visibility and appreciation of scale  
of commercial judgements
 – inaccurate and/or incomplete cost and value data or 
failure to analyse and report correctly, which could 
arise due to poor training, lack of supervision, lack  
of accountability or fear of reporting bad news.
What impact it might have
Failure to manage or deliver against contracted 
customer requirements on time, on budget and to 
an appropriate quality could result in issues such as 
contract disputes, rejected claims, design issues, 
liquidated damages, cost overruns or failure to achieve 
customer savings – which in turn harm Balfour Beatty’s 
profitability and reputation.
The Group may also be exposed to long-term 
obligations including litigation and costs to rectify 
defective or unsafe work.
Execution failure on a high-profile project could result in 
significant reputational damage and costs.
How it is mitigated
An increased focus on identifying and reporting risks, 
including the accuracy of cost and cash forecasting.
Consistent application of strong commercial 
management and contract administration processes.
Targeted recruitment of key staff within project delivery 
teams and senior management, together with ongoing 
and focused training of staff.

Uncertainty 
within our

environment
  Inc rea s e d  
risk 
Owner: 
The Board
Risk description
The effects of national or market trends, political 
change (including the UK’s exit from the EU and 
the change of administration in the US), or new 
developments in infrastructure expenditure or 
procurement may cause customers to re-evaluate 
existing or future projects.
Causes
The business may not be effective in managing the 
uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK’s exit from 
the EU or anticipating or assessing broader national 
or market events and developments. Failure to plan 
for any potentially negative impacts, or to capture any 
opportunities that may be presented could lead to:
 – cash pressures for customers and suppliers
 – wider than expected fluctuations in inflation
 – increased competition (eg in the UK from foreign 
investors acquiring competitors)
 – increased supply chain risks (eg solvency, people  
and materials)
 – reduced revenue or pressure on margins.
What impact it might have
Any significant changes in the level or timing of 
customer spending or investment plans could adversely 
impact the Group’s strategy, business model, revenue 
or profitability in the short or medium term. Such 
changes could arise from changes in government policy 
or customers’ failure to secure financing for future 
projects or for future stages of existing projects.
Restrictions to the availability of skilled labour and 
competitively priced materials will lead to a loss 
of competitive advantage and a devaluation of the 
business.
Financial failure of a customer, including any 
government or public sector body, could result in not 
collecting amounts owed.
How it is mitigated
The Group’s strategy to focus on the more resilient and 
stable infrastructure markets and geographies will help 
mitigate this risk. The effect of spending changes in any 
one market is mitigated by the Group’s broad exposure 
to infrastructure markets and the continued need for 
infrastructure spending. Balfour Beatty also mitigates 
the effects of such market conditions by continuing to 
adapt its business model.
The Group is actively monitoring the potential 
impacts of the UK exiting the EU including potential 
market stimulation by the UK Government, freedom 
of movement, finance costs, exchange rates and 
commodity prices. A dedicated Group-wide forum is 
in place for this purpose and a key strategy document 
(Infrastructure 2050) has been shared with the UK 
Government and wider industry.
The financial solvency and strength of counterparties 
is always considered before contracts are signed 
and such assessments are updated and reviewed 
whenever possible during the project lifecycle. The 
business also seeks to ensure that it is not over-reliant 
on any one counterparty.

Risk description
Supply chain partners are not able to meet the Group’s 
operational expectations and requirements including 
availability, financial stability, technical ability, quality, 
safety, environmental, social and ethical.
Causes
 – Supply chain failure risk, exacerbated during, and 
when emerging from, tough economic conditions
 – Over-reliance on a limited number of suppliers
 – Retention of subcontracted parties in buoyant 
markets
 – Inadequate assessment of supply chain partner 
capabilities and process (including safety, ethics, 
quality, material stewardship, child labour, forced 
labour and modern slavery)
 – Failure to accurately assess project resource 
requirements and key deliverables
 – Unethical treatment of the supply chain.
What impact it might have
Failure of a subcontractor or supplier would result in the 
Group having to find a replacement or undertaking the 
task itself. This could result in delays, additional costs or 
a reduction in quality owing to lack of expertise.
Mistreatment of suppliers, subcontractors and their 
staff, or poor ethical standards in the supply chain, 
could lead to legal proceedings, investigations or 
disputes resulting in business disruption, losses, fines 
and penalties, reputational damage and debarment.
How it is mitigated
The Group aims to develop long-term relationships 
with key subcontractors, working closely with them to 
understand their operations and dependencies.
Contingency plans in place to address subcontractor 
failure including replacement supplier list.

to risk 
Owner: 
The Board
Risk description
The traction gained in embedding the policies, process, 
and practices of Build to Last is lost and potential 
benefits are not realised.
Causes
To enable the transformation programme to succeed, a 
culture of adhering to the Build to Last principles must 
be embedded.
Failing to embed this culture could result from:
 – ineffective communication plans
 – inadequate resourcing (financial, physical and people) 
 – employee fatigue with change programme and loss 
of focus owing to a perceived high number and 
frequency of new initiatives
 – new systems and processes being used without 
appropriate controls being in place and/or tested.
What impact it might have
Failure to build fully upon the foundations of Build 
to Last could result in the Group’s ability to return to 
sustained profit and viability being jeopardised.
How it is mitigated
The success of Build to Last is a strategic priority 
for the Group and is being led by the Group Chief 
Executive.
The programme is being delivered in several phases 
and required controls and resources have been well 
considered. 
Controls include:
 – the Build to Last culture is now well embedded 
within each business unit
 – senior leadership communication across the 
businesses is clear and frequent
 – new systems and processes are deployed with 
training plans
 – employee surveys form a key part of the programme
 – leaders throughout the business frequently monitor 
the delivery and impacts of the programme
 – senior leadership is well experienced in delivering 
business transformation successfully.

Risk description
Inability of the Group to maintain the financial strength 
required to operate its business and deliver its 
objectives.
Causes
Failure to manage financial risks and the financial 
resources of the Group that underpin its ability to:
 – meet ongoing liquidity obligations so that it remains a 
going concern
 – meet financial covenants as set out in financing 
facility agreements
 – maintain the confidence of customers and key 
markets and therefore continue to win long-term 
contracts.
What impact it might have
Failure to effectively deliver the required financial 
strength will mean the Group:
 – fails to meet financial covenant tests, as set out in 
its financing facility agreements, that would lead to 
an event of default if not remedied within a specific 
grace period
 – fails to pass the required tests that allow it to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
preparing the financial statements
 – loses the ability to compete for key long-term 
contracts that are critical to the delivery of its long-
term objectives and viability. 
How it is mitigated
The Group operates with a centralised treasury function 
that is responsible for managing key financial risks, 
cash resources and the availability of liquidity and credit 
capacity. 
The Group maintains significant undrawn term 
committed bank facilities with a banking group of high 
credit-quality to underpin the liquidity requirements of 
the Group.

Owner: 
The Board
Risk description
The Group remains exposed to significant defined 
benefit pension risks.
Causes
The size of the Group’s legacy pension obligations is 
largely related to the investment performance of the 
assets held in the pension funds, net of the change in 
the value of the funds’ liabilities. The latter are typically 
related to changes in the long-term outlook for interest 
rates, inflation and life expectancy.
The size of the obligations could also be adversely 
influenced by intervention from regulators or legislators.

Failure to manage these risks adequately could lead 
to the Group being exposed to significant additional 
liabilities.
How it is mitigated
The Group constructively engages with the trustees 
of the pension funds to ensure that the funds’ assets

likelihood of an unexpected cost to the Company.

or corruption, whether by its own staff or via third 
parties such as agents, partners or subcontractors. 
Those risks are higher in some countries and sectors. 
Overall, the construction industry has a higher risk 
profile than other industries.
Causes
 – Corruption
 – Bribery
 – Fraud/false claims
 – Unfair competition
 – Human rights abuses, such as child and other 
labour standards generally, illegal workers, human 
trafficking and modern slavery
 – Unethical treatment of and by the supply chain
 – Other emerging ethical risks
 – Risk of ethics and values being compromised when 
times are tough, not just in high-risk markets.
What impact it might have
Failure by the Group, or employees and third parties 
acting on its behalf or in partnership, to observe the 
highest standards of integrity and conduct could result 
in litigation, civil and/or criminal penalties, debarment 
and reputational damage.
How it is mitigated
Group-wide Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of 
Conduct, and related policies and procedures in place.
The Business Integrity function promotes, monitors, 
assesses awareness of and provides training on, the 
Code of Conduct. The function reports to the Audit and 
Risk Committee and has the full support of the Board.
Each business unit, supported by the Business Integrity 
function, is responsible for embedding the Code of

The Group has a range of risk assessment, due 
diligence and procurement controls that are designed to 
identify and manage risks with third parties. 
Independent third-party whistleblowing hotline and 
dedicated email are in place and actively promoted. All 
in-scope complaints are independently investigated by 
the Business Integrity function and appropriate action is 
taken, where necessary.

Balfour Beatty also faces significant risks

hazard risks.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, 
the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period to 
31 December 2019. The Directors consider 
this period to be appropriate because this 
is the period aligned to the current order 
book or for which there is a good pipeline 
of potential new projects. This period 
also allows greater certainty over the 
forecasting assumptions used in labour 
and material pricing, skills and availability. 
Consequently, the Group performs its 
medium-term planning over three years.
In its assessment of the viability of the 
Group, the Directors have considered the 
need to be successful in implementing 
the Group’s Build to Last programme and 
focus on strategic priorities of Lean, Expert, 
Trusted and Safe detailed on pages 12 to 
17, as well as each of the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties detailed on pages 
56 to 65. The Directors have considered 
the impact of a number of severe but 
plausible scenarios, based on the Group’s 
principal risks, which would result in 
a reduction in revenue, a reduction in 
margin, an increase in operating costs and 
a slowdown in the Group’s investments 
disposal programme. The Directors have 
also considered the Group’s income and 
expenditure projections, the Group’s 
projected cash position, bank facilities 
and their maturity profile and covenants, 
the borrowing powers allowed under the 
Company’s Articles of Association and 
the fact that the Group’s PPP investments 
comprise reasonably realisable securities 
which can be sold to meet funding 
requirements if necessary.
Based on the Group’s processes for 
monitoring operating costs, managing 
Group performance, asset allocation, the 
portfolio risk profile, gearing, counterparty 
exposure, liquidity risk and financial 
controls, the Directors have concluded 
that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period until 
31 December 2019.

deliver on our specific targets 
for this year.
Philip Aiken AM
Chairman
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
66 Leadership
The Board is collectively responsible for 
setting and upholding high standards 
of corporate governance including the 
way the Group conducts its business, 
its approach to ethical matters, and the 
definition of acceptable risk in delivering the 
Group’s strategy and value creation for its 
shareholders. It is committed to providing 
effective leadership by ensuring that 
those governance principles are adhered 
to throughout the Group, supported by 
an effective framework of systems and 
controls which define clearly delegations of 
authority and accountabilities.
In my report last year I referred to the 
appointment of a new leadership team 
at both Board and executive level. 
The process of upgrading the executive 
leadership has continued through 2016. It is 
however with great sadness that I have to 
mention the untimely death on 1 July 2016 
of Graham Roberts who for many years 
chaired the Audit and Risk Committee. 
The breadth of skills represented on 
the Board however facilitated a smooth 
transition of responsibility for that important 
role to Stephen Billingham.
As Chairman, it is my role to ensure that 
the executive leadership and the Board 
are able to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively and, within that, I have 
responsibility to ensure that a robust 
succession plan is in place to cover 
all eventualities. 
Maureen Kempston Darkes, who has 
served as a Director since July 2012 and 
chair of the Safety and Sustainability 
Committee, will not be seeking re-election 
at the AGM this year. We are actively 
engaged in recruiting three Directors, 
two of whom will replace Maureen 
and Graham. 
Each of the Directors brings skills and 
experiences which enhance the quality 
of debate in the boardroom and in the 
case of the Directors provides additionally, 
guidance and challenge to the executive 
Directors. The Directors believe that 
the Board provides effective leadership. 
Details of the Directors are set out on 
pages 68 and 69.
Diversity
In seeking to recruit new Directors with 
relevant experience, we ask search firms to 
identify suitable female candidates. We do 
not however believe in gender quotas, 
preferring to appoint individuals based 
on merit. Diversity and inclusion are key 
components of our talent management  
and development programmes, details 
of which can be found on the website 
balfourbeatty.com.
Accountability
We believe that Balfour Beatty’s 
processes and procedures have been 
further strengthened during the year with 
the development of a single reference 
library for all aspects of UK business 
practice and ever greater harmonisation 
of HR systems and of financial reporting 
platforms, enabling the Board to present 
a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s trading position 
and its prospects. We continue to keep 
under review the matters reserved to 
the Board and the terms of reference of 
its Committees. Copies can be found on 
the website.
Remuneration
The remuneration policy was last approved 
by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
At the AGM in May 2017, we will revert 
to shareholders with proposed changes. 
Details of the revised remuneration policy 
and how we intend to operate that policy 
in 2017 can be found in the Remuneration 
report on pages 84 to 99.
Relations with shareholders
Our investor relations programme is of 
critical importance to the Board through 
this period of transformation for Balfour 
Beatty. The Board routinely receives 
reports from the investor relations team 
and analysts, together with feedback from 
any meetings which the Directors have 
with institutional investors. As Chairman, 
I seek to meet, at least annually, with 
representatives of the UK Shareholders 
Association. We recognise the AGM as an 
important opportunity for private investors 
to engage with the Board. All resolutions 
will, however, be put to a poll rather than a 
show of hands to ensure that shareholders 
who are not able to attend the meeting 
have their votes fully taken into account.

Board and Committee meetings
Procedures for Board meetings remain largely unchanged from

a good information flow and that Board procedures are properly 
followed. He is available to individual Directors for advice on 
Board procedures.
Details of the number of meetings of the Board and its Committees 
held during the year and attendance of Directors thereat are set out 
on page 71. Outside the formal schedule of meetings, the non-
executive Directors met without the executive Directors present on 
a number of occasions. Meetings are normally held at one of the 
Company’s London offices.
All non-executive Directors receive papers for every Committee 
meeting and where not a member, have an open invitation to 
attend any Committee meeting. A number of the Directors took 
this opportunity during the year.
Board and Committee meetings typically take place over two 
consecutive days with the first day allocated to Committee 
meetings and ending with a ‘Focus’ presentation by a member 
of the leadership team. The agenda for the Board meetings will 
usually include a ‘deep dive’ presentation from one of the business 
units as well as focusing on key priorities for the Group, including:
 – progress with the Build to Last transformation programme
 – strategy and budgets
 – operating structures, processes and costs
 – the Group’s financial performance

The number shown in brackets is the total number of meetings the Director could attend during the year (including as a result of changes to Committee memberships). 
Non-attendance at meetings was due to illness. In each case, where the Directors have not been able to attend a Board or Committee meeting, they have reviewed the papers 
circulated for that meeting and provided their comments directly to the Chairman, or the Committee chair, as appropriate.
Directors’ independence
At its meeting in January 2017, the Board considered the 
independence of the non-executive Directors against the criteria 
specified in the Code and determined that each of them continues 
to be independent.
A non-exhaustive list of the key strengths of the Directors is set out 
in the table below. Details of their service agreements, emoluments 
and share incentives are shown in the Remuneration report starting 
on page 84.
Following the performance evaluations of each of the non-executive 
Directors, it is confirmed that the performance of each continues to 
be effective and demonstrates commitment to the role.
Responsibility and delegation
The Board is responsible for the success of the Company and has a 
formal schedule of matters reserved for its decision which includes 
the matters summarised below:
 – determining the Group’s strategic direction
 – approving annual budgets and financial reporting, including the 
annual and half-year results and interim management statements
 – approving interim, and recommending final, dividends
 – approving major acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure
 – ensuring the necessary financial and human resources 
are in place to achieve objectives and review 
management performance
 – setting the Company’s values and ethical standards
 – approving policies and systems for risk management 
and assurance.
The Board reviewed its list of reserved matters, most recently, at its 
meeting in January 2017. The full list and the terms of reference of 
the Board Committees are available on the Company’s website: 
 www.balfourbeatty.com/investors

Induction
Directors undertake a thorough induction programme and receive 
a range of information about the Company when they join the 
Board, including access to a portal on which all Board papers are 
stored, Balfour Beatty’s Code of Conduct and processes for dealing 
in Balfour Beatty shares. In addition, they take part in a series of 
one-to-one meetings with other members of the Board, senior 
executives in the businesses and the Company’s external advisers, 
which include briefings on the Company’s business strategy, 
financial procedures, business development, legal and other 
key issues.
The Directors’ induction programme also provides the foundation 
for continuing professional development. This takes place 
throughout the year by way of a series of internal and external 
updates, including visits to operating companies to meet local 
management and visits to Balfour Beatty projects, both in the UK 
and overseas.
Professional development
In discussion with the Directors and Company Secretary, each year 
the Chairman determines whether there are any specific training 
needs identified by the Directors, which can be addressed either 
by the topic being included at a future Board meeting or on a one-
to-one basis. Directors are also enrolled in the Deloitte Academy, 
a seminar-led programme for directors of UK listed companies, 
which provides regular updates throughout the year on the principal 
governance and other matters of which directors of a listed 
company should be fully aware.
Board evaluation
Introduction
In keeping with the Code, the Board undertakes external 
evaluations, typically every three years, with internal evaluations 
in the intervening two years. The most recent external evaluation 
was carried out in early 2016, in respect of 2015, by Lintstock, an 
external facilitator. For 2016, the evaluation has been conducted 
using internal resources and considered the performance of 
the Board and its Committees, as well as the Chairman and 
individual Directors.
2016 evaluation
All Board members were requested to complete a questionnaire, 
the responses to which were reviewed and summarised by the 
Company Secretary and the Chairman. The emerging key themes 
were discussed with each Director individually, and presented to 
the Board for discussion in November 2016. 
The survey was tailored to the specific circumstances of Balfour 
Beatty and covered the composition, expertise and dynamics of 
the Board, the Board’s management of time, the support afforded 
to the Board, the Board’s oversight of strategy, risk and human 
resources, and priorities for change. The responses to the survey 
were unattributed.
Key conclusions from the evaluation
Overall ratings across most of the areas on which views were 
canvassed, showed an improvement year on year. The non-
executive Directors continue to enhance their understanding of 
the business, including by making regular visits to project sites 
throughout the UK and overseas and are individually and collectively 
involved in project reviews. An additional item has been added to 
the Board agenda to provide the non-executive Directors with an 
opportunity to give timely, verbal reports on their site visits and 
project reviews. The Board also committed to undertake at least 
one visit to the US each year, combining a series of presentations 
by the US leadership team with site visits.

72 Risk management and internal control
Risk management
Effective risk management underpins the delivery of the Group’s 
objectives and is an essential element of meeting the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. By identifying and 
managing risk, the business is better able to protect its reputation, 
ensure long-term viability and generate sustainable shareholder 
value. Balfour Beatty identifies key risks at an early stage and 
applies mitigations within a strong internal control environment 
to eliminate them or mitigate their impact and likelihood to an 
acceptable level. For more information, refer to pages 53 to 65.
The Board has applied principle C2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code by embedding continuous risk management 
processes throughout the Group at all levels which form an integral 
part of day-to-day business activity. 
Roles and responsibilities
The Board is responsible for the implementation and oversight of 
Balfour Beatty’s system of risk management and internal control. 
It sets the Group’s appetite for and attitude to risk in pursuit of 
its strategic objectives and therefore the level of risk that can be 
taken by Group, strategic business unit and individual business 
unit management without specific Board approval. Group policies, 
procedures and delegated authority levels set by the Board provide 
the means by which risks are reviewed and escalated to the 
appropriate level within the Group, up to and including the Board, 
for consideration and approval.
The roles and responsibilities of the Board, its Committees, 
strategic business unit and individual business unit management 
are set out below.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 73 Strategic Report Effectiveness continued
Risk management process
Balfour Beatty’s risk management policy requires that all 
business units ensure that effective controls are established and 
implemented for the management of risk.
Identified risk events, their causes and possible consequences 
are recorded in risk registers, together with assessments of their 
likelihood and potential business impact. The controls in place to 
manage each risk event are assessed for effectiveness and, if 
required, additional actions are developed to bring exposure within 
the Group’s risk appetite. Each risk is allocated to a specific risk 
owner who is given the responsibility to manage the risk and its 
controls within an agreed timeframe.
For new projects, an assessment of risk forms a key part of the 
work winning Gates (1–4) within the Gated Lifecycle process 
(page 53) and risks are continuously assessed as projects evolve 
and progress.
Additionally the Board sets and regularly reviews delegated 
authority levels which act as triggers for matters requiring senior 
management or Board approval. In relation to work winning, this 
means that projects above a certain value, or those that import 
particular uncertainties such as a move into new markets, require 
approval by the Group Tender and Investment Committee.
Reporting structures ensure that risks are monitored continually, 
mitigation plans are reviewed and significant exposures are 
escalated – from project level through the appropriate business unit 
review stages and, as appropriate, to Group senior management.
Further improvements to the risk management framework have 
been made throughout 2016 including significant strengthening 
to the process of assessing, managing and reporting risk. 
This progress is detailed on pages 53 to 55. Increased rigour within 
risk management will continue in 2017 with renewed focus on 
risk impact quantification and escalation. These enhancements 
alongside the ongoing co-ordination between project, contract 
and business level risk analysis continue to drive risk awareness 
and culture. 
Internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management systems and internal control, and regularly reviews 
their effectiveness.
The Group’s systems and controls are designed to ensure that 
the Group’s exposure to significant risk is managed appropriately. 
The Board recognises that any system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. In addition, not all the material joint ventures in which the 
Group is involved are treated, for these purposes, as part of the 
Group. Where they are not, systems of internal control and risk 
management are applied as agreed between the partners to the 
joint venture.
Central to the Group’s systems of internal control are its processes 
and framework for risk management. These align with Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting and were in place throughout 2016 and up to 
the date of signing this report.
Guidance and policies have been issued and are continuously 
monitored to provide an interlinked and comprehensive internal 
control environment. Such topics include but are not limited to:
 – a clear system of delegated authorities from the Board to 
management with certain matters reserved by the Board
 – the annual review of the strategy and plans of each business 
and of the Group as a whole in order to identify the risks to 
the Group’s achievement of its overall objectives and, where 
appropriate, any relevant mitigating actions
 – monthly financial reporting against budgets and the review of 
results and forecasts by executive Directors and management, 
including particular areas of business or project risk. This is used 
to update management’s understanding of the environment in 
which the Group operates and the methods used to mitigate and 
control the risks identified
 – specific policies set out in the Group Finance Manual covering 
the financial management of the Group, including arrangements 
with the Group’s bankers and bond providers, controls on 
foreign exchange dealings and management of currency and 
interest rate exposures, application of accounting policies and 
financial controls
 – Group-wide risk management standards which are embedded 
throughout the Group
 – gateway reviews requiring risk, uncertainty and control 
assessment at all stages of project development and at all levels 
of the business from business unit level to Board Committee if 
value, or perceived exposure, exceeds certain thresholds
 – reviews and tests by the internal audit function of critical business 
financial processes and controls and specific reviews in areas of 
perceived high business risk
 – reviews and authorises proposed investment, divestment 
and capital expenditure through the Board’s Committees and 
the Board
 – regular reporting, monitoring and review of the effectiveness 
of health, safety, environment and sustainability processes. 
These processes are subject to independent audit and 
certification to internationally recognised standards as appropriate
 – legal compliance risks which are addressed through specific 
policies and training on such matters as ethics, competition and 
data protection laws
 – promotion of a culture of compliance with ethics and integrity 
responsibilities to help manage legal and reputational risks across 
the Group. An ethics helpline has been established to encourage 
staff to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible breaches of 
the Code of Conduct.
These systems are extended, as soon as possible and as 
appropriate, to all businesses joining the Group.
The Group also has an independent internal audit function that 
executes a risk-based programme of audit throughout the entire 
Group. All audit reports are shared with relevant business leaders in 
addition to being scrutinised by the Audit and Risk Committee (see 
pages 75 to 77).
It is the expectation and requirement of the Board that business 
leaders ensure that this comprehensive internal control 
environment (including internal audit) is embedded within their 
business units. 
The Board continued to assess the effectiveness of the risk 
management processes and internal controls during 2016 and to 
the date of this report. Such assessment is based on reports made 
to the Board, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Safety and 
Sustainability Committee, including:
 – the results of the internal audit function’s reviews of internal 
financial controls
 – a Group-wide certification that effective internal controls had 
been maintained or, where any significant non-compliance or 
breakdown had occurred with or without loss, that appropriate 
remedial action has been or is being taken
 – a paper prepared by management on the nature, extent 
and mitigation of significant risks and on the systems of 
internal controls.
Principal risks
The principal risks that could adversely impact on the Group’s 
profitability and ability to achieve its strategic objectives are set 
out on pages 56 to 65.

by the Board as having recent and relevant financial experience.
Partners from the external auditor, the Group Risk and Audit 
Director, the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer 
regularly attend meetings. The Committee also invites divisional 
leaders and specialists relevant to the Committee’s agenda.
Summary of activities in 2016
In 2016, the Committee’s work programme focused on a number 
of significant issues and other accounting judgements where 
the Committee believed the highest level of judgement was 
required and with the highest potential impact on the Group’s 
financial statements. Further information is set out on page 76. 
The Committee’s standing agenda items comprised reports on:
 – accounting, financial and regulatory issues
 – review of non-audit work carried out by the external auditors,  
and their fees
 – risk management activities and compliance
 – implementation of and progress against the Group Internal 
Audit Plan.
The Committee is able to question management at both Group and 
business unit levels to gain further insight into the issues addressed 
in these reports. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
Following the introduction of the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, the Board has 
been mindful of the continuing need to provide a balanced and 
comprehensive analysis of the Company’s development and 
performance during the year and the position at the year end, 
including the use of alternative performance measures. The Audit 
and Risk Committee has assisted in achieving this objective by 
reviewing proposals for the internal procedures to be applied in 
preparing the Annual Report.
Viability statement
Following the revision to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published in September 2014, the Audit and Risk Committee has 
assisted in reviewing the viability of the Group over the longer term 
as part of its assessment of the Group’s risks.
  See page 65 for further details
The Audit and Risk Committee plays a key role 
in overseeing the Group’s financial reporting and 
risk management processes. We are committed 
to ensuring that the Group’s financial reporting 
is accurate, high-quality and clear, to allow 
shareholders to properly understand the Group’s 
performance and financial position.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 75 Strategic Report Significant issues and other accounting judgements
Revenue and margin 
recognition
Given the nature of the Group’s operations, these elements are central to how it values its work. 
Having reviewed detailed reports and met with management, the Committee considered contract and 
commercial issues with exposure to both revenue and margin recognition risks. As a key area of audit 
focus, the Committee also received a detailed written report from the external auditor setting out the 
results of its work in relation to key contract judgements. 
Carrying value of 
goodwill and other 
intangibles
The judgement largely relates to the assumptions underlying the value in use of the cash-generating units, 
primarily the achievement of the three-year strategic plan and the macroeconomic assumptions (such as 
discount rates) underpinning the valuation process. The Committee received reports from management 
outlining the impairment model and the assumptions used; in addition, the external auditor provided 
detailed written reports in this area. 
Going concern and 
viability statement
In order to satisfy itself that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future and that there are no material uncertainties that could lead to significant doubt as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Committee considered the Group’s viability statement, 
cash position (both existing and projected), bank facilities and covenants (including bonding lines) and the 
borrowing powers allowed under the Company’s Articles of Association. The Committee subsequently 
recommended to the Board the adoption of the going concern statement and the viability statement for 
inclusion in the Annual Report. More details on going concern and the viability statement are contained on 
pages 52 and 65.
Non-underlying items The key judgement is whether items relate to underlying trading or not and whether they have been 
presented in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. The Committee conducted a review of each 
of the non-underlying items, receiving written reports from management and the external auditor as to 
their quantum and nature. 
Provisions The Committee reviewed the significant judgements relating to provisions, including litigation and other 
risks. The Committee received detailed reports, including relevant legal advice.
Retirement benefits The key judgement relates to the assumptions underlying the valuation of the retirement benefit 
obligations. The Committee received reports from management outlining the assumptions used, including 
input from the Group’s actuaries, in particular in relation to discount rates, inflation and mortality which 
were evaluated against external benchmarks and, in relation to which, the external auditor also provided 
reports.
Deferred tax assets The Committee reviewed the Group’s considerations on future profitability to evaluate the judgement that 
it is probable the deferred tax assets are recoverable.
Directors’ valuation of 
the Investments portfolio
The Committee assessed the methodology used to value the assets in terms of the discount rates 
applied. It also critically appraised the output of the Directors’ valuation exercise.
Areas of focus in 2017
In 2017, the Committee will continue to address the topics on its 
standing agenda as well as continuing to undertake reviews of the 
risk management and assurance practices across the Group on a 
rolling programme. The Committee will also continue to receive 
any necessary training in order to broaden and refresh the skills and 
knowledge of its members. The Committee will also focus on the 
Group’s progress on the implementation of IFRS 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers and the impact of this new standard to 
the Group’s results.
Risk management and internal control
The risk management and internal control framework now 
comprises a number of approval and review gates that cover the 
business lifecycle from initial project pursuit through to delivery 
and completion. These processes are underpinned by common 
minimum standards in project and commercial management 
and are under constant review to ensure their effectiveness 
and compliance.
Internal auditor effectiveness
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function on an ongoing basis. This is achieved, in part, by reviewing 
and discussing the reports presented to it at each meeting, setting 
out the function’s work and findings, but also through a formal 
annual assessment. An independent periodic review of the internal 
audit function, as well as a thorough self-assessment scorecard 
drawn up in accordance with best practice guidelines, also helps 
contribute to the Committee’s evaluation.
Accountability continued
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
76 External auditor independence and effectiveness
The Committee carries out a formal review each year to assess the 
independence and effectiveness of the external auditor, KPMG. 
The Committee has satisfied itself as to KPMG’s independence. 
In reaching its conclusion, the Committee took into consideration 
the following matters:
Non-audit work
The objective set out in the Company’s policy is to ensure that the 
external auditor is not placed in a position where its independence 
is, or might be seen to be, compromised. Under no circumstances 
will any assignment be given to the external auditor, when the 
result is that:
 – it audits its own work
 – it makes management decisions on behalf of the Group
 – it acts as advocate for the Group
 – a mutuality of interest is created.
The Company’s policy identifies the various types of non-audit 
services and determines the analysis to be undertaken, and level 
of authority required, before the external auditor can be considered 
to undertake such services. For any non-audit services (which are 
not excluded under the policy), the policy provides for approval 
by the Chief Financial Officer of expenditure below £250,000, 
and approval by the chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee 
of expenditure above £250,000. A report is also submitted to the 
Committee of any non-audit services carried out by the external 
auditor, irrespective of value. The aggregated spend on non-audit 
services with the external auditor will not exceed 60% of the Group 
audit fee, unless exceptional circumstances exist, with a three-year 
rolling average not exceeding 70% of the Group audit fee.
During 2016, there were fees of £0.5 million (2015: £0.7 million) 
paid to the external auditor for non-audit services. 2016 non-audit 
services primarily related to the half-year review. Audit fees for 2016 
were £2m. Further details of the 2016 amounts are included in Note 
6.2 of the accounts.
There is no inconsistency between the Financial Reporting 
Council’s ethical standards and the Company’s policy.
The Committee considers that the Company receives particular 
benefits, including those relating to cost, quality and consistency, 
from the advice provided by its external auditor, given its wide and 
detailed knowledge of the Group and its international operations. 
There can also be savings in management time and accelerated 
delivery of work in situations where rapid turnaround is required.
45% by value of non-audit related work provided by international 
accounting firms in 2016 was carried out by firms other 
than KPMG.
Annual assessment of the audit process
In addition to receiving written reports from the auditors (both 
internal and external) and management, the Committee also 
conducted separate private meetings with the external auditors 
and with management. These provide the opportunity for open 
dialogue and feedback on the audit process, the responsiveness 
of management and the effectiveness of individual internal and 
external audit teams.
A detailed assessment of the external audit process and 
the effectiveness of the external auditor, together with any 
identified improvement recommendations, is prepared each 
year. Each strategic business unit within the Group is required 
to evaluate the performance of the assigned external audit team 
and to compare that performance against the previous year. 
This assessment has taken into account the issues which have 
been raised during 2016.
The external auditor’s annual transparency report for the year ended 
31 May 2016 was reviewed. This was prepared in accordance with 
the provisions of the Statutory Auditors (Transparency) Instrument 
2008 made by the Professional Oversight Board of the Financial 
Reporting Council.
External auditor rotation
As reported last year, KPMG were selected as the Company’s 
auditor for the year ending 31 December 2016, following a 
competitive tender process, and were duly appointed at the AGM 
on 19 May 2016. The external auditors are required to rotate the 
lead partner every five years. Such changes are carefully planned 
to ensure business continuity without undue risk or inefficiency. 
KPMG’s lead partner will complete his first year in May 2017.
The EU Audit Directive on audit tendering took effect from June 
2016 and its key aspects include:
 – audit firms will have a maximum tenure of 10 years, although the 
UK Government proposes to allow an extension of (i) up to an 
additional 10 years where a public tender is carried out after 10 
years; or (ii) by an additional 14 years where more than one audit 
firm is appointed to carry out the audit
 – audit firms are to be prohibited from providing certain non-audit 
services and where non-audit services are provided they will be 
subject to a fees cap
 – a restriction in any contract limiting a company’s choice of auditor 
will be prohibited.
The Group has therefore adopted a policy that no external auditor 
appointed after June 2016 can remain in post for longer than 20 
years and there will be a tendering process every 10 years, and 
that KPMG, as the currently appointed external auditor, may remain 
so until the completion of the 2025 annual audit. However, the 
Committee will continue to consider annually the need to tender 
the audit for audit quality or independence reasons. There are no 
contractual obligations in place that restrict the Company’s choice 
of statutory auditor.
The disclosures provided above constitute the Company’s 
statement of compliance with the requirements of The Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 77 Strategic Report Nomination Committee
Summary of activities in 2016
During 2016 and into 2017, the Committee’s programme of work 
included the commencement of recruitment processes for the 
appointment of three new non-executive Directors.
All appointments to the Board are based on merit, against objective 
criteria, having due regard for diversity, including gender.
In seeking suitable candidates for the positions, Heidrick and 
Struggles US and Ridgeway, external executive search agencies, 
were separately engaged. The Committee identified the 
competencies and experience sought.
Key determinants in the selection of the Directors are a background 
in organisations that share key dynamics with Balfour Beatty, 
including contracting, customer service, major capital projects, 
infrastructure and B2B services.
The search agencies appointed were reminded to approach a 
diverse talent pool of candidates, and neither has other connections 
with Balfour Beatty.
Areas of focus in 2017
In January 2017, the Committee received a comprehensive 
presentation on the succession and development plans for the 
Group’s senior leadership team and discussed succession plans 
for the Board. The implications of the business strategy for senior 
executive recruitment and the impact on the Group’s succession 
planning are also areas which the Committee will consider during 
the year. It will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the 
composition of the Board. 
Safety and Sustainability Committee
Summary of activities in 2016
In addition to the standard agenda items designed to provide 
the Committee with objective reporting of absolute and relative 
performance against agreed KPIs, during the year the Committee has 
overseen the establishment of leading Group-wide safety indicators 
and the update of the Group’s sustainability strategy, Our Blueprint.

sustainability-blueprint-2017.pdf
The Committee has also overseen the merger of the UK Health 
and Safety function with the UK Environment and Sustainability 
function. This has facilitated the development of a more effective and 
collaborative way of working throughout the Group’s UK operations. 
This has been supported by additional training of health, safety, 
environment and sustainability practitioners as part of an ongoing 
development programme to build expertise and flexibility.
The new UK Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability function 
also performs a Group-wide data collection and reporting role for 
Balfour Beatty’s international operations.
The Committee considered certain significant health and safety 
related incidents, including fatalities, discussing in detail the themes 
around supervision, communications and safety by design. It also 
reviewed the Group’s sustainability performance.
The Committee also engaged with key customers to identify 
opportunities for greater collaboration and joint working.
Areas of focus in 2017
In 2017, the Committee will continue to focus on the key areas of 
health and safety by design, supervision and treating health like safety 
as well as measuring performance against Our Blueprint and the Zero 
Harm action plan. 
Accountability continued
The role of the Committee is to monitor the 
structure and composition of the Board, 
including responsibility for recommending 
Board appointments, and to consider the 
strategy, processes and plans for senior 
executive recruitment, the Group’s succession 
planning and talent management.
Philip Aiken 
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
The role of the Committee is to drive

The Company has not adopted any special rules regarding the

company law.
Relations with shareholders
The Board attaches great importance to maintaining good 
relationships with all shareholders and ensures that shareholders 
are kept informed of significant Company developments. 
The Company continued its programme of communication with 
institutional investors and sell-side analysts throughout 2016. 
Presentations of the half-year and annual results were made in 
accordance with the practice of previous years. 
Through the year, approximately 75 one-on-one and group 
meetings were held at regular intervals with institutional 
shareholders (2015: approximately 102). Current and prospective 
shareholders, brokers and analysts were also given the opportunity 
to engage with Balfour Beatty during road shows in London, 
Scotland and North America. 
This communication programme will be maintained and expanded 
where appropriate, subject to the constraints of regulation and 
practice. The 2017 investor relations programme will focus on 
ensuring investors and the analyst community understand the 
Group, its operations and strategy, and that institutions continue to 
be given the opportunity to meet with management. 
Care is exercised to ensure that any price sensitive information is 
released to all shareholders at the same time in accordance with UK 
Listing Authority requirements. 
Executive Directors report regularly to the Board on meetings or 
other contact with shareholders or their representatives. The non-
executive Directors continue to believe that, through their direct 
and ready access to, and contact with, the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director and through the regular reports to the Board, 
they are kept fully aware of the views of the larger shareholders in 
the Company and the investment community generally. 
The Board continues to retain the services of independent 
external corporate and investor relations consultants who 
provide advice on the relationship between the Company and its 
institutional investors. 
Further information on the Company’s investor relations 
programme can be found at: 
 www.balfourbeatty.com/investors
The Board regards the Company’s general meetings as an 
opportunity to communicate directly with private investors 
and actively encourages participative dialogue with all the 
Company’s shareholders. 
The chairs of the Board Committees attend the AGM each year 
along with the other Directors and are available to answer questions 
from shareholders. The circular setting out the Notice of the 
2017 AGM provides a detailed explanation of the business to be 
transacted and includes contact details which shareholders can use 
to make any comments or ask any questions concerning the AGM. 
The website is regarded by the Company as an important 
source of information on the Group, including financial press 
releases, shareholder documentation, annual and half-year results 
presentations and the terms of reference of the principal Board 
Committees. The Company’s website continues to be developed to 
ensure it remains a principal source of information on the Group and 
its activities.
Political donations
At the AGM held in May 2016, shareholders gave authority for the 
Company and its UK subsidiaries to make donations to political 
organisations up to a maximum aggregate amount of £25,000 in 
the European Union. This approval is a precautionary measure in 
view of the broad definition of these terms in the Companies Act. 
No such expenditure or donations were made during the year and 
shareholder authority will be sought again at the 2017 AGM.
In the US and Canada, corporate political contributions 
totalling £195,290 were made by business units during 2016 
(2015: £35,000). Any political contributions or donations are tightly 
controlled and must be approved in advance in accordance with the 
Company’s internal procedures and must also adhere strictly to the 
Company’s policies on probity set out in its Code of Conduct.

Employment
The Balfour Beatty Group operates across a number of geographies 
and end markets. However, there are key principles in the design 
and practice of employment policy that are applicable across the 
Group. These are to: 
 – provide a safe, open, inclusive and challenging environment that 
attracts and retains the best people 
 – enable all employees to perform at their best and realise 
their full potential, assisted by appropriate training and 
career development 
 – communicate the strategy of the Group, the objectives of 
each respective business and the role and objectives of each 
employee within that business 
 – actively consult with all employees and engage in a participating 
environment that fosters the exchange of best practice 
and collaboration 
 – provide market competitive pay and benefits that reward both 
individual and collective performance 
 – ensure that all job applicants receive fair treatment, regardless of 
age, origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, 
religion or belief 
 – ensure that all employees similarly receive fair treatment 
throughout their career 
 – provide a working environment of respect and free 
from harassment. 
Information concerning employee diversity is set out on page 38 
and forms part of the Directors’ report disclosures. 
Balfour Beatty strives to provide employment, training and 
development opportunities for disabled people wherever possible 
and is committed to supporting employees who become disabled 
during employment and helping disabled employees make the best 
use of their skills and potential, consistent with all other employees. 
The Company also operates an all employee Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP) which enables UK-based employees to acquire the 
Company’s ordinary shares on a potentially tax-favourable basis, 
in order to encourage employee share ownership and provide 
additional alignment between the interests of employees and 
shareholders. Participants in the SIP are the beneficial owners of 
shares but not the registered owners, and the voting rights to such 
shares are exercised by the trustee of the SIP at the discretion of 
the participants. 
Information concerning the performance of the Group and the 
Company’s share price is provided to all employees via the 
Company’s website.
Events after the reporting date 
On 26 January 2017, the Group reached agreement to sell its 
49% interests in Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC and BK Gulf LLC to 
its joint venture partner. The sale subsequently completed on 
1 March 2017.
Change of control provisions
The Group’s bank facility agreements contain provisions that, on 
30 days’ notice being given to the Group, the lender may exercise 
its discretion to require prepayment of the loans on a change of 
control of the Company and cancel all commitments under the 
agreement concerned.
A number of significant joint venture and contract bond agreements 
include provisions which become exercisable by a counterparty 
on a change of control of the Company. These include the right 
of a counterparty to request additional security and to terminate 
an agreement.
The Group’s US private placement arrangements require the 
Company, promptly upon becoming aware that a change of control 
of the Company has occurred (and in any event within 10 business 
days), to give written notice of such fact to all holders of the notes 
and make an offer to prepay the entire unpaid principal amount of 
the notes, together with accrued interest.
The Group’s convertible bond arrangements provide that the holder 
of bonds can require the Company to redeem its bonds following 
a change of control of the Company at their principal amount, 
together with accrued interest. The Company is required to notify 
the bond holder within 14 days of a change of control.
Some other commercial agreements, entered into in the normal 
course of business, include change of control provisions.
The Group’s share and incentive plans include usual provisions 
relating to change of control, as do the terms of the Company’s 
cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares.
There are no agreements providing for compensation for the 
Directors or employees on a change of control.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies and 
its exposure to the following risks – foreign exchange, interest rate, 
price and credit – are detailed in Note 38 on pages 167 to 171.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
82 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
 – for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
 – for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in its 
financial statements
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole
 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
In light of the work undertaken by the Audit and Risk Committee 
reported in greater detail on pages 75 to 77 and the internal 
verification and approval process which has been followed this year, 
the Directors are able to state that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.
Statements of Directors as to disclosure of information 
to auditors
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that:
 – so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware
 – the Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Remuneration report
Chairman of Remuneration Committee introduction
2016 was a busy year for the Committee as we undertook a full 
review of our executive Director reward strategy, tools and practices, 
to ensure that they support fully the next stage of the Group’s 
transformation. The resultant revised Remuneration Policy will be 
presented for approval by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration report for 
2016, which is divided into two sections, the Policy Report and the 
Annual Report, the former being subject to the triennial binding vote, 
and the latter being subject to an advisory vote, at the 2017 AGM.
Link to strategy
The primary objectives of our remuneration policy are to ensure we 
are able to attract, retain and motivate key executives to deliver strong 
sustainable business performance aligned to the strategic plan and to 
the interests of shareholders. 
Summary of activities in 2016
Reward for 2016
In respect of 2016, the annual bonus payments for the executive 
Directors reflect the performance of the Group – cash performance 
was strong, as was the personal performance of both executive 
Directors; however, profit performance, whilst showing a marked 
improvement, did not achieve the threshold payment level. The Group 
Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer received annual bonus 
payments of 47.5% and 47.1% of the maximum available respectively.
The TSR performance conditions relating to the 2014 PSP which 
measured performance over the three years ended 31 December 
2016 were not achieved and so those awards lapsed in full for the 
former executive Directors in March 2017. 
Areas of focus in 2017
Subject to shareholder support at the 2017 AGM, the Committee will 
focus on the implementation of the revised Remuneration Policy as 
the Group enters the next stage of its transformation and seeks to 
return to delivering industry-level margins. 
Remuneration policy for 2017
The Committee’s review of the remuneration policy concluded that 
the current policy remains broadly appropriate, subject to minor 
changes to the incentive arrangements and to provide some flexibility 
for the Committee to select performance metrics in line with the 
evolving Company strategy. In considering the proposed increases in 
annual bonus maximum, the Committee has taken into account the 
importance, during the current stage of the Group’s transformation, of 
ensuring there is sufficient focus and reward for delivering the shorter-
term ‘recovery’ based objectives. Then, as the Group moves to more 
of a ‘steady-state’ operating model, we will need to provide a focus 
on achieving annual results which deliver sector-leading performance. 
In considering the revised remuneration packages of the executive 
Directors, the Committee has taken into account the significant 
milestones that have been achieved in the Group’s transformation as 
a result of the performance of the individual Directors. 
In summary, the key changes to support the next stage of the Group’s 
transformation are:
 – the annual bonus maximum opportunity for both executive 
Directors will increase from 120% to 150% of salary; 50% of 
any bonus will continue to be paid in Company shares which are 
deferred for three years
 – the Chief Financial Officer’s long-term incentive award, currently 
150% of salary, will increase to 175%. The Group Chief Executive’s 
long-term incentive award will remain at the current level of 200% 
of salary
 – to increase the minimum share ownership guideline for the Group 
Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer from 100% of salary 
to 200% and 150% of salary respectively
 – providing flexibility to enable the Committee to select performance 
measures for the annual bonus and long-term incentive award that 
remain aligned with the evolving strategy of the Company, with at 
least 70% of the annual bonus to be based on financial metrics.
I am pleased to report that our discussions with major investors in 
relation to the revised Remuneration Policy have been positive and 
we hope that we can count on the support of shareholders for these 
important changes. 
Conclusion
The Committee will continue to engage with major shareholders 
to ensure that executive remuneration remains appropriate as the 
Board takes its responsibility to engage with investors seriously. 
The Committee believes that the remuneration actions taken in 2016, 
and those proposed for 2017, are in the best interest of the Company 
and its shareholders. 
Iain Ferguson
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
2016 was another year of strong cash 
performance when overall the Group made 
significant progress as the Board continued to 
deal with legacy issues, as reflected in executive 
Directors’ remuneration out-turns.

Directors’ remuneration policy report
The policy will be presented to shareholders at the AGM on 18 May 2017 for approval by binding vote. 
Policy overview
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the Company’s remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the executive 
Directors of the Company and the Chairman. In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a number of factors, 
including:
 – general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group
 – the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market
 – the balance between fixed and variable pay – more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately high level 
of potential remuneration
 – the strategy of the business
 – the views of investors and their representative bodies.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account when setting 
executive Directors’ reward packages. A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their remuneration package 
is delivered through performance-related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group. The areas covered in this Policy 
Report comprise:
Consideration of shareholders’ views 85
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group 85
Summary of executive Directors’ remuneration policy 86
Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors 88
Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors 88
Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors 89
External appointments of executive Directors 89
Appointment of non-executive Directors 90
Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee considers feedback from shareholders received at each AGM, and any feedback from additional meetings or from published 
investor guidelines, as part of any review of executive remuneration. In addition, the Committee engages proactively with shareholders and 
will ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance, where any material changes to the remuneration policy and implementation of that 
policy are proposed. Indeed, major investors were consulted in advance of the publication of the revised Remuneration Policy. 
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
In determining the remuneration of the Company’s Directors, the Committee takes into account the general trends in pay and conditions 
across the Group as a whole. Whilst employees have not been consulted formally on executive pay, due in part to the diverse geographic 
disposition of the Group, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on Directors’ pay 
are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken. These are focused for the most part on market 
competitiveness, business performance and personal performance.
In practice, the remuneration policy for executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, so 
that a significant proportion of their remuneration is dependent on Company performance. For employees below Board level, variable pay 
represents a lower proportion of their total remuneration, which is driven by market comparators and general performance. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016

Summary of executive Directors’ remuneration policy
The following table sets out a summary of each element of the executive Directors’ remuneration packages, their link to the Company’s 
strategy, the policy for how these are operated, the maximum opportunity and a description of any relevant performance metrics.
Element of pay Purpose and link to Company’s strategy How operated in practice Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary To attract and retain high-calibre individuals.
To provide a competitive salary relative 
to comparable companies in terms of size 
and complexity.
Salaries are reviewed and set annually in July. The Committee 
considers remuneration levels in companies of comparable 
market capitalisation, revenue and industry sector.
In addition, a key reference point for salary increases is the 
average increase across the general workforce (with the 
exception of promotions or significant changes in responsibility).
Salaries are paid monthly in cash.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. The Committee is 
guided by the general increase for the broader employee population 
but on occasion may need to recognise, for example, an increase in 
the scale, scope or responsibility of the role.
Current salary levels are disclosed on page 92.
A number of factors are considered, notably market 
competitiveness, business and personal performance.
Benefits To aid retention and to remain competitive in the 
marketplace. In addition, medical benefits are 
provided to minimise disruption due to absence.
Private medical and life assurance may be provided. A car and 
fuel card or car allowance are offered. Other benefits may be 
provided as appropriate.
The maximum opportunity for medical benefits is cover for the 
executive Director and his or her family. Life assurance cover, car or 
car allowance and any other benefits are based on market norms.
None
Pension To remain competitive in the marketplace. Executive Directors can elect either to:
 – participate in the defined contribution (DC) section of the 
Group’s pension fund. Executive Directors must make 
contributions of 5% of base salary (up to an earnings cap),  
with the Company contributing 20% of base salary (up to the 
cap). On earnings above the cap, executive Directors receive  
a salary supplement; or
 – receive a salary supplement in lieu of a pension.
Executive Directors who participate in the Group’s pension fund 
benefit from a pension contribution of 20% of base salary up to 
the earnings cap and a salary supplement of 20% of base salary 
in excess of the cap.
If a salary supplement is taken in lieu of a pension contribution, 
this is equivalent to 20% of base salary.
None
Annual Incentive 
Plan (AIP) and 
Deferred Bonus 
Plan (DBP)
To motivate executive Directors and incentivise 
the achievement of key business performance 
targets over the financial year without 
encouraging excessive risk taking. Managing 
risk is critical, particularly given the nature of the 
Company’s business.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
50% of any payment is normally deferred into shares for  
three years.
Clawback and malus may apply in the event of material 
misconduct and/or material misstatement or error of financial 
results.
Participants may also receive an award of cash or shares  
in lieu of the value of dividends paid over the vesting period  
on vested shares.
Maximum annual incentive opportunity is 150% of base salary. The Committee will select performance measures for the annual 
bonus that are aligned with the evolving strategy of the Company. 
A minimum 70% weighting is based on financial metrics.
Measures are reviewed each year and may be varied as appropriate 
to reflect the Company’s strategy.
Performance 
Share Plan (PSP)
To incentivise and reward delivery of long-term 
performance linked to the business strategy.
To facilitate share ownership and provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
To aid retention.
PSP awards are granted annually so that no undue emphasis is

Awards normally vest on the third anniversary of grant, subject  
to performance.
Clawback and malus may apply in the event of material 
misconduct and/or material misstatement or error of  
financial results.
Participants also receive an award of cash or shares in lieu of the 
value of dividends paid over the vesting period on vested shares.
The limit in the rules of the PSP is 200% of base salary which will 
be applied to the Group Chief Executive. Other than in exceptional 
circumstances, the normal limit for other executive Directors will be 
175% of base salary.
Performance measures will be set on an annual basis to reflect 
the Company’s strategy. A minimum of 30% of any award will be 
based on relative total shareholder return (TSR), with the balance 
being based on other financial targets. Targets will normally be 
measured over a three-year performance period.
There is 25% vesting for threshold performance, rising to 100% 
vesting for maximum performance.
Shareholding 
guidelines
To align the interests of executive Directors with 
those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to accumulate a shareholding 
in the Company’s shares to the value of 200% and 150% of 
base salary for the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer respectively. Executive Directors are expected to retain 
at least 50% of shares (net of tax) which vest from awards made 
under the PSP and DBP until the target shareholding is attained.

Notes
1 Salary levels are based on those applying from 1 January 2017. These salaries will be reviewed in July 2017.
2 The value of benefits receivable for 2017 has been estimated. Cash allowance in lieu of pension is 20% of base salary.
3 The on-target level of AIP is taken to be 50% of the maximum AIP opportunity (150% of salary for executive Directors), of which 50% is paid in cash and 50% is deferred in shares 
under the DBP.
4 The on-target level of vesting under the PSP is taken to be 50% of the face value of the award at grant (200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 175% of salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer). The executive Directors’ buyout awards, as agreed as part of their joining arrangements, are not reflected in the above charts as these are not part of the 
ongoing remuneration policy.
5 The maximum level of AIP and vesting under the PSP is taken to be 100% of the AIP opportunity and 100% of the face value of the PSP awards at grant.
6 No share price appreciation or dividend awards have been assumed for the DBP shares and the PSP awards.
Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors
To ensure the ongoing leadership continuity of the Group, the Company will seek the appointment of high-calibre executives, either by external 
appointment or internal promotion. The remuneration package for a new executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of 
the Company’s remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the scope and complexity of the role, the experience 
of the individual, the prevailing market rate for that experience and the importance and immediacy of securing that candidate.
The salary would be set at a level, based on the principles above, to secure the most appropriate candidate but paying no more than is 
necessary and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The AIP potential would be limited to 150% of salary, and grants 
under the PSP may be up to the plan maximum of 200% of salary. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based 
elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, 
that these awards were consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any remuneration awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental expenses  
as appropriate. balfourbeatty.com/AR2016
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 89 Strategic Report
Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which can be terminated on one year’s notice 
by the Company and six months’ notice by the executive Director. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM. 
In the event of termination, the following principles will apply:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months by the Company, six months by the executive Director.
In the event of termination by the Company ‘for cause’ the executive 
Director would not be entitled to notice of termination under his or  
her contract of employment or to any payment in lieu of notice.
Notice payments If any existing contract was terminated by the Company (other than 
for cause), it would be liable to pay an amount approximating to the 
net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice 
period, subject to mitigation and including any period of garden leave. 
The Company may elect to make payment in lieu of any unexpired 
period of notice comprising salary and a cash sum in lieu of benefits. 
The Company reserves the right to apply mitigation to any notice 
payment (or payment in lieu of notice) for example, by making 
phased payments where appropriate for the balance of any notice 
period, against which earnings from new employment are offset.
Remuneration entitlements Pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active 
service along with vesting for outstanding share awards (in certain 
circumstances – see below).
In all cases, performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no provisions for enhanced termination payments in the 
event of change of control of the Company.
Incidental expenses and other payments The Company may meet relocation and other incidental expenses  
on termination of employment, for example relocation expenses,  
the fees of legal or other professional advisers, and accrued but 
untaken holiday. It may also elect to continue to provide certain 
benefits rather than making payment in lieu of the benefit in question.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be determined based on the relevant 
plan rules. The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, awards 
will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will vest under 
the normal vesting schedule, being reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that PSP awards vest at cessation and/or to amend time pro-rating. Outstanding DBP 
awards will lapse on cessation of employment, except in certain good leaver circumstances prescribed by the plan rules when DBP awards 
will vest in full on the date of cessation.
External appointments of executive Directors
The Committee recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere. 
Executive Directors are permitted to have one external appointment, from which fees may be retained with the approval of the Board. Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016

Appointment of non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed by the full Board following recommendations from the Nomination Committee. All non-executive 
Directors are appointed for a term of three years. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all non-executive Directors submit 
themselves for re-election at the AGM.

The Chairman is paid an annual fee 
and the non-executive Directors are 
paid an annual base fee and additional

Independent Director or for chairing a 
Board Committee.
Non-executive Directors based outside 
Europe receive a travel allowance for each 
visit made on Company business to the 
UK, or to any other country (excluding 
their home country).
Fee levels are normally reviewed annually 
in July.
The non-executive Directors are not 
eligible to join any pension scheme 
operated by the Company and cannot 
participate in any of the Company’s share 
plans or annual incentive schemes.
The Company will pay any reasonable 
business-related expenses (including tax 
thereon where determined as a taxable 
benefit). 
As per executive Directors, there 
is no prescribed maximum annual

by the general increase in the non-
executive director market and for the 
broader employee population, but on 
occasions may need to recognise, 
for example, an increase in the scale, 
scope or responsibility of the role.
The appointment letters for non-executive Directors may be terminated with three months’ notice (six months’ notice for the Chairman) by 
either party and contain no provision for payment in the event of termination. balfourbeatty.com/AR2016

Leo Quinn 800,000 800,000 0.0%
Philip Harrison 400,000 400,000 0.0%
The normal review date for executive Directors’ base salaries is 1 July, but it was agreed that neither would receive an increase in 2016. 
The next salary review date is 1 July 2017.
Performance targets for the AIP in 2017
For 2017, the AIP for the executive Directors will be a maximum bonus of 150% of base salary (subject to shareholder approval of the 
revised Remuneration Policy) based on the achievement of three performance measures:
 – profit before tax (40%)
 – cash (35%)
 – strategic business and personal objectives (25%).
The Committee will ensure that the targets continue to be set at a stretching level particularly given the higher incentive opportunity 
proposed for 2017 as part of the revised Remuneration Policy. The three elements are measured and calculated independently of each other 
and 50% of any bonus earned will be deferred for three years in Balfour Beatty shares.
While the Committee has chosen not to disclose in advance the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which 
the Committee considers commercially sensitive, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be presented in 
next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance targets for PSP awards granted in 2017
Subject to shareholder approval of the revised Remuneration Policy, the Group Chief Executive will be granted a PSP award over shares 
worth 200% of salary and the Chief Financial Officer 175% of salary. Consistent with the approach adopted in 2015 and 2016, the PSP 
awards to be granted in 2017 will be based on the achievement of three performance measures:
 – relative TSR (33.3%) – the Company’s TSR measured against a comparator group of UK listed companies ranked 51–200 by market 
capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index (excluding investment trusts) as at 1 January 2017, the start of the performance period. There is 
no vesting for ranking below median, with 25% of this part of an award vesting at median ranking, rising to 100% vesting of this part of an 
award at upper quartile or higher
 – EPS (33.3%) – the Company’s EPS over the three-year performance period
 – cash (33.3%) – cash remains critical as a long-term performance measure during the Company’s transformation. 
As at the date of publication of this Remuneration report, the Committee had not finalised the EPS and cash performance targets for the 
PSP awards to be granted in 2017. These EPS and cash targets will be set at an appropriate level of stretch and will be fully disclosed in the 
RNS announcement issued immediately following the grant of the PSP award and in the Remuneration report for 2017.
Non-executive Directors
As detailed in the Policy Report, the Company’s approach to setting non-executive Directors’ fees is by reference to fees paid at similar 
companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role. A summary of current fees is as follows:
1 July 2015 
£
1 July 2016 
£
 
% increase
Chairman 270,000 270,000 0%
Base fee 56,000 56,000 0%
Senior Independent Director fee 10,000 10,000 0%
Committee chair fee 10,000 10,000 0%
For non-executive Directors based outside Europe, the travel allowance for each overseas visit made on Company business remains 
at £2,500.
Where the Chairman or Senior Independent Director is also the chair of a Committee, he or she receives no committee chair fee. balfourbeatty.com/AR2016

1 Base salary and fees were those paid in respect of the period of the year during which the individuals were Directors. 
2  In practice, the base salary paid to Leo Quinn was reduced due to his participation in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan. The salary reduction in 2016 was £1,800. 
3  Taxable benefits are calculated in terms of UK taxable values. Leo Quinn received private medical insurance for the Director and his immediate family and received a car 
allowance of £20,000 per annum. Philip Harrison received private medical insurance for the Director only and received a car allowance of £14,000 per annum.

AIP awards for the year ended 31 December 2016
For 2016, the AIP for the executive Directors was a maximum bonus of 120% of base salary based on the achievement of three 
performance measures:
 – profit before tax (51%)
 – cash (25%)
 – strategic business and personal objectives (24%).
The three elements are measured and calculated independently of each other and 50% of the bonus earned is deferred for three years in the 
form of Balfour Beatty shares.

1 Although the Group total cash flow was impacted positively by foreign exchange and disposals, the Committee has verified that the out-turn would have been at maximum even 
without these impacts and is satisfied that the achievement is a result of strong underlying performance.
Performance against the 2016 AIP strategic business and personal objectives as it relates to the executive Directors was:

trustees; agreed strategy for interest/dividend levels – – 30.0 30.0
Total 100.0 93.75 100.0 92.0
The Committee considered carefully the AIP performance out-turn for the executive Directors against the background of the profit 
performance and determined that the above payments are appropriate given the Group’s strong cash performance and the personal 
performance of the executive Directors. The profit performance issues largely relate to legacy contracts. The executive Directors 
have, in the opinion of the Committee, made significant progress to close out the legacy contracts and to create the foundations for 
a sustainable business.

As disclosed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, two former executive Directors at the time of the grant of the 2014 PSP award had 
a pro-rated number of shares preserved at cessation of employment, subject to the achievement of the original performance criteria 
(Duncan Magrath and Peter Zinkin, who left employment with the Company on 8 May 2015 and 31 August 2015 respectively). 
Details of vesting of the PSP awards with performance periods ending in the year under review for the former executive Directors

1 2015 PSP award: The award is subject to three performance targets over a three-year performance period commencing 1 January 2015, except for Leo Quinn’s award which has 
a measurement period for the TSR part of the three years to 14 October 2017. TSR part (33.3% weighting), measured against a comparator group of companies ranked 51–150 by 
market capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index, no vesting below median ranking, 25% vesting of this part at median, rising to 100% vesting at upper quartile performance or 
better. Net Debt part (33.3% weighting), no vesting unless 2017 year-end Net Debt is less than £(150)million, 25% vesting of this part at £(150)million, rising to full vesting at £nil. 
EPS part (33.3% weighting), no vesting unless 2017 EPS is 14p, 25% vesting of this part at 14p, rising to full vesting at 21p.
2 The 2015 PSP award used a share price of 202.8p to calculate the number of shares awarded, being the average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the 
10 dealing dates before Leo Quinn joined the Company on 2 January 2015. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the award was 243.0p.
3 2016 PSP award: Details of this award are set out on page 96.
4 The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the PSP award dates, which was used for calculating the number of shares 
granted, was 249.2p for the 2013 award, 301.9p for the 2014 and 235.4p for the 2016 award. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 
244.9p, 299.6p and 238.3p respectively.
5 All PSP awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc. 
6  On 13 April 2016, for all participants in the PSP, a maximum of 3,768,644 conditional shares were awarded which are exercisable on 13 April 2019. 
7 All DBP awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc. It is the Company’s current intention that awards will be satisfied 
by shares purchased in the market.
8 The initial DBP awards made in 2014, March 2015, June 2015 and 2016 will vest on 31 March 2017, 31 March 2018, 26 June 2018 and 31 March 2019 respectively, providing the 
participant is still employed by the Group at the vesting date (unless specified leaver conditions are met, in which case early vesting may be permitted).
9 The initial DBP awards made in 2013 vested on 31 March 2016. The closing middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company on the vesting dates was 254.6p.
10 The shares subject to the DBP awards made on 31 March 2013, 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015, 26 June 2015 and 31 March 2016 were purchased at average prices of 234.85p, 
301.9p, 241.0p, 245.0p and 252.5p respectively.
11 On 31 March 2016, for all participants in the DBP, a maximum of 651,306 conditional shares were awarded which will normally be released on 31 March 2019. On 6 October 
2016, a further 4,676 conditional shares were awarded in lieu of entitlements to the interim 2016 dividend. 
12 For the initial DBP awards made in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the shares awarded on 6 October 2016 (in lieu of the interim 2016 dividend) were allocated at the average price of 277p.
13 The share buyout awards were granted for nil consideration and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc. The awards compensate each of Leo Quinn and Philip 
Harrison for incentive awards which were forfeited on leaving their previous employers. Further details of these awards are set out on pages 96 and 97. The closing middle market 
price of ordinary shares in the Company on the date of the awards was 212.4p and 253.1p respectively.
14 The closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on 31 December 2016 was 268.2p. During the year, the highest and lowest closing market prices were 295.1p and

The performance condition for 33.3% of the award (the TSR Part) will measure the Company’s Total Shareholder Return performance 
relative to the TSR performance of a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE 51–150 (excluding 
investment trusts) as at the start of the measurement period. The measurement period for the TSR Part is the three financial years to 
31 December 2018.
No portion of the TSR Part will vest unless the Company’s TSR performance at 31 December 2018 ranks at least equal to median TSR 
performance of the comparator group, at which point 25% of the TSR Part will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for the 
Company’s TSR performance ranking at upper quartile or better.
The performance condition applying to a separate 33.3% of the award (the Net Debt Part) will measure the Company’s net debt at the end 
of the measurement period comprising the three financial years to 31 December 2018. 
No portion of the Net Debt Part will vest unless the Company’s net debt at the 2018 financial year end is less than £(75) million. Were net 
debt to be £(75) million or less but more than £0 million, 25% to 50% of the Net Debt Part would vest on a straight-line between such 
levels. Were net debt to be £0 million or less, between 50% and 100% of the Net Debt Part would vest on a straight-line basis for net cash 
between £nil and £50 million.
The performance condition applying to a separate 33.3% of each award (the EPS Part) will measure the Company’s underlying earnings per 
share (EPS) performance at the end of the measurement period comprising the three financial years to 31 December 2018.
No portion of the EPS Part will vest unless the Company’s EPS for the 2018 financial year is 20p, at which point 25% of the EPS Part will 
vest, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for the Company’s EPS being 27p or more.
Executive Directors’ recruitment terms
Leo Quinn
As part of his recruitment arrangements and as fully disclosed in the 2014 and 2015 Remuneration reports, the Company agreed to 
compensate Leo Quinn for incentive awards which were forfeited upon leaving his previous employer.
Outstanding at year end is a conditional share award over 1,812,767 Balfour Beatty plc shares granted on 2 January 2015 which will vest 
in two tranches:
 – 604,256 shares (one-third of the award) will vest on the second anniversary of grant subject to share price targets tested at the end of the 
two-year period based on a 60-day average and as adjusted for dividends. 25% of this part of the award will vest for an end average share 
price of 222p increasing pro-rata for full vesting of this part of the award for an end average share price of 309p. No vesting for this part of 
the award will take place for an average share price of less than 222p
 – 1,208,511 shares (two-thirds of the award) will vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to share price targets tested at the end of 
the three-year period based on a 60-day average and as adjusted for dividends. 25% of this part of the award will vest for an end average 
share price of 250p increasing pro-rata for full vesting of this part of the award for an end average share price of 380p. No vesting for this 
part of the award will take place for an average share price of less than 250p
 – in addition to the dividend adjusted share price targets, an underpin will apply to the vesting whereby the Committee must be satisfied 
with the underlying performance of the business for this award to vest.
The above share-based buyout award lapses in the event of voluntary resignation or termination for cause prior to the respective vesting 
dates. In the event of good leaver departure, the awards will vest at employment cessation, subject to performance conditions and pro-
rating at the time of cessation. 
In relation to the first tranche of 604,256 shares, on 13 March 2017 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the end average share price of 
274.34p at 2 January 2017 against the target range, indicating vesting at 70.12% of this part of the award, and also considered the underlying 
performance of the Company over the performance period. The Committee determined that 70.12% of the award (423,704 shares) will be 
permitted to vest on 16 March 2017 when the Company enters an open period.  balfourbeatty.com/AR2016

Philip Harrison
As part of his recruitment arrangements, the Company agreed to compensate Philip Harrison for share awards which were forfeited upon 
leaving his previous employer. The performance targets are consistent with the awards granted to Leo Quinn at the start of 2015.
The Company granted a conditional share award over 92,493 Balfour Beatty plc shares on 11 June 2015 which will vest in two tranches:
 – 30,831 shares (one-third of the award) will vest on 31 December 2016 subject to share price targets tested at the end of the period 
based on a 60-day average and as adjusted for dividends. 25% of this part of the award will vest for an end average share price of 222p 
increasing pro-rata for full vesting of this part of the award for an end average share price of 309p. No vesting for this part of the award will 
take place for an average share price of less than 222p
 – 61,662 shares (two-thirds of the award) will vest on 31 December 2017 subject to share price targets tested at the end of the period 
based on a 60-day average and as adjusted for dividends. 25% of this part of the award will vest for an end average share price of 250p 
increasing pro-rata for full vesting of this part of the award for an end average share price of 380p. No vesting for this part of the award will 
take place for an average share price of less than 250p
 – in addition to the dividend adjusted share price targets, an underpin will apply to the vesting whereby the Committee must be satisfied 
with the underlying performance of the business for this award to vest.
The share buyout award lapses in the event of voluntary resignation or termination for cause prior to the respective vesting dates. In the 
event of good leaver departure, the awards will vest at employment cessation, subject to performance conditions and pro-rating at the time 
of cessation. 
In relation to the first tranche of 30,831 shares, on 13 March 2017 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the end average share price 
of 274.01p at 31 December 2016 against the target range, indicating vesting at 69.83% of this part of the award, and also considered the 
underlying performance of the Company over the performance period. The Committee determined that 69.83% of the award (21,529 
shares) will be permitted to vest on 16 March 2017 when the Company enters an open period.

DBP and PSP until the required shareholding is met. Subject to the approval of shareholders at the 2017 AGM, the revised Remuneration Policy requires that the Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer have share ownership guidelines of 200% and 150% of salary respectively.

Performance graph
As in previous reports, the Remuneration Committee has chosen to compare the TSR on the Company’s ordinary shares against the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member. 
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a £100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares 
in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent non-executive Directors, as defined under the Corporate Governance Code. 
No member of the Committee has conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no member is involved in the day-to-day executive 
management of the Group. During the year under review, the members of the Committee were as follows:
 – Iain Ferguson (Committee chair)
 – Philip Aiken
 – Stuart Doughty
 – Maureen Kempston Darkes
 – Graham Roberts.
Stuart Doughty stepped down from the Committee on 13 January 2016 as part of a general review of committee membership by the Board. 
Graham Roberts was a member of the Committee until his death on 1 July 2016.
The Committee also receives advice from several sources, namely:
 – the Group Chief Executive and the Group HR director, who are invited to attend meetings of the Committee but are not present when 
matters relating directly to their own remuneration are discussed
 – New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon plc) (NBS).
NBS has been appointed as external independent executive remuneration advisers by the Committee and has provided a range of advice 
to the Committee during the year, including:
 – in support of the Remuneration Policy review, NBS provided analysis of market practice and advice on remuneration approaches for 
consideration by the Committee and in relation to the views of shareholders and their representative bodies
 – assistance with the drafting of the Remuneration report
 – valuation of share-based payments for IFRS 2 purposes
 – calculation of vesting levels under the TSR element of the PSP awards and the share buyout awards.
Neither NBS nor any part of Aon plc provided any other services to the Company during the year under review. Total fees paid to NBS in 
respect of its services to the Committee were £62,206 (2015: £45,871).
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct. The Committee is satisfied that the advice that it receives from NBS is 
objective and independent.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Contract accounting 
£6.2 billion  
(2015: £5.9 billion)
Refer to page 76 (Audit and Risk Committee Report), page 
114 (Principal accounting policies – Note 2.5 Construction 
and service contracts) and pages 117-118 (Judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty – Note 2.27a Revenue 
and margin recognition).
Subjective estimate
For the majority of its contracts, the Group recognises 
revenue and profit on the stage of completion based on the 
proportion of contract costs incurred for the work performed 
to the balance sheet date, relative to the estimated total 
costs of the contract at completion. 
The recognition of revenue and profit therefore relies on 
estimates in relation to the forecast total costs on each 
contract. Cost contingencies may also be included in these 
estimates to take account of specific uncertain risks, or 
disputed claims against the Group, arising within each 
contract. These contingencies are reviewed by the Group 
on a regular basis throughout the contract life and adjusted 
where appropriate. 
The revenue on contracts may also include variations and 
claims. Variations and claims are recognised on a contract-
by-contract basis when the Group’s negotiations have 
reached a stage such that it is probable that the customer 
will accept the claim and the amount can be measured 
reliably. In certain circumstances recoveries from insurers 
are also included in forecasts where sufficient progress has 
been made to meet accounting recognition requirements. 
Therefore there is a high degree of risk and associated 
management judgement in estimating the amount of 
revenue and associated profit to be recognised by the Group 
up to the balance sheet date and changes to these estimates 
could give rise to material variances.
Our procedures included: 
 – Tests of detail: using a variety of quantitative and qualitative criteria 
we selected a sample of contracts to assess and challenge the most 
significant and complex contract estimates. We obtained the detailed 
project review papers from the Group to support the estimates made 
and challenged the judgements underlying those papers with senior 
operational, commercial and financial management;
 – Historical comparisons: evaluating the financial performance of 
contracts against budget and historical trends;
 – Site visits: completing site visits to certain higher risk or larger value 
contracts, physically inspecting the stage of completion of individual 
projects and identifying areas of complexity through observation and 
discussion with site personnel;
 – Benchmarking assumptions: challenging the Group’s judgement 
in respect of forecast contract out-turn, contingencies, settlements 
and the recoverability of contract balances via agreement to third-
party certifications and confirmations and with reference to our own 
assessments, historical outcomes and industry norms;
 – Customer correspondence scrutiny: analysing correspondence with 
customers around variations and claims and considering whether this 
information is consistent with the estimates made by the Group;
 – Insurer correspondence scrutiny: analysing correspondence and 
meeting minutes with insurers around recognised insurance claims and 
considering whether this information supports the position taken on 
the contract;
 – Test of detail: inspecting selected contracts for key clauses; identifying 
relevant contractual mechanisms such as pain/gain shares, design 
bonuses, liquidated damages and success fees and assessing whether 
these key clauses have been appropriately reflected in the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements;
 – Our sector experience: assessing whether the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements resulting from the estimates and assumptions 
made represent a balanced view of the risks and opportunities pertinent to 
the contract cash positions; 
 – Our sector experience: considering whether provisions against contracts 
sufficiently reflect the level of risk by challenging the Group’s judgement in 
this area with reference to our own assessments.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
100 The risk Our response
Goodwill impairment
£937 million;  
2015: £844 million
Refer to page 76 (Audit and Risk Committee Report), pages 
115-116 (Principal accounting policies – Note 2.12 Intangible 
assets, Note 2.16 Impairment of assets) and pages 130-131 
(Note 14 Intangible assets – goodwill).
Forecast-based valuation
The Group’s balance sheet includes goodwill. The risk is 
that the goodwill allocated to cash-generating units (CGU) 
is not recoverable and should be impaired. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting 
future cash flows, which are the basis of the assessment 
of recoverability, this is one of the key judgement areas for 
our audit.
The Group annually carries out an impairment assessment 
of goodwill using a value-in-use model which is based on 
the net present value of the forecast earnings of the cash-
generating unit. This is calculated using certain assumptions 
around discount rates, growth rates and cash flow forecasts.
Given the relative size of the goodwill in the Group balance 
sheet, in particular with regard to the UK Regional and 
Engineering Services CGU, which remains loss making, 
relatively small changes in the above assumptions could give 
rise to material changes in the assessment of the carrying 
value of goodwill.
Our procedures included:
 – Assessing methodology: considering the consistency and 
appropriateness of the allocation of businesses and related goodwill 
balances into CGUs; 
 – Benchmarking assumptions: considering the underlying assumptions 
in determining the cash flows and growth assumptions applied with 
reference to historical forecasting accuracy, current order book, and wider 
macroenvironment conditions; 
 – Our sector experience: challenging the assumptions used in the 
calculation of the discount rates used by the Group, including comparisons 
with external data sources and by involving our own valuation specialist to 
assist us in evaluating the valuation methodologies used by the Group, as 
well as the discount rate assumptions applied; 
 – Sensitivity analysis: performing our own sensitivity analysis, including 
a reasonably possible reduction in assumed growth rates and margins to 
identify areas on which to focus our procedures; and
 – Assessing transparency: considering the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures including disclosure of sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions appropriately 
reflecting the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.

3.  Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope 
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £10.0 million, determined with reference to the benchmark 
of Group profit before tax from continuing operations of £60 million 
normalised to take into account items that are considered one-off 
or exceptional in the year as disclosed in Note 10, but not including 
an adjustment for the amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 
£9 million, of which it represents 20%. 
Due to the volatility in the Group’s results in recent financial years, 
as part of our materiality assessment we also considered the 
scale of the business, the level of judgement and precision within 
the Group’s key accounting judgements, as well as how the level 
of materiality compares to other relevant benchmarks such as 
revenue, of which it represents 0.1% and total assets, of which it 
represents 0.2%, where they provide more consistent measures 
year-on-year than Group profit before tax. 
We report to the Audit and Risk Committee any corrected and 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.5 million in 
addition to other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 16 reporting components, 11 were subject to an 
audit for Group reporting purposes, 2 to specified risk-focused 
audit procedures and 3 to reviews. The components for which we 
performed specified risk-focused procedures were not individually 
financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting 
purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to 
be addressed. The specified audit procedures were performed 
over fixed assets 2 components and inventory 1 component.

 Residual components
The components for which we performed a review of financial 
information were not individually significant enough to require an 
audit for Group reporting purposes but were included in the scope 
of our Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage 
over the Group’s results. Together, the audits cover 96% of Group 
revenue, 93% of Group profit before tax and 94% of Group total 
assets. Including the components subject to specified procedures 
or review, coverage was 100% of Group revenue, 99% of Group 
profit before tax and 100% of Group total assets. As part of the 
audit we performed procedures on the items excluded from 
normalised Group profit before tax. 
The Group operates one shared service centre in Newcastle, 
United Kingdom, the outputs of which are included in the financial 
information of the reporting components it services. Therefore it 
is not a separate reporting component. The service centre is 
subject to specified risk-focused audit procedures, predominantly 
the testing of transaction processing and review controls. 
Additional procedures are performed at each reporting component 
to address the audit risks not covered by the work performed over 
the shared service centre.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors, and the 
auditors of the shared service centre, as to the significant areas 
to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved 
the component materialities, which ranged from £3.15 million 
to £9.0 million, having regard to the mix of size and profile of the 
Group across the components. The work on 15 of the Group’s 16 
components was performed by the component auditors with the 
review of financial information on one of the components being 
performed by the Group audit team. 
In 2016, the Group audit team visited nine components in the 
United Kingdom, United States, United Arab Emirates and Hong 
Kong. Telephone conference meetings were held with these 
component auditors and the majority of the others that were 
not physically visited. At these visits and meetings, the findings 
reported to the Group audit team were discussed in detail. 
4.  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of 
the audit of the financial statements and from reading the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report:
 – we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; 
and 
 – in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. 
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
102 5.  We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal 
risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – the Directors’ statement in relation to Balfour Beatty plc’s 
longer-term viability on pages 53 to 65, concerning the principal 
risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in 
operation over the three years to 31 December 2019; or 
 – the disclosures in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on page 52 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
6.  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the Annual Report that contains 
a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the 
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is 
otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 – we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy; or
 – the Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 75 to 77 does 
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit and Risk Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 – the Directors’ statements, set out on pages 52 and 65, in relation 
to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 66 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the 11 provisions 
of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for 
our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities. 
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 83, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report 
is made solely to the Company’s members as a body and is 
subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/
auditscopeukco2014a, which are incorporated into this report as if 
set out in full and should be read to provide an understanding of the 
purpose of this report, the work we have undertaken and the basis 
of our opinions.

Commentary on the Group Income Statement
*
Total pre-tax profit from continuing operations for 2016 was £8m, 
which is inclusive of a non-underlying loss of £52m. The total profit 
after tax including discontinued operations was £24m.
Background
The Group Income Statement includes the majority of the 
Group’s income and expenses for the year with the remainder 
being recorded within the statement of comprehensive income. 
The Group’s income statement is presented showing the Group’s 
underlying and non-underlying results separately on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
financial performance achieved by the Group.
The income statement shows the revenue and results of continuing 
operations. The post-tax results shown within discontinued 
operations represent the residual gain on the disposal of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff (PB). 
The Group has continued to present the remaining parts of Rail 
Germany outside of underlying items as it remains committed to 
exiting its Mainland European rail businesses as soon as possible 
and does not consider its operations part of the Group’s underlying 
activity. Following the various disposals of parts of Rail Germany in 
2015 and 2016, the Group is winding down its remaining operations 
in Rail Germany with the last remaining contract expected to reach 
completion in 2018.
In addition to this, in 2014, the performance of external Engineering 
Services (ES) contracts linked to poor legacy management and 
in regions that ES has withdrawn from tendering for third-party 
work was included in non-underlying items as the size and nature 
of the losses due to the problematic delivery of these contracts 
are exceptional and distort the underlying performance of the 
Group. The Group continues to present the results from these 
legacy contracts within non-underlying and will continue to do 
so until these contracts reach completion, inclusive of any claims 
recovery. Separate disclosure of these contracts aids the reader’s 
understanding of the underlying performance of the remainder of 
the Group.
Revenue
Revenue from continuing operations including non-underlying 
items, joint ventures and associates increased by 3% to £8,683m 
from £8,444m in 2015.

Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 49 to 52.
Group Income Statement
For the year ended 31 December 2016
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
104 Commentary on the Group Income Statement continued
Gain on disposal of investments 
The Group continued its programme of realising accumulated value 
in the Investments portfolio and generated income by disposing of 
interests in Connect M1-A1 Holdings Ltd (the Group continues to 
hold a 20% stake), Living & Learning Unit Trust, BSF Schools and 
five of its streetlighting projects (the Group continues to hold 20% 
interests) resulting in a net underlying gain of £65m after recycling 
losses of £1m from reserves to the income statement.
Share of results of joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures and associates are those entities over which the 
Group exercises joint control or has significant influence and whose 
results are generally incorporated using the equity method whereby 
the Group’s share of the post-tax results of joint ventures and 
associates is included in the Group’s operating profit.
This share increased by £8m to £55m before non-underlying items, 
largely due to a decrease in losses incurred by the Group’s Middle 
East joint ventures. 
Underlying profit from continuing operations 
Underlying profit from continuing operations increased to £67m 
from a £106m loss in 2015. This is primarily driven by significantly 
reduced contract losses in the UK and US construction businesses 
as the Group continued to be more selective in the work that 
it bids, through increased bid margin thresholds, improved risk 
frameworks and better contract governance. Support Services 
and Infrastructure Investments continued to deliver excellent 
operating results, including the benefit of £65m of gains from 
investment disposals. 
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of financial performance which 
the Group believes should be separately identified on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
financial performance achieved by the Group.
Non-underlying items from continuing operations of £52m before 
tax were charged to the income statement. These comprised 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets of £9m, trading 
profits from Rail Germany of £1m, losses resulting from legacy 
ES contracts of £6m and other loss items of £38m.
Significant other non-underlying items included £14m of 
restructuring costs incurred relating to the Group’s Build to Last 
transformation programme which was launched in early 2015. 
As a result of a reassessment of potential liabilities on historical 
health and safety breaches following new sentencing guidelines 
introduced and the settlement of other historical claims, the Group 
revised its legal provisioning levels resulting in a £25m expense in 
the year. This has been presented as non-underlying because its 
size would otherwise distort the underlying performance achieved 
by the Group and the events giving rise to these expenses occurred 
in prior years. 
In 2016, the Group commissioned a revised independent actuarial 
report on its exposure to industrial disease related liabilities. As a 
result of the findings within this report, the Group has increased 
its provision held with respect to industrial disease related claims 
giving rise to a £14m charge to the income statement in the year. 
Non-underlying items continued 
The non-underlying charges recognised in 2016 were partially offset 
by a £9m gain following the release of all remaining provisions 
relating to Trans4m Ltd (Trans4m). Trans4m went into creditors’ 
voluntary liquidation on 27 June 2016. 
Net finance cost
Net finance cost of £7m in the year represents a decrease from 
£17m in 2015 mainly due to a £19m gain on foreign currency 
deposits in the year. 
Taxation
The Group’s underlying profit before tax from continuing operations 
for subsidiaries of £5 million (2015: £170 million loss) resulted in 
an underlying tax charge of £12 million (2015: £11 million). The tax 
charge principally arises due to significant non-recognition of 
deferred tax assets on losses incurred in the year. In addition tax 
is levied at the subsidiary level for US and Canada joint ventures 
and associates, rather than within the share of joint ventures 
and associates. 
Discontinued operations
In 2016, the Group reached a settlement with the purchaser of 
Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB), the Group’s former professional services 
business disposed in October 2014, in relation to outstanding tax 
matters and indemnities. The Group received an additional £9m as 
a result of this settlement. At the same time, provisions in relation 
to these matters have been released, resulting in an overall non-
underlying gain to the Group of £24m.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was nil 
(2015: 30.2p loss) as a result of significant improvements in the 
Group’s UK and US construction businesses as discussed above. 
Including the results from discontinued operations, the Group 
generated a basic earnings per share of 3.5p (2015: 30.1p loss). 
Underlying earnings per share from continuing operations was 7.0p 
(2015: 19.7p loss).

Commentary on Group Statement of Comprehensive Income
*
Total comprehensive loss for 2016 was £66m comprising a total 
profit after tax including discontinued operations of £24m and other 
comprehensive loss after tax of £90m. 
Background
The Group Statement of Comprehensive Income is presented on a 
total Group basis combining continuing and discontinued operations. 
Other comprehensive income (OCI) is categorised into items which 
will affect the profit and loss of the Group in subsequent periods 
when the gain or loss is realised and those which will not be recycled 
into the income statement.
Items which will not subsequently be reclassified to the 
income statement 
Actuarial movements on retirement benefit liabilities are increases 
or decreases in the present value of the pension liability because of:
 – differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and 
what has actually occurred; or
 – changes in actuarial assumptions used to value the obligations.
Actuarial losses for the Group including joint ventures and 
associates increased from £90m loss in 2015 to £120m loss in 
2016. Refer to Note 28.
Items which will subsequently be reclassified to the 
income statement 
Currency translation differences
The Group operates in a number of countries with different local 
currencies. Currency translation differences arise on translation of 
the balance sheet and results from the local functional currency into 
the Group’s presentational currency, sterling.
Fair value revaluations – PPP financial assets
Assets constructed by PPP concession companies are classified 
principally as available-for-sale financial assets. In the operational 
phase fair value is determined by discounting the future cash 
flows allocated to the financial asset using discount rates based on 
long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the 
assets, with market-related fair value movements recognised in 
OCI. During the year, there was a decrease in gilt rates resulting in a 
fair value gain including joint ventures and associates of £37m being 
taken through OCI (2015: £183m loss).
Fair value revaluations – cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges are principally interest rate swaps, to manage 
the interest rate and inflation rate risks in the Group’s Infrastructure 
Investments’ subsidiary, joint venture and associate companies 
which are exposed by their long-term contractual agreements. 
The fair value of derivatives changes in response to prevailing market 
conditions. During the year, LIBOR decreased resulting in a fair value 
loss on the interest rate swaps including joint ventures and associates 
of £108m being recognised in OCI (2015: £29m gain).
Recycling of reserves to the income statement on disposal
Fair value gains and losses and currency translation differences 
recognised in OCI are transferred to the income statement upon 
disposal of the asset and therefore on disposal of Infrastructure 
Investments’ concessions and other businesses, £8m profit 
including joint ventures and associates was recycled to the income 
statement through OCI and is included in the gain on disposal.
There is no associated tax on the amounts recycled to the 
income statement.

Group Statement of Comprehensive Income
For the year ended 31 December 2016
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
106 Commentary on Group Statement of Changes in Equity
*
Total equity holders’ funds of £757m at 31 December 2016 
decreased by 8% primarily due to movements in other 
comprehensive income.
Background
The Group Statement of Changes in Equity includes the total 
comprehensive income attributable to equity holders of the 
Company and non-controlling interests and also discloses 
transactions which have been recognised directly in equity 
and not through the income statement.
Dividends
The Board reinstated the dividend, declaring an interim dividend of 
0.9p in August 2016 which was paid in December 2016. The Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 1.8p. 
Joint ventures’ and associates’ dividends 
Dividends of £43m were received in the year from joint ventures 
and associates (JVA) resulting in a transfer of this amount between 
JVA reserves and Group retained profits.
Special reserve
A special reserve of £185m was created in 2004 as a result of 
cancelling £181m of share premium and cancelling the £4m capital 
redemption reserve in Balfour Beatty plc. This was approved by the 
court and becomes distributable to the extent of future increases 
in share capital and share premium, of which £nil occurred in 2016 
(2015: £1m).
Other reserves
Other reserves comprise: the equity components of the preference 
shares of £18m (2015: £18m) and convertible bonds £26m 
(2015: £26m); the hedging reserves £(30)m (2015: £(58)m); PPP 
financial assets revaluation reserve £25m (2015: £58m); currency 
translation reserve £135m (2015: £87m) and other reserves £17m 
(2015: £13m).
Other reserve transfers relating to joint venture and associate 
disposals 
On disposal of JVAs, retained profits relating to these 
businesses are transferred from the JVA reserves to the Group’s 
retained profits.

Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
108 Commentary on the Group Balance Sheet
*
Total assets of £4.8bn were 4% more than last year. Total liabilities 
of £4.0bn increased by 6%, resulting in an overall decrease in net 
assets of 8%. The decrease is primarily driven by actuarial losses on 
retirement benefit liabilities of £120m and fair value losses on the 
Group’s cash flow hedges of £108m, offset by fair value gains on 
the Group’s PPP financial assets of £37m and currency translation 
gains of £93m. 
Background
The Group’s Balance Sheet shows the Group’s assets and liabilities 
as at 31 December 2016. In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements and IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations, the Group does not re-present the 
prior year balance sheet for assets held for sale or disposals. 
Goodwill
The goodwill on the Group’s balance sheet at 31 December 2016 
increased to £937m (2015: £844m). The increase was primarily 
relating to currency translation differences. The Group has 
conducted impairment reviews on its goodwill balance at the year 
end and has concluded that it was fully recoverable. 
Investments in joint ventures and associates
Investments in joint ventures and associates have decreased to 
£628m in 2016 from £671m in 2015 primarily due to the disposal of 
the Infrastructure Fund. 
PPP financial assets
The £239m decrease in PPP financial assets is principally driven 
by the sale of 80% of the Group’s interest in five streetlighting 
projects. As a result, the Group no longer consolidates these five 
streetlighting projects as subsidiaries, and the Group has accounted 
for its remaining 20% interests as joint ventures. The Group 
recognised an underlying gain of £11m as a result of this sale. 
Working capital
Net movements in working capital are discussed in the statement 
of cash flows commentary on page 111.
Provisions are discussed in the working capital commentary and in 
detail in Note 25.
Borrowings
Borrowings excluding non-recourse loans
The Group’s committed facility totals £400m. The purpose of this 
facility is to provide liquidity from a set of core relationship banks to 
support Balfour Beatty in its activities.
The Group completed its refinancing in December 2015 with the 
new facility extending though to 2018. In November 2016, £375m 
of the facility was extended until 2019. A further one-year extension 
through to 2020 of the whole £400m facility is available, subject 
to bank approval. At 31 December 2016, £350m of this facility 
was undrawn. 
The Group’s borrowings include recourse borrowings to the Group 
arising from certain Infrastructure Investment projects in North 
America amounting to £12m (2015: £10m).
Non-recourse loans
In addition, the Group has non-recourse facilities in 
companies engaged in certain construction and infrastructure 
concessions projects.
At 31 December 2016, the Group’s share of non-recourse net 
borrowings amounted to £1,806m (2015: £2,014m), comprising 
£1,573m (2015: £1,649m) in relation to joint ventures and 
associates as disclosed in Note 18.2 and £233m (2015: £365m) 
on the Group balance sheet in relation to subsidiaries as disclosed 
in Note 26.
Retirement benefit liabilities
The Group’s balance sheet includes retirement benefit liabilities of 
£231m (2015: £146m) representing deficits in the Group’s pension 
schemes. These liabilities increased primarily due to actuarial losses 
on pension scheme obligations. Refer to Note 28 for further details.
Any surplus of deficit contributions would be recoverable by way 
of a refund as the Group has the unconditional right to the surplus 
and controls the run-off of the benefit obligations once all other 
obligations of the schemes have been settled.
Other
In addition to the liabilities on the balance sheet, in the normal 
course of its business, the Group arranges for financial institutions 
to provide customers with guarantees in connection with its 
contracting activities, commonly referred to as bonds. These bonds 
provide a customer with a level of financial protection in the event 
that a contractor fails to meet its commitments under the terms of a 
contract. They are customary or mandatory in many of the markets 
in which the Group operates. In return for issuing the bonds, the 
financial institutions receive a fee and a counter-indemnity from 
the Company. As at 31 December 2016, contract bonds in issue by 
financial institutions under uncommitted facilities covered £4.0bn 
(2015: £3.4bn) of the contract commitments of the Group.
Equity commitments
During 2016, the Group invested £65m (2015: £102m) in a 
combination of equity and shareholder loans to Infrastructure 
Investments’ project companies and at the end of the year had 
committed to provide a further £131m from 2017 onwards, 
inclusive of £56m expected for projects at preferred bidder stage. 
£33m of this is expected to be invested in 2017, as disclosed in 
Note 39(f).

Group Statement of Cash Flows
For the year ended 31 December 2016
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
110 Commentary on the Group Statement of Cash Flows
*
Cash and cash equivalents increased by 16% during the year to £768m. 
Cash used in operating activities deteriorated by 5% to £136m.
Background
The Group Statement of Cash Flows shows the cash flows from 
operating, investing and financing activities during the year.
Working capital
Working capital includes: inventories and non-construction work 
in progress; amounts due to and from construction contract 
customers; operating trade and other receivables; operating trade 
and other payables; and operating provisions. Where the net 
working capital balance is in an asset position, ie the inventory and 
receivables balances are greater than the payables and provisions, 
this is referred to as unfavourable/positive working capital. 
Where this is not the case, this is referred to as favourable/negative 
working capital.
Working capital movements
The movement of the individual working capital balances on the 
balance sheet will not be reflective of the underlying movement of 
working capital due to the balance sheet being affected by foreign 
currency movements. 
Working capital movements are disclosed in Note 31.1.
Inventories and non-construction work in progress
During 2016, underlying inventories and non-construction work in 
progress decreased by £42m for continuing operations due to the 
Group’s continued focus on reducing these balances.
Amounts due from/to construction contract customers
Movements in the Group’s underlying due from/to construction 
contract customers balances, which reflect the net unbilled contract 
position and traded profit and loss for each individual construction 
contract generated an underlying working capital inflow of £46m 
(2015: inflow of £297m). The inflow was mainly derived from an 
improvement in billing, offset by the flow of cash from contract 
losses recognised in prior years.
Operating trade and other receivables
During 2016, there was a £121m increase in underlying operating 
trade and other receivables for continuing operations, this is caused 
by quicker billing of construction contract amounts, an increase 
in retentions as projects mature and also a reflection of the large 
receipts into the business in December 2015. 
Operating trade and other payables 
During 2016, there was a £53m decrease in underlying operating 
trade and other payables for continuing operations as a result of the 
expected cash outflows on historical loss making jobs.
Provisions
During 2016, there was a £4m increase in underlying operating 
provisions for continuing operations as a result of additional 
provisions taken on defects.
Cash used in operations 
Underlying cash used in continuing operations of £132m 
(2015: £84m) comprised a profit from operations of £67m 
(2015: £106m loss), a working capital outflow of £82m 
(2015: £179m inflow) and includes the following significant 
adjustment items: share of results of joint ventures and associates 
£55m (2015: £47m), depreciation charges of £29m (2015: £33m), 
pension deficit payments of £41m (2015: £66m) and gain on 
disposals of investments in infrastructure concessions of £65m 
(2015: £95m).
Non-underlying cash used in continuing operations of £15m 
(2015: £54m) was impacted by a loss from operations of £52m 
(2015: £76m) and a working capital inflow of £34m (2015: £5m 
outflow), after adjusting for the following non-cash items: an £8m 
gain on disposal of businesses (2015: £13m), a depreciation charge 
of £1m (2015: £2m) relating to Rail Germany, a £3m impairment 
of land relating to Blackpool airport (2015: £4m impairment of 
goodwill) and an amortisation charge of £9m (2015: £10m) on 
acquired intangible assets.
Cash flows from investing activities 
The Group received dividends of £43m (2015: £69m) from joint 
ventures and associates during the year.
During the year, the Group incurred additional spend on intangible 
assets of £11m (2015: £43m) of which £6m (2015: £23m) related to 
the construction spend on the Edinburgh student accommodation 
and £5m (2015: £20m) related to software and other intangible 
assets. The £41m (2015: £36m) property, plant and equipment 
purchased during the year comprised: capitalisation of the cost 
relating to constructing Phase 2 of the student accommodation 
in Iowa of £14m (2015: £9m); the purchase of land of £10m 
(2015: £6m) and the purchase of plant and equipment of £17m 
(2015: £21m). Cash paid towards investment properties was £32m 
(2015: £4m), primarily in relation to the construction of Kennedy 
Street student accommodation.
The Group disposed of interests in ten infrastructure concession 
joint ventures during the year for £155m (2015: £104m). 
In addition the Group disposed of 80% of its interest in five 
streetlighting projects for £17m, net of cash disposed (2015: £23m 
(100% disposal of subsidiary)). The Group also received £14m 
(2015: £16m) on the disposal of other subsidiaries comprising: £9m 
in relation to the disposal of Parsons Brinckerhoff and £5m on the 
disposal of parts of Rail Germany.
During the year, the Group incurred cash expenditure of £31m 
(2015: £75m) and received cash receipts of £39m (2015: £30m) 
relating to PPP financial assets.
Cash flows from financing activities
The Group made further drawdowns on its non-recourse 
borrowings of £65m (2015: £79m) mainly to finance the 
construction of assets within its infrastructure portfolio. 
Drawdowns on recourse borrowings were £52m (2015: £nil).
Preference dividends of £12m (2015: £11m) were paid in the year.
Total interest payments amounted to £72m (2015: £51m) during 
the year of which £24m (2015: £19m) related to infrastructure 
concessions and £48m (2015: £32m) related to the US private 
placement, convertible bonds and recourse borrowings drawn 
down by the Group.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents increased from £663m to £768m.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 111 Strategic Report 1 Basis of accounting
The annual financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis as discussed on page 52 and in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that 
are applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group has 
applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee as adopted by the 
European Union and effective for accounting periods beginning on 
1 January 2016.
The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, except as described under Note 2.26. 
The functional and presentational currency of the Company and 
the presentational currency of the Group is sterling.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). The Company 
meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial 
Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2016 the Company 
has undergone transition from reporting under IFRS to FRS 101 as 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
On adoption of FRS 101, no significant impacts from any changes in 
accounting policies have been noted, and no transition adjustments 
were required on the prior year financial statements. Therefore the 
opening balance sheet on transition has not been presented. 
No presentational changes were required to the Company 
balance sheet.
Except as noted below, the Company’s accounting policies are 
consistent with those described in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. As permitted by FRS 101, the Company 
has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available 
under that standard in relation to share-based payments, 
financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a 
cash flow statement, related party transactions and comparative 
information. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
In addition to the application of FRS 101, the Company has 
taken advantage of Section 408 of the Act and consequently its 
statement of comprehensive income (including the profit and loss 
account) is not presented as part of these accounts.
2 Principal accounting policies
2.1 Accounting standards 
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following accounting standards, interpretations and 
amendments have been adopted by the Group in the 
current period:
 – Amendments to the following standards:
 – IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in 
Joint Operations
 – IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
 – IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of 
Depreciation and Amortisation
 – IAS 16 and IAS 41: Agricultural: Bearer Plants
 – IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
 – IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities: Applying 
the Consolidation Exemption
 – Improvements to IFRSs (2012–2014).
The above new and amended standards do not have a material 
effect on the Group. 
Accounting standards not yet adopted by the Group
The following accounting standards, interpretations and 
amendments have been issued by the IASB but had either not 
been adopted by the European Union or were not yet effective 
in the European Union at 31 December 2016:
 – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 – IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
 – IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 – IFRS 16 Leases
 – Amendments to the following standards:
 – IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
 – IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses
 – IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property
 – IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based 
Payment Transactions
 – IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts
 – IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between 
an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
 – Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers
 – IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and 
Advance Consideration
 – Improvements to IFRSs (2014–2016).
The Directors continue to assess the impact of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 
and IFRS 16 but do not expect the other standards above to have 
a material quantitative effect. 
The requirements of IFRS 9 in issue as at 31 December 2016 are 
being assessed and might result in the Group’s PPP financial assets 
being reclassified from ‘available-for-sale’, which is a category that 
no longer exists under the new standard, to a debt instrument 
measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through profit 
or loss. Assuming the Group adopts the fair value through profit 
or loss option, movements in the fair value of PPP financial assets 
will no longer be recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Retrospective application of this requirement would result in the 
closing balance of fair value movements recognised in PPP financial 
asset reserves being transferred to retained earnings. The effect 
within the Group’s reserves would be a transfer of £25m from PPP 
financial asset reserves to retained earnings. The effect within the 
share of joint ventures’ and associates’ reserves would be a transfer 
of £227m from PPP financial asset reserves to retained earnings. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued by 
the IASB in May 2014 and will be effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The new standard will replace 
existing accounting standards, and provides enhanced detail on the 
principle of recognising revenue to reflect the transfer of goods 
and services to customers at a value which the company expects 
to be entitled to receive. The standard also updates revenue 
disclosure requirements. 
The Group has commenced its impact assessment, which involves 
carrying out a systematic review of all existing major contracts 
to ensure that the impact and effect of the new standard is fully 
understood and changes to the current accounting procedures 
are highlighted and acted upon in advance of the effective date. 
The results of this assessment will drive the Group’s choice of 
transition option albeit it is likely that the Group will adopt this 
standard prospectively. The Group intends to disclose the impact 
of the new standard on its 2016 results in the 2017 interim 
financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements 2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.1 Accounting standards continued
Accounting standards not yet adopted by the Group continued
IFRS 16 Leases was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and is 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2019. The new standard will replace IAS 17 Leases and will 
eliminate the classification of leases as either operating leases or 
finance leases and, instead, introduce a single lessee accounting 
model. The adoption of IFRS 16 is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s net results or net assets, although 
the full impact will be subject to further assessment.
The Group has chosen not to adopt any of the above standards and 
interpretations earlier than required.
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the Company 
and its subsidiaries, together with the Group’s share of the results 
of joint ventures and associates, drawn up to 31 December 
each year.
a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group 
controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. On acquisition, the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at 
their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the fair 
value of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of 
the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets acquired (discount on acquisition) is credited to the income 
statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of non-controlling equity holders is stated at the non-
controlling equity holders’ proportion of the fair value of the assets 
and liabilities recognised.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on 
disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value 
of any retained interest less direct costs of the transaction and 
(ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), 
less liabilities of the subsidiary. The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost 
is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition 
of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for in the same manner 
as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were 
disposed of (ie reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly 
to retained earnings).
Any acquisition or disposal which does not result in a change in 
control is accounted for as a transaction between equity holders. 
The carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling 
interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the fair value 
of the consideration paid or received and the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity 
and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are adjusted where necessary 
to ensure consistency with those used by the Group. All intra-
Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
b) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group 
has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of 
the entity, rather than rights to its individual assets and obligations 
for its individual liabilities.
Associates are those entities over whose financial and operating 
policies the Group has significant influence, but not control or 
joint control. 
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and associates are 
incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting except when classified as held for sale. The Group 
may elect to measure some of its investments in associates at fair 
value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39 where the 
investment is held by a Group entity which meets the classification 
of a venture capital organisation, in which case the investment will 
be marked to market with movements being recognised in the 
income statement. The equity return from the military housing 
joint ventures of the Group is contractually limited to a maximum 
level of return, beyond which the Group does not share in any 
further return. Therefore the Group’s investment in these projects is 
recognised at initial equity investment plus the value of the Group’s 
accrued preferred return from the underlying projects.
Any excess of the fair value of the cost of acquisition over the 
Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of 
the joint venture or associate entity at the date of acquisition is 
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the fair value of the cost 
of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets of the joint venture or associate at the date 
of acquisition (discount on acquisition) is credited to the income 
statement in the period of acquisition.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially carried in 
the balance sheet at cost (including goodwill arising on acquisition) 
and adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the joint venture or associate, less any impairment in 
the value of individual investments. Losses of joint ventures and 
associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those joint ventures 
and associates are only recognised to the extent that the Group is 
contractually liable for, or has a constructive obligation to meet, the 
obligations of the joint ventures and associates.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions with joint ventures and 
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
relevant joint venture or associate.
c) Joint operations
The Group’s share of the results, assets and liabilities of contracts 
carried out in conjunction with another party are included under 
each relevant heading in the income statement and balance sheet.
balfourbeatty.com/AR2016
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 113 Strategic Report 2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.3 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the rates of exchange at the reporting date. Significant exchange 
rates used in the preparation of these financial statements are 
shown in Note 3.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, 
the results of foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint venture 
entities are translated at average rates of exchange for the year, 
unless the exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, 
in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are 
used. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at the reporting date. Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rates of 
exchange at the reporting date. Currency translation differences 
arising are transferred to the Group’s foreign currency translation 
reserve and are recognised in the income statement on disposal of 
the underlying investment.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the 
Group may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts. Refer to 
Note 2.25(c) for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect 
of such derivative financial instruments.
2.4 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for goods and services provided, net of 
trade discounts, value added and similar sales based taxes, after 
eliminating revenue within the Group.
Revenue is recognised as follows:
 – revenue from construction and service activities represents the 
value of work carried out during the year, including amounts 
not invoiced
 – revenue from manufacturing activities is recognised when title 
has passed
 – interest income is accrued on a time basis using the effective 
interest method by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount
 – dividend income is recognised when the equity holder’s right to 
receive payment is established.
2.5 Construction and service contracts 
When the outcome of individual contracts can be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue and contract costs are recognised as revenue and 
expenses respectively by reference to the stage of completion at 
the reporting date.
Costs are recognised as incurred and revenue is recognised on the 
basis of the proportion of total costs at the reporting date to the 
estimated total costs of the contract. Estimates of the final out-turn 
on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account 
of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified 
during the early stages of the contract. The cost contingencies are 
reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are 
adjusted where appropriate. However, the nature of the risks on 
contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end 
of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the 
project. Management continually review the estimated final out-turn 
on contracts, and in certain limited cases, assess recoveries from 
insurers, and make adjustments where necessary. 
No margin is recognised until the outcome of the contract can be 
estimated with reasonable certainty.
Provision is made for all known or expected losses on individual 
contracts once such losses are foreseen.
Revenue in respect of variations to contracts and incentive 
payments is recognised when it is probable it will be agreed by 
the customer. Revenue in respect of claims is recognised when 
negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is 
probable that the customer will accept the claim and the probable 
amount can be measured reliably.
Profit for the year includes the benefit of claims settled in the year 
on contracts completed in previous years.
2.6 Segmental reporting
The Group considers its Board of Directors to be the chief operating 
decision maker and therefore the segmental disclosures provided 
in Note 5 are aligned with the monthly reports provided to the 
Board of Directors. The Group’s reporting segments are based 
on the types of services provided. Operating segments with 
similar economic characteristics have been aggregated into three 
reportable segments which reflect the nature of the services 
provided by the Group. A description of each reportable segment is 
provided in Note 5. Further information on the business activities of 
each reportable segment is set out on pages 18 to 29.
Working capital is the balance sheet measure reported to the chief 
operating decision maker. The profitability measure used to assess 
the performance of the Group is underlying profit from operations.
Segment results represent the contribution of the different 
segments after the allocation of attributable corporate overheads. 
Transactions between segments are conducted at arm’s-length 
market prices. Segment assets and liabilities comprise those assets 
and liabilities directly attributable to the segments. Corporate assets 
and liabilities include cash balances, bank borrowings, tax balances 
and dividends payable. Non-recourse net borrowings are directly 
attributable to Infrastructure Investments and therefore not included 
within Corporate activities.
Major customers are defined as customers contributing more than 
10% of the Group’s external revenue.
2.7 Pre-contract bid costs and recoveries
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until it is virtually 
certain that a contract will be awarded, from which time further 
pre-contract costs are recognised as an asset and charged as 
an expense over the period of the contract. Amounts recovered 
in respect of pre-contract costs that have been written off are 
deferred and amortised over the life of the contract.
For construction and services projects, the relevant contract is 
the construction or services contract respectively. With respect 
to PPP projects, an assessment is made as to which contractual 
element the pre-contract costs relate to, in order to determine 
the relevant period for amortisation. The relevant contract is that 
which gives rise to a financial or intangible asset, which is either the 
construction contract or the contract which transferred the asset to 
the project.
2.8 Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after the Group’s share of the post-
tax results of equity accounted joint venture entities and associates, 
but before investment income and finance costs.
2.9 Finance costs
Finance costs of debt, including premiums payable on settlement 
and direct issue costs, are charged to the income statement on an 
accruals basis over the term of the instrument, using the effective 
interest method.

2.10 Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of financial performance which 
the Group believes should be separately identified on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
financial performance achieved by the Group. Such items will 
not affect the absolute amount of the results for the period and 
the trend of results. Underlying items are items before non-
underlying items.
Non-underlying items include:
 – gains and losses on the disposal of businesses and investments, 
unless this is part of a programme of releasing value from 
the disposal of similar businesses or investments such as 
infrastructure concessions
 – costs of major restructuring and reorganisation of 
existing businesses
 – costs of integrating newly acquired businesses
 – acquisition and similar costs related to business combinations 
such as transaction costs
 – impairment and amortisation charges on intangible assets 
arising on business combinations (amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets)
 – impairment of goodwill.
These are examples, however, from time to time it may be 
appropriate to disclose further items as non-underlying items in 
order to highlight the underlying performance of the Group.
The results of Rail Germany and certain legacy ES contracts have 
been included as non-underlying. Refer to Note 5. 
2.11 Taxation
The tax charge comprises current tax and deferred tax, calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date. Current tax and deferred tax are charged or 
credited to the income statement, except when they relate to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the relevant tax 
is also accounted for within equity. Current tax is based on the profit 
for the year.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
on such assets and liabilities is not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can 
be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.12 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and other 
businesses, joint ventures and associates and represents the 
excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill on acquisitions 
of subsidiaries and other businesses is included in non-current 
assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates 
is included in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is included 
when determining the profit or loss on subsequent disposal of 
the business to which it relates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRS (1 January 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment. Goodwill written 
off or discount arising on acquisition credited to reserves under UK 
GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
b) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation charges in 
respect of software and Infrastructure Investments intangibles 
are included in underlying items.
c) Research and development
Internally generated intangible assets developed by the Group are 
recognised only if all the following conditions are met:
 – an asset is created that can be identified
 – it is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic benefits
 – the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Other research expenditure is written off in the period in which it 
is incurred.
2.13 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
associated with bringing the asset to its operating location 
and condition.
2.14 Investment property
The Group classifies land and buildings which it holds to generate 
capital appreciation and/or to earn rental income as investment 
property. The Group has chosen to state its investment properties 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
balfourbeatty.com/AR2016
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 115 Strategic Report 2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.15 Leasing
Leases which transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee are classified as finance leases. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, determined at the inception of the 
lease, and depreciation is provided accordingly. The liability to the 
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant 
effective rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
2.16 Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life (such as goodwill arising 
on acquisitions) are reviewed at least annually for impairment. 
Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment whenever there is any indication that the 
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. Value in use is assessed by discounting the 
estimated future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. 
For this purpose assets, including goodwill, are grouped into cash-
generating units representing the level at which they are monitored 
by the Board of Directors for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent 
periods. Reversals of other impairment losses are recognised 
in income when they arise.
2.17 Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade date 
where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-
for-sale investments are recognised in equity, until the investment 
is disposed or is determined to be impaired, at which time 
the cumulative gain or loss is included in the net profit or loss 
for the period. Held to maturity investments are measured at 
amortised cost.
2.18 Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets and groups of assets to be disposed of are 
classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
Held for sale assets are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount on classification as held for sale or fair value less costs 
to sell.
A component of the Group is presented as a discontinued operation 
if it has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and 
it is a separate major line of business or geographic operation or 
the proposed sale is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of 
a single separate major line of business or geographical operation. 
When classified as a discontinued operation, income statement 
performance is reported in summary form outside continuing 
operations and comparative figures are restated.
2.19 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes an appropriate proportion of manufacturing 
overheads incurred in bringing inventories to their present location 
and condition and is determined using the first-in first-out method. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution.
2.20 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recorded at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost as reduced by 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
2.21 Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at cost.
2.22 Provisions
Provisions for insurance liabilities retained in the Group’s captive 
insurance arrangements, legal claims, defects and warranties, 
environmental restoration, onerous leases, and other onerous 
commitments are recognised at the best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability.
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
2.23 Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are included in the 
carrying amount of the instrument and are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method 
together with the interest payable.
2.24 Retirement benefit costs
The Group, through trustees, operates a number of defined benefit 
and defined contribution retirement and other long-term employee 
benefit schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit 
type and are funded. Defined benefit contributions are determined 
in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of 
providing benefits recognised in the income statement and the 
defined benefit obligations are determined at the reporting date 
by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet comprises the present 
value of the defined benefit pension obligation, determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash flows using the market yield 
on a high-quality corporate bond, less the fair value of the scheme 
assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged 
to the income statement as they fall due.
Any surplus of deficit contributions to the Balfour Beatty Pension 
Fund (BBPF) and the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS) would be 
recoverable by way of a refund as the Group has the unconditional 
right to the surplus and controls the run-off of the benefit 
obligations once all other obligations of the BBPF and RPS have 
been settled. Implementation of the draft Amendment to IFRIC 14 
when it becomes effective will not affect this accounting.

Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016
116 2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.25 Share-based payments 
Employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity- 
settled awards are charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair values of the 
awards at the date of grant. 
The credits in respect of the amounts charged are included within 
separate reserves in equity until such time as the awards are 
exercised, when the shares are transferred to employees. 
2.26 Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
a) Classification of financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
b) Cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares and 
convertible bonds
The Company’s cumulative convertible redeemable preference 
shares and the Group’s convertible bonds are compound 
instruments, comprising a liability component and an equity 
component. The fair value of the liability components was 
estimated using the prevailing market interest rates at the dates 
of issue for similar non-convertible instruments. The difference 
between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and 
convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the respective 
liability components, representing the embedded option to convert 
the liability components into the Company’s ordinary shares, 
is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability components is calculated by 
applying applicable market interest rates for similar non-convertible 
debt prevailing at the dates of issue to the liability components 
of the instruments. The difference between this amount and the 
dividend/interest payable is included in the carrying amount of the 
liability component and is charged to the income statement on an 
accrual basis together with the dividend/interest payable.
c) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage 
interest rate risk and to hedge exposures to fluctuations in 
foreign currencies in accordance with its risk management policy. 
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. A description of the Group’s objectives, 
policies and strategies with regard to derivatives and other financial 
instruments is set out in Note 38.
Derivatives are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair 
value on the date the derivative transaction is entered into and 
are subsequently re-measured at their fair values.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that 
are attributable to the hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives that 
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised 
in other comprehensive income (OCI). Changes in the fair value 
of the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognised 
in the income statement. Amounts originally recognised in OCI 
are transferred to the income statement when the underlying 
transaction occurs or, if the transaction results in a non-financial 
asset or liability, are included in the initial cost of that asset 
or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument recognised in OCI is retained in equity until 
the hedged transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in 
OCI is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host 
contracts are treated as separate derivatives and recorded in the 
balance sheet at fair value when their risks and characteristics are 
not closely related to those of the host contract. Changes in the 
fair value of those embedded derivatives recognised in the balance 
sheet are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
d) PPP concession companies
Assets constructed by PPP concession companies are classified 
principally as available-for-sale financial assets.
In the construction phase, income is recognised by applying an 
attributable profit margin to the construction costs representing 
the fair value of construction services performed. In the operational 
phase, income is recognised by allocating a proportion of total cash 
receivable over the life of the project to service costs by means of 
a deemed rate of return on those costs. The residual element of 
projected cash is allocated to the financial asset using the effective 
interest rate method, giving rise to interest income.
Due to the nature of the contractual arrangements, the projected 
cash flows can be estimated with a high degree of certainty.
In the construction phase, the fair value of the Group’s PPP 
financial assets is determined by applying an attributable profit 
margin to the construction costs representing the fair value of 
construction services performed. In the operational phase, fair 
value is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated 
to the financial asset using discount rates based on long-term 
gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets, 
with market-related movements in fair value recognised in OCI. 
Amounts originally recognised in OCI are transferred to the 
income statement upon disposal of the asset.
2.27 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect amounts recognised for assets and 
liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and 
expenses incurred during the reporting period. Actual outcomes 
may differ from these judgements, estimates and assumptions.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have the most 
significant effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities of the 
Group as at 31 December 2016 are discussed below.
All of the below are both judgements and estimates made by the 
Group apart from the classification of non-underlying items which 
is an item that requires judgement only.
a) Revenue and margin recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition and margin recognition policies, 
which are set out in Notes 2.4 and 2.5, are central to how the 
Group values the work it has carried out in each financial year.
These policies require forecasts to be made of the outcomes of 
long-term construction services and support services contracts, 
which require assessments and judgements to be made on 
recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in the scope of work, 
contract programmes, maintenance and defects liabilities and 
changes in costs.
balfourbeatty.com/AR2016
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 117 Strategic Report 2 Principal accounting policies continued
2.27 Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
continued
Across Construction Services there remain a small number of 
long-term and complex projects where the Group has incorporated 
significant judgements over contractual entitlements. The range 
of potential outcomes in future financial periods could result in a 
materially positive or negative swing to underlying profitability and 
cash flow. In the UK, the majority of these contracts are within 
Major Projects. Outside the UK, this primarily relates to a number 
of significant contracts in Hong Kong where the range of potential 
outcomes could result in a materially positive or negative swing 
to profitability. The majority of these claims are expected to reach 
commercial settlement by 2018.
b) Taxation
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and 
judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for 
income taxes. The Group provides for future liabilities in respect of 
uncertain tax positions where additional tax may become payable 
in future periods and such provisions are based on management’s 
assessment of exposures. This may involve a significant amount of 
judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to different 
interpretation. Management uses both in-house and external 
tax experts and previous experience when assessing tax risks. 
Where actual tax liabilities differ from the provisions, adjustments 
are made which can have a material impact on the Group’s profit for 
the year.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally provided for in full and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is judged probable 
that future taxable profit will arise against which the temporary 
differences will be utilised. Refer to Note 27.
c) Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are items of financial performance which 
the Group believes should be separately identified on the face of 
the income statement to assist in understanding the underlying 
financial performance achieved by the Group. Determining whether 
an item is part of underlying items or non-underlying items 
requires judgement. A total non-underlying loss after tax of £24m 
(2015: £71m) was charged to the income statement for the year 
ended 31 December 2016. Refer to Note 10.
d) Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of 
the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimate to be made of the timing and amount of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and the application 
of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. 
A nominal growth rate, based on real GDP growth plus CPI inflation, 
is used to calculate a terminal growth multiple in accordance with 
the Gordon Growth Model. The discount rates used are based on 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect 
the specific economic environment of the relevant cash-generating 
unit. The carrying value of goodwill at 31 December 2016 was 
£937m (2015: £844m). Refer to Note 14.
e) Available-for-sale financial assets
At 31 December 2016, £2,292m (2015: £2,638m) of PPP financial 
assets constructed by the Group’s subsidiary, joint venture and 
associate companies were classified as available-for-sale financial 
assets. In the operational phase the fair value of these financial 
assets is measured at each reporting date by discounting the future 
value of the cash flows allocated to the financial asset. A range of 
discount rates is used from 2.3% to 8.3% (2015: 3.61% to 5.10%), 
which reflects the prevailing risk-free interest rates and the different 
risk profiles of the various concessions. Refer to Note 38.2.
A £37m gain was taken to other comprehensive income in 2016 
(2015: £183m loss) and a cumulative fair value gain of £349m 
had arisen on these financial assets as a result of market-
related movements in the fair value of these financial assets at 
31 December 2016 (2015: £441m gain).
f) Recoverable value of recognised receivables
The Group has recognised trade receivables with a carrying value 
of £647m (2015: £495m). The recoverability of trade receivables is 
regularly reviewed in the light of the available economic information 
specific to each receivable and specific provisions are recognised 
for balances considered to be irrecoverable. Refer to Note 23.
g) Provisions
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and therefore 
in making a reliable estimate of the quantum and timing of liabilities 
judgement is applied and re-evaluated at each reporting date. 
The Group recognised provisions at 31 December 2016 of £273m 
(2015: £206m). Refer to Note 25.
h) Retirement benefit obligations 
Details of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are set out 
in Note 28, including tables showing the sensitivity of the pension 
scheme obligations and assets to different actuarial assumptions.
At 31 December 2016, the retirement benefit liabilities recognised 
on the Group’s balance sheet were £231m (2015: £146m). 
The effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying 
the schemes’ obligations and discount rates and the differences 
between expected and actual returns on the schemes’ assets are 
classified as actuarial gains and losses. During 2016, the Group 
recognised net actuarial losses of £120m in equity (2015: £90m 
losses), including its share of the actuarial gains and losses arising in 
joint ventures and associates.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 119 Strategic Report 5 Segment analysis
Reportable segments of the Group:
 – Construction Services – activities resulting in the physical construction of an asset
 – Support Services – activities which support existing assets or functions such as asset maintenance and refurbishment
 – Infrastructure Investments – acquisition, operation and disposal of infrastructure assets such as roads, hospitals, schools, student 
accommodation, military housing, offshore transmission networks, waste and biomass and other concessions. This segment also 
includes the Group’s housing development division.
The Group has continued to present the remaining parts of Rail Germany outside of underlying items as it remains committed to exiting 
its Mainland European rail businesses as soon as possible and does not consider its operations part of the Group’s underlying activity. 
Following the various disposals of parts of Rail Germany in 2015 and 2016, the Group is winding down its remaining operations in Rail 
Germany with the last remaining contract expected to reach completion in 2018. 
In 2014, the performance of external Engineering Services (ES) contracts linked to poor legacy management and in regions that ES has 
withdrawn from tendering for third-party work was included in non-underlying items as the size and nature of the losses due to the 
problematic delivery of these contracts are exceptional and distort the underlying performance of the Group. The Group continues to present 
the results from these legacy contracts within non-underlying and will continue to do so until these contracts reach completion, inclusive of 
any claims recovery. Separate disclosure of these contracts aids the reader’s understanding of the underlying performance of the remainder 
of the Group.

10.1.1 Rail Germany was reclassified from discontinued operations in 2014 and has continued to be presented as part of the Group’s  
non-underlying items within continuing operations. Refer to Note 5. In 2016, the remaining parts of Rail Germany generated a profit before 
tax excluding share of joint ventures and associates of £1m (2015: £3m loss before tax). 
10.1.2 The Group has continued to present the results of certain external legacy Engineering Services (ES) contracts in non-underlying 
items. These contracts were classified as non-underlying items in 2014 as the performance of these contracts was linked to poor legacy 
management and in regions where ES has withdrawn from tendering for third-party work. Refer to Note 5. These contracts resulted in 
a loss before tax for the Group of £6m in 2016 (2015: £8m). No tax credit has been recognised on this loss. 
10.1.3 The amortisation of acquired intangible assets from continuing operations comprises: customer contracts £6m (2015: £6m); customer 
relationships £3m (2015: £3m); and brand names £nil (2015: £1m). These have been included as non-underlying items as they relate to costs 
arising on acquisition of businesses. 
The charge was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services £3m (2015: £4m) and Infrastructure Investments £6m 
(2015: £6m).
10.1.4.1 The Group launched its Build to Last transformation programme in February 2015. The transformation programme is aimed to 
drive continual improvement across all of the Group’s businesses and realise operational efficiencies. As a result of this programme, 
restructuring costs of £14m were incurred in 2016 relating to: Construction Services £12m; Support Services £1m; and Corporate £1m. 
These restructuring costs comprise: redundancy costs £9m; external advisers £2m; property-related costs £1m; and other restructuring 
costs £2m.
In 2015, the Group incurred restructuring costs of £23m relating to: Construction Services £14m; Support Services £6m; and Corporate 
£3m. These restructuring costs comprise: redundancy costs £13m; external advisers £5m; property-related costs £1m; and other 
restructuring costs £4m.

Governance Financial Statements Other Information 125 Strategic Report 10 Non-underlying items continued
Continuing operations continued
10.1.4.2 In 2016, potential liabilities on historical health and safety breaches were reassessed following new sentencing guidelines 
introduced and the settlement of other historical claims previously treated as non-underlying items. As a result of this, the Group has revised 
its legal provisioning levels relating to these items, recognising an expense of £25m. This has been presented as non-underlying because 
its size would otherwise distort the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group and the events giving rise to these expenses 
occurred in prior years. 
The charge was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services £13m and Support Services £12m.
10.1.4.3 In 2016, the Group has released all remaining provisions relating to Trans4m Ltd (Trans4m) amounting to £9m, £1m of which 
has been recognised at the joint venture level. Trans4m was an equal joint operation between Balfour Beatty and three other partner 
shareholders and was contracted to Metronet as part of the London Underground PPP . The provisions were originally recorded in non-
underlying items in 2007. Trans4m went into creditors’ voluntary liquidation on 27 June 2016.
The credit was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services £8m and Support Services £1m. 
10.1.4.4 In 2016, the Group commissioned a revised independent actuarial report on its exposure to industrial disease related liabilities. 
These are mostly for asbestos-related claims in relation to events pre-1972 which are not insured by the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. As a result of the findings within this report, the Group has increased its provision held with respect to industrial disease related 
liabilities, resulting in a £14m charge to the income statement. This has been presented as non-underlying because its size would otherwise 
distort the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group and the events giving rise to these liabilities occurred in prior years. 
The entire charge was recognised within Construction Services. 
10.1.4.5 In 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners, comprising its 17.8% interest in the 
Infrastructure Fund and 100% interest in the fund’s advisor. Initial consideration of £48m was received, resulting in a gain of £3m to the 
Group. Refer to Notes 32.2.4 and 32.2.5.
10.1.4.6 In 2016, an impairment of £3m was recognised on land held at Blackpool Airport. The land was originally held in connection with the 
Group’s former operation of the airport. In 2015, goodwill amounting to £4m in relation to Blackpool Airport was fully written down.
10.1.4.7 On 27 May 2015, the Group disposed of its 50% interest in Signalling Solutions Ltd (SSL) for a cash consideration of £18m, resulting 
in a £16m gain in 2015. In 2016, additional consideration received resulted in a further gain of £2m being reported. In addition to this, a £1m 
pension settlement gain arose as a result of transferring pension liabilities relating to the employees of SSL to the new employer. This gain 
was recognised within Construction Services. 
10.1.4.8 In September 2016, the Group completed the disposal of parts of Rail Germany to Tianjin Keyvia Electric Co Ltd for a cash 
consideration of £15m. Refer to Note 32.2.7. This sale resulted in a £2m gain as a result of recycling of foreign currency reserves. The related 
assets disposed were impaired by £11m in 2015 to reflect the value of the agreed consideration. £4m of that impairment was recognised at 
the joint venture level. Refer to Note 10.1.5.2.
In 2015, the Group disposed of other parts of Rail Germany to the Rhomberg Sersa Rail Group for a cash consideration of £9m resulting in a 
£3m loss in 2015. Refer to Notes 32.3.1 and 32.3.4.
10.1.4.9 A settlement gain of £1m (2015: £3m) was recognised in relation to commutation options offered by the Balfour Beatty Pension 
Fund since 2014. Refer to Note 28.
10.1.4.10 In 2015, following the disposal of Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB) on 31 October 2014, the Group incurred £4m of costs relating to 
restructuring the continuing operations of Heery Inc. which was previously reliant on PB for its back office functions.
In 2015, additional restructuring costs of £5m were incurred in Rail Germany relating to the restructuring of overheads post completion of 
disposal of parts of the business. These restructuring costs comprise redundancy costs of £1m and other restructuring costs of £4m. 
Both Heery and Rail Germany are included within the Construction Services segment. 
10.1.4.11 In 2015, transitioning other operating companies to the UK shared service centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and increasing the scope 
led to incremental costs of £8m.
10.1.4.12 In 2015, an impairment charge of £17m was recorded to write down intangible assets in relation to costs capitalised in the 
transformation of the Group’s UK IT estate from a federated to a more centralised model. Refer to Note 15. 
The charge was recognised in the following segments: Construction Services £9m; Support Services £7m; and Corporate £1m. 
10.1.5.1 Refer to Note 10.1.4.3.
10.1.5.2 In 2016, the joint venture within Rail Germany generated a trading gain of £nil for the Group (2015: £1m gain). In addition to this, in 
2015, a £4m impairment charge was recognised on the joint venture following an agreement to sell parts of Rail Germany to Tianjin Keyvia 
Electric Co Ltd. Refer to Note 10.1.4.8. 
10.1.6 The non-underlying items charged against Group operating profit from continuing operations gave rise to a tax credit of £4m 
comprising: £3m tax credit on amortisation of acquired intangible assets; £3m charge on the results of Rail Germany; and £4m credit on 
other non-underlying items (2015: £4m comprising: £2m charge on the results of Rail Germany; £4m credit on amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets; and £2m credit on other non-underlying items).

Discontinued operations
10.2.1.1 In 2015, the Group finalised the cash consideration due on the disposal of Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB) amounting to additional 
consideration for the Group of £16m of which £7m was recognised as a receivable at the date of disposal in the prior period. In accordance 
with the stock purchase agreement, the Group received cash of £20m relating to historical tax matters (£16m of which was recognised as a 
current tax receivable in the prior period) and the Group also released an indemnity provision relating to an historical legal claim of £3m which 
was successfully settled during the period. Offsetting this additional non-underlying gain on disposal were separation costs incurred during 
the period of £4m, of which £2m were paid during the period, and the write-off of a deferred tax asset of £7m resulting in an overall net gain 
of £5m. Transaction costs of £9m, which were accrued in the prior period, were paid in the year. 
Subsequently in 2016, the Group reached a settlement with the purchaser of PB in relation to outstanding tax matters and indemnities. 
The Group received an additional £9m as a result of this settlement. At the same time, provisions in relation to these matters have been 
released, resulting in an overall gain to the Group of £24m. Refer to Note 32.2.10.
10.2.1.2 On 11 March 2015, as part of the ongoing process to exit the Mainland European rail businesses, the Group disposed of Rail Italy for 
a cash consideration of £5m, resulting in a £4m loss being recognised in the year. Refer to Note 32.3.3. 
10.2.2 The non-underlying items credited to profit from discontinued operations gave rise to a tax charge of £nil (2015: £nil).

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK was 20% during the year. The rate will be reduced to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017, with 
a further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020. These changes were all substantively enacted prior to the end of the year. The net impact of 
these rate changes was a £3m credit (2015: £5m charge) to the income statement and a £nil charge (2015: £2m) to equity.
The Group tax charge excludes amounts for joint ventures and associates (refer to Note 18.2), except where tax is levied at the Group level.
In addition to the Group tax charge, tax of £16m is credited (2015: £49m) directly to other comprehensive income, comprising: a deferred 
tax credit of £1m for subsidiaries (2015: £16m); and a deferred tax credit in respect of joint ventures and associates of £15m (2015: £33m).

The UK Government has confirmed its intention to introduce restrictions on the utilisation of brought forward tax losses from 1 April 2017. 
This legislation has not yet been substantively enacted and hence has not been taken into account in assessing the recognition of UK 
deferred tax assets at 31 December 2016. Pending finalisation of this legislation, its impact on both tax expense and cash tax payable in 
future periods will continue to be assessed.

There were no proposed or recognised dividends for 2015. The Board took the decision to suspend the dividend in 2015, to ensure balance 
sheet strength was maintained during the initial stages of Build to Last. Following the demonstrable progress made by the Group in the first 
year of the transformation programme and in the expectation of further solid and measurable improvements, the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 1.8p, following the interim dividend declared at the half year of 0.9p. The Board continues to anticipate a progressive 
dividend policy going forward.
The interim 2016 dividend was paid on 2 December 2016. Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2017, the final 2016 
dividend will be paid on 7 July 2017 to holders on the register on 21 April 2017 by direct credit or, where no mandate has been given, by 
cheque posted on 6 July 2017 payable on 7 July 2017. The ordinary shares will be quoted ex-dividend on 20 April 2017.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value-in-use, a key input of which is forecast cash flows. The Group’s cash flow forecasts 
are based on the expected workload of each cash-generating unit (CGU), giving consideration to the current level of confirmed and 
anticipated orders. Cash flow forecasts for the next three years are based on the Group’s Three Year Plan, which covers the period from 
2017 to 2019 and includes the stabilisation and recovery of the Construction Services UK business to more normal levels of performance. 
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU were compiled from each of its constituent business units as part of the Group’s annual financial 
planning process.
Whilst it is anticipated that growth will remain stable in the UK buildings sector, tender margins will improve as there will be an increased 
selectivity to drive a higher quality project portfolio. The Group is well positioned in the UK infrastructure market for major schemes and 
regulatory spending uplift. It is anticipated that the US construction market will continue to improve, as will tender margins which will also 
be driven by increased selectivity of projects. In the Support Services segment, market conditions are anticipated to be stable in the UK. 
The Support Services business has a portfolio of long-term contracts and has secured the majority of its workload for the forecast period.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its long-term growth rate and discount rate. The discount rates have been calculated 
using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) method, which takes account of the Group’s capital structure (financial risk) as well 
as the nature of each CGU’s business (operational risk). Long-term growth rates are assumed to be the estimated future GDP growth rates 
based on published independent forecasts for the country or countries in which each CGU operates, less 1.0% to reflect current economic 
uncertainties and their consequent estimated effect on public sector spending on infrastructure.
In the derivation of each CGU’s value-in-use, a terminal value is assumed based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax. 
The multiple is applied to a terminal cash flow, which is the normalised cash flow in the last year of the forecast period. The EBIT multiple 
is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and is a factor of the discount rate and growth rate for each CGU. The nominal terminal value 
is discounted to present value.

Sensitivities
The Group’s impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used. The major assumptions that result in significant 
sensitivities are the discount rate and the long-term growth rate.
Using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.6% and nominal long-term growth rate of 3.4% the recoverable amount of the remaining goodwill in 
Balfour Beatty Construction Group Inc. is £594m based on value-in-use, with consequent headroom of £142m. A 1.0% increase in the 
discount rate and a 1.0% reduction in the growth rate would lead to an impairment of £41m.
Except as noted above, a reasonable possible change in key assumptions will not give rise to an impairment in any of the Group’s CGUs. 
In light of the significant, albeit reduced, losses incurred within the construction business in 2016 the Group has considered whether a 
reasonable possible change in assumptions would lead to an impairment of the goodwill in the related CGUs and concluded that it is not the 
case. The stabilisation and recovery of the Group’s Construction Services UK business to more normal levels of performance is however a 
key assumption underpinning the cash flow forecasts used to assess the recoverable amount of the related goodwill.

In 2013, the Group reached financial close on a student accommodation project in which the Group has demand risk and therefore, 
under IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements, recognises an intangible asset as Infrastructure Investments intangible. The project to 
design, build and maintain postgraduate accommodation at the University of Edinburgh is nearing completion of the construction phase, with 
the first rooms occupied by students from September 2015. Additional spend of £6m (2015: £23m) was incurred in the year in respect of 
this project. 
In 2015, an impairment charge of £17m was recognised against software intangible assets relating to costs capitalised in the transformation 
of the Group’s UK IT estate from a federated to a more centralised model. Due to curtailments in the scope of the implementation and the 
Group’s termination of its agreement with its implementation partner, future benefits expected to be generated from this asset are reduced. 
The impairment was recognised as a non-underlying charge. Refer to Note 10.1.4.12.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are one to four years for customer contracts, 
three to 10 years for customer relationships, three to seven years for software, and up to five years for brand names, except for customer 
contracts and relationships relating to Balfour Beatty Investments North America which are amortised on a basis matching the returns earned 
over the life of the underlying contracts and relationships. These contracts have a duration of up to 50 years for customer contracts relating to 
Balfour Beatty Investments North America.
The Infrastructure Investments intangible is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the project which is 50 years. 
Software assets recognised in the UK are amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its seven-year life. The Group’s remaining 
knowledge sharing and collaboration software is amortised on a basis matching its usage profile over its five-year life. Other intangible 
assets are amortised over periods up to 10 years.

Infrastructure leasehold improvements comprise student accommodation projects in Iowa and Reno. The Group commenced construction 
of Phase 2 of the student accommodation project in Iowa in 2015 resulting in capital expenditure of £14m in the year (2015: £9m). 
Construction on this phase was completed in 2016 and was therefore transferred out of assets in the course of construction to be classified 
within infrastructure leasehold improvements. All buildings are held under short leaseholds and are depreciated over 40 years.
The carrying amount of the Group’s plant and equipment held under finance leases was £1m (2015: £1m). The Company has no property, 
plant and equipment held under finance leases.
Except for land and assets in the course of construction, the costs of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over their expected useful lives. Buildings are depreciated at 2.5% per annum or over the term of the lease, and plant and equipment is 
depreciated at 4% to 33% per annum.

the definition of investment properties and have been reclassified accordingly. 
Investment properties are held by the Group to generate rental income and capital appreciation. The Group has chosen to account for its 
investment property assets under the cost method. For one of its investment properties, the Group has secured non-recourse project 
specific financing amounting to £18m (2015: £nil). This financing is secured through a floating charge over the property. 
In 2015, the amounts held as investment properties solely related to the purchase of land on which construction has commenced in 2016. 
All of the additions disclosed in the table above relate to capital expenditure on these properties which are in the course of construction and 
are not yet operational. 
No depreciation is charged on investment properties that are in the course of construction. The fair value of the Group’s investment 
properties at 31 December 2016 approximates the carrying value as these assets are still under construction. The Group did not generate 
any rental income from these properties as these assets are still under construction (2015: £nil).

The principal joint ventures and associates are shown in Note 39. 
The amount of the Group’s share of borrowings of joint ventures and associates which was supported by the Group and the Company was 
£17m (2015: £20m), relating to the Group’s share of guaranteed borrowings. 
The non-recourse borrowings of joint venture and associate entities relating to infrastructure concessions projects are repayable over 
periods extending up to 2044. The non-recourse borrowings arise under facilities taken out by project-specific joint venture and associate 
concession companies. The borrowings of each concession company are secured by a combination of fixed and floating charges over that 
concession company’s interests in its project’s assets and revenues and the shares in the concession company held by its immediate parent 
company. A significant part of these loans has been swapped into fixed rate debt by the use of interest rate swaps.
As disclosed in Note 39(f), the Group has committed to provide its share of further equity funding of joint ventures and associates in 
Infrastructure Investments’ projects and military housing concessions. Further, in respect of a number of these investments the Group has 
committed not to dispose of its equity interest until construction is complete. As is customary in such projects, banking covenants restrict 
the payment of dividends and other distributions.
The Group has recognised losses in relation to Dutco
#
 in excess of the carrying value of its investment as the Group has constructive 
obligations to provide further funding to make good these losses. At 31 December 2016, these losses amounted to £12m (2015: £9m) 
and have been classified as other provisions. Refer to Notes 18.4 and 25. 
As detailed in Note 37, on 26 January 2017 the Group reached agreement to sell its 49% interests in Dutco
#
 to its joint venture partner. 
The sale subsequently completed on 1 March 2017.

1 Before non-underlying items (Notes 2.10 and 10).
The Group’s investment in military housing joint ventures’ and associates’ projects is recognised at its remaining equity investment plus the 
value of the Group’s accrued returns from the underlying projects. The military housing joint ventures and associates have total non-recourse 
net borrowings of £2,710m (2015: £2,249m). Note 39(e) details the Group’s military housing projects.
On certain Infrastructure Investments concessions where net fair value revaluations of PPP financial assets and cash flow hedges resulted 
in the Group’s carrying value of these investments being negative, the Group has not recognised losses beyond the carrying value of its 
investments. This is because the Group has not committed to provide any further funding to these investments and the borrowings within 
these concessions are non-recourse to the Group. At 31 December 2016, the unrecognised cumulative net fair value charges to other 
comprehensive income amounted to £19m (2015: £24m).

^ Represents the combined results of BK Gulf LLC and Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC as both joint ventures have common ownership and report under the same management structure.
Contract provisions include construction insurance liabilities, principally in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements, and defect and 
warranty provisions on contracts, primarily construction contracts, that have reached practical completion.
Employee provisions are principally liabilities relating to employers’ liability insurance retained in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements 
and provisions for employee termination liabilities arising from the Group’s restructuring programmes.
Other provisions principally comprise: motor and other insurance liabilities in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements; legal claims 
and costs, where provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress; 
property-related provisions, mainly onerous lease commitments, some of which arise from the Group’s restructuring programmes; and 
environmental provisions.
The Group takes actuarial advice when establishing the level of provisions in the Group’s captive insurance arrangements and certain other 
categories of provision.
Insurance-related provisions within these categories were £82m (2015: £76m) as follows: Contract provisions £42m (2015: £37m); 
Employee provisions £31m (2015: £35m); and Other, mainly motor, provisions £9m (2015: £4m).
Restructuring provisions within these categories were £10m (2015: £12m) as follows: Employee provisions £10m (2015: £9m); and Other, 
mainly property-related, provisions £nil (2015: £3m).
The Group has recognised losses in relation to Dutco
^ 
in excess of its carrying value of its investment as the Group has constructive 
obligations to provide further funding to make good these losses. At 31 December 2016, these losses amounted to £12m and have been 
classified as other provisions (2015: £9m). Refer to Note 18.

The loans relating to projects finance arise under non-recourse facilities taken out by project-specific subsidiary companies. The loans of 
each company are secured by a combination of fixed and floating charges over that company’s interests in its project’s assets and revenues 
and the shares in the company held by its immediate parent company. A significant part of these loans has been swapped into fixed rate 
debt by the use of interest rate swaps. 
Included in cash and cash equivalents is restricted cash of: £23m (2015: £25m) held by the Group’s captive insurance company, Delphian 
Insurance Company Ltd, which is subject to Isle of Man insurance solvency regulations; £31m (2015: £58m) held within construction 
project bank accounts; £nil (2015: £7m) relating to cash collateral held against an issued letter of credit, and £7m (2015: £20m) relating to the 
maintenance and other reserve accounts in the Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Cash, deposits and term deposits include the Group’s share of amounts held by joint operations of £282m (2015: £251m).

26.2 US private placement
In March 2013, the Group raised US$350m (£231m) of borrowings through a US private placement of a series of notes with an average 
coupon of 4.94% per annum and an average maturity of 9.3 years. At 31 December 2016, as a result of movements in exchange rates, 
the balance outstanding was £285m (2015: £236m).
26.3 Convertible bonds
On 3 December 2013, the Group issued convertible bonds of £100,000 each maturing on 3 December 2018 at a total issue price of 
£252.7m and incurred transaction costs of £6.7m resulting in net proceeds of £246m. The bonds have a coupon of 1.875% per annum 
payable semi-annually in arrears and the initial conversion price has been set at £3.6692 per share. On 23 April 2014, the conversion price 
was revised to £3.6212.
From 14 January 2014 until 14 days prior to final maturity, one bond is convertible at the option of the holder into one preference share 
in Balfour Beatty Finance No 2 Ltd which is immediately transferred to the Company in exchange for the issue of ordinary shares in the 
Company. The Group has the option to redeem the bonds from December 2015 under certain circumstances.
The bonds are compound instruments, comprising equity and liability components. The fair value of the liability component at the date of 
issue, included under non-current liabilities, was £220m estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 4.29% per annum for a similar 
non-convertible instrument. The difference between the net proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds after the transaction costs and 
the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in equity holders’ 
funds. Refer to Note 29.3.

At the reporting date the Group had unrecognised tax losses from operations (excluding capital losses) that arose over a numbers of years of 
approximately £1,064m (2015: £964m) which are available for offset against future profits. £6m (2015: £11m) will expire between five and 
20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 
2017. The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets for UK corporation tax trading losses of £4m (2015: £14m). The Group has UK corporation 
tax trading losses of £768m (2015: £709m) which are not recognised as deferred tax assets. The Group also had unrecognised deferred tax 
assets relating to retirement benefits of £108m (2015: £nil).
At the reporting date the undistributed reserves for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised were £1m (2015: £1m) in respect 
of subsidiaries and £nil (2015: £nil) in respect of joint ventures and associates. No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences 
because either no temporary difference arises or the timing of any distribution is under the Group’s control and no distribution which gives 
rise to taxation is contemplated.

28 Retirement benefit liabilities
28.1 Introduction
The Group, through trustees, operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
Defined contribution schemes are those where the Group’s obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the 
scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligation is to provide specified 
benefits on retirement.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (IAS 19) prescribes the accounting for defined benefit schemes in the Group’s financial statements. 
Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on high-quality 
corporate bonds. The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme 
members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses. The net finance cost arising from the expected interest income on 
plan assets and interest cost on scheme obligations is included in finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are reported in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The IAS 19 accounting valuations are set out in Note 28.2.
A different calculation is used for the formal triennial funding valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company 
contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme obligations. The principal difference between the 
two methods is that under the funding basis the obligations are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in 
the scheme, rather than the rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds as required by IAS 19 for the financial statements. Details of the 
latest formal triennial funding valuations are set out in Note 28.3.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Group’s financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other 
assets of, the Group.
Principal schemes
The Group’s principal schemes are the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund (BBPF), which includes defined contribution and defined benefit 
sections, and the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS). The defined benefit sections of both schemes 
are funded and closed to new members with the exception of employees where employment has transferred to the Group under certain 
agreed arrangements. Pension benefits are based on employees’ pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
The schemes operate under trust law and are managed and administered by trustees on behalf of the members in accordance with the 
terms of the trust deed and rules and relevant legislation. Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, 
after taking actuarial advice. The trustees are responsible for establishing the investment strategy and ensuring that there are sufficient 
assets to meet the cost of current and future benefits.
These schemes expose the Group to investment and actuarial risks where additional contributions may be required if assets are not 
sufficient to pay future pension benefits:
 – investment risk: equity returns are a key determinant of investment return but the investment portfolio is also subject to a range of other 
risks typical of the investments held, for example, credit risk on corporate bond holdings.
 – actuarial risk: the ultimate cost of providing pension benefits is affected by inflation rates and members’ life expectancy. The net present 
value of the obligations is affected by the market yield on high-quality corporate bonds used to discount the obligations.
Changes in the principal actuarial assumptions based on market data, such as inflation and the discount rate, and experience, such as life 
expectancy, expose the Group to fluctuations in the net IAS 19 liability and the net finance cost.

28.1 Introduction continued
Balfour Beatty Pension Fund
The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth. 
The BBPF invests partly in a diversified range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will 
grow in value faster than the obligations. The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other developed market 
and emerging market equities. The remaining BBPF assets are principally fixed and index-linked bonds and derivatives, providing protection 
against movements in inflation and interest rates and hence enhancing the resilience of the funding level of the scheme. The performance of 
the assets is measured against market indices.
Since 2014, the Group has been offering a commutation option for pensioner members and dependants with benefits with a value of less 
than £30,000 and £18,000, respectively, to extinguish their benefits within the BBPF in exchange for a cash lump sum. The acceptance of 
this offer by certain members and dependants gave rise to a settlement event resulting in a decrease in liabilities of £1m (2015: £3m), which 
was recognised in other non-underlying items. Refer to Note 10.1.4.9.
Following the scheme apportionment arrangement made in relation to the disposal of Balfour Beatty WorkPlace, agreement was reached 
with the trustees on 24 September 2014 to make additional deficit payments totalling £15m in 2015.
On 1 July 2015, the Group established a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP) structure into which its investment in Consort Healthcare 
(Birmingham) Holdings Ltd (Consort Birmingham), which owns the Group’s 40% interest in the Birmingham Hospital PFI investment, was 
transferred. The BBPF is a partner in the SLP and is entitled to a share of the income of the SLP . In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated 
Financial Statements, the SLP is deemed to be controlled by the Group, which retains the ability to substitute the investment in Consort 
Birmingham for other investments from time to time. On 29 December 2016 the Group transferred into the SLP its investment in Holyrood 
Student Accommodation Holdings Ltd, which owns the Group’s 100% interest in the Edinburgh student accommodation project.
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the BBPF in the SLP does not constitute a plan asset and therefore the pension deficit presented in 
these financial statements does not reflect the BBPF’s interest in the SLP . Distributions from the SLP to the BBPF will be reflected in the 
Group’s financial statements as pension contributions on a cash basis. The first distribution was received in December 2015 and amounted 
to £1m. A further distribution was received in 2016 and amounted to £1m.
Alongside the establishment of the SLP , agreement was reached to make a series of deficit payments to the BBPF with the first payment 
of £4m paid in 2016. A further £5m is due in 2017; £7m due in 2018; £9m due in 2019; £13m due in 2020; £17m due in 2021; £22m due in 
2022; and £25m due in 2023.
A formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2016. As a result, the Group agreed to make ongoing deficit 
payments in addition to those set out above of £5m for the period from January 2017 to April 2017; £17m per annum from April 2017; £19m 
per annum from April 2018; and £3m per annum from April 2020.
If the dividend cover ratio is below an agreed trigger level then the contributions set out above may need to be accelerated.
This agreement constitutes a minimum funding requirement (MFR) under IFRIC 14 IAS 19: The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The Group has not recognised any liabilities in relation to this MFR as any surplus of deficit 
contributions to the BBPF would be recoverable by way of a refund and the Group has the unconditional right to the surplus and controls the 
run-off of the benefit obligations once all other obligations of the BBPF have been settled. Implementation of the draft Amendment to IFRIC 
14 when it becomes effective will not affect this accounting.

28.1 Introduction continued
Railways Pension Scheme
The RPS is a shared cost scheme. The legal responsibility of the Group in the RPS is approximately 60% of the scheme’s assets and 
liabilities based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and 
deficit financing.
In 2013 and previous years, the assumed cost of providing benefits was split between the Group and the members in the ratio 60:40. 
This had been a reasonable assumption to make of how costs might have been shared over the long term. This assumption has been 
retained in relation to the cost of providing future service benefits.
Since 2014, because of a declining population of active members, it became less likely that the Group’s costs of meeting any deficits 
would be capped in line with its strict legal obligation of 60%. It was anticipated that members might only be able to afford to fund a small 
proportion of the scheme deficit. In the accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the long-term cost 
of providing past service benefits was assumed to be split between the Group and the members in the ratio 95:5. For the year ended 
31 December 2016 it has been assumed that the Group will be responsible for 100% of any deficit and the balance sheet assets and 
obligations disclosed, therefore, are equal to 100% of the total scheme assets and obligations. 
The RPS invests in a range of pooled investment funds intended to generate a combination of capital growth and income and, as determined 
by the trustee, taking account of the characteristics of the obligations and the trustee’s attitude to risk. The majority of the RPS’ assets 
that are intended to generate additional returns, over the rate at which the obligations are expected to grow, are invested in a single pooled 
growth fund. This fund is invested in a wide range of asset classes and the fund manager RPMI has the discretion to vary the asset 
allocation to reflect its views on the relative attractiveness of different asset classes at any time. The remaining assets in the RPS are 
principally fixed and index-linked bonds.
Following the formal triennial funding valuation carried out as at 31 December 2013, the Group agreed to make ongoing fixed deficit 
contributions of £6m per annum which should reduce the deficit to zero by 2031. This agreement constitutes a MFR under IFRIC 14 IAS 19: 
The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The Group has not recognised any liabilities 
in relation to this MFR as any surplus of deficit contributions to the RPS would be recoverable by way of a refund and the Group has the 
unconditional right to the surplus and controls the run-off of the benefit obligations once all other obligations of the RPS have been settled. 
Implementation of the draft Amendment to IFRIC 14 when it becomes effective will not affect this accounting.
The triennial funding valuation as at 31 December 2016 is now underway.
Other schemes
Other schemes comprise unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe, the majority of which are closed to new entrants,  
and deferred compensation schemes in North America, where an element of employees’ compensation is deferred and invested in  
available-for-sale assets (as disclosed in Note 19.1) in a trust, the assets of which are for the ultimate benefit of the employees but are  
available to the Group’s creditors in the event of insolvency.

28.2 IAS 19 accounting valuations continued
In December 2016, following independent advice from the Group’s actuaries, the Group reassessed the difference between RPI and CPI 
measures of price inflation from 1.4% in December 2015 to 1.2% increasing the retirement benefit liability by a further £44m which was 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The BBPF actuary undertakes regular mortality investigations based on the experience exhibited by pensioners of the BBPF and due to 
the size of the membership of the BBPF (44,322 members at 31 December 2016) is able to make comparisons of this experience with the 
mortality rates set out in the various published mortality tables. The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over 
time. This research is taken into account in the Group’s mortality assumptions across its various defined benefit schemes.
The mortality assumptions as at 31 December 2016 have been updated to reflect the experience of Balfour Beatty pensioners for the period 
1 April 2005 to 31 March 2016. The mortality tables adopted for the 2016 IAS 19 valuations are the Self-Administered Pension Scheme 
(SAPS) S2 tables (2015: SAPS S2 tables) with a multiplier of 102% for all male and female members (2015: 102%) and 109% for female 
widows and dependants (2015: 109%); all with future improvements in line with the CMI 2015 core projection model (2015: CMI 2015 
core projection model), with long-term improvement rates of 1.25% per annum and 1.00% per annum for males and females respectively 
(2015: 1.25% per annum and 1.00% per annum).

table below and the defined contribution section assets and liabilities amounting to £405m (2015: £318m) have been excluded from the 
tables on pages 153 to 155. Defined contribution charges for other schemes include contributions to multi-employer pension schemes.

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes in assumptions occurring at the end of the 
reporting period. In each case the relevant change in assumption occurs in isolation from potential changes in other assumptions. In practice 
more than one variable is likely to change at the same time. The sensitivities have been calculated using the projected unit credit method.

At 31 December 2015 and 2016 690 345
All issued ordinary shares are fully paid. Ordinary shares carry no right to fixed income but each share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company. 
29.2 Cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of 1p each
Issued
Million £m
At 31 December 2015 and 2016 112 1
All issued preference shares are fully paid. During the current and prior year, no preference shares were repurchased for cancellation by 
the Company.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, 
payable half-yearly. A preference dividend of 5.375p per cumulative convertible redeemable preference share of 1p was paid on 1 July 2016 
in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2016. A preference dividend of 5.375p per cumulative convertible redeemable preference share 
of 1p was paid on 1 January 2017 in respect of the six months ended 31 December 2016. 
On 1 July 2020, any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable at £1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless 
the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date. The maximum redemption value of all of the issued 
and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was £112m at 31 December 2016 (2015: £112m).
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion 
notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 24.69136 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, 
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares 
if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for a Balfour Beatty plc 
ordinary share during a 30-day period exceeds 810p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The preference shares carry no voting rights at a general meeting of the Company, except where the dividend is six months or more in 
arrears, or where the business of the meeting includes a resolution which directly affects the rights and privileges attached to the preference 
shares or a resolution for the winding up of the Company. On winding up the Company, holders are entitled to receive the sum of £1 per 
preference share, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, in priority to any payment on any other class of shares.
The preference shares are a compound instrument, comprising equity and liability components. The fair value of the liability component at 
the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% per annum for a 
similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to 
the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in equity holders’ equity, net of deferred tax.

The fair value of the liability component of the preference shares at 31 December 2016 amounted to £117m (2015: £109m). The fair value is 
determined by using the market price of the preference shares at the reporting date.
Interest expense on the preference shares is calculated using the effective interest method.
29.3 Convertible bonds
On 3 December 2013, the Group issued convertible bonds for net proceeds of £246m. The convertible bonds are compound instruments 
comprising equity and liability components. The fair value of the liability component was estimated as £220m using the prevailing market 
rate at the date of issue for a similar non-convertible instrument. The difference between the net proceeds and the fair value of the liability 
represented the embedded option to convert the liability into the Company’s ordinary shares being the equity component of £26m.

As permitted under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its Statement of Comprehensive 
Income (including the profit and loss account) for the year. Balfour Beatty plc reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 
of £10m (2015: £34m profit).
The retained profits of Balfour Beatty plc are wholly distributable. By special resolution on 13 May 2004, confirmed by the court on 16 June 
2004, the share premium account was reduced by £181m and the £4m capital redemption reserve was cancelled, effective on 25 June 
2004, and a special reserve of £185m was created. This reserve becomes distributable to the extent of future increases in share capital 
and share premium account, of which nil occurred in 2016 (2015: £1m).
30.3 The retained profits in the Group and the retained profits of the Company are stated net of investments in Balfour Beatty plc ordinary 
shares acquired by the Group’s employee discretionary trust, the Balfour Beatty Employee Share Ownership Trust, to satisfy awards 
under the Performance Share Plan, the Executive Buyout Scheme, the Deferred Bonus Plan and the Restricted Share Plan. In 2016, 1.6m 
(2015: 7.3m) shares were purchased at a cost of £3.9m (2015: £16.9m). The market value of the 10.5m (2015: 9.2m) shares held by the Trust 
at 31 December 2016 was £28.2m (2015: £24.9m). The carrying value of these shares is £26.1m (2015: £23.0m). 
Following confirmation of the performance criteria at the end of the performance period in the case of the Performance Share Plan and 
the Executive Buyout Scheme, and at the end of the vesting period in the case of the Deferred Bonus Plan and the Restricted Share Plan, 
the appropriate number of shares will be unconditionally transferred to participants. In 2016, nil shares were transferred to participants in 
relation to the April 2013 awards under the Performance Share Plan (2015: nil shares were transferred to participants in relation to the April 
2012 awards under the Performance Share Plan), nil shares were transferred to participants in relation to the January 2015 awards under the 
Executive Buyout Scheme (2015: 0.3m), and 0.3m shares were transferred to participants in relation to awards under the Deferred Bonus 
Plan (2015: 0.7m shares).
The Trustees have waived the rights to dividends on shares held by the trust. Participants in the schemes receive an award of shares to 
represent the dividends which would have been payable on the shares since the date of grant. 
Other reserves in the Group and Company include £5.8m (2015: £3.9m) relating to unvested Performance Share Plan awards, £1.5m 
(2015: £0.2m) relating to unvested Restricted Share Plan awards, £1.5m (2015: £1.3m) relating to unvested Executive Buyout Scheme 
awards and £1.9m (2015: £1.5m) relating to unvested Deferred Bonus Plan awards.

consideration for the Group of £16m of which £7m was recognised as a receivable at the date of disposal in the prior period. In accordance 
with the stock purchase agreement, the Group received cash of £20m relating to historical tax matters (£16m of which was recognised as a 
current tax receivable in the prior period) and the Group also released an indemnity provision relating to an historical legal claim of £3m which 
was successfully settled during the period. Offsetting this additional non-underlying gain on disposal were separation costs incurred during 
the period of £4m, of which £2m were paid during the period, and the write-off of a deferred tax asset of £7m resulting in an overall net gain 
of £5m. Transaction costs of £9m, which were accrued in the prior period, were paid in the year. 
Subsequently in 2016, the Group reached a settlement with the purchaser of PB in relation to outstanding tax matters and indemnities.

released, resulting in an overall gain to the Group of £24m.

35 Contingent liabilities
The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and entered into counter-
indemnities in respect of bonds relating to the Group’s own contracts and given guarantees in respect of their share of certain contractual 
obligations of joint ventures and associates and certain retirement benefit liabilities of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund and the Railways 
Pension Scheme. Guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable payment will be required under 
the terms of the guarantee.
Provision has been made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims, investigations and legal actions in progress. The Group 
takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on 
that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed, or that the Group cannot make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation.

On 26 January 2017, the Group reached agreement to sell its 49% interests in Dutco Balfour Beatty LLC and BK Gulf LLC to its joint 
venture partner for a total cash consideration of £11m. The sale subsequently completed on 1 March 2017. The Group’s investment in these 
entities did not satisfy the criteria under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations at the balance sheet date 
and therefore continued to be presented within the Group’s underlying continuing operations. Following the agreement to sell in January 
2017, the criteria under IFRS 5 are now satisfied and therefore the Group’s share of results in these entities will be presented as part of 
its discontinued operations with comparatives restated accordingly in its 2017 financial statements. The impact of the disposal will be 
presented as non-underlying within discontinued operations.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital. The components of capital are as follows: equity attributable to equity holders of the Company comprising issued ordinary 
share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 29.1 and 30; preference shares as disclosed in Note 29.2; US private 
placement as disclosed in Note 26; convertible bonds as disclosed in Note 26; and cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in 
Note 26.
The Group maintains or adjusts its capital structure through the payment of dividends to equity holders, issue of new shares and buyback of 
existing shares, and drawdown of new borrowings and repayment of existing borrowings. The policy of the Group is to ensure an appropriate 
balance between cash, borrowings (other than the non-recourse borrowings of companies engaged in Infrastructure Investments projects), 
working capital and the value in the Infrastructure Investments investment portfolio.
The overall capital risk management strategy of the Group remains unchanged from 2015.

Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk; credit risk; and liquidity risk. The Group’s financial risk management 
strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Group’s financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board. Group Treasury liaises with 
the Group’s operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks. The Board provides written principles for overall financial 
risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of 
derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies 
and exposure limits is monitored through the Group’s internal audit and risk management procedures. The Group uses derivative financial 
instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, 
for speculative purposes.
(a) Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including:
 – forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the 
functional currency of the operating company
 – interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability in non-recourse project finance loans arising from variable interest rates 
on borrowings.
There has been no material change to the Group’s exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages those 
risks since 2015.
(i) Foreign currency risk management
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, 
euros, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirates dirhams. Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and 
liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. 
Whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identified with sufficient reliability Group Treasury enters into forward contracts 
on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above materiality levels determined by the Chief Financial Officer.
Refer to page 168 for details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency 
transactional exposures.
As at 31 December 2016, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where 
hedge accounting is not applied was £70m (2015: £35m) receivable and £71m (2015: £36m) payable with related cash flows expected to 
occur in up to two (2015: two) years. The foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from fair valuing these unhedged foreign exchange 
contracts will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of £10m (2015: £nil) receivable and £11m (2015: £nil) 
payable as cash flow hedges against highly probable cash flows which are expected to occur in up to five (2015: one) years. Fair value gains 
on these contracts of £2m (2015: £nil) have been taken to hedging reserves through other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount 
deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at the reporting date is £2m (2015: £nil).
No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the income statement in relation to any foreign 
exchange cash flow hedges.
The Group’s investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks. The Group does not enter into forward 
foreign exchange or other derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets.
In March 2013, the Group raised US$350m through a US private placement which has been designated as a net investment hedge against 
changes in the value of the Group’s US net assets due to exchange movements. The Group has reassessed this hedge and has concluded 
that the hedge continues to be effective. Exchange movements in the year totalled £49m (2015: £12m). A 5% increase/decrease in the 
US dollar to sterling exchange rate would lead to a £14m decrease (2015: £11m)/£15m increase (2015: £12m) in the carrying amount of the 
liability on the Group’s balance sheet, with the movement recognised in other comprehensive income. 
A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a £7m increase 
(2015: £20m)/£9m decrease (2015: £24m) in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically. At the reporting date there had been no change to the hedging policies since 2015.
balfourbeatty.com/AR2016
Governance Financial Statements Other Information 169 Strategic Report 38 Financial instruments continued
(ii) Interest rate risk management
Interest rate risk arises in the Group’s non-recourse project companies which borrow funds at both floating and fixed interest rates and hold 
available-for-sale financial assets. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s policy to manage 
this risk is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, using interest rate swap contracts.
In an interest rate swap, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed 
notional principal amounts. The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would be immaterial. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curve at the reporting date.
During 2016 and 2015, the Group’s non-recourse project subsidiaries’ borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling 
and US dollars.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding subsidiaries’ interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2016 totalled £117m 
(2015: £304m) with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 23 years.
At 31 December 2015, the fixed interest rates range from 3.5% to 5.1% (2015: 3.5% to 5.1%) and the principal floating rates are LIBOR plus 
a fixed margin.
A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a £7m increase 
(2015: £20m)/£9m decrease (2015: £24m) in amounts taken directly to other comprehensive income by the Group in relation to the Group’s 
exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its Infrastructure Investments subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and other borrowings. A 50 basis point increase/
decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a £nil decrease (2015: £2m)/£nil 
increase (2015: £1m) in the Group’s net finance cost.
(iii) Price risk management
The Group’s principal price risk exposure arises in its Infrastructure Investments concessions. At the commencement of the concession, an 
element of the unitary payment by the customer is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concession’s costs. The Group is exposed 
to price risk to the extent that inflation differs from the index used.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss. Credit risk arises from cash and 
deposits, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. 
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments, the Group has a policy of only using counterparties that are independently rated 
with a minimum long-term credit rating of BBB+. At 31 December 2016, £1m (2015: £5m) did not meet this criterion due to the operational 
and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from these counterparties. The credit rating of 
a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board 
of Directors for the Group and subsidiary companies. Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables, credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings 
where available or by assessment of the customer’s credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors. 
The Group’s most significant customers are public or regulated industry entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high 
credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at the reporting date is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the 
financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out 
in Note 26.1. The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is set out on page 168.

Fair value estimation
The Group holds certain financial instruments on the balance sheet at their fair values. The following hierarchy classifies each class of 
financial asset or liability in accordance with the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.
Level 1 – The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
The Group holds available-for-sale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued at the closing market price 
at the reporting date.
Level 2 – The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising yield curves at the reporting 
date and taking into account own credit risk. Own credit risk for Infrastructure Investments’ swaps is not material and is calculated using the 
following credit valuation adjustment (CVA) calculation: loss given default multiplied by exposure multiplied by probability of default.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts. Own credit risk for the other derivative 
liabilities is not material and is calculated by applying a relevant credit default swap (CDS) rate obtained from a third party.
Level 3 – The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Group’s PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin by 
reference to the construction margin on non-PPP projects reflecting the construction risks retained by the construction contractor, and fair 
value of construction services performed. In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the 
financial asset at a discount rate which is based on long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets, with market-
related movements in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and other movements recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts originally recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement upon disposal of the asset. 
A change in the discount rate would have a significant effect on the value of the asset and a 50 basis point increase/decrease, which 
represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in the risk-adjusted discount rate, would lead to a £7m decrease 
(2015: £14m)/£7m increase (2015: £15m) in the fair value of the assets taken through equity. Refer to Note 20 for a reconciliation of the 
movement from the opening balance to the closing balance.

Military housing
Summary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number of 
US military privatisation projects associated with a total of 55 US government military bases which includes 55 military family housing 
communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that are expected to contain approximately 42,800 housing units once 
development, construction and renovation are complete.
The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army (Army), seven 
projects with the United States Department of the Air Force (Air Force) and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy 
(Navy). In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing (UPH) project with the Army at Fort Stewart.
Contractual arrangements The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction 
or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years. With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government 
becomes a member or partner of the project entity (Project LLC); the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty 
Communities’ Project LLCs, however it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar 
rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC. On each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the 
government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 
years. Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development 
of existing housing units, as well as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the 
project, which, in the case of the Army, could potentially extend for up to an additional 25 years. The 50-year duration of each project calls 
for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units. At the end of the ground lease term the Project 
LLC’s leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual minimum preferred rate of 
return. On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities’ 
initial equity contribution to the project. During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the 
minimum preferred rate of return. The unpaid amounts will generally accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and 
construction costs, if necessary. If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, at the end of the initial 
development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the government in accordance 
with the terms of the project agreements.

Allocation of remaining operating cash flows Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining after the 
annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment account held by the 
project for the benefit of the government. On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to 
receive (inclusive of the preferred return) is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, on its initial equity 
contribution to the project. Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to 18% depending on the particular project and 
the type of return (annual modified rates of return or cash-on-cash). However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual 
caps or lower projected annual rates of return. The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed 
above. The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, 
development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military service.
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour 
Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, in a predetermined order of priority. Typically these distributions will have the effect 
of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and a complete return of the 
initial capital contribution. After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a party’s initial contribution, all remaining funds 
will typically be distributed to the applicable military service.

Notes
(i) Registered in the US and the principal operations of each project are conducted in the US.
(ii) The share of results of the military housing joint ventures of Balfour Beatty Communities is limited to a pre-agreed preferred return on funds invested.
The Group evaluated each of its interests in the military housing projects to determine if the entities should be consolidated. This analysis 
included, but was not limited to, identifying the activities that most significantly impact an entity’s economic performance, which party or 
parties control those activities and the risks associated with these entities. Decision making power over key facets of the contracts were 
evaluated when determining which party or parties had control over the activities that most significantly impacted a project’s economics. 
Based on this review, the Directors consider that the Group does not have the power to direct these activities and does not have control and 
therefore the Group does not consolidate the military housing projects.

Notes:
(i) The Group evaluated each of its interests in the military housing projects to 
determine if the associated entities should be consolidated. This analysis 
included, but was not limited to, identifying the activities that most significantly 
impact an entity’s economic performance, which party or parties control those 
activities and the risks associated with these entities. Decision making power 
over key facets of the contracts were evaluated when determining which 
party or parties had control over the activities that most significantly impact 
a project’s economics. Based on this review, the Directors consider that the 
Group does not have the power to direct these activities and does not control 
or jointly control them and therefore the entities have been accounted for as 
associated undertakings.
(ii) Partnership interests held.
Joint ventures incorporated outside the 
United Kingdom continued

to receive corporate documents by email should, in the first 
instance, be directed to the Company’s Registrars and clearly state 
your registered address and, if available, your shareholder reference 
number. Please write to:
Capita Asset Services, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, 
Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, Telephone: 0871 664 0300 from 
the UK. Calls cost 12p per minute plus your phone company’s

Dividends and dividend reinvestment plan
Dividends may be paid directly into your bank or building society 
account through the Bankers Automated Clearing System (BACS). 
The Registrars can provide a dividend mandate form. A dividend 
reinvestment plan (DRIP) is offered which allows holders of ordinary 
shares to reinvest their cash dividends in the Company’s shares 
through a specially arranged share dealing service. Full details of the 
DRIP and its charges, together with mandate forms, are available at 
www.balfourbeatty-shares.com.
International payment service
Shareholders outside the UK may elect to receive dividends 
direct into their overseas bank account, or by currency draft, 
instead of by sterling cheque. For further information, contact

Shareholder information on the internet and 
electronic communications

information about the Company, our people and businesses and 
our policies on corporate governance and corporate responsibility. 
It should be regarded as your first point of reference for information 
on any of these matters. The share price can also be found there. 
You can create a Share Portal account, through which you will 
be able to access the full range of online shareholder services, 
including the ability to: view your holdings and indicative share 
price and valuation; view movements on your holdings and your

Unsolicited telephone calls
In the past, some of our shareholders have received unsolicited 
telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters 
from organisations or persons claiming or implying that they have 
some connection with the Company. These are typically from 
overseas-based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to 
sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in 
UK or overseas investments. Shareholders are advised to be very 
wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount 
or offers of free reports on the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 – always ensure the firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) Register and is allowed to give financial advice before 
handing over your money. You can check via www.fsa.gov.uk/
register/home.do
 – double-check the caller is from the firm they say they are – ask 
for their name and telephone number and say you will call them 
back. Check their identity by calling the firm using the contact 
number listed on the FCA Register. If there are no contact details 
on the FCA Register or you are told that they are out of date, 
or if you have any other doubts, call the FCA Consumer Helpline 
on 0800 111 6768
 – if you are approached about a share scam, please visit the FCA’s 
ScamSmart website at www.scamsmart.fca.org.uk where 
you can access information about the various types of scam, 
including share and boiler room fraud, see the FCA’s Warning List 
and reports on firms about whom consumers have expressed 
concerns. Alternatively, you can call the FCA Consumer Helpline 
(see above). If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares 
or other investments, you will not have access to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service or be eligible to receive payment under the 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong
 – you should also report any approach to Action Fraud, who are the 
UK’s national fraud reporting centre at www.actionfraud.police.uk, 
or by calling 0300 123 2040.

Shareholder information Gifting shares to your family or to charity
To transfer shares to another member of your family as a gift, 
please ask the Registrars for a Balfour Beatty gift transfer form. 
Alternatively, if you only have a small number of shares whose 
value makes it uneconomic to sell them, you may wish to consider 
donating them to the share donation charity ShareGift (registered 
charity no. 1052686), whose work Balfour Beatty supports.
Any shares you donate to ShareGift will be aggregated, sold when 
possible, and the proceeds will be donated to a wide range of other 
UK charities. Since ShareGift was launched, over £20m has been 
given to more than 2,000 charities.
The relevant share transfer form may be obtained from the 
Registrars. For more information visit www.sharegift.org.

 We l c o m e t o  
Bank of Georgia Holdings 
In 2012, Bank of Georgia Holdings has made strong 
progress in a number of areas that underpin future  
growth in its revenues, earnings and delivering value to  
its shareholders. The Board is delighted with the Group’s 
progress in a year in which it delivered record earnings  
of GEL 179.6 million.
Our executive management team, led by Irakli Gilauri, has 
developed and implemented a growth-focused strategy 
that is generating high levels of business and earnings 
growth, with strong profitability and returns whilst 
maintaining a conservative balance sheet with high levels  
of capital and liquidity – levels that are substantially in 
excess of minimum regulatory requirements. This strategy 
clearly works and, as a result, the Group continues to  
get stronger and stronger.
On behalf of the entire Board, I thank Irakli and the 
management team for plotting and maintaining the sound 
strategic course – with challenging goals – for Bank of 
Georgia. Irakli’s personal integrity and commitment to the 
values of the Group are clearly recognised, highly regarded 
and reflected throughout the organisation. 
In my letter to shareholders last year I talked about 
Georgia’s recent progress in the eradication of corruption 
and in delivering market-oriented reforms that have 
underpinned Georgia’s macroeconomic development  
over the last decade. This economic progress has 
continued to be delivered throughout 2012 and into 2013, 
notwithstanding a period of uncertainty around the time  
of the country’s parliamentary elections in October 2012. 
In 2012, Georgia remained firmly on the path of economic 
growth, recording an estimated 6.1% real GDP growth 
during the year. This economic growth reflects three main 
pillars: Georgia’s economic liberalisation and strong fiscal 
and monetary framework, ongoing macro-economic 
stability and Georgia’s welcoming business environment 
resulting from recent growth oriented reforms.
Neil Janin
Chairman of Bank of Georgia Holdings
Four reasons why we are the 
leading bank in Georgia 
1.  Our values drive our business
2.  Our products and services are 
right for the market we are in
3.  We have a strong and robust  
governance structure
4.  Our Executive Management 
team is focused on  
delivering results

Growth in tourism continues to be an important driver  
of Georgia’s economic progress, with the number of  
foreign visitors growing by 56% to a total of an estimated  
4.4 million visitors in 2012 compared to 2011. Net remittances 
and foreign direct investment remained robust and are 
expected to continue to be so into 2013 and beyond. In 
January and February 2013, the number of foreign visitors 
continued to increase significantly with 37% year-on-year 
growth compared to January and February 2012.
Georgia benefits significantly from its liberal economic 
policies and its positioning as the logistics and tourism  
hub for the Caucasus region. The country’s Liberty Act 
ensures the continuation of the country’s credible fiscal  
and monetary policy framework. With effect from 2014, 
Georgia’s government expenditure as a percentage of 
GDP will be capped at 30%, the budget deficit as a 
percentage of GDP will be capped at 3%, and overall 
Government debt to GDP will be capped at 60%.  
In addition, recent growth oriented economic reforms,  
such as eradication of regulation and red tape and 
eradication of administrative corruption, among others, 
will continue to benefit the economy for years to come. 
2012 was also a breakthrough period in the Deep and 
Comprehensive Free Trade Area negotiations with the 
European Commission, which is now expected to lead 
to the successful conclusion of negotiations during 2013, 
and to the initiation of free trade with the European Union 
within two years.
In December 2012, the Parliament of Georgia approved 
Georgia’s state budget for 2013. The budget revenues 
are projected at GEL 7.4 billion, while the total state 
expenditure budget (including acquisition of non-financial 
assets) is expected to be GEL 7.9 billion. The forecast 
budget deficit, as a percentage of GDP, is 2.9%, and 
Government debt to GDP is targeted to be 33.1%. Real 
GDP growth is budgeted to be c.6%, and average inflation 
is expected to be c.3%.
Whilst 2012 was another year of economic progress in Georgia, 
it is in the political sphere that a truly remarkable breakthrough 
was achieved. Following the victory of the Georgian Dream 
coalition in the October 2012 parliamentary elections, there  
was a relatively smooth transition to a Government run by the 
Georgian Dream coalition – a rare democratic achievement 
among former members of the post-Soviet CIS. The new 
Government is now clearly ‘up and running’, progress is being 
demonstrated in many areas and it is encouraging to see good 
levels of inward investment continue, high and growing levels of 
tourists visiting Georgia and, perhaps most notably, significant 
signs of a substantial improvement in both diplomatic and 
economic relations with Russia – over time I believe this will be 
extremely beneficial to the people and economy of Georgia. 
Whilst the last October elections plainly represented a significant 
source of uncertainty for businesses and consumers in Georgia, 
having seen these more recent developments in the country, it 
feels like this period of uncertainly is now behind us.

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Throughout 2012, Bank of Georgia has remained firm 
and true to its core values and principles. Among the  
many reasons why Bank of Georgia continues to be,  
by any measure, the leading bank in Georgia, I would 
highlight these:
 – Our key values drive our business
 – Our products and services are appropriate for the 
markets in which we operate
 – We have a strong and robust governance structure, and
 – Our executive management remains clearly focused on 
delivering high quality, sustainable, results.
The Group recognises that we live in a time when the 
external environment constantly challenges us to develop 
innovative solutions that drive both value for our customers 
and sustainable profits for our shareholders. Many of the 
ways in which the Group is responding to this challenge are 
explored in greater detail in the Chief Executive’s statement 
and elsewhere in this Annual Report. I will mention only a few 
of the key areas of progress made by the Group. In Retail 
Banking, our Express Banking strategy is revolutionising 
Georgian financial services markets and is increasingly been 
used to bring more, previously unbanked, customers into  
the banking sector. 
Passion
To be pro-active, 
result driven and 
constantly the best
Courage
To explore new areas, take 
reasonable risks and make 
opportunities come true
Respect
To build long-term  
client relationships  
based on consideration, 
professionalism and trust
Innovation
To think outside  
the box, constantly 
challenge the status  
quo and to come up 
with fresh ideas
Team Spirit
To achieve outstanding results 
together, as one, united and 
uncompromising team
Our values keeps us  
one step ahead
Overview: Chairman’s statement continued
Values
4 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Management’s focus on cost efficiency and delivering 
positive operational leverage is also an important strategic 
priority. By constantly looking to improve efficiency, and 
focusing on leveraging new technologies and efficiencies 
such as Straight-Through Processing, the Bank again 
delivered revenue growth that is more than double the  
rate of expense growth. 
In a maturing financial services market, which we expect 
to be characterised over the next decade by falling interest 
rates, management has made reducing the Group’s cost 
of funds a priority. Over the last 12 months this has been 
highlighted by a strong focus on reducing deposit rates 
across all business sectors, as well as the issuance of a 
five-year Eurobond in July 2012 which, when combined, 
supported both a significantly reduced cost of funds and, 
consequently, an increase in the Bank’s net interest margin. 
This emphasis on strong balance sheet management will, 
I believe, continue to support strong margins over the  
next few years.
Our strong earnings performance and level of profitability 
has produced high rates of internal capital generation.  
Our capital ratios substantially exceed our current capital 
requirements and proposed future needs. This has enabled 
the Board to recommend a more than doubled dividend of 
GEL 1.50 per share, and announce an expected dividend 
payout ratio going forward of 25%-40% of earnings.
Finally, our listing on the premium segment of the London 
Stock Exchange in February 2012 has achieved its key 
objectives. The average daily liquidity of Bank of Georgia 
Holdings shares has increased substantially, the Group has 
improved access to global capital markets and we have 
experienced a significant diversification of our institutional 
shareholder base, with particularly noticeable increases 
in our UK and US shareholder bases. The value of these 
improvements was both demonstrated and further enhanced 
in March 2013 by the successful placement of a 10% equity 
holding by East Capital Financials Fund, which is in the 
process of closing.
The Board believes that both Georgia and Bank of 
Georgia remain well positioned to build on the successes  
of 2012, in 2013 and beyond. The Bank of Georgia business 
model has a demonstrated flexibility and ability to generate 
high quality organic growth in a number of different economic 
environments. Georgia’s economy is in good shape and I 
cannot think of a bank better placed to take advantage  
of the opportunities that will arise in our core businesses 
over the next few years.

A snapshot
Georgia’s economic performance reflects economic 
liberalisation, ongoing macro-economic stability and 
Georgia’s business-friendly environment that have resulted 
from the growth-oriented reforms of the last decade. Such 
reforms, initiated in 2003-2004, included eradication of 
administrative corruption, downsizing bureaucracies, 
reforming public services and simplifying the business 
environment. Almost a decade later, Georgia stands out as  
a country with one of the lowest corruption and crime rates  
in the world, well-functioning public institutions and a growing 
private sector positioned to continue benefiting from the 
strong fundamentals of the growth economy and inward 
investments. With only six taxes that are currently imposed,  
of which the corporate tax rate is 15% and personal income 
tax 20%, Georgia is truly one of the world’s most “friendly”  
tax regimes. In the 2013 World Bank/International Finance 
Corporation’s “Doing Business Report”, Georgia was ranked 
9th in the world (a significant improvement from 115th  
in 2005). 
Georgia’s geographic location between land-locked, 
energy-rich countries and the European markets has largely 
determined the hub economy role for the country. The 
country is an important energy transit hub, hosting several 
pipelines one of which is Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, 
transporting Azerbaijani crude oil through Georgia to Turkey. 
One of the three ports on Georgia’s Black Sea coast is 
owned and managed by Denmark’s A.P . Moeller-Maersk. 
Since 2003, Georgia has delivered real GDP compounded 
annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of over 6% per annum. The 
composition of Georgia’s GDP is quite diverse, with the largest 
sector – trade – representing 17% of GDP , with manufacturing 
(c. 11%), agriculture (c. 8%), transportation (c. 8%), construction 
(c. 7%) and hospitality (c. 2%) all representing strong sectors of 
the economy. A significant portion of the trade is attributed  
to the business of re-exporting cars that are sent to various 
destinations from Georgian ports.
In addition, hydroelectric power and several large scale 
infrastructure projects have become one of the key drivers 
of the economy. If harnessed, Georgia could produce 32 
TWh of hydropower annually, 4x more than currently. The 
extra capacities would allow 6.3 TWh exports by 2020. 
Such growth will be supported by the completions of new 
hydroprojects and transmission lines to Turkey, increasing 
total transmission capacity to Turkey by 7.6x times. 
Foreign Direct Investment (“FDI”) is diversified across  
various sectors, supporting ongoing investments in capital 
intensive areas (such as hydropower transmission assets 
among others). Since the onset of the structural reforms, the 
country observed substantial FDI inflows, which averaged 
approximately 10% of GDP from 2003 to 2011. Over the  
past few years, FDI and net remittances, the latter being a 
traditionally reliable source of FX inflows from approximately 
one million Georgians living abroad accounting for approximately 
7 .0% of GDP (2003-201 1 average), have more than covered the 
relatively high current account deficit. 
The structure of inflows that drive Georgia’s economy has 
changed in recent years, reflecting the diversification (and 
growth) of sources of funds flowing into the country. Tourism 
is increasingly becoming a significant income source for 
Georgia, as investments into infrastructure and hospitality 
sectors of the past several years, resulted in the significant 
increase in number of visitors (c. 300,000 visitors in 2003 
compare to an estimated 4.4 million visitors in 2012). The 
tourist inflows are now on par with the FDI and remittances, 
accounting for approximately 7.1% of GDP in 2011.

Georgia has relatively low levels* of household, business 
and government debts (13.8%, 19.6% and 32.6% of GDP, 
respectively) compared to many Western countries, a factor 
that in combination with strong economic growth makes it a 
unique market.
2012
In 2012, Georgia remained firmly on the path of continued 
economic growth, recording an estimated 6.1% real GDP 
growth during the year. Economic growth was stronger in 
the first half of the year compared to the second half of the 
year. The slowdown in the second half reflected lower 
corporate investment levels in both the pre and post 
parliamentary election period.
The annual growth in 2012 was underpinned by strong 
growth in the construction and manufacturing sectors (2012 
real growth of 11.4% and 16.4% respectively), while financial 
intermediation, hospitality businesses and communication 
grew by 15.0%, 11.8% and 9.6%, respectively. 
Fiscal and monetary policies remained broadly unchanged 
during the year, and the Georgian Lari exchange rate remained 
largely unchanged to the US Dollar, reflecting continuing 
stability in the Georgian macroeconomic environment. The 
Government’s budget deficit, an estimated 2.9% for 2012, was 
maintained at the expected level. This level was consistent 
with government plans to bring the budget deficit down from 
9.2% in 2009, to under 3.0% from 2013 onwards.
The total National Bank of Georgia reserves continued to 
grow, reaching a record high of US$ 2.9 billion in December 
2012, covering 4.4 months of 2012 import of goods and 
services. In addition, the National Bank of Georgia has 
continued to increase its US Dollar reserves in the first few 
months of 2013.
The Government continues to diligently manage its foreign 
debt portfolio and further decreased its foreign sovereign 
debt to an estimated 27.6% of GDP in 2012, compared to 
44.9% in 2003, and 33.6% in 2010. 
Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, 
(“CPI”) remained below recent trend levels, resulting in a 
year-end annual deflation of an estimated 1.4%.
The current account deficit for the year was an estimated 
11.5% of GDP, reflecting continued extensive investments. 
This deficit continues to be comfortably financed by foreign 
inflows of capital. The growth in services exports continued 
to be significant, with the number of foreign visitors growing 
by 56% to a total of approximately 4.4 million visitors in 
2012. Net remittances grew by 5.0% in 2012 reaching  
US$ 1.2 billion. FDI for the year totalled an estimated  
US$ 865 million.
Georgia continues to benefit significantly from its liberal 
economic policies and its positioning as the logistics and 
tourism hub for the Caucasus region. The country’s Liberty 
Act, will ensure the continuation of the country’s credible fiscal 
and monetary policy framework. Free Trade Agreements  
with the US and Europe are expected to lead to the increase 
both Georgian exports to these markets and the inward 
investments to the country.
In December 2012, the Parliament of Georgia (the 
“Parliament”) approved Georgia’s state budget for 2013.  
The budget revenues are projected at GEL 7.4 billion, while 
the total state expenditure budget (including acquisition  
of non financial assets) is expected to be GEL 7.9 billion.  
The forecast budget deficit, as a percentage of GDP, is  
2.9%, and Government debt to GDP is targeted to be  
33.1%. Real GDP growth is budgeted to be c. 6%, and 
average inflation is expected to be c. 3% in 2013.
Georgian Banking and Insurance Sectors
The Georgian financial services sector is one of the most 
solid contributors to economic growth of the country, with 
banking assets accounting for 54.9% of GDP in 2012 and 
growing at an average growth rate of c. 30.4% during the 
past decade. Despite a high growth rate the banking sector 
penetration remains low with loans/GDP and deposit/GDP 
ratios at 33.4% and 31.3%, respectively. The banking 
system is entirely privately owned and is quite concentrated 
with two largest banks accounting for 62.5% of total assets. 
The NBG is the regulator of the whole financial sector and it 
supervises the banking sector, the securities market and 
insurance companies. 
The Georgian insurance sector is represented by 14 insurance 
companies, with Aldagi BCI being the largest player on the 
market followed by Vienna Insurance Group companies.  
Like the banking sector, the insurance market remains  
under penetrated with premiums-to-GDP ratio of 1.7%.

Irakli Gilauri
Chief Executive Officer of Bank of Georgia Holdings
In 2012 your Company reported another record profit of  
GEL 179.6 million, an increase of 32.3% from the profit 
delivered by Bank of Georgia in 2011. This strong progress 
continues to reflect the strength of the Bank’s earnings 
power and resulted in a ROAE of 19.1%, up from 18.3%, 
and EPS growth of 17.6% to GEL 5.22, reflecting a strong 
business performance, significantly reduced cost of funds 
and improved efficiency across the business.
On 28 February 2012, Bank of Georgia Holdings started 
trading on the LSE Main Market and in June 2012 became a 
FTSE 250 constituent company. This has markedly improved 
the liquidity of your stock, positively affecting the price of 
BGEO LN, which grew 86.0% since the premium listing 
almost one year ago on the back of an average trading 
volume of approximately 103,000 shares per day  
(GBP 1.5 million). We have a well-diversified shareholder  
base which includes our long-time investors across various 
geographies and the addition of many new non-emerging 
markets focused institutional investors, who now make up 
approximately 15% of our investor base. As the Chairman 
mentions in his statement, we were particularly pleased  
with the recent successful placing of the East Capital  
private equity stake, with a diverse range of high quality 
institutional investors.
Performance: Chief Executive Officer’s statement
2012 was a momentous year for Georgia as well. Following  
the parliamentary elections in October 2012, we witnessed a 
democratic passing of power for the first time in the country’s 
history. The new government has asserted its commitment  
to improve further Georgia’s investor and business friendly 
policies and in December 2012 the newly-elected Parliament 
approved a well-balanced budget for 2013 that forecasts 6% 
real GDP growth, further improvements in general government 
debt ratios and a continuous focus on infrastructure sector 
development. In Q4 2012, the uncertainty in respect of the 
change of political leadership resulted in a relative slow-down 
of corporate business lending growth throughout the Georgian 
banking sector. While we may continue to see this trend of 
slower growth over the next few months, we have been 
encouraged by higher levels of business activity in the first  
few months of 2013.
Our revenue in 2012 totalled GEL 498.3 million, up 21.9% 
(revenue adjusted for a one-off currency hedge gain in 2011) 
compared to 2011. The significant increase in revenue was 
due to the robust performance of our businesses and the 
effects of our diversified sources of growth. Strong interest 
income was driven by growth in both the retail and corporate 
loan books, especially in the first nine months of the year. 
Fee income increased 14.8% to GEL 86.5 million, reflecting  
our leadership in money transmission payments and the 
superior fee generating capabilities of our Corporate Banking 
business. We enjoy an estimated 50% market share in card 
acquiring business in Georgia, have unmatched client reach 
through the largest network of ATMs and Express Pay 
terminals and American Express card exclusivity in Georgia. 
During 2012, Bank of Georgia launched contactless Express 
cards for the first time in Georgia, and further developed our 
Express cards and associated loyalty programmes that are 
unique in Georgia and increasingly serve as the metro, bus 
and mini-bus transportation payment systems. The Bank 
has also significantly enhanced its already market leading 
branch network, adding 30 Express branches to bring the 
total Express and Metro branches to 63, and also more than 
doubled the number of Express Pay terminals, which are 
increasingly being used for bank transactions such as  
credit card and consumer loan repayments, cash deposits, 
utility bill payments and mobile telephone top up payments. 
Our Insurance and Healthcare businesses, which had an 
eventful year in terms of M&A activity, contributed 11.0%  
to the consolidated revenue and 8.7% to the consolidated 
profit and is becoming an increasingly meaningful source  
of the Bank’s income. 
22 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Our affordable housing business successfully completed  
its pilot project, contributing GEL 15.5 million to the 
mortgage loan book and m2 Real Estate, our real estate 
subsidiary, realised a profit of GEL 1.7 million. Non-interest 
income amounted to 43.0% of revenue, an achievement that 
is particularly striking compared to four years ago, when  
this ratio stood at 34.3%. 
We have become more efficient. For the past five quarters 
we have consistently delivered strong positive operating 
leverage, as our operating costs have regularly increased  
at only half the rate of our revenue growth. Several factors 
behind this achievement are described below. 
We successfully strengthened and expanded further  
our retail franchise through our Express Banking strategy, 
which entails the rollout out of cost-efficient small-sized 
express branches, avoiding the need to build costly flagship 
branches, to continue to serve our ever-increasing client base. 
With Express Banking in place, we have pushed further  
the ongoing shift to transactional banking by means of a 
wide-range of electronic channels, away from regular or 
flagship branches, which are now focusing on selling more 
value-added products and services. We have continued to 
invest in IT to minimise and, in certain cases, eliminate 
document flow, and stepped-up optimisation of the centralised 
retail banking back office. These developments coupled with 
the ongoing cost control measures that we already have in 
place, have resulted in a substantial improvement in the Retail 
Banking cost to income ratio to 44% from 51% last year while 
the Corporate Banking cost to income ratio improved to 33%  
from 43% in 2011. The increasing benefits we are delivering 
from these improved efficiencies are expected to underpin 
further improvements in our cost to income ratio over the  
next few years. It has been a rewarding and exciting 
experience to observe the effects of economies of scale. 
Credit quality has continued to be robust, albeit the cost  
of credit risk was at the top end of our expected range, 
increasing by GEL 22.5 million to GEL 44.7 million, or  
1.3% of the loan book. This largely reflected the absence  
of last year’s releases and recoveries, and an increase in 
the Retail Banking impairment charge as a result of the job 
reductions made by a large payroll client during the first half 
of the year. We did however see an increase in corporate 
provisions in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of a 
provision of GEL 14.2 million relating to one single corporate 
credit. This was offset however by the impact of the 2008 
and 2009 stress years dropping out of our Retail Banking 
provision methodology. 
Buttressing the Chairman’s comments in his letter, I would 
also like to highlight the excellent progress we have made 
against our liability management objectives. Throughout the 
year we have consistently sought to optimise our funding 
structure and cost base. Our strong branding and pre-
eminence in the retail segment has enabled aggressive 
deposit pricing on the back of the Bank’s growing retail 
deposit base, while the more competitive corporate 
environment led to the outflow of expensive Lari corporate 
deposits, allowing us to replace them with less-costly long-term 
international borrowing. The funding profile of Corporate 
Banking has improved markedly as the Corporate Banking  
cost of deposits declined to a historic low of 6.2% in the fourth 
quarter of 2012, also benefiting from superior access to trade 
finance lines, which provides substantially cheaper long-term 
funding. Overall, the Bank’s cost of funds decreased to 7.3% 
from 8.0% last year, and was as low as 6.6% in the fourth 
quarter of 2012. 
In 2013, we do not expect any changes to the fundamentals of 
our business strategy. We intend to continue to focus on the 
Georgian market, with Retail Banking and Corporate Banking 
driving profitability. The full effects of our recent scaling up of  
the business are still to be realised, as more customers shift to 
electronic channels. The introduction of a sophisticated CRM 
system will enhance product penetration and boost revenues 
per client, thus further improving our efficiency. 
In Corporate Banking we intend to expand our export  
and trade finance businesses and to build on our strong  
fee generating capabilities, supported by research  
and advisory services. We are set to build our regional 
asset management business on the currently of assets 
under management US$365.3 million-strong wealth 
management platform. 
The potential health insurance reform in Georgia, the 
structure of which is still under consideration, envisages  
the provision of basic healthcare coverage for the entire 
Georgian population in addition to existing state-subsidised 
socially vulnerable groups. We expect these reforms to be  
a positive factor for the healthcare revenues of Aldagi BCI, 
the country’s leading healthcare provider. 
While we are pleased with our progress in cost optimisation 
in 2012, we see lots of opportunities to further improve 
efficiency and to ensure that our costs continue to increase 
at a lower rate than our revenue growth. In 2013, we will be 
vigilant of our asset quality and continue to enhance our 
risk management practices.
At the end of December 2012, the Bank’s Total Capital ratio,  
on a Basel I basis, was 27 .0% and the Tier I Capital ratio  
was 22.0%. This reflects a very strong capital position with 
capital ratios significantly exceeding the Bank’s minimum  
capital requirements. The Group is well positioned to improve its 
performance in 2013 and this, combined with continued strong 
profitability and capital ratios, has led the Board to review  
the Group’s dividend policy. The Board has decided to 
recommend an annual dividend of GEL 1.5 per share 
payable in British Sterling at the prevailing rate subject to 
approval by shareholders at the AGM. This represents a 
significant increase of 1 14.3%, compared to the annual dividend 
of GEL 0.70 per share last year, a payout ratio of 28.7% and a 
dividend yield for shareholders of 5.5%, calculated based on the 
Group’s 2012 results and using the 31 December 2012 share 
price of GBP 10.30. Going forward, the Board will aim to 
maintain a dividend payout ratio in the 25%-40% range.
The success of the Group continues to be built on the strong 
contributions of thousands within the management and 
employee teams, and I am grateful for all their efforts and 
achievements during 2012. Their consistently superior work 
over the last few years has, I am confident, positioned Bank  
of Georgia to continue to perform strongly in the future, as  
the leading bank in Georgia.

Returns KPIs
The strength of the Group’s banking franchise and 
continuous diversification of revenue sources is reflected in 
the 2012 ROAE of 19.1%, an increase from 18.3% in 2011 
and the 17.6% increase in EPS to GEL 5.22 at the end of the 
year. Net Interest Margin (“NIM”) remains robust, which is  
a result of the decrease in cost of funds following targeted 
liability management during the year. The healthy growth  
of the loan book, increasing share of non-interest income, 
strong margins and improving cost efficiency translated into 
23.7% growth in Profit before Income Tax (“PBT”), one of 
the primary profitability measures used by management  
to assess the performance of the Group. Strong capital 
generation of the Group, prompted the Board to recommend 
a 114% increase in dividend payment to GEL 1.5 equivalent 
in GBP per share for 2012 (2011: GEL 0.7).
In 2013 and beyond, we will continue to focus on the 
profitable earnings growth, to be driven by good levels  
of customer lending growth without compromising asset 
quality, an increase in the share of non-interest income in 
the revenue as we grow fee generating businesses and 
expand our insurance and healthcare operations.

Efficiency KPIs
The Cost to Income ratio has been steadily improving  
over the last three years as a result of ongoing cost 
efficiency measures undertaken by the Bank. These 
measures have, among others, included various 
investments in IT aimed at optimisation of workflow 
processes, as well as the introduction of a new Express 
Banking model, which has given a boost to cost efficient 
transactional banking by using electronic channels. On the 
flip side, revenue grew at a rate of more than four times the 
rate of cost growth (21.9%* compared to 5.2%), as a result 
of robust growth across all business segments of the 
Group, including its insurance and healthcare businesses. 
Positive operating leverage is one of the key execution 
priorities for the management in order to ensure that 
revenues increase at a faster rate than costs on an  
ongoing basis.

Growth KPIs 
The loan book growth was driven by strong lending momentum 
in both the retail and corporate businesses, which saw a 10.4% 
and 23. 1% growth in lending, respectively. The demand for 
corporate lending has been subdued in the fourth quarter of 
2012 and beginning of 2013, however a pick-up in corporate 
lending is expected to take place in the second half of the year 
and to contribute to the double digit growth of net loan book 
over the medium term. 
The strong funding position allowed us to comfortably 
finance the loan book growth while decreasing funding 
costs. We ended 2012 with a strong liability structure,  
with client deposits accounting for 57.1% of liabilities and 
the loan to deposit and Developmental Financial Institutions 
(“DFIs”) ratio at comfortable level of 91.9%.

Capital KPIs
We further strengthened our capital position as reflected 
in the robust Tier I Capital (BIS) ratio of 22.0%. The 
improvement in the capital position came from strong 
capital generation on the back of increasing risk weighted 
assets. Strong capital generating capability allowed us  
to increase the annual dividend payment for 2012 and  
to announce that BGH targets a dividend payout of 
between 25%-40% range going forward, subject to market 
conditions and the Group’s performance. Risk weighted 
assets increased 24.6%, reflecting the increase in interest 
earning assets during the year, while Tier I Capital (BIS) 
increased by 37.8%, as a result of higher retained  
earnings and the conversion of the European Bank  
for Reconstruction and Development (“EBRD”) and 
International Finance Corporation (“IFC”) subordinated  
and convertible loans into Bank of Georgia’s equity, 
subsequently acquired by BGH upon the completion  
of the Tender Offer. In 2013 and beyond, we intend  
to maintain strong capital ratios, well above the  
regulatory requirements.

Overview
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group delivered a profit of GEL 179.6 million, an increase of 32.3% against the 
profit for the year ended 31 December 2011. This strong progress continues to reflect the strength of the Bank’s earnings 
power and resulted in a return on average equity of 19.1%, which is an increase from 18.3% for 2011, and earnings per 
share growth of 17.6% to GEL 5.22 per share, reflecting a strong business performance, significantly reduced cost of 
funding and improved efficiency across the business.
Revenue
The Group maintained strong growth momentum across all main revenue items in 2012, delivering record revenue of 
GEL 498.3 million, a 14.9% increase compared to 2011. Adjusted for the impact of the last year’s one-off BYR currency 
hedge gains, total revenue increased by 21.9% compared to 2011.
The key driver of this solid revenue growth was net interest income, which increased by 18.7% to GEL 284.1 million. Net 
interest income before interest rate swaps grew 22.0% to GEL 285.8 million, a result of healthy growth of the consolidated 
loan book, largely stable loan yields (2012: 17.5%; 2011: 17.6%) and reduced funding costs (2012: 7.3%; 2011: 8.0%).

* Other operating non-interest income includes net gains from foreign currencies, net revenue from sale of goods of the Group’s non-banking

In a positive shift towards diversifying revenue sources, net non-interest income (excluding the effects of one-off gains 
from the BYR currency hedge in 2011) grew 26.4% in 2012, boosted by the net insurance and net healthcare revenues, 
a result of a combination of organic growth and acquisitions by Aldagi BCI, the Group’s insurance and healthcare 
subsidiary. Net insurance revenue almost doubled to GEL 34.1 million, net healthcare revenue grew nearly tenfold to  
GEL 23.3 million. The two businesses together contributing 11.0% to the consolidated revenue in 2012, compared to  
4.7% in 2011. 
An increase in the level of economic activity in 2012 had a positive effect on the activity of the Group’s clients across 
all lines of settlement operations, including the Group’s card business operations, guarantees and letters of credit and 
cash operations. The growth of our Express Banking service, through which the Group delivers extremely cost-effective 
self-service transactional and remote banking facilities, has supported strong growth in banking operations. As a result, 
net fee and commission income grew 14.8% to GEL 86.5 million in 2012. 
Other operating non-interest income, adjusted for one-off gains from the Belarusian Ruble currency hedge, decreased 
5.0% to GEL 70.2 million, as a result of a 3.5% decline in net gain from foreign currencies reflecting the slowdown in 
economic activity in the second half of 2012 and a 4.4% decrease in other operating income. Affordable Housing and 
the Group’s non-core segments contributed GEL 4.4 million and GEL 9.6 million respectively to other operating income 
in 2012. Overall, other operating non-interest income declined by 29.1% year-on-year, due to the one-off gain of 
GEL 25.1 million on the BYR currency hedge in 2011.
Net non-interest income amounted to 43.0% of total revenue compared to 41.5% in 2011 (excluding the one-off gains 
from BYR hedge in 2011).

During 2012, the Group’s operating expenses increased by 5.2% to GEL 221.2 million, significantly lagging behind the 
revenue growth rate of 14.9%. Adjusted for the one-off BYR hedge gain in 2011, operating leverage was 16.7% in 2012. 
The increase in expenses primarily reflected a 6.9% increase in salaries and other employee benefits as a result of  
the Group’s headcount growth to service the Group’s increased revenue base over the course of 2012. General and 
administrative expenses for the reporting period grew by 8.2% to GEL 67.0 million, which included expenditure on new 
branches, distribution channels such as ATMs and Express Pay terminals, and marketing costs. The cost to income ratio 
improved further to 44.4% in 2012 from 48.5%, benefiting from ongoing cost efficiency measures undertaken by the 
Group. When adjusted for the one-off revenue gains in 2011, the cost to income ratio improved substantially from 51.4% 
adjusted for Belarusian Ruble hedge gains to 44.4%, reflecting significant underlying cost efficiency improvements.

Net operating income 232,386 201,392 15.4%
The cost of credit risk increased by GEL 22.5 million to GEL 44.7 million in 2012, reflecting the absence of the previous 
year’s recoveries, the increase in the Retail Banking impairment charge as a result of job reductions made in a large 
payroll client during the first half of 2012 and the increase in the Corporate Banking cost of risk in the second half of 2012, 
predominantly due to provisions attributed to a single corporate client in the fourth quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter  
of 2012, the Group recognised an impairment charge of GEL 14.2 million (increasing respective allowance for losses to 
50% of total balance sheet exposure) in respect to one of the larger corporate clients of the Group in the infrastructure 
sector, with a total exposure of GEL 58.8 million, of which GEL 36.2 million comprises a loan and GEL 22.6 million 
off-balance sheet guarantee. Bankruptcy procedures have been initiated against the borrower, and while the Group 
expects to be able to recover the un-provisioned amount of the loan from the borrower’s assets (including pledged 
collateral) in the bankruptcy proceeding it will continue to assess objective evidence of further impairment of the  
overall exposure in 2013. These factors, which negatively affected the cost of risk, were partially offset by the effects 
of a change in the collective assessment methodology. 
The loss experience used to determine the appropriate collective assessment rates was changed from seven years to 
three years in Retail Banking in 2012. As a result of the foregoing, in 2012 cost of risk amounted to 1.3%, compared to 
0.9% in 2011. The allowance for loan impairment was GEL 110.5 million or 3.5% of total gross loans as at 31 December 
2012, compared to 4.2% as at 31 December 2011.
The Group’s Non-performing loans (“NPLs”) increased to GEL 126.3 million as at 31 December 2012 from GEL 100.3 
million a year earlier, reflecting the addition of the above-mentioned corporate client. NPLs are defined as the principal  
and interest on loans overdue for more than 90 days and any additional losses estimated by Execuitve Management.  
The Bank’s NPLs to total gross loans ratio was 3.9% as at 31 December 2012, an increase from 3.7% in 2011, while  
NPL coverage ratio, including discounted value of collateral was 87.5% at 31 December 2012. NPL coverage ratio 
excluding discounted value of collateral was 110% at 31 December 2012.

an increase of GEL 40.7 million, or 23.7%, compared to 2011. After income tax expense of GEL 33.2 million, the Group’s 
profit for the period was GEL 179.6 million, an increase of GEL 28.6 million, or 19.0%, while profit for the period adjusted

32 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 As at 31 December 2012, the Group’s total assets were GEL 5,655.6 million, an increase of 21.2% compared to 
31 December 2011. The annual growth in total assets reflects a strong growth in net loan book, which increased 
by GEL 476.0 million or 18.2% compared to 2011. On a constant currency basis, the net loan book grew by 19.2% 
compared to 2011. 
The Group’s liquid assets, which comprise high quality assets including NBG certificates of deposit, Georgian government 
treasury bills and bonds and interbank deposits and cash and cash equivalents, grew by 21.3% to GEL 1,624.3 million at 
31 December 2012. The funds raised as a result of the Eurobond issuance by Bank of Georgia in July 2012 contributed to 
the significant increase in the liquidity pool.
The growth of the Group’s loan book during the course of 2012 was driven by a 10.4% increase in Retail Banking lending 
to GEL 1,348.3 million and a 23.1% increase in Corporate Banking lending to GEL 1,696.3 million. Approximately 87.1% 
of the Group’s loan book was collateralised as of 31 December 2012 (2011: 85.0%). Loans denominated in foreign 
currencies (primarily in US dollars) accounted for 68.3% of the Group’s net loan book as at 31 December 2012, 
compared to 69.6% as at 31 December 2011.
Total liabilities 
Total liabilities amounted to GEL 4,596.1 million, an increase of 19.3% in 2012, driven by the growth in borrowed funds, 
which increased 42.0% to GEL 1,225.8 million as a result of the Eurobond issued in July 2012. The Group’s average 
customer funds grew 25.0% to GEL 2,772.6 million during 2012, while the deposit rate cuts during the course of 2012 
led to a reduction of the more costly GEL denominated deposit base, decreasing customer funds to GEL 2,693.0 million 
as at 31 December 2012, a 1.5% decrease compared to 31 December 2011. Client deposits denominated in foreign 
currency accounted for 68.7% of the Group’s total client deposits as at 31 December 2012 (2011: 59.1%). 
Shareholders’ equity
Total equity amounted to GEL 1,059.5 million, a 16.3% increase since 28 February 2012, when Bank of Georgia Holdings acquired 
98.3% of the entire issued capital of Bank of Georgia as a result of the Tender Offer which was completed in February 2012. Total 
equity increased by GEL 246.9 million compared to Bank of Georgia’s total equity as at 31 December 201 1, the increase reflecting 
the inclusion of the current year’s profit and the conversion of loan notes by EBRD and IFC into equity in February 2012. (See Notes 
18 and 20 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).
The Group’s book value per share on 31 December 2012 was GEL 30.33 (US$18.31/£11.38) and GEL 25.98 
(US$15.55/£10.08) as at 31 December 2011.

Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 33
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Business review – Overview of financial results continued
The composition of the Bank’s balance sheet reflects its aim to maintain a diversified funding base, while optimising 
funding costs. Customer lending was largely funded by customer deposits, as the increase of the average client loans by 
GEL 441.9 million in 2012 compares to the increase of average customer funds by GEL 555.3 million. The strong trend of 
client deposit inflows in the first half of 2012 was reversed in the second half of 2012, as reduced deposit pricing led to 
lower customer account balances of corporate clients in particular in the fourth quarter of 2012. The targeted deposit 
repricing resulted in the further reduction in the cost of client deposits to 7.3% in 2012 from 7.6% in 2011. 
The change in the funding structure also reflected the issuance of the five-year Eurobond in July 2012, which accounted 
for 34.3% of the borrowed funds and 9.2% of total liabilities. Long-term lending from DFIs accounted for 54.9% of the 
Bank’s borrowed funds and 14.6% of total liabilities, translating into good quality long-term less expensive funding source 
for the Group. 
Reflecting the continued discipline with deposit pricing, the cost of client deposits declined from 7.6% in 2011 to 7.3% in 
2012. Cost of funds from credit institutions decreased by 161 basis points to 7.2% in 2012, largely as a result of repayment 
of costly international borrowings. As a result of targeted liability management during the year, Cost of funds declined from 
8.0% in 2011 to 7.3% in 2012. Net loans to customer funds and long-term DFI funding ratio was 91.9% as at 31 December 
2012 (2011: 79.1%), while net loans to customer funds ratio was 114.8% (2011: 95.7%).

Risk-weighted assets increased 24.6% to GEL 4,785.9 million, reflecting the increase in interest earning assets during 
2012, while Tier I Capital (BIS) increased by GEL 289.2 million, due to the generated retained profits and the conversion of 
the EBRD and IFC subordinated and convertible loans into Bank of Georgia’s equity, subsequently acquired by BGH upon 
the completion of the Tender Offer. Total Capital resources increased by GEL 197.3 million.

Per NBG, the Bank ended 2012 with a very strong capital position with robust Tier I Capital ratio of 13.8%, as opposed  
to the minimal 8% required by NBG. This is a further improvement from the 10.5% Tier I Capital ratio of the Bank in 2011. 
Tier I Capital increased by GEL 227.6 million, due to the generated retained profits and due to the conversion of the EBRD 
and IFC subordinated and convertible loans into the Bank’s equity. Total Capital per NBG increased by GEL 75.2 million, 
affected by a decline in subordinated debt due to repayments. 
Risk weighted assets increased by 9.8% to GEL 5,352.2 million, reflecting the increase in interest earning assets. 
Among other differences between BIS and NBG capital regulations, the key ones are summarised below: 
 – BIS is based on Group consolidated audited IFRS numbers, while NBG is based on Bank standalone unaudited 
numbers per NBG standards; 
 – Per NBG standard, 175% total risk weighting (including both credit risk and market risk) is applied to loans denominated 
in foreign currency (with an exception for export-related income of a borrower), while a maximum of 100% total risk 
weighting is applied to such loans under Basel. 
 – Current year profit per the NBG is part of Tier II Capital and moves to Tier I Capital at the start of the next year, while per 
BIS current year profit is part of total retained earnings and, therefore, included in Tier I of current year.

In 2012, Retail Banking revenue growth of 16.8% was largely 
driven by an increase in net interest income, reflecting the  
strong growth of the retail net loan book. Loan yield increased 
by 36 basis points to 21.4%, while cost of deposits decreased 
from 6.7% in 2011 to 6.1% in 2012, benefiting from the Bank’s 
leadership in Georgia’s retail segment. Net fees and commission 
income increased to GEL 53.6 million as a result of a growth  
of the Bank’s card operations, boosted by the launch of the 
Bank’s Express Banking franchise. 
Strong positive operating leverage was achieved as operating 
expenses grew by 1.0% being significantly less than the retail 
revenue growth of 16.8%. Increased efficiencies of scale, 
supported by the build-out of the Bank’s Express Banking 
franchise and prudent cost control measures, resulted in a 
markedly improved Retail Banking cost to income ratio,  
which was 44.3% in 2012 compared to 51.2% in 2011. 
The cost of credit risk of GEL 12.5 million was largely attributed 
to the consumer loan and credit card portfolio, reflecting 
provisions and impairments on credit card and consumer  
loan balances of employees of the large payroll client that 
implemented a significant layoff during the course of 2012. 
Deposits from retail clients increased by 15.5% to GEL 816.7 million, 
US dollar-denominated deposits decreased to 69.4% of retail 
deposits as at 31 December 2012 compared to 73.2% as at  
31 December 2011.

The 18.1% growth of Corporate Banking revenue during 2012  
was driven by an 18.5% growth in net interest income and strong 
growth of net fees and commission income, in line with the  
Group’s focus on further developing its fee generating business  
for corporate clients. Net gains from foreign currencies rose, 
reflecting the increase in volumes of foreign currency conversions 
by the Bank’s corporate clients. Further improvements in operating 
efficiency resulted in an 8.8% decrease in Corporate Banking 
operating costs, translating into an improved Corporate Banking 
cost to income ratio of 33.2%, compared with 42.9% in 2011. 
Corporate Banking cost of credit risk increased to GEL 29.5 million 
from GEL 21.6 million in 2011. 
Corporate Banking posted profit before income tax expense  
of GEL 65.6 million, an increase of 39.6% compared to 2011. 
Corporate Banking net loans increased by 23.1%, to  
GEL 1,696.3 million, while Corporate Banking client deposits 
decreased as a result of targeted outflow of costly GEL denominated 
corporate deposits following the deposit re-pricing during 2012. 
The resulting reduction of corporate cost of deposits to 6.2% in 
the fourth quarter of 2012 has not been reflected in the full year 
ratio. US dollar denominated deposits represented 50.2% of 
corporate deposits, up from 38.4% in 2011.
Corporate Banking business in Georgia comprises of  
loans and other credit facilities to the country’s large corporate 
clients as well as other legal entities generating revenue of 
more than GEL 5 million. The services include fund transfers 
and settlements services, currency conversion operations, 
trade finance services and documentary operations as well  
as handling savings and term deposits for corporate and 
institutional customers. Corporate Banking business also

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Principal Risk  
and Uncertainties
The following discussion sets forth certain risks and 
uncertainties that the Group believes are material. If any 
of the following risks actually occur, the Group’s business, 
financial condition, results of operations or prospects 
could be materially affected. The risks and uncertainties 
described below may not be the only ones the Group faces. 
Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that the 
Group is currently not aware of or deems immaterial, may 
also result in decreased revenues, incurred expenses or 
other events that could result in a decline in the value of 
the Group’s securities.
Macroeconomic risks and political risks 
related to Georgia
Difficult global economic conditions have had, and 
may continue to have, a material adverse effect on 
the Group
The Group conducts its operations mainly in Georgia, 
where most of its customers and assets are located. 
Nevertheless, the Group’s business and performance are 
affected by global macroeconomic and market conditions. 
In 2008, the global economy entered the most severe 
downturn in 80 years, with the financial services industry 
facing unprecedented turmoil. A shortage of liquidity, limited 
availability of funding, pressure on capital, deteriorating 
asset quality and significant price volatility across a wide 
range of asset classes put financial institutions, including 
the Group under considerable pressure. Many developed 
economies entered into recession and growth slowed in 
many emerging economies, including Georgia.
The financial crisis was accompanied by a number of 
related developments, including an erosion of confidence in 
financial institutions, increased currency volatility, increased 
counterparty risk and the risk of systemic failures. Such 
circumstances have caused disruptions in financial markets 
worldwide, leading to liquidity and funding difficulties in the 
international banking system. Access to capital, the credit 
markets, FDI and other forms of liquidity was significantly 
impaired and the cost of financing for financial institutions 
increased considerably. As a result, the cost of borrowing in 
the wholesale debt markets increased for the Group, the debt 
capital markets were effectively closed or severely restricted to 
banks in emerging markets and certain international financial 
institutions owned by national governments, including the 
EBRD and the IFC, became the principal source of long-term 
funding for the Group. The financial crisis also had a significant 
adverse effect on the valuation of assets and the capital 
position of many financial institutions globally.
Although global markets showed signs of improvement in 
2010 and in the first half of 2011, during the second half of 
2011 and in 2012, there has been turmoil in the European 
banking system and a deterioration of sovereign credit of 
a number of European countries including Greece, Ireland, 
Italy, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus. In addition, during 2012 
there were concerns that these countries may experience 
“double-dip” or prolonged recessions. These developments 
have created an unfavourable environment for the banking 
sector globally and in Georgia and could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
Regional tensions could have an adverse effect on 
the local economy and the Group
Georgia, which is bordered by Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia 
and Turkey, could be adversely affected by political unrest 
within its borders and in surrounding countries. In particular, 
Georgia has had ongoing disputes in the breakaway regions  
of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia and  
with Russia since the restoration of its independence in 1991. 
These disputes have led to sporadic violence and breaches  
of peace-keeping operations. Most recently, in August 2008, 
the conflict in the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia escalated 
as Georgian troops engaged with local militias and Russian 
forces that crossed the international border, and Georgia 
declared a state of war (the “2008 Conflict”). Although Georgia 
and Russia signed a French-brokered ceasefire that called  
for the withdrawal of Russian forces later that month, Russia 
recognised independence of the breakaway regions and 
Russian troops continue to occupy Abkhazia and the 
Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia and tensions continue. In 
addition, relations between Georgia’s neighbours, Azerbaijan 
and Armenia, remain tense and there are sporadic instances 
of violence between these two countries. Russia is opposed 
to the eastward enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation, potentially including ex-Soviet republics, such  
as Georgia. The Georgian government has taken certain  
steps towards improving relations with Russia, however these 
have not currently resulted in any formal or legal changes  
in the relationship between the two countries. Any future 
deterioration or worsening of Georgia’s relationship with 
Russia, including any major changes in Georgia’s relations 
with Western governments and institutions, in particular in 
terms of national security, Georgia’s importance to Western 
energy supplies, the amount of aid granted to Georgia or the 
ability of Georgian manufacturers to access world export 
markets, or a significant deterioration in relations between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia, may have a negative effect on the 
political and economic stability of Georgia, which could have 
an adverse effect on the Group.
46 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 As most of the Group’s businesses operate only 
within Georgia, the Group’s success is dependent 
on a number of economic, political and other factors 
affecting Georgia that are beyond its control
For the year ended 31 December 2012, 96.2% of the 
Group’s total consolidated profit was derived from its 
business in Georgia. Therefore, macroeconomic factors 
relating to Georgia, such as GDP, inflation, interest and 
currency exchange rates, as well as unemployment, 
personal income and the financial condition of companies, 
have a material impact on loan losses, margins and 
customer demand for the Group’s products and services, 
which materially affects the Group’s business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
Georgia’s main economic activities include tourism, transit 
services, agriculture, mining, metals, machinery and 
chemicals. According to the Geostat, the country’s  
real GDP grew by 9.4% in 2006 and 12.3% in 2007 and, 
according to the Ministry of Finance of Georgia, this  
growth was largely based on strong inflows of FDI and 
robust spending by the Government of Georgia. However, 
the global economic downturn and the 2008 Conflict led 
to a decline in public spending and Georgia experienced  
a 57.9% reduction in FDI in 2009, compared to 2008,  
Real GDP in Georgia declined by 3.8% in 2009 compared 
with growth of real GDP by 2.3% in 2008 due to the  
global economic crisis, which led to deterioration in the 
employment market in Georgia and, in turn, contributed to  
a decrease in loans and a slowdown in the rate of growth  
of deposits in the Georgian banking sector. In addition, the 
Georgian banking sector began to experience a shortage of 
liquidity in the second half of 2008, which continued into the 
first half of 2009, increasing competition for retail deposits.
The economic slowdown in Georgia reduced the growth rate 
of the Group’s portfolio of retail and corporate loans. This in 
turn affected the Group’s net fee and commission income 
(and, to a certain extent, the Group’s net interest income, 
although net interest income was predominantly affected  
by a reduction in the size of the Group’s securities portfolio). 
Moreover, financing costs increased due to both the limited 
availability of funding on the inter-bank market, mainly driven 
by credit risk aversion, and increasing interest rates on bank 
deposits resulting from increasing competition in the deposit 
market, which also had a negative impact on the net interest 
income earned by the Group. In addition, the quality of  
the Group’s loan portfolio deteriorated as a result of the 
economic slowdown, which resulted in an increase in the 
Group’s loans past due more than 90 days. NPLs, defined  
as loans past due more than 90 days and any additional 
losses estimated by the management declined from GEL 
117.6 million at 31 December 2010 to GEL 100.3 million as 
at 31 December 2011 and then increased to GEL 126.3 
million as at 31 December 2012. FDI grew by 37.2% to  
US$ 1.1 billion in 2011 from 2010 and declined by 22.6% 
to an estimated US$ 865.2 million in 2012. Although the 
Georgian economy showed signs of improvement in 2010, 
2011 and 2012, with real GDP growth of 6.3% in 2010, 7.2% 
in 2011, there can be no assurance that the recovery will 
continue or that there will not be a further deterioration in 
Georgia’s economy. 
Market turmoil and economic deterioration in Georgia 
could also have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, 
businesses or financial condition of the Group’s borrowers, 
which could in turn, increase the Group’s NPL ratios, impair 
its loans and other financial assets and result in decreased 
demand for the Group’s products. In such an environment, 
consumer spending may decline and the value of assets 
used as collateral for the Group’s secured loans, including 
real estate, could also decrease significantly which could 
reduce recoveries on defaulting loans. Any of these 
conditions could have a material adverse effect on  
the Group’s business, financial condition and results  
of operations.
In addition, the Georgian economy is highly dollarised. 
Prior to 2008, the dollarisation rate of the banking system 
(defined as foreign currency deposits as a share of total 
deposits) had declined with foreign currency deposits 
accounting for approximately 64.4% of all client deposits as 
at 1 January 2008. As a result of the combined effects of 
the 2008 Conflict and the global financial crisis, however, 
the dollarisation rate increased to approximately 73.6%  
as at 1 January 2009, although it has since decreased to 
approximately 68.8% as at 1 January 2010, 67.0% as at  
1 January 2011, 59.2% as at 1 January 2012 and increased 
to 63.8% as at 1 January 2013. Although the NBG has 
adopted measures to support the development of Georgia’s 
domestic money markets, the dollarisation rate could 
adversely impact on the effectiveness of the implementation 
of the NBG’s monetary and exchange rate policies, which 
could negatively impact the purchasing power of the Lari, 
restrict future growth in the GDP of Georgia and depress 
Georgia’s investment climate. Any of these effects could, 
in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Georgian 
economy and therefore an adverse effect on the Group.
Instability or a lack of growth in the domestic 
currency market may have an adverse effect on 
the development of Georgia’s economy and, in 
turn, have an adverse effect on the Group
Although the Lari is a fully convertible currency, there is 
generally no market outside Georgia for the exchange of 
Lari. A market exists within Georgia for the conversion of 
Lari into other currencies, but it is limited in size. According 
to the NBG, in 2012, the total volume of trading turnover  
in the Lari-US Dollar and Lari-Euro markets (excluding 
activities of the NBG) amounted to US$ 14.4 billion and  
€5.0 billion, respectively. According to the NBG, the  
NBG had US$ 2.8 billion in gross official reserves as at  
31 December 2011 and US$ 2.9 billion as at 31 December 
2012. While the Government of Georgia has stated that 
these reserves will be sufficient to sustain the domestic 
currency market in the short term, a lack of growth of this 
currency market may hamper the development of Georgia’s 
economy, which could have a material adverse effect on the 
businesses of the Group’s corporate customers and, in 
turn, a material adverse effect on the Group.

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
In addition, a lack of stability in the currency market may 
adversely affect Georgia’s economy. There was significant 
instability in the Lari to US dollar exchange rate following the 
Russian financial crisis of August 1998 and again following 
the 2008 Conflict. In November 2008, the NBG devalued 
the Lari by 16.1%, a measure aimed at alleviating the 
negative impact of the global financial crisis on the Georgian 
economy. While the Lari generally appreciated against the 
US dollar and other major international currencies from 
2001 to 2008, the Lari then generally depreciated against 
the US dollar and other major international currencies until 
April 2011, since then the exchange rate has remained 
stable. The Lari/US dollar exchange rate was 1.7728 as 
at 31 December 2010, 1.6703 as at 31 December 2011  
and 1.6567 as at 31 December 2012 The ability of the 
Government of Georgia and the NBG to limit any volatility of 
the Lari will depend on a number of political and economic 
factors, including the NBG’s and the Government’s ability to 
control inflation, the availability of foreign currency reserves 
and FDI and other currency inflows. Any failure to do so,  
or a major depreciation or further devaluation of the Lari, 
could adversely affect Georgia’s economy. According to the 
information provided by Geostat, annual inflation in Georgia, 
as measured by the end-of-period CPI in Georgia was 2.0% 
in 2011 and 11.2% in 2010. Inflation continued to rise in  
the first half of 2011, reaching 14.3% at 31 May 2011, but 
then decreased to 2.0% at 31 December 2011. This trend 
continued throughout 2012 with inflation turning into 1.4% 
deflation at 31 December 2012. There is no guarantee that 
the country will continue to remain unaffected by global 
increases in food prices. High and sustained inflation could 
lead to market instability, a financial crisis, a reduction in 
consumer purchasing power and erosion of consumer 
confidence. On the other hand, deflation, whilst increasing 
the purchasing power of the Lari, can adversely affect 
foreign investment and the Group’s profitability in its lending 
activities. Any of these events could lead to a deterioration 
in the performance of Georgia’s economy and negatively 
affect the businesses of the Group’s customers which 
could, in turn, have an adverse effect on the Group.
Political and governmental instability in Georgia 
could have a material adverse effect on the local 
economy and the Group
Since the restoration of its independence in 1991, 
Georgia has experienced an ongoing substantial political 
transformation from a constituent republic in a federal 
socialist state to an independent sovereign democracy. 
At the most recent Georgian Parliamentary elections (which 
were held on 1 October 2012) the Georgian Dream coalition 
won the election by a majority of seats. The Georgian 
Dream party is generally seen to be business and investor 
friendly and to date, has implemented economic and fiscal 
policies which have generally been designed to liberalise 
the Georgian economy. The Georgian Dream coalition is 
led by Bidzina Ivanishvili, who was officially approved by 
the Parliament of Georgia (the “Parliament”) as the country’s 
new Prime Minister on 25 October 2012. Although the 
Georgian Dream Coalition won the 2012 Parliamentary 
elections and Bidzina Ivanishvili is the Prime Minister 
and head of government, the leader of the United National 
Movement Party, Mikheil Saakashvili, is President of Georgia 
and head of state. Pursuant to the provisions of Georgia’s 
constitution (the “Constitution”), the Georgian President 
currently has the ability to veto legislation adopted by the 
Parliament. Georgia faces several challenges, one of which is 
the need to implement further economic and political reforms. 
However, there can be no assurance that these business and 
investor friendly reforms will continue or will not be reversed or 
that such reforms and economic growth will not be hindered 
as a result of any changes affecting the continuity or stability of 
the coalition government or as a result of a rejection of reform 
policies by the President, the Parliament or otherwise. 
Mikheil Saakashvili has served as President of Georgia 
for two terms, having first been elected in January 2004. 
The next presidential elections are scheduled to be held in 
October 2013. However, pursuant to the provisions of the 
Constitution, President Saakashvili cannot stand for a third 
term in office. Should any protests or criticism arise in 
relation to the conduct or outcome of the 2013 Presidential 
election this may lead to political instability or disruption 
within Georgia. 
Additionally, on 15 October 2010, the Parliament approved 
amendments to the Constitution which are intended to 
enhance the primary governing responsibility of the 
Parliament, increase the powers of the Prime Minister 
and reduce the powers of the Presidency. It is currently 
anticipated that the majority of these amendments to the 
Constitution will become effective after the 2013 Presidential 
election. However, although in March 2013 the Parliament 
has unanimously adopted certain amendments to the 
constitution thus limiting the powers of the President, there 
can be no assurance that the proposed favourable reforms 
in the healthcare and insurance business will continue,  
will not be reversed or will not otherwise be hindered.  
There can be no assurance that changes to Georgian 
Parliamentary, Presidential or Prime Ministerial powers  
will not create political disruptions or political instability or 
otherwise negatively affect the political climate in Georgia. 
The Georgian Dream coalition government is currently 
in the process of preparing and finalising a range of new 
initiatives, including amendments to the Labour Code, 
anti-monopoly regulations, court system and changes to 
the regulation of the healthcare sector. The Group sees its 
healthcare and insurance business as one area of future 
growth for the Group. Current planned healthcare reform 
significantly increases the market available to the Group’s 
current and proposed activities. 
Changes in governmental policy, including changes in 
the implementation or approach of previously announced 
government initiatives, could have a material adverse affect 
on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of 
operations and prospects.
The Group may experience increases in its 
income taxes
During the three years ended 31 December 2012, the 
corporation income tax rate in Georgia was 15%. This tax 
rate is generally lower than the tax rate applicable to other 
of the Group’s peer companies, particularly 
48 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 those operating in more developed Western countries. 
Furthermore, by virtue of the Economic Liberty Act passed 
by Parliament in July 2011 which enters into force on  
1 January 2014 subject to certain exceptions, referenda are 
required to be held before raising taxes and tax rates. 
However, no assurance can be given that there will not 
in the future be an increase in corporate income tax in 
Georgia. Any significant increase in the rate of corporate 
income tax in Georgia or other changes in taxation policy 
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks relating to the Group’s lending 
activities
The Group may not be able to maintain the quality 
of its loan portfolio
The quality of the Group’s loan portfolio is affected by  
changes in the creditworthiness of its customers, the ability of 
customers to repay their loans on time, the statutory priority  
of claims against customers and the Group’s ability to enforce 
its security interests on customers’ collateral should such 
customers fail to repay their loans and whether the value of 
such collateral is sufficient to cover the full amounts of those 
loans. In addition, the quality of the Group’s loan portfolio  
may deteriorate due to various other reasons, such as any 
negative developments in Georgia’s economy resulting in the 
financial distress or bankruptcy of the Group’s customers or 
the unavailability or limited availability of credit information 
concerning certain customers, and other factors, such as a 
failure of the Group’s risk management procedures or a rapid 
expansion of the Group’s loan portfolio. For example, during 
2008 and 2009, the Group’s loan book quality was negatively 
affected by the economic slowdown in Georgia, Ukraine  
and Belarus, as well as by the 2008 Conflict. The Group’s 
loan impairment charges were to GEL 39.7 million in 2012 
compared to GEL 23.5 million in 2011 and GEL 44.1 million  
in 2010. Also, as at 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010, loans 
past-due more than 90 days accounted for 2.6%, 3.2% and 
4.6% of total gross loans, respectively. NPLs accounted for 
3.9% of gross loans as at 31 December 2012, 3.7% as at  
31 December 2011 and 4.6% as at 31 December 2010. Loans 
that would otherwise be overdue or impaired whose terms 
(including as to principal and interest payment) have been 
renegotiated due to the borrower’s existing or possible  
inability to pay (“Renegotiated Loans”) accounted for 3.2%  
of total gross loans as at 31 December 2012 as compared  
to 4.5% and 10.9% as at 31 December 2011 and 2010, 
respectively. For more information regarding the credit quality  
of Renegotiated Loans, see “The Group’s risk management 
methods may provide ineffective at mitigating credit risk.” 
Although, the Board does not believe that there is a material 
risk that the Group’s loan portfolio quality will deteriorate in the 
next 12 months, there can be no assurance that in the longer 
term the Group’s loan portfolio quality will not deteriorate and 
that the Group’s loan impairment charges will not increase, 
which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Group’s loan portfolio for its corporate banking 
segment is highly concentrated, with the Group’s top  
ten corporate borrowers accounting for 17.4% of the 
Group’s total loan portfolio as at 31 December 2012  
(gross of allowance for impairment). To the extent that the 
Group grows its loan portfolio by entering into additional 
arrangements with existing counterparties, it will increase 
its credit and general counterparty risk with respect to 
those counterparties.
Collateral values may decline
As at 31 December 2012, the Group held collateral  
against gross loans amounting to GEL 2,789.3 million, 
corresponding to 87.1% of the Group’s total gross loans. 
The main forms of collateral taken by the Group in its 
corporate lending are charges over real estate, equipment, 
inventory and trade receivables. The main form of collateral 
taken by the Group in its retail lending is a mortgage over 
residential property. In respect of mortgage loans which are 
secured by real estate, the Group imposes a loan-to-value 
(based on a liquidation value of the collateral) ratio of 
between 60% and 90% at the time the loan is advanced, 
depending on the value of the collateral. Downturns in the 
residential and commercial real estate markets or a general 
deterioration of economic conditions in the industries in 
which the Group’s customers operate, such as occurred 
during 2008 and 2009, may result in illiquidity and a decline 
in the value of the collateral securing the Group’s loans, 
including a decline to levels below the outstanding principal 
balance of those loans.
In addition, declining or unstable prices of collateral in 
Georgia may make it difficult for the Group to accurately 
value collateral held by it. If the fair value of the collateral 
held by the Group declines significantly in the future, the 
Group could be required to record additional provisions 
and could experience lower than expected recovery levels 
on collateralised loans past due more than 90 days which 
could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Group. 
Significant changes or volatility in the Group’s 
net interest margin could have an adverse effect 
on the Group
The Group derives the majority of its total net income from net 
interest income. As a result, the Group’s operations are affected 
by fluctuations in its net interest margin. In particular, the 
Group’s banking operations depend on the management of key 
factors which affect the Group’s net interest margin, such as 
interest rates, competition for loans and deposits, customer 
demand and costs of funding. These key factors are influenced 
by factors beyond the Group’s control, such as global and local 
economic conditions, the resources of the Group’s competitors 
and consumer confidence. Interest rates are highly sensitive 
to many factors beyond the Group’s control, including monetary 
policies and domestic and international economic and political 
conditions and the reserve policies of the NBG.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 49
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
A mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing 
liabilities in any given period resulting from changes in any 
of the key factors outlined above, or otherwise, could 
reduce the Group’s net interest margin. The Group’s NIM 
was 7.9%, 7.8% and 8.8% in the years ended 31 December 
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The slight increase in the 
Group’s NIM in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to the 
overall decrease of the Group’s cost of funding from 8.0% 
in 2011 to 7.3% in 2012, supported by a decrease in the 
proportion of Lari denominated customer deposits within 
total customer deposits in the second half of 2012 in 
particular. Any reduction in the Group’s NIM caused by 
changes in the key factors outlined above otherwise  
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s net 
interest income, which could, in turn, have a material 
adverse effect on the Group.
In addition, any increase in interest rates may result in an 
increase in the instalment amounts paid by the Group’s 
customers. Such an increase may result in difficulties 
related to the repayment of the assumed loans, which in 
turn may lead to a decrease in the quality of the Group’s 
loan portfolio and an increase in impairment provisions for 
loans extended to the Group’s customers, which could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and results of operations.
Currency fluctuations have affected, and may 
continue to affect, the Group
A substantial portion of the total assets of the Group, 
especially its loan portfolio (67.9% of its gross loans to 
customers as at 31 December 2012), is denominated in 
foreign currencies, primarily US Dollars, while the majority 
of customers who have their loans denominated in foreign 
currencies earn their income in Lari. Those customers  
are usually not protected against the fluctuations of the 
exchange rates of the Lari against the currency of the loan. 
Consequently, any depreciation of the Lari against the 
currency of the loan may result in difficulties in repayment 
of the loans, which may lead to a decrease in the quality of 
the Group’s loan portfolio and an increase in impairment 
provisions for loans extended to the Group’s customers, 
which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the Group’s operations are affected by the 
Lari to Belarusian Rouble exchange rates as these affect 
the value of the Group’s equity interests in BNB, its 
Belarusian subsidiary, on a consolidated basis. 
Depreciation of the Belarusian Rouble against the Lari has 
the effect of reducing BNB’s contribution to the Group’s 
consolidated capital. In May 2011, the Belarusian Rouble 
was devalued by 39.5% as compared to its value as at 
30 April 2011, as measured against the US Dollar. As a 
result, the regulatory capital of BNB decreased below 
the minimum regulatory capital required to accept retail 
deposits (being €25 million, as required by the National 
Bank of Republic of Belarus). In the second half of 2011,  
the Belarusian Rouble depreciated further, as measured 
against the US dollar, and declined another 
40.6% between 30 June 2011 and 31 December 2011. 
Accordingly, the regulatory capital of BNB decreased  
to €14.6 million (GEL 31.6 million) as at 31 December 2011.  
As at 1 January 2013, the regulatory capital of BNB was 
€17.3 million (GEL 37.8 million). The NBRB has granted  
a temporary waiver of the minimum regulatory capital 
requirement until 1 January 2014. The NBRB has also  
set a limit on the amount of deposits from individuals  
at GEL 49.5 million (which is the value of deposits from 
individuals of BNB as at 1 February 2013) until BNB 
regulatory capital reaches minimum required level  
of €25 million. As at 31 December 2011, as a result  
of the devaluation of the Belarusian Rouble, the  
Group recognised a write down of GEL 23.4 million, 
representing the full amount of BNB’s goodwill.
Any subsequent devaluation of the Belarusian Rouble 
could result in further declines in BNB’s regulatory capital. 
Although the Group seeks to minimise its open foreign 
currency positions through limits on the Group’s foreign 
currency positions in accordance with NBG regulations and 
through swap agreements, there can be no assurance that 
these measures will protect against foreign exchange risks 
since any additional depreciation of the Belarusian Rouble 
may lead to further erosion of the Group’s share capital 
and pressure on its capital adequacy ratios. The Group 
is subject to counterparty risk in respect of its swap agreements 
(including its currency swap agreement with the NBRB), as 
the Group’s counterparties may not honour their obligations 
under the relevant swap agreement.
If the Lari exchange rate against the US dollar or the 
Belarusian Rouble exchange rate against the Euro 
fluctuates, or any of the Group’s counterparties default 
on their obligations, this could lead to the Group suffering 
losses which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, financial condition and results 
of operations.
The Group’s risk management methods may prove 
ineffective at mitigating credit risk
Losses relating to credit risk may arise if the risk 
management policies, procedures and assessment 
methods implemented by the Group to mitigate credit risk 
and to protect against credit losses prove less effective 
than expected. The Group employs qualitative tools and 
metrics for managing risk that are based on observed 
historical market behaviour. These tools and metrics may 
fail to predict future risk exposures, especially in periods of 
increased volatility or falling valuations or in periods in which 
there is a rapid expansion of the Group’s loan portfolio. In 
addition, even though the Group requires regular financial 
disclosure by its corporate customers’, customer financial 
statements may not always present a complete and 
accurate picture of each customer’s financial condition. 
Furthermore, some of the Group’s corporate customers 
may not have extensive or externally-verified credit histories, 
and their accounts may not be audited by a reputable 
external auditor. Therefore, notwithstanding the Group’s 
credit risk evaluation procedures, the Group may be unable 
to evaluate effectively the current financial condition of each 
prospective corporate borrower and to evaluate the ability 
50 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 of such corporate borrower to repay its loans when due. 
Similarly, the financial condition of some private individuals 
transacting business with the Group is difficult to assess 
and predict, as some retail borrowers have no or very 
limited credit history. Accordingly, the risk management 
systems employed by the Group may prove insufficient in 
measuring and managing risks and this may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
Additional risks arising principally from 
the Group’s banking activities
The Group faces liquidity risk
The Group becomes exposed to liquidity risk when the 
maturities of its assets and liabilities do not coincide. 
Liquidity risk is inherent in banking operations and can 
be heightened by a number of factors, including an 
over-reliance on, or an inability to access, a particular 
source of funding, changes in credit ratings or market-wide 
phenomena such as financial market instability and natural 
disasters. The Group seeks to manage its liquidity risk by, 
among other things, maintaining a diverse funding base 
comprising short-term sources of funding (including retail 
and corporate customer deposits, inter-bank borrowing  
and borrowing from the NBG) and longer-term sources 
of funding (including borrowing from international credit 
institutions, sales and purchases of securities and long-
term debt securities). The Group’s current liquidity may  
be affected by unfavourable financial market conditions.  
If assets held by the Group in order to provide liquidity 
become illiquid or their value drops substantially, the Group 
may therefore be required, or may choose, to rely on other 
sources of funding to finance its operations and expected 
future growth. However, there is only a limited amount of 
funding available on the Georgian inter-bank market and the 
Group’s recourse to other funding sources may pose 
additional risks, including the possibility that other funding 
sources may be more expensive and less flexible. In 
addition, the Group’s ability to access such external funding 
sources is directly connected with the level of credit lines 
available to the Group, and this in turn is dependent on the 
Group’s financial and credit condition, as well as general 
market liquidity.
As at 31 December 2012, 2011 and 2010, 87.7%, 92.7%, 
and 92.8%, respectively, of the Group’s amounts due to 
customers had maturities of one year or less while 48.2%, 
55.6% and 48.3%, respectively, were payable on demand. 
As at the same dates, the Group’s ratio of net loans to 
amounts due to customers was 114.8%, 95.7%, and 
116.8%, respectively. In terms of current and short-term 
liquidity, the Group is exposed to the risk of unexpected, 
rapid withdrawal of deposits by its customers in large 
volumes. Circumstances in which customers are more likely 
to rapidly withdraw deposits in large volumes include a 
severe economic downturn, a loss in consumer confidence, 
an erosion of trust in financial institutions, or a period of 
social, economic or political instability. By way of example, 
the Group experienced a higher than usual volume of 
customer withdrawals in the period following the 2008 
Conflict. See “Political and governmental instability in 
Georgia could have an adverse effect on the local economy 
and the Group”. If a substantial portion of the Group’s 
customers rapidly or unexpectedly withdraw their demand 
or term deposits or do not roll over their term deposits  
upon maturity, this could have a material adverse effect  
on the Group.
The Group is subject to certain regulatory ratios
The Bank, like all regulated financial institutions in Georgia, 
is required to comply with certain capital adequacy and 
regulatory ratios set by the NBG. Although in the past, the 
Bank’s investments to equity and investment plus fixed 
assets to equity financial ratios have been below the level 
set by the NBG, the NBG confirmed on 31 December 2009 
that it would not impose any sanctions on the Bank as a 
result and the Bank has been in compliance with both of 
these financial ratios since February 2011.
In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision published the Basel III rules setting out certain 
changes to capital requirements applicable to banks. 
Implementation of the new, combined regulation based on 
Basel II and Basel III takes place at a national level, the NBG is 
currently in the process of implementing Basel II and Basel III 
in Georgia. On 17 January 2013, the NBG published a draft 
regulation for capital adequacy based on Basel II and Basel III, 
which makes adjustments to certain Basel II and Basel III 
rules, including those relating to foreign currency additional risk 
weights, specific measurements and risk estimates. The 
Group had expected that the Basel III requirements are 
phased in over a period of time commencing in April 2013. 
However, the NBG has notified the Bank about the delay in the 
implementation of Basel II and Basel III until 1 January 2014. 
The NBG is expected to publish an updated implementation 
schedule in due course. As the implementation of Basel II and 
Basel III will be the subject of rules that have yet to be adopted 
in Georgia, the Group cannot predict the impact such rules will 
have on the Group’s overall capital requirements. 
In addition, BNB is licensed by the NBRB and is required to 
comply with certain capital adequacy ratios and minimum 
share capital requirements set by the NBRB. Although BNB 
has the minimum level of regulatory capital required by 
NBRB to conduct banking operations in Belarus (the 
minimum level for this purposes is set at the equivalent  
of €5 million and, as at 31 December 2012, the regulatory 
capital of BNB was €17.3 million), BNB has not had the 
minimum level of regulatory capital required by NBRB in 
order to hold deposits from individuals (set at the equivalent 
of €25 million for this purpose) since May 2011. Although 
BNB has received a temporary waiver effective until  
1 January 2014 in respect of this breach, there is no 
assurance that BNB will be able to comply with the 
minimum level of regulatory capital required by NBRB by  
1 January 2014, or that it will be able to obtain a further 
waiver from the NBRB thereafter. For further information 
see “Currency fluctuation have affected, and may continue 
to affect, the Group”. If BNB’s level of regulatory capital 
remains below the minimum level required by the NBRB 
after the temporary waiver expires and no new waiver is 
obtained, the NBRB may revoke BNB’s licence to accept 
retail deposits. As at 31 December 2012, BNB had  
GEL 49.7 million in deposits from individuals, representing  
1.9% of the Group’s total customer deposits and 1.1%  
of total liabilities.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 51
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
Save for BNB not having the minimum level of regulatory 
capital required by the NBRB in order to hold retail 
deposits, the Group is not in breach of any applicable 
capital adequacy or regulatory ratios and the Board 
believes that the Group overall has adequate capital for at 
least the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Group’s ability 
to comply with applicable capital adequacy and regulatory 
ratios could be affected by a number of factors, some of 
which are beyond the Group’s control, including:
 – an increase of the Bank’s risk-weighted assets;
 – the Group’s ability to raise capital;
 – losses resulting from a deterioration in the Group’s asset 
quality, a reduction in income levels, an increase in 
expenses or a combination of all of the above;
 – a decline in the values of the Group’s securities portfolio;
 – changes in accounting rules or in the guidelines regarding 
the calculation of the capital adequacy ratios; and
 – increases in minimum capital adequacy ratios imposed 
by the NBG.
Failure to maintain the minimum capital adequacy and 
other regulatory ratios may have a material adverse 
effect on the Group. Moreover, a breach of regulatory 
requirements relating to the minimum capital adequacy 
and other regulatory ratios may result in entities in the 
Group being subject to regulatory or administrative 
sanctions, which could impact the Group’s ability to 
conduct its business, result in an increase in the operating 
costs of the Group and loss of reputation which could have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition. 
The Group’s businesses are subject to substantial 
regulation and oversight and future changes in 
regulation, fiscal or other policies are unpredictable
Currently, the Bank is required to comply with Georgian 
banking regulations. In addition to mandatory capital 
adequacy ratios, the NBG is authorised to set lending limits 
and other economic ratios in Georgia, with which the Bank 
is required to comply. Under Georgian banking regulations, 
the Bank is required to, among other things, comply with 
minimum reserve requirements and mandatory financial 
ratios and file periodic reports. In addition to its banking 
operations, the Group also provides other regulated 
financial services and offers financing products, including 
brokerage and pension fund operations, as well as 
insurance and healthcare products through its insurance 
and healthcare subsidiary and services that are subject to 
governmental supervision. Additionally, the business, 
financial condition and results of operations of the Group’s 
activities in Belarus are affected by legal regulations, 
instructions and recommendations, including those issued 
by the NBRB and the NBG, including those which seek to 
implement Basel III into national law. See “The Group is 
subject to certain regulatory ratios”.
Future changes in regulation, fiscal or other policies are 
unpredictable and there is often a delay between the 
announcement of a change and the publication of detailed 
rules relating to such change. For example, the NBG has 
indicated that it is considering introducing a new liquidity 
framework in Georgia but has yet to confirm the details or 
timing for the implementation of such liquidity framework. 
There can be no assurance that the current regulatory 
environment in which the Group operates will not be 
subject to significant change in the future, including 
change as a result of a change in government in Georgia 
or Belarus, or that the Group will be able to comply with any 
or all resulting regulations. See “Political and governmental 
stability in Georgia could have an adverse effect on the 
local economy and the Group”.
The Group is subject to operational risk inherent in 
its business activities
The Group is subject to the risk of incurring losses or 
undue costs due to the inadequacies or failure of internal 
processes or systems or human error, or from errors made 
during the execution or performance of operations, clerical 
or record-keeping errors, business disruptions (caused by 
various factors such as software or hardware failures and 
communication breakdowns), failure to execute outsourced 
activities, criminal activities (including credit fraud and 
electronic crimes), unauthorised transactions, robbery 
and damage to assets.
Although the Board believes that the Group’s risk management 
policies and procedures (which are designed to identify and 
analyse relevant risks to the Group’s business, prescribe 
appropriate limits to various risk areas and monitor the level and 
incidence of such risks on an on-going basis) are adequate and 
that the Group is currently in compliance in all material respects 
with all laws, standards and recommendations applicable to the 
Group, any failure of the Group’s risk management system to 
detect unidentified or unanticipated risks, or to correct 
operational risks, or any failure of third parties adequately 
to perform outsourced activities could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results  
of operations.
Risks affecting the Group’s 
non-banking activities
The Group’s insurance subsidiary, Aldagi BCI, is subject  
to the risks inherent in the insurance industry
Aldagi BCI, operates in the property and casualty, life and 
health insurance industry. In the ordinary course of business, 
Aldagi BCI seeks to reduce losses that may arise from 
catastrophes or other events through reinsurance. Under 
such reinsurance arrangements, reinsurers assume a portion 
of the losses and related expenses, however, Aldagi BCI 
remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. 
Consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not 
eliminate Aldagi BCI’s obligation to pay under its insurance 
policy for losses insured, which could cause a material 
increase in Aldagi BCI’s liabilities and a reduction in its 
profitability. Moreover, Aldagi BCI is subject to its reinsurers’ 
credit risk and solvency and their willingness to make 
payments under the terms of reinsurance arrangements  
with respect to its ability to recover amounts due from them.
52 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Although Aldagi BCI adheres to strict reinsurance policies and 
periodically evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers to 
minimise its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer 
insolvencies, reinsurers may become financially unsound by 
the time their financial obligations become due. The inability of 
any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to Aldagi BCI 
could negatively impact Aldagi BCI’s financial condition and 
results of operations. In addition, the availability, amount and 
cost of reinsurance depend on general market conditions 
which may fluctuate. Reinsurance may not be available to 
Aldagi BCI at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, and  
any decrease in the amount of Aldagi BCI’s reinsurance will 
increase its risk of loss.
In accordance with industry practices and accounting 
regulatory requirements, Aldagi BCI establishes reserves  
for reported claims, incurred but not reported claims and 
unearned premiums. Reserves do not represent an exact 
calculation of liability, but instead represent estimates  
of what the ultimate settlement and administration of  
claims will cost based on an assessment of facts and 
circumstances then known, review of historical settlement 
patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency  
of claims, legal theories of liability and other factors. There 
can be no assurance that actual claims will not materially 
exceed its claims reserves and have a material effect on 
its financial condition and results of operations.
The Group’s real estate subsidiary, m2 Real Estate,  
is subject to the risks of developing and selling  
real estate
The Group’s real estate subsidiary m2 Real Estate, is 
primarily engaged in developing affordable residential 
properties for sale and rent. Real estate property 
investments are subject to varying degrees of risk  
which affect the level of income from the value of  
properties including:
 – changes in the Georgian economic climate;
 – local conditions such as a surplus of similar properties 
or a reduction in demand for the property;
 – the attractiveness of the property to tenants and 
purchasers;
 – occupancy rates and the ability to collect rent 
from tenants;
 – laws, governmental regulations, including environmental 
regulation, tax laws and insurance; and
 – acts of nature, such as earthquakes, floods and other 
extreme weather events that may damage the property.
In addition, m2 Real Estate’s projects are subject to the 
general risks associated with construction and 
development, including:
 – cost overruns due to increased material, labour or 
other costs, which could make completion of the 
project unprofitable;
 – the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, required 
zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other 
governmental permits and authorisations, which could 
result in increased costs and could require m2 Real 
Estate to abandon a project entirely; and
 – m2 Real Estate may be unable to complete construction 
and leasing of a property on schedule.
Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect 
on the financial condition and operating results of m2 Real 
Estate which may have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial condition and results of operations.
Other risks affecting the Group
The Group may not successfully implement its 
strategy
The Group aims to achieve long-term sustainable growth 
and profitability through a secure, modern and universal 
banking model, as well as to maintain and enhance its 
leading market position in Georgia. In addition, the Group’s 
strategy is to diversify its business through the addition  
of businesses that have strong synergies with its banking 
operations. Furthermore, the Bank is concentrating on  
the Georgian market and the Bank’s subsidiary, Joint  
Stock Company BG Capital (“BG Capital”), has exited  
from its brokerage operations in Ukraine and Belarus.  
In addition, the Group intends to exit from its other  
non-core operations, including through the sale of Liberty 
Consumer and its interest in BNB. The Group may seek to 
pursue selective acquisitions in Georgia.
There can be no assurance that the Group will be able 
to achieve its major strategic objectives, including in 
respect of its synergistic businesses, such as insurance 
and healthcare, which may be affected by market 
conditions, potential legal and regulatory impediments and 
other factors, or that it will be able to exit from its non-core 
operations at a satisfactory price, or at all. Any failure by 
the Group to achieve its strategic objectives could have 
a material adverse impact on the Group’s reputation, 
business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Group faces competition
In recent years the Georgian banking sector has become 
increasingly competitive. According to the NBG, as at 
December 2012 there were 20 commercial banks, of which 
18 are foreign controlled. The Group competes with a 
number of these banks, including TBC Bank, ProCredit 
Bank, Bank Republic and VTB Georgia. In particular, as 
ProCredit Bank has a large market share in respect of SME 
and micro finance loans, the Group faces competition from 
ProCredit Bank in relation to SME and micro financing in 
Georgia. TBC Bank and Bank Republic are the Bank’s 
principal competitors in the corporate sector. In addition, 
both the mortgage market and the market for the provision 
of financial services to high net worth individuals are highly 
competitive in Georgia, with some competitors in the 
mortgage market implementing aggressive pricing policies 
in order to retain or build their market share. Additionally, in 
Belarus, the Group competes with a wide range of local 
(including state-owned) and international banks.
There can be no assurance that the current regulatory 
environment in which the Group operates in respect of 
competition and anti-monopoly matters will not be subject 
to significant change in the future. Anti-monopoly matters 
are currently handled by the NBG. However, as part of the 
Georgian Government’s anti-monopoly policies, it may, in 
the future, seek to legislate or regulate competition and 
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 53
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
anti-monopoly matters in the Georgian banking industry  
and as part of any such changes, it is possible that anti-
monopoly regulation could be enforced by a governmental 
agency other than NBG. The Group cannot predict whether 
Parliament will seek to do this, or if they did, what such laws 
or regulations would be. In addition, the Group cannot 
predict whether it would be able to comply with any or all 
such laws or regulations.
In addition, although there are currently no anti-monopoly 
regulations in Georgia that establish market share limits, 
there can be no assurance that such anti-monopoly 
limitations will not be introduced in Georgia in the future. 
Given the current high market share maintained by the 
Group, the introduction of any anti-monopoly restrictions 
may have an effect on the growth rates of the Group, 
restrict the Group’s ability to make future acquisitions, 
or lead to the Group being compulsorily required to sell 
some of its assets or exit or reduce business areas.
Increased competition may have a negative impact on 
the Group’s ability to sustain its margin and fee levels, 
particularly if the Group’s competitors possess greater 
financial resources (especially in the case of banks with 
foreign capital investment or banks which are branches 
of non-resident foreign banks, by way of access to funding 
from foreign capital or their parent entity), access to 
lower-cost funding and a broader offering of products 
than the Group, or if the Group’s competitors merged 
to significantly enhance their financial resources, access 
to funding and product offerings. Unlike most of its 
competitors, the Group has a relatively wide shareholder 
base and does not have an international financial institution 
as a majority shareholder. In 2008 and 2009, the Group’s 
financing costs increased (which in turn had a negative 
impact on the net interest income earned by the Group) 
due to, among other things, increasing interest rates on 
bank deposits resulting from increasing competition in the 
deposit market. In addition, increasing competition could 
lead to significant pressure on the Group’s market share. 
Increasing competition in the banking industry has already 
led to and may, in the future, continue to lead to increased 
pricing pressures on the Group’s products and services, 
which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business financial condition and results of operations.
The Group depends on its key management and 
qualified personnel
The Group’s current senior management team includes a 
number of persons that the Board believes contribute 
significant experience and expertise in the banking and 
other industries in which the Group operates. The Group’s 
ability to continue to retain, motivate and attract qualified 
and experienced banking and management personnel is 
vital to the Group’s business. There can be no assurance 
that the Group will be able to successfully recruit and retain 
the necessary qualified personnel. The loss or diminution in 
the services of members of the Group’s seniormanagement 
team or an inability to recruit, train or retain necessary 
personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Group.
The Group’s insurance policies may not cover,  
or fully cover, certain types of losses
The Group generally maintains insurance policies covering 
its assets, operations and certain employees in line with 
general business practices in Georgia. The Group seeks  
to insure against a range of risks including fire, lightning, 
flooding, theft, vandalism and third-party liability. The Group 
also maintains Bankers’ Blanket Bond and directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance. However, there can be no 
assurance that all types of potential losses are insured or 
that policy limits would be adequate to cover them. Any 
uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits could 
adversely affect the Group’s existing operations and could 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition 
and results of operations.
The Group faces certain risks associated with 
conducting international operations
The Group has historically made investments in Ukraine 
and Belarus. The Group’s financial results in 2009 were 
adversely affected by a goodwill write-down in the amount 
of GEL 73.1 million, predominantly due to the write-off of 
the entire goodwill associated with BG Bank, as a result of 
a weak economic environment in Ukraine and high loan and 
finance lease receivables impairment charges in respect of 
BG Bank in 2008 and 2009. In February 2011, the Group 
disposed of its 80% interest in BG Bank. The Group’s 
financial results in 2011 were adversely affected by a 
goodwill write down in the amount of GEL 23.4 million, due 
to the write off of the entire goodwill associated with BNB, 
as a result of a material devaluation of the Belarusian 
Rouble. For further information, see “Currency fluctuations 
have affected and may continue to affect the Group”.
As part of its revised strategy to concentrate on the Georgian 
market the Group disposed of an 80% equity interest in  
BG Bank (in respect of which the remaining GEL 7.6 million  
(US$ 4.6 million) instalment of the purchase price has been 
fully provisioned and written off as of 31 December 2012. 
The Group will continue to seek to exit from its international 
operations (including its interest in BG Bank and, in due 
course, BNB) at an appropriate time. While it holds these 
assets, the Group will continue to be subject to risks relating 
to these operations including certain political and economic 
risks, compliance risks and foreign currency exchange risks, 
as well as the risk of failure to market adequately to potential 
customers in other countries. Any failure to manage such 
risks may cause the Group to incur increased liabilities  
which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, financial condition and results of operations.
54 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 If the Group fails to comply with any applicable 
regulations relating to, or the Group is associated 
with, money laundering or terrorist financing, this 
could have an adverse effect on the Group
Although the Group has implemented comprehensive 
anti-money laundering (“AML ”), “know-your-customer”,  
“know your corresponding bank” and “know your employee” 
policies, and is in the process of implementing such policies 
throughout its financial subsidiaries (including insurance and 
brokerage subsidiaries), which are monitored by its AML 
Compliance Department, and adheres to all requirements 
under applicable legislation aimed at preventing it being used 
as a vehicle to facilitate money laundering, there can be no 
assurance that these measures will be effective. If the Group 
fails to comply with timely reporting requirements or other 
AML regulations or is associated with money laundering or 
terrorist financing, this could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of 
operations. In addition, involvement in such activities may 
carry criminal or regulatory fines and sanctions.
The uncertainties of the judicial system in Georgia, 
or any arbitrary or discriminatory state action taken 
in Georgia in the future, may have a material adverse 
effect on the local economy, which could and in turn, 
have an adverse effect on the Group
Georgia is still developing an adequate legal framework 
required for the proper functioning of a market economy. 
For example, in Georgia, several fundamental civil, criminal, 
tax, administrative and commercial laws have only recently 
become effective. The recent nature of much of Georgian 
legislation and the rapid evolution of the Georgian legal 
system place the quality and the enforceability of laws in 
doubt and result in ambiguities and inconsistencies in 
their application.
In addition, the court system in Georgia is understaffed 
and has been undergoing significant reforms. Judges and 
courts in Georgia are generally less experienced in the area 
of business and corporate law than is the case in certain 
other countries, particularly in Europe and the United 
States. Most court decisions are not easily available to the 
general public, and enforcement of court judgments may, 
in practice, be difficult in Georgia. The uncertainties of the 
Georgian judicial system could have a negative effect on 
the Georgian economy, could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and 
results of operations. In addition, to varying degrees, the 
same uncertainties of the judicial system in Georgia as 
discussed above apply to Belarus.
Uncertainties in the tax system in Georgia may result in 
the Group facing tax adjustments or fines in the future and 
there may be changes in current tax laws and policies
In Georgia, tax laws have not been in force for significant 
periods of time compared to more developed market 
economies, and often result in unclear or non-existent 
implementing regulations. Moreover, such tax laws are 
subject to frequent changes and amendments, which can 
result in unusual complexities for the Group and its business 
generally. A new Tax Code was adopted in Georgia on  
17 September 2010 and came into effect on 1 January 2011. 
Differing opinions regarding the interpretation of various 
provisions exist both among and within governmental 
ministries and organisations, including the tax authorities, 
creating uncertainties, inconsistencies and areas of conflict. 
While the new Tax Code provides for the Georgian tax 
authorities to provide advance tax rulings on tax issues raised, 
thereby reducing the uncertainty regarding interpretation, it is 
possible that the relevant authorities could take differing 
positions with regard to interpretative issues, which may result 
in the Group facing tax adjustments or fines. In addition, there 
can be no assurance that the current tax laws or government 
tax policies will not be subject to change in the future, 
including any changes introduced as a result of a change  
of government. See “Political and governmental instability  
in Georgia could have an adverse effect on the local economy 
and the Group”. Such changes could include the introduction 
of new taxes, an increase in the tax rates applicable to the 
Group or its customers or the introduction of a bank levy. Any 
such changes in the tax laws or governmental tax policies  
may have a material adverse effect on the Group. In addition, 
to varying degrees, the same uncertainties of the tax system  
in Georgia apply to Belarus.
There are additional risks associated with investing 
in emerging markets such as Georgia
Emerging markets may have higher volatility, limited liquidity,  
a narrower export base and are subject to more frequent 
changes in the political, economic, social, legal and regulatory 
environment than more mature markets. Emerging economies 
are subject to rapid change and are particularly vulnerable  
to market conditions and economic downturns elsewhere  
in the world.
In addition, international investors’ reactions to events occurring 
in one emerging market country or region sometimes appear  
to demonstrate a contagion effect, in which an entire region  
or class of investment is disfavoured by investors. If such a 
contagion effect occurs, Georgia could be adversely affected by 
negative economic or financial developments in other emerging 
market countries. Georgia has been adversely affected by 
contagion effects in the past, including following the 1998 
Russian financial crisis and the more recent global financial 
crisis. No assurance can be given that it will not be affected  
by similar effects in the future.
Financial or political instability in emerging markets also tends 
to have a material adverse effect on the capital markets of 
emerging economies and the wider economy as investors 
generally move their money to more developed markets, 
which may be considered to be more stable. These risks 
may be compounded by incomplete, unreliable, unavailable 
or untimely economic and statistical data on Georgia.

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Managing risk  
effectively
Performance: Risk Management
The following discussion may not contain all the information 
that is important to readers of this Annual Report.  
For additional information relating to the risk management 
process and procedures of the Group, please refer to the Note 
27 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Risk Management Policy
Management of risk is fundamental to the banking business 
and is an essential element of the Bank’s operations. The 
Risk Management Policy adopted by BGH sets out the 
manner in which BGH identifies, assesses, manages  
and monitors the risk programme for BGH, the Bank  
and its other subsidiaries. The Bank seeks to manage  
its overall risk exposure by continuously improving its  
risk management policies and systems. 
The main objectives of the Risk Management Policy are to:
 – Set out the Group’s risk management bodies;
 – Set out the Group’s risk management and risk reporting 
procedures;
 – Define roles and responsibilities within the Group in 
relation to risk;
 – Identify and define the nature and extent of the Group’s 
significant risks;
 – Formulate the Group’s risk appetite;
 – Ensure that identified risks are monitored and mitigated 
where possible; and
 – Ensure that identified risks are properly reported, both 
internally and externally.
Responsibilities
Responsibility for the implementation risk of management 
procedures within the Group lies at all levels of the Group 
from BGH Board of Directors to business managers and 
risk managers. The distribution of responsibilities ensures 
that risk/return decisions are taken at the appropriate level.
BGH Risk Management Policy is available on the website:
http://bogh.co.uk/en/corporate-governance
All decisions related to risk and risk management reside 
at the BGH Board level, rather than being delegated to  
a separate Risk Committee, allowing each Director to 
contribute meaningfully to the risk management of the 
Group. The BGH Board is responsible for setting the 
Group’s risk philosophy and appetite and approving the 
overall risk management strategy and policy of the Group.  
It is responsible for maintaining sound system of internal 
control that supports the achievement of its goals  
and objectives.
The BGH Board is also responsible for overseeing the 
establishment, implementation and review of the Group’s 
risk management systems and, to this end, has delegated 
certain risk management functions to different executive 
boards, executive committees and management of its 
subsidiaries, as deemed necessary. At least once a year, 
the BGH Board conducts a review of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control systems, 
including the Risk Management Policy. The review covers 
all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. 
The Audit Committee of BGH is responsible for assessing 
the role and effectiveness of the internal audit function as 
well as keeping under review the Group’s internal controls 
and systems for assessing and mitigating financial and 
non-financial risks. (Please see further details on the  
Audit Committee on page 77.)
Bank of Georgia’s risk management procedures are 
designed to identify and analyse relevant risks to its 
business, prescribe appropriate limits to various risk areas 
and to monitor the level and incidence of such risks on an 
ongoing basis. The Bank regularly reviews its risk analysis 
processes in order to institute improvements which are 
required in light of the development and growth of its 
business and the varying nature of the risks which the  
Bank faces in its day-to-day business.
56 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 The Bank’s risk management system is based on the 
principle of continually assessing risk throughout the 
life of any operation and includes such stages as:
 – risk identification;
 – quality and quantity assessment of a particular risk;
 – determination of an acceptable risk level;
 – placement of limits and creation of reserves;
 – use of collateral;
 – ongoing monitoring and control allowing efficient 
adjustments in case of any negative changes in the 
conditions on which the preliminary risk assessment  
was made; and
 – analysis of efficiency of the risk management system.
The major risks inherent in the Bank’s operations are 
liquidity risk, market risk (including currency exchange  
rate risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, operational risk 
and legal risk.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for the overall risk 
management approach and for approving risk strategies and 
principals and is ultimately responsible for identifying and 
controlling risks. It approves the Bank’s Credit Policies, which 
outline credit risk control and monitoring procedures and  
the Bank’s credit risk management systems and approves 
certain decisions which fall outside the scope of the Credit 
Committees’ authority (including approvals of single group 
borrower lending exposure exceeding US$ 25.0 million). The 
Bank Management Board presents a comprehensive credit 
risk report and market risk report to the Bank’s Supervisory 
Board for their review on a quarterly basis.
The Audit Committee has overall responsibility for 
developing and implementing overall risk assessment and 
risk mitigation strategies, principles, frameworks, policies  
and limits. It is responsible for fundamental risk issues  
and manages and monitors compliance of relevant risk 
management decisions with the Bank’s risk management 
policy, covering but not limited to: macroeconomic and 
environmental risks, general control environment, manual 
and application controls, risks of intentionally or unintentional 
misstatements, risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets, 
information security, anti-money laundering, information 
technology risks, etc. The Bank Audit Committee facilitates 
the activities of the internal audit and external auditors of  
the Bank. The Bank Internal Audit also reviews AML policies 
and procedures and presents audit reports on AML to the 
Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. The Bank Audit 
Committee is elected and directly monitored by the Bank 
Supervisory Board.
The Management Board has overall responsibility  
for the Bank’s asset, liability and risk management 
activities, policies and procedures. The Management  
Board delegates individual risk management functions  
to each of the various decision making and execution  
bodies within the Bank.
Treasury is responsible for managing the Bank’s assets 
and liabilities and the overall financial structure and is also 
primarily responsible for managing funding and liquidity 
risks of the Bank.
The Internal Audit department ensures that the Bank’s 
policies conform to current legislation and regulation  
and professional norms and ethics. The Internal Audit 
department is responsible for monitoring and assessing  
the adequacy of compliance with internal procedures at  
all levels of the Bank’s management. This department 
regularly inspects the integrity, reliability and compliance  
with applicable law of operations conducted by departments 
of the Bank that are responsible for risk management, and 
regularly reviews the reliability of the Bank’s information 
technology systems in accordance with a predetermined 
schedule. It also assesses the reliability and integrity of 
financial information and monitors the Bank’s internal 
controls and reporting procedures. The Internal Audit 
department is independent from the Bank Management 
Board. The Head of the Internal Audit department is 
appointed by the Bank Supervisory Board and reports 
findings and recommendations directly to both the  
Bank and BGH Audit Committees. 
The principal function of the Internal Audit department  
is to reduce the levels of operational and other risks,  
audit the Bank’s internal control systems, and detect  
any infringements or errors on the part of the Bank’s 
departments and divisions.

58 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 The Asset and Liabilities Management Committee 
(“ALCO”) is the core risk management body that establishes 
policies and guidelines with respect to capital adequacy, 
market risks and respective limits, funding liquidity risk and 
respective limits, interest rate and prepayment risks and 
respective limits, money market general terms and credit 
exposure limits, designs and implements respective risk 
management and stress testing models in practice and 
regularly monitors compliance with the pre-set risk limits, 
approves treasury deals with non-standard terms. 
Specifically, ALCO:
 – Sets money-market credit exposure/lending limits; 
 – Sets open currency position limits with respect to 
overnight and intraday positions 
 – Establishes stop-loss limits for foreign currency 
operations and securities;
 – Monitors compliance with the established risk 
management models for foreign exchange risk, interest 
rate risk and funding liquidity risk;
 – Sets ranges of interest rates for different maturities at 
which the Bank may place its liquid assets and attracts 
funding; and
 – Reviews different stress tests and capital adequacy 
models prepared by the Finance Department. 
The ALCO is chaired by the CEO and at any time deemed 
necessary, with decisions made by a majority vote of its 
members. ALCO members include the CEO, Deputy CEO 
Finance, Deputy CEO, Chief Risk Officer, Deputy CEO 
Corporate Banking, Deputy CEO, Retail Banking, Deputy 
CEO, Asset and Wealth Management, the Head of the 
Financial Department, the Head of the Financial Risk 
Management Unit of the Finance Department, the Head  
of the Treasury Department and the Head of the Funding 
Department. The ALCO reviews financial reports and indices 
including the Bank’s limits/ratios, balance sheet, statement  
of operations, maturity gap, interest rate gap, currency gap, 
foreign exchange risk, interest risk and funding liquidity risk 
reports, total cash flow analyses, customer cash flow analysis, 
concentration risk analysis, for the past periods as well as 
future projections and forecasts, other financial analysis and 
further growth projections on a monthly basis.
Regulatory capital requirements in Georgia are set by NBG 
and are applied to the Bank, on a stand-alone basis. NBG 
requires the Bank to maintain a minimum Total Capital 
adequacy ratio of 12% of risk-weighted assets and a minimum 
Tier I Capital adequacy ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets, 
both computed based on the Bank’s stand-alone special 
purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with 
NBG regulations and pronouncements. The Bank also follows 
Basel I capital adequacy regulations on its own, having 
established respective minimal internal ratios of 16% for Total 
Capital and 10% for Tier I Capital, as opposed to 8% and 6% 
of original Basel I pronouncement, respectively. ALCO is the 
key governing body for the Capital adequacy management as 
well as for the respective risks identification and management. 
ALCO establishes limits and reviews actual performance over 
those limits for both, NBG as well as Basel I capital adequacy 
regulations. Finance Department is in charge of regular 
monthly monitoring and reporting over NBG and Basel I 
capital adequacy compliance with original pronouncements  
as well as with ALCO policies. Capital adequacy management 
is an integral part of the Bank’s actual monthly reporting as 
well as the Bank’s annual and semi-annual budget approval 
and budget review processes. Finance Department 
prepares NBG and Basel I capital adequacy actual reports 
as well as their forecasts and budgets, as well as different 
stress scenarios for both regulations, while ALCO and the 
Management Board regularly review them, identify risks, 
issue recommendations or propose amendment measure. 
The Legal department’s principal purposes are to ensure 
the Bank’s activities conform to applicable legislation and  
to minimise losses from the materialisation of legal risks. 
The Legal department is responsible for the application  
and development of mechanisms for identifying legal risks 
in the Bank’s activities in a timely manner, investigation  
of the Bank’s activities in order to identify any legal risks, 
planning and implementation of all necessary actions for 
the elimination of identified legal risks, participation in legal 
proceedings on behalf of the Bank where necessary and 
investigating possibilities for increasing the effectiveness  
of the Bank’s legal documentation and its implementation  
in the Bank’s daily activities. The Legal department is also 
responsible for providing legal support to structural units  
of the Bank.
The Anti-Money Laundering Compliance department 
is responsible for the implementation of the Bank’s AML 
programme (including the development of AML policies  
and procedures, transaction monitoring and reporting and 
employee training) throughout the Bank and its subsidiaries. 
The AML programme is based on recommendations and 
requirements of Georgian and international organisations 
including the Financial Action Task Force on Money 
Laundering and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of  
the United States Department of the Treasury. The Bank’s 
Internal Audit department audits the AML Compliance 
department and monitors implementation of the AML 
programme. It is fully independent of all other business 
functions within the Bank.
The Bank and BGH have policies and procedures aimed 
at preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, 
including a general anti-money laundering policy and rules on 
counteracting money laundering and financing of individuals 
and legal entities engaged in terrorist activities and in the 
case of the Bank, procedures for reporting to the Financial 
Monitoring Service of Georgia (“FMS”), a legal entity of public 
law. The FMS was established in 2003 and serves as 
Georgia’s financial intelligence unit. These procedures aim to, 
among other things, minimise the risk of the Bank being used 
as a vehicle for money laundering or terrorist financing, 
protect the Bank from financing and reputation risks of being 
associated with money laundering or terrorist financing 
activities and ensure that banking services are provided  
only to bona fide clients.
The Bank has also implemented specific policies and 
procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of the  
EU’s Third Directive, which requires financial institutions 
to identify and verify the identity of its customers and their 
beneficial owners and monitor its customers’ transactions, 
while taking into account a risked-based approach.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 59
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Risk Management continued
Adopting a risk-based approach implies the adoption of a risk 
management process for dealing with money laundering and 
terrorist financing. This process encompasses recognising  
the existence of risks, undertaking an assessment of those 
risks and developing strategies to manage and mitigate  
the identified risks. The Bank uses a risk assessment matrix 
based on the client, sector, country and product risk. The 
Bank has a general AML policy; “know your customer” 
procedures that require it to identify its clients, verify their 
identity and their ultimate beneficial owners as well as  
the economic rationale of their transactions; “know your 
correspondent bank” procedures that involve careful 
screening of prospective correspondent banks’ AML  
policies; and “know your employee” procedures to  
prevent its employees’ involvement in money laundering  
and financing terrorism.
The Bank’s risk-based approach means that it applies 
enhanced due diligence procedures if it determines that 
there is a significant risk that particular clients are engaged 
in money laundering and financing terrorism.
The Bank carries out transaction monitoring using profiling 
and rules-based methodologies. Customer profiling is used 
to identify unusual patterns of activity by comparing current 
patterns with previous transactions by the same customer 
or peer group. Under the rule-based methodology, certain 
types of transactions over GEL 30,000 or its equivalent in 
foreign currencies as well as transactions involving certain 
high-risk, non-cooperative or suspicious jurisdictions are 
subject to monitoring and reporting.
Implementation of Risk Management 
System
The Bank’s risk management system is implemented by  
the Finance Department and the Treasury, Credit Risk 
Management, Operational Risk Management and Control, 
Legal, AML Compliance and Security Departments and  
other departments. The Reporting and Analysis unit and the 
Financial Risk Management unit of the Finance Department 
report to the Head of the Finance Department. The Finance 
Department and the Treasury Department report to the 
Deputy CEO, Finance. The Credit Risk Management 
(Corporate Banking Portfolio Analysis) and Operational Risk 
Management and Control Departments report to the Deputy 
CEO, Chief Risk Officer.
The Retail Credit Risk Management Department reports to 
the Deputy CEO, Retail Banking and Deputy CEO, Chief Risk 
Officer. The Legal and AML Compliance Departments report 
to the Deputy CEO, Legal. The Financial Risk Management 
unit of the Finance department, in coordination with the 
Treasury, implements the Bank’s market risk policies by 
ensuring compliance with established open currency position 
limits, counterparty limits, and the interest rate policy set  
by the ALCO. The Treasury department manages foreign 
currency exchange, money market, securities portfolio and 
derivatives operations and monitors compliance with the 
limits set by the ALCO for these operations. The Treasury 
Department is also responsible for management of short-
term liquidity and treasury cash flow and monitors the 
volumes of cash in the Bank’s ATMs and at its branches.
The Credit Risk Management department manages credit 
risks with respect to particular borrowers and assesses 
overall loan portfolio risks. It is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with the Bank’s Credit Policies, management  
of the quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio and filing and 
loan administration. 
The Operational Risk Management and Control Department 
is responsible for identification and assessment of operational 
risk categories within the Bank’s processes and operations.  
It is also responsible for detecting critical risk areas or groups 
of operations with an increased risk level and developing 
internal control procedures to address these risks, including 
(among others) business-process optimisation schemes, 
including document circulation, information streams, 
distribution of functions, permissions and responsibility.
The Legal Department monitors all changes in relevant  
laws and regulations, and ensures that those changes are 
properly reflected in the Bank’s procedures, instructions, 
manuals, templates and other relevant documentation.  
It also disseminates information on legislative changes 
to all relevant departments within the Bank. The Legal 
department also participates in drafting laws and regulatory 
documents upon request of legislators and regulators, 
certain associations and other professional bodies. The 
Legal department is responsible for registering the collateral 
taken by the Bank, monitored by the credit administration 
and documentation unit.
The Tax Compliance unit of the Finance Department 
focuses on the Bank’s relationship with the tax authorities 
and provides practical advice and monitors tax compliance 
across the Group. 
Each of the foregoing departments is provided with  
policies and/or manuals that are approved by the Bank 
Management Board and/or the Bank Supervisory Board. 
The manuals and policies include comprehensive guidance 
for each stage of a transaction, including, but not limited to, 
manuals outlining asset and liability management policies, 
foreign exchange operations procedures, fixed income 
investment guidelines, retail banking operations 
procedures, the deposit policy and the credit policies.
Risk Types, Monitoring and Mitigation 
Procedures
The Bank measures risk using a method which  
reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal 
circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an 
estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different 
forecasting models. These models use probabilities derived 
from historical experience, adjusted from time to time to 
reflect the economic environment. The Bank also runs 
worst case scenarios that could arise in the event that 
those extreme events, however unlikely, do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed 
based on limits established by the Bank. These limits reflect 
the business strategy and market environment of the Bank 
as well as the level of risk that it is willing to accept, with 
additional emphasis on selected industries. The Bank also 
conducts ongoing monitoring and control allowing efficient 
adjustments in case of any unexpected changes in the 
60 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 conditions on which the preliminary risk assessment was 
made. In addition the Bank monitors and measures the 
overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate 
risk exposure across all risks types and activities.
Risk Management Reporting
The Group maintains a management reporting system  
which requires the Credit Risk Management Department,  
the Finance Department, the Treasury Department, the 
Operational Risk Management Department and other relevant 
departments of relevant subsidiaries of the Group to prepare 
certain reports on a daily, monthly, quarterly and annual basis. 
On a daily basis, a statement of operations, balance sheet and 
Treasury Report (providing open foreign currency positions, 
cash flows, limits and balances on correspondent accounts) 
and confirmation that there has been compliance with 
mandatory financial ratios is provided by each department.  
On a monthly basis, a report on the structural liquidity gap,  
a report on interest rate risk, monthly financial statements  
and a management and supervisory board report containing 
analysis of the Group’s performance against the budgets are 
provided to the Management Board. On a quarterly basis, 
credit risk and operational risk report is submitted to the 
Management Board and to the Supervisory Board.
Information compiled from all the business area of the Bank 
is examined and processed in order to analyse, control  
and identify risks early. This information is presented and 
explained to the Bank Management Board, and the head of 
each business division. The report includes aggregate credit 
exposure, liquidity ratios and risk profile changes. Senior 
management assesses the appropriateness of the allowance 
for credit losses on a monthly basis. The Bank Management 
Board and Bank Supervisory Board receive a comprehensive 
risk report once a quarter which is designed to provide all the 
necessary information to assess and draw conclusions on 
the Bank’s risk exposure.
Risk Mitigation and Excessive Risk 
Concentration
As part of its overall risk management, the Bank uses 
derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures 
resulting from changes in interest rates and foreign 
currencies. While these are intended for hedging,  
these do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The Bank actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks.
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties, or 
related entities or shareholders, are engaged in similar business 
activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have 
similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet 
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in 
economic, political or other conditions.
Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Bank’s 
performance to developments affecting a particular industry 
or geographical location. In order to avoid excessive 
concentrations of risks, the Bank focuses on maintaining a 
diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks 
are controlled and managed accordingly.
Liquidity Risk
Definition
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet 
its payment obligations when they fall due under normal 
and stress circumstances. 
Monitoring 
Liquidity risk is managed through the ALCO-approved 
liquidity framework. Treasury manages liquidity on a daily 
basis. In order to manage liquidity risk, it performs daily 
monitoring of future expected cash flows on clients’ and 
banking operations, which is a part of the assets/liabilities 
management process. The Finance department prepares 
and submits monthly reports to the ALCO. The ALCO 
monitors the proportion of maturing funds available to meet 
deposit withdrawals and the amounts of interbank and 
other borrowing facilities that should be in place to cover 
withdrawals at unexpected levels of demand.
The liquidity risk management framework models the  
ability of the Bank to fund its business under both normal 
conditions and during a crisis situation. The Bank has 
developed a model based on the Basel III liquidity guidelines. 
This approach is designed to ensure that the funding 
framework is sufficiently flexible to ensure liquidity under a 
wide range of market conditions. The liquidity management 
framework is reviewed from time to time to ensure it is 
appropriate to the Bank’s current and planned activities. 
Such review encompasses the funding scenarios modelled, 
the modeling approach, wholesale funding capacity, limit 
determination and minimum holdings of liquid assets. The 
liquidity framework is reviewed by the ALCO prior to approval 
by the Bank Management Board.
The Finance Department also undertakes an annual  
funding review that outlines the current funding strategy for 
the coming year. This review encompasses trends in global 
debt markets, funding alternatives, peer analysis, estimation 
of the Bank’s upcoming funding requirements, estimated 
market funding capacity and a funding risk analysis. The 
annual funding plan is reviewed by the Bank Management 
Board and approved by the Bank Supervisory Board as 
part of the annual budget. The Funding and Treasury 
departments also review, from time to time, different 
funding options and assess the refinancing risks of  
such options.
Liquidity position is at a 
comfortable level well above  
the regulatory requirements

Mitigation
The Bank’s capability to discharge its liabilities is dependent 
on its ability to realise an equivalent amount of assets within 
the same period of time. The Bank maintains a portfolio of 
highly marketable and diverse assets that it believes can be 
easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption of 
cash flow. It also has committed lines of credit that it can 
access to meet its liquidity needs. Georgian commercial 
banks are entitled to get one week NBG’s refinancing 
facility by pledging NBG certificates of deposit, Georgian 
Government Securities or mortgage loans denominated 
in Georgian Lari. In addition, the Bank maintains a cash 
deposit (an obligatory reserve) with the NBG, the amount  
of which depends on the level of customer funds attracted. 
As of 31 December 2012, in line with the NBG’s requirements, 
15% of customer deposits in foreign currencies are set aside 
as minimum mandatory reserves. In addition, the Bank 
maintains a minimum average balance of 10% of its customer 
deposits in Georgian Lari at its correspondent account at the 
NBG. For wholesale funding, the NBG requires the Bank to set 
aside 15% of its unsubordinated foreign currency wholesale 
funding for borrowings with remaining maturity of less than 
one year, 5% for borrowings with a remaining maturity of  
more than one year (but less than two years) and 10% of  
its unsubordinated Georgian Lari wholesale funding with a 
remaining maturity of less than one year. The NBG’s liquidity 
ratio (average liquid assets during the month as defined by 
the NBG divided by average-borrowed funds with effective 
maturity of more than six months plus certain off balance 
sheet commitments maturing within six months) stood at 
41.1% against the required minimum of 30%. 
Funding
Diversification of funding is an important component of  
the Bank’s liquidity management strategy. The principal 
sources of liquidity are debt issues, client funds (including 
client deposits or amounts due to customers and 
promissory notes), borrowings (including borrowings from 
Developmental Financial Institutions), interbank deposits, 
principal repayments of loans, interest income and fees and 
commissions income. As of 31 December 2012, all of Bank 
of Georgia’s funding was unsecured as it was bound by 
negative pledge commitments to its lenders.
Client deposits are a consistent source of funding for 
Bank of Georgia. As of 31 December 2012, client deposits 
(including deposits of individuals) were GEL 2,622.9 million, 
or 57.1% of total liabilities (31 December 2011: GEL 2,554.1 
million and 66.3%, respectively). In accordance with the 
Georgian legislation, the Bank is obliged to repay such 
deposits upon demand of a depositor. In case of early 
withdrawal, the interest on deposit is foregone or reduced. 
As of 31 December 2012, the Group’s total consolidated 
amounts due to customers were GEL 2,693.0 million and 
represented 58.6% of the Group’s total liabilities. 
Funding flexibility is also provided by Bank of Georgia’s 
ability to raise wholesale funding from international markets. 
Borrowed funds reached GEL 1,225.8 million as  
of 31 December 2012, or 26.7% of total liabilities 
(31 December 2011: GEL 863.0 million, or 22.4% of total 
liabilities). In July 2012, the Bank issued US$250 million 
7.75% Notes due in 2017. In addition, during 2012, Bank  
of Georgia has signed loan agreements for the aggregate 
amount of GEL 96.0 million with IFC and Kreditanstalt fuer 
Wiederaufbau (“KfW”). As of 31 December 2012, the 83.8% 
of the Bank’s borrowed funds had a maturity of more than 
one year. 
In addition, Bank of Georgia has trade finance lines from 
various international financial institutions and credit lines  
for interbank-operations from both Georgian and non-
resident banks. As of 31 December 2012, the Bank had  
aggregate trade finance limits from international partner 
credit institutions of US$308.8 million equivalent diversified 
across different currencies (US$, EUR, CHF) (31 December 
2011: US$178.4). The number of partner credit institutions 
that has opened trade finance lines the bank was 14 in 
2012. (2011: 10).

management please see Note 27 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Market Risk
Definition
The Bank is exposed to market risk (including currency 
exchange rate risk and interest rate risk), which is the  
risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial 
instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market 
variables. Market risk exposure arises from open  
positions in fixed income and currencies, all of which  
are exposed to market fluctuations.

62 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Within limits approved by the Bank Supervisory Board, 
the ALCO approves ranges of interest rates for different 
maturities at which the Bank may place assets and attract 
liabilities. Compliance with the Bank’s interest rate policy is 
monitored by the Head of the Financial Risk Management 
unit of the Finance department and the Head of the 
Treasury department.
In May 2009, the Bank entered into an ISDA Master 
Agreement with IFC, pursuant to which from time to 
time the Bank enters into interest rate swaps with IFC to 
hedge its US Dollar interest rate risk on its outstanding 
long-term borrowings.
The Bank is also subject to prepayment risk, which is the 
risk that the Bank will incur a financial loss because its 
customers and counterparties repay or request repayment 
earlier than expected, such as fixed rate mortgages when 
interest rates fall. The Group reviews the prior history of 
early repayments by calculating the weighted average rate 
of early repayments across each credit product, individually, 
applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying 
amount of each loan product as at the reporting date and 
by further multiplying the product by the weighted average 
effective annual interest rates per each product. This allows 
the Bank to calculate the expected amount of unforeseen 
losses in case of early repayments.
Credit Risk
Definition
Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will be 
unable to pay amounts in full when due. Credit risk arises 
mainly in the context of the Bank’s lending activities. 
Mitigation
The general principles of the Bank’s credit policy are 
outlined in the Credit Policies. The Credit Policies also 
outline credit risk control and monitoring procedures and 
the Bank’s credit risk management systems. The Credit 
Policies are reviewed annually, or more frequently if 
necessary. For example, as a result of previous reviews, 
new procedures addressing the standards and 
methodology for loan loss provisioning pursuant to IFRS 
requirements were implemented, new loan restructuring 
tools were introduced and the loan terms were tightened. 
The Bank also uses the NBG’s provisioning methodology  
in order to comply with NBG requirements.
The Bank manages its credit risk by placing limits on  
the amount of risk accepted with respect to individual 
corporate borrowers or groups of related borrowers, liability 
of insurance companies, types of banking operations and 
by complying with the exposure limits established by the 
NBG. The Bank monitors the market value of collateral, 
requests additional collateral in accordance with the 
underlying agreement, and monitors the market value  
of collateral obtained during its review of the adequacy  
of the allowance for the loan impairment. The Bank also 
mitigates its credit risk by obtaining collateral and using 
other security arrangements. The exposure to individual 
corporate borrowers (including financial institutions) is 
further restricted by sub-limits covering on and off-balance 
sheet exposures and daily delivery risk limits with respect 
to trading terms such as foreign exchange contracts.
Mitigation
The general principles of the Bank’s market risk 
management policy are set by the ALCO. The Bank aims  
to limit and reduce the amount of possible losses on open 
market positions which may be incurred by the Bank due  
to negative changes in currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. The Bank classifies exposures to market  
risk into either trading or non-trading positions. The  
Bank has no trading positions. Non-trading positions are 
managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis. In order 
to address these risks, the ALCO specifically establishes 
limits on open foreign currency positions, individually by 
currency as well as in aggregate. The limits are controlled 
by Treasury and monitored by Finance Department and 
ALCO as well. 
Currency Exchange Rate Risk. Currency exchange rate 
risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. The Bank is exposed to the effects of fluctuation  
in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its 
financial position.
Mitigation
The Bank’s currency risk is controlled through aggregate 
open currency positions and respective limits. Its open 
currency positions are managed by the Treasury department 
and Finance department on a day-to-day basis and are 
monitored by the Head of Treasury on a real-time basis.  
The ALCO sets open currency position limits with respect  
to both overnight and intraday positions and stop-loss limits. 
Currently, the Bank’s proprietary trading position is limited  
by the ALCO. The open currency position is also limited  
by ALCO to a maximum of 15.0% of the Bank’s NBG total 
regulatory capital. The ALCO limit of 15.0% is more 
conservative than NBG, which allows banks to keep open 
positions of up to 20.0% of regulatory capital. The Bank 
additionally limits open foreign currency positions, for 
individual currencies other than US Dollars and Lari, to  
1% of the NBG regulatory capital. The Bank also applies 
sensitivity stress tests to its open currency positions to 
estimate potential negative impact on its net assets  
and earnings.
Interest Rate Risk. The Bank has exposure to interest 
rate risk as a result of lending at fixed interest rates in 
amounts and for periods which differ from those of term 
borrowings at fixed and floating interest rates. Interest 
margins on assets and liabilities having different maturities 
may increase or decrease as a result of changes in market 
interest rates.
Mitigation
Similarly to other Georgian banks, the majority of the Bank’s 
assets and deposits have fixed interest rates. In order to 
minimise interest rate risk, the Bank monitors its interest 
rate (repricing) gap and maintains an interest rate margin 
(net interest income before impairment of interest earning 
assets divided by average interest earning assets) sufficient 
to cover operational expenses and risk premium.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 63
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance: Risk Management continued
The Credit Committees approve individual transactions, 
establish credit risk categories and provisioning rates in 
respect of such transactions. The Deputy CEO, Chief Risk 
Officer and Credit Risk Management department reviews the 
credit quality of the portfolio and sets provisioning rates, in 
consultation with the Bank’s CEO and Deputy CEO, Finance, 
on a monthly basis.
The Bank’s credit quality review process provides early 
identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness  
of counterparties, including regulator collateral revisions. 
Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit 
risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty 
a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision. The 
credit quality review process allows the Bank to assess the 
potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed 
and take corrective action.
The Bank makes available to its customers guarantees/
letters of credit which may require that the bank make 
payments on their behalf. Such payments are collected 
from customers based on the terms of the guarantee/letter 
of credit. They expose the Bank to similar risks to loans  
and these are mitigated by the same control processes 
and policies.
Loan approval procedures
The procedures for approving loans, monitoring loan quality 
and for extending, refinancing and/or restructuring existing 
loans are set out in the Bank’s Credit Policies that are 
approved by the Supervisory Board of the Bank and/or the 
Management Board of the Bank. The Credit Committees 
approve individual transactions and establish credit risk 
categories and provisioning rates. 
The Bank evaluates corporate banking clients on the basis 
of their credit history, business operations, market position, 
management, level of shareholder support, financial 
condition, proposed business and financing plan and on 
the quality of the collateral offered. The appropriate level  
of the relevant Credit Committee is responsible for making 
decision for loan approval based on credit memorandum, 
and where appropriate, credit risk managers’ report. The 
loan approval procedures for retail banking loans depend 
on the type of retail lending product. Applications for 
consumer loans, including credit cards, and auto loans  
are treated under the “scoring” approval procedure. While 
certain loans of up to GEL 6,000 are approved by the 
scoring system, the appropriate Credit Committee will 
determine the amount, terms and conditions of other loans. 
Applications for mortgage loans by retail banking clients are 
completed by the mortgage loan officer and submitted to 
the Credit Risk Manager, who evaluates the credit risks and 
determines the amount, terms and conditions of the loan, 
which must be approved at the appropriate Credit 
Committee level. In the case of micro-financing loans, 
officers evaluate loan applications, prepare a project 
analysis and submit proposals to the appropriate Credit 
Committee which makes the final decision. Credit 
Committee members have equal voting authority and 
decisions are approved by a simple majority of votes. 
Since 2004, the Bank, jointly with certain other Georgian 
banks and with the Creditinfo Group, a provider of credit 
information solutions, established JSC Credit Information 
Georgia (“CIG”), that serves a centralised credit bureau in 
Georgia. Since 2009, all the participating banks share and 
contribute positive and negative customer credit information 
with CIG.
Collateral
The Bank typically requires credit support or collateral as 
security for the loans and credit facilities that it grants. The 
main forms of credit support are guarantees and rights to 
claim amounts on the borrower’s current account with the 
Bank or other assets. The main forms of collateral for 
corporate lending are charges over real estate properties, 
equipment, inventory and trade receivables and the main 
form of collateral for retail lending is a mortgage over 
residential property. In the case of corporate loans, the 
Bank usually requires a personal guarantee (surety) from 
the borrower’s shareholders. Under the Bank’s internal 
guidelines, collateral should be provided (where it is 
required) to cover outstanding liabilities during the entire 
duration of a transaction. As of 31 December 2012, 87.1% 
of the Group’s loans to clients were collateralised. An 
evaluation report of the proposed collateral is prepared  
by the Asset Appraisal and Disposal department and 
submitted to the appropriate Credit Committee, together 
with the loan application and credit risk manager’s report. 
When evaluating collateral, the Bank discounts the market 
value of the assets to reflect the liquidation value of the collateral.
Measurement
The Bank’s compliance with credit risk exposure limits is 
monitored by the Credit Risk Management department on a 
continuous basis. Exposure and limits are subject to annual 
or more frequent review. The Bank establishes provisions 
for impairment losses of financial assets when there is 
objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. The Bank creates provisions  
by reference to the particular borrower’s financial condition 
and the number of days the relevant loan is overdue. If in  
a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss 
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to 
an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, 
the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by an 
adjusted provision account. The determination of provisions 
for impairment losses is based on an analysis of the assets 
at risk and reflects the amount which, in the judgment of 
the Bank’s management, is adequate to provide for losses 
incurred. Provisions are made as a result of an individual 
appraisal of financial assets.
The Bank has conservative 
credit approval processes and 
underwriting criteria, all of which 
are intended to maintain the 
quality of its assets as its loan 
portfolio grows
64 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Provisions are made against gross loan amounts and 
accrued interest. Under the Bank’s internal loan loss 
allowance methodology, which is based upon IFRS 
requirements, the Bank categorises its loan portfolio into 
significant and non-significant loans. Significant loans are 
defined as loans in the amount of GEL 600,000 or more 
and non-significant loans are defined as loans less than 
GEL 600,000. The Credit Risk Management department 
makes an individual assessment of significant loans and 
loans with category a rating are given a collective 
assessment rate. All significant loans other than category A 
are provisioned individually depending on the category they 
fall in. Categories are determined according to borrower’s 
financial performance business performance, leverage, 
credit history, quality of management and shareholders’ 
support. In addition, the loan to collateral ratio and quality  
of collateral may affect the provisioning rates of individually 
assessed loans. All non-significant loans are divided into 
different groups (for example mortgage, consumer, 
micro-financing loans).
All loans in range of GEL 100,000–600,000 with overdue 
days more then 10 days are provisioned individually and 
non-significant loans that are overdue more than 30 days are 
provisioned individually based on overdue days. All non-
impaired non-significant loans, as well as non-impaired prime 
rated significant loans, are assessed collectively within the 
sub-loan portfolio categories based upon historical loss 
rates. Non-significant loans which are overdue for more then 
150 days are written off automatically, except for mortgage 
loans which, since June 2009, are written off once overdue 
for more than 365 days. Significant loans may be written-off 
following an assessment by the Deputy CEO, Chief Risk 
Officer and the Credit Risk Management department, in 
consultation with the Bank’s CEO and Deputy CEO, Finance.
Operational Risk
Definition
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems 
failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls 
fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to 
reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead  
to financial loss. 
For more information on credit risk please see Note 27  
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Pg 159
Mitigation
The Bank is exposed to operational risks, arising out of 
the various operational activities in which it is engaged.  
The Bank cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, 
but through a control framework and by monitoring and 
responding to potential risks, the Bank aims to manage  
the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, 
access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures,  
staff education and training and assessment processes, 
including the use of internal audit. The Bank manages 
its operational risks by establishing, monitoring and 
continuously improving its policies and procedures relating 
to the various aspects of the Bank’s cash, payments, 
accounting, trading and core processing operations and 
data backup and disaster recovery arrangements.
The Bank has an integrated control framework encompassing 
operational risk management and control, AML compliance, 
corporate and information security and physical security, each 
of which is managed by a separate department, and an 
internal audit function for the Bank Group.
The Operational Risk Management and Control Department is 
responsible for identification and assessment of operational 
risk categories within the Bank’s processes and operations, 
detecting critical risk areas or groups of operations with an 
increased risk level, developing response actions and the 
imposition of restrictions in critical risk zones to neutralise 
identified risk and developing business-process optimisation 
schemes, including document circulation, information streams, 
distribution of functions, permissions and responsibilities. The 
Operational Risk Management and Control department is also 
responsible for developing and updating policies and 
procedures and ensuring that these policies and procedures 
meet legal and regulatory requirements and help to ensure 
that material operating risks are within acceptable levels. It also 
monitors and periodically reviews the Bank’s internal control 
systems to detect errors or infringements by the Bank’s 
departments and divisions. The Head of the Operational Risk 
Management department, who reports to the Deputy CEO, 
Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the oversight of the Bank’s 
operational risks.

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information A robust governance 
structure-underpins  
the delivery of our  
strategic objectives
Neil Janin
Chairman of Bank of Georgia Holdings
As a FTSE 250 company with a premium listing on the 
London Stock Exchange, it is our Board’s responsibility 
both to practise high standards of corporate governance 
and to contribute to promoting an environment where 
robust processes are in place. Such processes need to 
be underpinned by the right culture, values and behaviours 
permeating throughout the Group based on openness, 
transparency and accountability, as well as constructive 
challenge and collaboration. Our Board and its Committees 
play a particularly important role by setting the tone at the 
top, and I and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible  
for seeing that this culture trickles down.
We review the Group’s corporate governance policies, 
structures and practices on an annual basis in order to 
ensure that they are up to date and being effectively 
implemented. In 2012, the review focused on the matters 
reserved for the Board, each Board Committee’s Terms  
of Reference, and ways in which we could improve the 
connections between our Board and its Committees.
During 2012 we also focused on the future nature, shape 
and composition of the Board. We adopted term limits for 
our Board members and developed a multi-year Board 
succession plan that we believe will maintain the Board’s 
current high level of effectiveness. As a result, it is likely 
that there will be Board changes within the next two years. 
We believe that there are many factors to consider when 
seeking to maximise a board’s effectiveness through its 
composition. It is necessary for the Board to have the 
expertise and knowledge that are most appropriate for  
the Group’s current and future business activities, as well 
as individuals with sufficient time to devote to the Board 
(both in stable and challenging times) and who are able to 
offer a broad range of diverse perspectives to the Board, 
including both by way of geographic representation and 
gender diversity. 
Dear Shareholder,
In 2012 we also focused on the policy for executive 
remuneration in order to ensure that the compensation 
structure aligns management with shareholders, whereby 
long-term shareholder value is increased. 
Good corporate governance contributes to the long-term 
success of a company, creating trust and engagement 
between the company and its stakeholders. The Group is 
committed to its customers and clients and works tirelessly 
to act ethically and responsibly in each and every of its 
business transactions. 
We also strive to create an inclusive environment for all 
employees which helps us attract, retain and develop the 
best talent, and creates an environment where a diverse 
range of people are motivated to be at their best every day. 
We have a performance-based culture, which enables us  
to sustain strong business performance for the long term.
We continuously work to promote greater and more effective 
engagement with our shareholders. On behalf of the Board,  
the Supervisory Board, the Chief Executive Officer and  
Chief Financial Officer, supported by the Investor Relations 
department, regularly meet with institutional investors and 
analysts throughout the year. The Board receives regular 
reports from the Investor Relations department on its activities, 
and in particular on the feedback being received from 
investors, analysts and advisers. In 2013, we will continue  
to further enhance our engagement with shareholders. 
I firmly believe our Board is committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance and will continue to develop its skills 
and capabilities as well as promote the long-term success of 
the Group over the course of 2013 and beyond.
Neil Janin
Chairman 
10 April 2013
Governance: Chairman’s Corporate Governance Statement
72 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Governance: Corporate Governance Report
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and has implemented a framework for 
corporate governance which it considers to be appropriate 
for BGH. This framework is reviewed on an annual basis  
as part of the performance evaluation process and will  
be reviewed in light of any changes to BGH’s strategy.  
The Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), published  
in June 2010 by the Financial Reporting Council, applies  
to disclosures in this statement. The Code is available  
to download from www.frc.org.uk
The Financial Conduct Authority requires all listed 
companies to disclose how they have complied with  
the provisions of the Code. This Corporate Governance 
statement, together with the Director’s Responsibility 
Statement, the Going Concern Statement and the 
Statement of Compliance all of which are set out  
on page 95, indicate how BGH has complied with  
the principles of good governance of the Code  
and its requirements on internal control.
The Board
What is the role of the Board?
Our principal duty, collectively, is to promote the long-term 
success of the Group by directing management in creating 
and delivering sustainable shareholder value. We do this by 
setting the strategy and overseeing its implementation by 
management. While our ultimate focus is long-term growth, 
we also need to deliver on short-term objectives and we 
seek to ensure that management strikes the right balance 
between the two. 
We are mindful of our wider obligations and consider 
the impact our decisions will have on the Group’s various 
stakeholders, such as our employees, our shareholders, 
our customers and clients, the environment and our 
community as a whole. In setting and monitoring the 
execution of our strategy, we aim to ensure that we maintain 
an effective system of internal control and that management 
maintains an effective risk management and oversight 
process across the Group, so that growth is delivered 
in a controlled and sustainable way.
In order to ensure that we meet our responsibilities, specific 
key decisions have been reserved for approval by the 
Board. These include decisions on the Group’s strategy, 
approval of risk appetite and capital and liquidity matters, 
Board membership, financial results and governance 
issues. A full formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to the Board can be found on our website,

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information To assist us in carrying out our functions and to ensure there is independent oversight of financial, audit and internal 
control issues, review of remuneration, share plans and other incentives as well as oversight and review of Board and 
executive succession planning, the Board has delegated certain responsibilities to Board Committees. Each Board 
Committee has agreed Terms of Reference, which are approved by the Board. Copies of each Committee’s Terms of 
Reference can be found on our website, at http://www.bogh.co.uk/en/corporate-governance
The Board has decided that all decisions regarding risk and risk management will remain at the Board level as opposed to 
being delegated to a separate Risk Committee. This arrangement has proven to be successful, allowing each Director to 
provide meaningful input into the risk management of the Group.
The Chairman of each Board Committee reports to the Board on the matters discussed at Board Committee meetings. 
You will find later in this section reports from the Chairman of each Board Committee on the Committee’s activities in 2012 
and priorities for 2013.
How does the Board operate?
We normally meet five times a year. We meet more frequently when the need arises and, in 2012, we arranged and held 
10 additional meetings at short notice to discuss other matters relevant to the Board. In total, we met as a Board 15 times 
during the year. All Directors make every effort to attend each meeting, whether in person, by telephone or by video 
conference, unless circumstances, such as illness or prior commitments prevent them from doing so. In such instances, 
they are able to provide the Chairman ahead of the meeting with any views or comments they may have on the matters to 
be discussed. 
The Chairman also seeks input from the non-executive Directors ahead of each Board meeting in order to ensure that any 
particular matters raised by non-executive Directors are discussed at the meeting. In addition, the Chairman meets with 
the Company Secretary after each meeting to agree the actions to be followed up and to discuss how effective the 
meeting was.
Each Director committed an appropriate amount of time to their duties in 2012 and the non-executive Directors met the 
time commitment specified in their letters of appointment.

Governance: Corporate Governance Report continued
74 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 What makes our Board effective?
Our Board has primary responsibility for ensuring that, as 
a collective body, it has the appropriate skills, knowledge 
and experience to perform its role effectively. We take an 
integrated approach to effective corporate governance, 
which is underpinned by openness, transparency  
and accountability, as well as constructive challenge  
and collaboration.
Key to ensuring the Board’s effectiveness is enabling 
Directors’ full access to information and management 
across the Group. The Chairman and non-executive 
Directors frequently conduct site visits and interact with 
staff at all levels. This gives them opportunities to see the 
culture and values of the organisation in action and also 
provides context to the formal information that they receive 
for Board meetings.
The Board consistently probes, questions and explores 
the logic behind management actions both in formal Board 
meetings and other informal interactions. The Chairman 
plays a particularly important role by ensuring that all Board 
members have the opportunity to contribute fully in all 
Board discussions. Given the collaborative nature of the 
Board, Board members feel that they can speak their minds 
freely and constructively challenge management as well as 
other members of the Board. This atmosphere enhances 
the Board’s overall effectiveness.
Board Size, Composition and Qualification
We have determined that the optimum Board size for BGH 
is seven to 10 members. We currently have eight Board 
members: the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and  
six non-executive Directors. A list of individual Directors and 
their biographies and qualifications are set out on pages  
68 to 69. Details of Board Committee membership are  
set out on page 76 of this Annual Report.
The size and composition of a board and the qualifications 
of its members have a significant impact on how effective 
that board is. We regularly review the balance of skills 
we have on the Board, as well as the Board’s size and 
composition, both in terms of what we need now and what 
we might need to be successful in the future. Our aim is to 
ensure that we have the right mix for constructive group 
discussion and, ultimately, effective Board decisions.
We recognise the benefits of diversity on the Board and 
the current members of the Board have the wide range of 
skills and experience required to govern the Group. Our 
Board includes one woman and its members collectively 
represent five different nationalities. We welcomed and 
comprehensively discussed Lord Davies’ report entitled 
“Women on Boards”. We have commenced a full review 
of our Board’s composition, looking forward to 2015 
and beyond. This review is being facilitated through our 
Nomination Committee. Geographic and gender diversity 
together with key technical expertise in banking, risk, 
accountancy, finance, technology and international business 
will form core components of our Board succession 
planning. Balancing all of these factors to maintain an 
effective Board is a delicate matter and we do not believe 
that imposing quotas is appropriate in this context.
Director Independence
We consider non-executive Director independence  
on a bi-annual basis as well as part of each Director’s 
performance evaluation. The Board is satisfied that the 
majority of our non-executive Directors are independent 
and that therefore there is a balance of independent to 
non-independent Directors in the context of the Group. 
Evaluation of Board Performance
In order to improve the effectiveness of the Board, 
each Board Committee and each individual Director, 
we undertake on an annual basis a formal and rigorous 
effectiveness review. 
The Board believes that it continues to operate effectively. 
There is a high level of engagement from our non-executive 
Directors and meaningful interaction with the Chief 
Executive Officer and senior management. In the 2012 
Board effectiveness review, both the non-executive 
Directors and executive Director commented that the 
Board dynamics remain conducive to the provision and 
receipt of constructive challenge within the context of our 
unitary board approach. 
The results from the 2012 Board effectiveness review 
acknowledged that the Board Committee structure is 
effective, with excellent Committee chairmanship and that 
appropriate feedback is provided to the Board as a whole. 
It was recognised that the Board as a whole has been able 
to focus more broadly on strategic issues as a result of the 
increased delegation to the Board Committees. In 2013, 
we will continue to focus upon and evolve our approach to 
ensuring these critical connections between the Board and 
its Committees.
In addition to reviewing the Board’s overall effectiveness, 
each Director discussed his or her self-assessment with  
the Chairman on a one-to-one basis. These discussions 
included details of time commitment (including, where 
relevant, the potential impact of outside interests held by 
each Director), other broader contributions to the Board 
as well as desired future training and development. Future 
engagement plans were discussed, providing a guideline 
for the activities that Director intends to undertake over the 
next 12 to 18 months. 
Succession Planning and Board Appointments
We believe that effective succession planning mitigates 
the risks associated with the departure or absence of 
well-qualified and experienced individuals. We recognise 
this and our aim is to ensure that the Board and 
management are always well resourced, with the right 
people in terms of skills and experience, in order to 
effectively and successfully deliver our strategy. We also 
recognise that, even though new faces bring fresh ideas 
and perspective to how things are done, continued tenure 
brings a depth of Group-specific knowledge that is 
important to retain.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 75
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information We have a number of Directors that have served between 
three and six years on the Board. Given the complexity of 
banking, the volatile macroeconomic environment and 
changing political landscape in Georgia, we believe that it 
is important to retain a core of Directors with long-standing 
knowledge of the Group while still ensuring that the Board’s 
composition is regularly refreshed. During 2012, the Board 
(through its Nomination Committee) focused heavily on its 
future composition with an emphasis both on executive and 
non-executive succession planning. We have developed a 
succession plan aimed at ensuring a smooth transition 
through to 2015 and beyond. 
The Board Nomination Committee is responsible for both 
executive and non-executive Director succession planning 
and recommends new appointments to the Board. There  
is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board. More detail  
on the role of the Board Nomination Committee is given  
in the report below.
Non-executive Directors’ Terms of Appointment
On appointment, our non-executive Directors are given a 
letter of appointment that sets out the terms and conditions 
of their directorship, including the fees payable and the 
expected time commitment. Each non-executive Director  
is expected to commit approximately three to four days  
per month to the role. An additional time commitment is 
required to fulfil their roles as Board Committee members 
and/or Board Committee chairmen, as applicable. We are 
confident that all non-executive Directors dedicate the 
amount of time necessary to contribute to the effectiveness 
of the Board.
Directors’ external activities and conflicts of interest
Our Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in 
which they have or may have interests that conflict with 
those of the Group, unless that conflict is first authorised by 
the Directors. This includes potential conflicts that may arise 
when a Director takes up a position with another company. 
We recognise the importance of the experience, value and 
knowledge that can be brought to the Board by Directors 
undertaking other roles or activities. Our Directors are 
obliged to obtain authorisation prior to doing so and it is their 
responsibility to ensure that they will be able to meet the 
time commitment we expect of them and that the additional 
role will not impact their effectiveness as a Director.
Our Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise 
potential conflicts, and we have a comprehensive 
procedure in place to deal with any actual or potential 
conflict of interest. The Board takes into consideration  
all the circumstances and deals with each appointment  
on its individual merit.
All potential conflicts approved by the Board are recorded in 
an Interests Register, which is reviewed bi-annually by the 
Board. Following a review of the Interests Register in 2012, the 
Board concluded that all the potential conflicts as registered 
have been considered thoroughly and appropriately. 
Director Re-election
At our 2012 AGM, in line with the Code, we moved to the 
practice of proposing each Director for annual re-election  
at BGH’s AGM and will follow this practice again in 2013. 
Following a performance evaluation of each Director and 
the Board as a whole, we can confirm that all the Directors 
submitting themselves for re-election are considered by 
the Board to be fully effective. 
Board induction and professional development
We have a Director induction and ongoing development 
programme in place that is tailored to the needs of  
each Director. All Directors most recently undertook 
comprehensive training in February 2012 at the time of 
listing and ongoing training is provided. At each Director 
evaluation, the Chairman and Director agree a tailored 
development programme and the Chairman reviews the 
performance of each Director annually. Delivery against 
the agreed development programme is a key component 
of this review. The Chairman and non-executive Directors 
are supported by dedicated corporate secretariat  
resources and through specialist advice on corporate 
governance matters.
Board Committees 
The Board currently has three primary Committees: 
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
and the Nomination Committee. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for the oversight and review of financial, 
audit and internal disclosure issues. The Remuneration 
Committee is tasked with the oversight and review of 
remuneration, share plans and other incentives. The 
Nomination Committee is responsible for the oversight 
and review of Board and executive succession planning.
Our Board has made a conscious decision to delegate a 
broader range of issues to the Board Committees in order 
for the Board to focus more heavily on strategy, but has 
ensured effective connections between the Committees 
and the Board so as to ensure openness and transparency.

and satisfy itself that any significant financial 
judgements made by management are sound;
 – monitor the Group’s internal controls, including internal 
financial controls; 
 – monitor and review the activities and performance of 
the internal and external auditor, including monitoring 
their independence, objectivity and compliance with  
the Group’s policy on non-audit services; 
 – engage with and ensure effective communication with 
the Board, Head of Internal Audit, the external auditor 
and shareholders; 
 – review and monitor conflicts of interests for each 
Director; and 
 – monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
policies and procedures relating to compliance, 
whistleblowing and fraud.

Chairman’s Overview
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 77
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information How did the Audit Committee discharge  
its responsibilities in 2012?
Financial Reporting 
Over the course of 2012, the Committee considered the 
financial control framework within the Group. We have 
discussed and sought assurance that the effects on the 
Group’s business of the continued volatility in financial 
markets (including reduced supply of credit) are being 
closely monitored. We have also considered impairment 
generally and compliance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards within the Group. The Committee 
has also considered management’s recommendations in 
respect of provisions for bad and doubtful debts and any 
other provisions for losses and charges as reported in the 
Group’s half-year and full-year results. We also considered 
management’s assessment in determining that the going 
concern basis for preparing those financial statements was 
appropriate and are satisfied that we have considered for 
disclosure all material relevant issues that have been raised 
by management during the year.
Internal Control
The Code requires the Board to at least annually conduct  
a review of the adequacy of the Group’s systems of internal 
control and report to shareholders that it has done so.  
The Board has undertaken a full review of all the aspects  
of the Turnbull Guidance for Directors, as revised in  
October 2005 (the Turnbull Guidance) under which the 
Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
Our role is to carefully review the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management systems and internal controls. 
We do this by reviewing reports on control issues from 
the internal audit and compliance functions of the Group. 
During 2012, we conducted a review of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management systems and internal 
controls. We have also discussed control environment 
issues, their root causes and management’s response 
and follow-up activities. In addition, we work to ensure 
that the resourcing requirements of both the internal audit 
and compliance functions are met so as to enable each 
department to deliver on its objectives.
Objectivity and Independence of the External Auditor
One of our key responsibilities is to monitor and review the 
objectivity and independence of our external auditor. This 
includes having in place a policy to govern the non-audit 
services that may be provided by the external auditor, 
which sets out the circumstances in which the external 
auditor may be permitted to undertake non-audit services. 
Allowable services are pre-approved up to £100,000. Any 
permissible non-audit service that exceeds this threshold 
requires approval from the Committee and must be robustly 
justified and, if appropriate, tendered, before it is approved. 
The Committee’s policy on tax advisory services is to not 
use the auditor unless there is a very strong case for not 
seeking an alternative supplier. If non-audit services are 
undertaken by the auditor, the Committee receives a 
quarterly report on such non-audit services so that it can 
monitor the types of services being provided and the fees 
incurred. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee reviews 
the Group policy on the provision of non-audit services in 
order to ensure compliance with its terms.
A breakdown of the fees paid to the auditor for non-audit 
work may be found in Note 24 of the Consolidated  
Financial Statements. 
Further details of the non-audit services that are prohibited 
or allowed under our policy can be found on our website,  
at http://www.bogh.co.uk/en/corporate-governance
Oversight of Internal Audit and External Audit
Internal Audit
We are responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of 
the internal audit function and ensuring it is adequately 
resourced and focused on the right issues. We also  
review and approve the annual Internal Audit plan.
During 2012, we received regular reports from Internal 
Audit, which set out the Internal Audit function’s view 
of the control environment and performance against 
key indicators. We have also reviewed and monitored 
management’s responsiveness to Internal Audit’s findings 
and recommendations. We also specifically evaluated the 
resources available to the Internal Audit function and any 
adjustments to be made to the Internal Audit plan, including 
changes to methodology.
Internal Audit’s self-assessment of conformance, which 
we reviewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, evidenced the 
fact that the function generally conforms to the standards 
set by the Institute of Internal Auditors.
External Audit
It is our responsibility to monitor the performance, 
objectivity and independence of the external auditor 
and recommend to the Board the appointment or  
re-appointment or removal of the external auditor.  
We also agree the audit plan with the external auditor  
to ensure that the areas of focus are appropriate.
Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) was appointed as our Group 
statutory auditor by shareholders at our 2012 AGM, 
following a tender process and subsequent Committee and 
Board recommendation. During the course of the year, we 
have discussed with E&Y the business and financial risks 
and have sought assurance that these risks have been 
properly addressed in the audit strategy and plan that  
has been reviewed by the Committee. We have sought 
assurance and are comfortable that no undue pressure has 
been asserted on the level of audit fees so as to ensure that 
there is no risk to audit work being conducted effectively.
Governance: Audit Committee Report continued
78 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 We conducted a review of the performance and effectiveness 
of E&Y, which included an assessment of its independence 
and objectivity. Over the course of the year, the Committee 
has scrutinised the audit process and the quality and 
experience of the audit partners and senior team members 
engaged in the audit. 
In conducting the review, the Committee was seeking to 
gain assurance that E&Y has conducted a comprehensive, 
appropriate and effective audit. Following such review, the 
Committee found that E&Y was considered to be effective, 
objective and independent in its role as Group statutory 
auditor. The Committee will recommend to the Board and 
to shareholders that E&Y should be re-appointed as the 
Group’s auditor at the 2013 AGM.
On a regular basis the Committee meets separately with 
E&Y, the Deputy CEO, Finance, Head of Internal Audit and 
Head of Compliance. These meetings allow Committee 
members to discuss freely matters relating to the statutory 
auditor’s remit and issues arising from the audit.
Effectiveness
The performance of the Committee is reviewed each 
year as part of the Board Effectiveness Review, both 
by the Committee itself and by the Board as a whole. 
In carrying out this review, the Committee considered 
best practice recommendations.
The 2012 review concluded that the Committee continues 
to operate effectively. Areas where we could enhance our 
performance include ensuring that the form and content 
of information presented to the Committee is appropriate 
given the Committee’s busy agenda and we have put 
together an action plan to address the findings.
Ongoing Training and Development 
Over the course of the year, the Committee received 
ongoing training from the Company Secretary, and other 
professional firms, including Freshfields Bruckhaus 
Deringer. These sessions covered control effectiveness, 
financial reporting processes as well as best practice.  
The Audit Committee will continue its ongoing training  
to further enhance its effectiveness.
Looking ahead to 2013
For 2013, the Committee’s areas of focus will continue to 
be influenced by the impact of the challenging economic 
environment and political climate in Georgia. The Committee 
will continue to enhance the Group’s systems, processes and 
controls in order to ensure effective operation consistently 
throughout the Group, in line with the Group’s growth and 
in response to changes in regulatory requirements. The 
Committee will also continue to scrutinise the audit process  
to ensure satisfaction with the quality and coverage of the 
work done by Internal Audit and the Group’s statutory auditor.

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Governance: Directors’ Report on Remuneration
In 2012, the BGH Remuneration Committee’s most 
important action was to evaluate and re-confirm at  
the Group level the merits of the existing executive 
management compensation policy of the Bank  
and its principal subsidiaries, which was originally  
adopted in 2010. 
In 2010, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Bank’s 
executive management contracts were expiring, allowing  
the Remuneration Committee and Supervisory Board to 
formulate a compensation policy reflecting the core principles 
of the Bank and taking into account the lessons learned from 
the crisis. In particular, the Bank’s key objective was to create 
a compensation policy that focused on long-term shareholder 
value and the avoidance of excessive risk-taking. The Bank’s 
new policy sought to avoid the pitfalls in the compensation 
structures prevalent in the United States and Western Europe, 
which were characterised by high cash bonuses (oftentimes 
forming over 50% of an employee’s total compensation).  
That system too frequently rewarded short-term results  
and promoted high stakes risk-taking at stakeholder,  
and ultimately taxpayer, expense. 
The management compensation policy developed by  
the Remuneration Committee and adopted by the 
Supervisory Board in this context (the “Policy”) placed 
particular focus on the compensation of the Group’s 
executive management team, comprising approximately 
seven to 10 people at any given time and including the 
Bank’s CEO, Irakli Gilauri. When the holding company 
structure was implemented in 2012, the Policy continued  
to apply to executives at the Bank and, with his dual  
role as the CEO of the Bank and BGH (and BGH’s sole 
Executive Director), to the bulk of Irakli’s compensation  
in respect of the Bank. 
The core principles upon which the Policy is based are  
the following:
 – management should be rewarded only for good 
performance, taking into account the overall 
performance of the Group and individual performance;
 – management should be incentivised to protect the 
Group’s long-term performance and guard against 
taking risks that endanger the long-term stability of  
the Group; and 
 – banks prosper over the long term with management 
compensation structures that allow executives to see 
themselves as “partners”, i.e., long term participants  
in and owners of the Bank.
As discussed in greater detail in the Remuneration Overview 
directly below, the Policy provides for a three-part remuneration 
structure, comprised of a modest yet competitive fixed cash 
salary, fixed contingent deferred share compensation and 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation. In 2012, 
the fixed cash salary (including other benefits), fixed contingent 
deferred share compensation and discretionary contingent 
deferred share compensation comprised on average  
15%, 47% and 38%, respectively, of an executive’s total 
remuneration package (calculated on an average basis for  
all those who were members of the executive management 
team in 2012, and excluding the CEO). The emphasis on  
share-based compensation, which takes the form of nil-cost 
options to acquire shares in BGH, has created a culture among 
executives that prioritises the long-term success of the Group 
by closely aligning management’s with shareholders’ interests.
The only vesting condition of both the fixed and 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation  
is continued employment within the Group or leaving 
on a “good leaver” basis. 
The most important work  
of BGH’s Remuneration 
Committee in 2012 was to 
evaluate the merits and results 
of the Group’s management 
compensation policy, 
previously adopted in 2010
Al Breach
Chairman of Remuneration Committee
Chairman’s Overview
80 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 An executive is not considered a “good leaver” (a) if the 
executive is dismissed for cause, (b) upon the expiration of  
his or her contract the executive refuses to accept a new 
service agreement upon substantially similar terms, or (c) if the 
executive departs the Group other than for good reason (such 
as breach of a service contract by the company which is not 
cured during the remedy period), change of control, death, 
retirement at normal retirement age, disability, injury or 
redundancy. In addition, the Supervisory Board may, in its 
discretion in exceptional circumstances, treat an executive as 
a good leaver in circumstances other than those listed above. 
Generally, if the executive is not a good leaver, the 
unvested portion of his or her contingent deferred share 
compensation will lapse. If the executive remains employed 
with the Group or is a good leaver, unvested fixed and 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation 
continues to vest during the respective vesting period.  
In addition, any unvested fixed and discretionary contingent 
deferred share compensation vests immediately upon the 
occurrence of certain events, including death, termination 
of the contract by the executive for good reason and the 
occurrence of a change of control (which is defined as a 
person or a group of people owning more than 50% of 
the issued voting shares of the Bank or BGH), or upon  
a decision by the BGH Board or the Supervisory Board  
that an executive is a good leaver.
The Group’s Policy in effect means that our executives  
earn rights to acquire shares in BGH through continuing 
commitment to the Group, and lose the unvested portion  
of those rights if they leave and are not considered a good 
leaver e.g. the executive resigns during the term of his 
contract whether to take up employment elsewhere or 
otherwise, the executive refuses to renew the contract  
at the end of the term of the contract or if the Group 
terminates the employment of the executive for cause. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the compensation 
of management and a financial institution’s ownership 
structure is crucial to laying the foundation for the long-term 
success of an institution. Our experience so far suggests that 
linking much of management’s remuneration to the stability 
and growth of the Group is helping to:
 – ensure that management is dedicated to strong  
financial performance; 
 – entrench a culture of hard work and loyalty to the  
Group; and
 – reward calculated risk-taking that is focused on  
long-term stability and growth. 
Accordingly, in early February 2013, the Committee and  
the Board re-confirmed their commitment to the terms of  
the Policy, with the addition of a dividend equalisation 
mechanism, as described in greater detail below. The 
Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that the 
merits of the Policy have been made even clearer in light of the 
continuing executive compensation developments in banking 
and other industries since the start of the financial crisis. 
Remuneration Overview
This Directors’ Report on Remuneration and the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements have been drawn up  
from the date of incorporation of BGH (14 October 201 1)  
to 31 December 2012. The accompanying Consolidated 
Financial Statements are prepared as if the Group is a 
continuation of the pre-existing group of companies with 
the Bank as its ultimate parent. The comparative financial 
statements as at and for the years ended 31 December 201 1 
and 31 December 2010 are that of the group of companies 
consolidated with the Bank as its ultimate parent.
With the exception of Irakli Gilauri (who is eligible to receive 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation in 
respect of his Bank service contract), BGH Directors do  
not receive bonuses or share-based compensation based 
on performance. The remuneration in respect of Directors 
of BGH, in their capacity as such, is not linked to any 
performance conditions and BGH does not currently have 
any plans to modify the remuneration of its Directors to 
include any performance conditions. Notwithstanding  
the above, each BGH Director is carefully evaluated on  
an annual basis to ensure that his or her performance 
continues to provide a positive contribution to the Group. 
The Group’s executive management team comprises the CEO 
of BGH and the Bank and the Bank’s deputy CEOs responsible 
for the following directions: Finance, Retail Banking, Corporate 
Banking, Wealth Management, Risk, Legal and Affordable 
Housing, as well as the CEO of Aldagi BCI (each an “executive”).
Irakli Gilauri serves as CEO of BGH and the Bank. He has 
two separate service agreements, one with BGH signed on 
15 December 2011 under which he is paid a fixed cash 
salary of US$250,000, and one with the Bank signed on  
25 May 2010 under which he receives a fixed cash salary  
of US$187 ,500 as well as fixed and discretionary contingent 
deferred share compensation. 
Irakli Gilauri’s current service agreement with BGH continues 
until terminated by either party upon four months’ written notice 
or by BGH with immediate effect by payment in lieu of notice 
(where such payment in lieu of notice shall be solely in respect 
of fixed cash salary under the BGH service agreement). 
Irakli’s current service agreement with the Bank has been 
renewed with effect from 1 May 2013 (the “2013 service 
agreement”) for a term of three years until 1 May 2016, 
unless terminated by Irakli upon three months’ written notice 
or by the Bank with immediate effect, which is the same 
termination provision as the current service agreement.
BGH and the Bank, as the case may be, may terminate the 
executive’s employment early without notice or pay in lieu  
of notice in the case of, among other circumstances, his 
dishonesty, gross misconduct, conviction of an offence 
(other than traffic related) or becoming of unsound mind. 
If Irakli’s service contract with the Bank is terminated other 
than for cause or is not renewed on substantially similar 
terms at the expiry of the term of the contract, Irakli is 
entitled to a separation payment approximately equal to  
12 months’ base annual salary under the Bank service 
agreement. In addition, upon termination of the service 
agreement with the Bank for any reason, the executive shall 
be entitled to all vested fixed and discretionary contingent 
deferred share compensation and may also be entitled to 
unvested awards of the same, subject to the vesting 
provisions summarised below.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 81
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Executive Remuneration
In accordance with the Policy, executive compensation comprises the following:
1. Competitive yet modest fixed cash salary;
2. Fixed contingent deferred share compensation – this takes the form of annual awards of nil-cost options over such 
number of shares in BGH as is stipulated in the executive’s service agreement. Awards vest over the five-year period that 
follows the beginning of the year (the work year) in respect of which the share award is granted (0% of the options vest in 
the first year following the work year, 20% of the options vest in each of the second, third and fourth years following the 
work year, and 40% vest in the fifth year following the work year); and 
3. Discretionary contingent deferred share compensation. This takes the form of annual awards of nil-cost options over 
such number of shares in BGH as is determined annually by the Supervisory Board in its sole discretion, based on  
the performance of the Bank and the executive. Awards vest over a two-year period following the end of work year 
(50% of the options vest at the beginning of each of the second and third years following the work year).
A critical element in the overall structure of the compensation is that there are no cash bonuses and the only vesting 
condition of both the fixed and discretionary contingent deferred share compensation is continued employment with the 
Group or “good leaver” status as described above. 
The following table provides the fixed cash salary, fixed contingent deferred share compensation and discretionary contingent 
deferred share compensation for the CEO and other members of executive management of the Bank in respect of 2012. 
Detailed information regarding the holdings of ordinary shares in BGH of executive management can be found on page 86 of

1. Please note that the Bank reports in Lari. All figures provided above in US Dollars have been converted for convenience from Lari to US Dollars using 
an exchange rate of GEL 1.6567 per US$1.00, being the official Lari to US Dollar exchange rate as reported by the NBG on 31 December 2012 and 
have been rounded to the nearest US Dollar. Although the amount of each executive’s salary is presented in US Dollars in the table above, these 
salaries are paid in Lari in Georgia and in GBP in the UK, and therefore accounted for in such currencies. These accounting values in Lari and GBP,  
for the purposes of the above presentation, have been translated into US Dollars at the 2012 year-end official exchange rate of NBG.
2. Irakli Gilauri’s BGH salary was cash only in the amount of US$233,037, and is included in the figure in this table.
3. For presentation purposes in the table above, the values of the fixed contingent deferred shares are calculated as the full number of grant shares 
multiplied by US$16.6, which was the market value of a BGH share as at 31 December 2012. However, for IFRS purposes, grant values of these shares 
are based on the market values of the same shares at the respective grant dates. The grant date of the fixed contingent deferred shares was the date 
of signature of the executive’s contract, which was 25 May 2010 for Irakli Gilauri and 29 March 2010 for all other executives listed in the table above. 
The share price in US Dollars as at 25 May 2010 and 29 March 2010, was US$10.2 and US$10.6, respectively. Fixed contingent deferred share 
compensation is subject to a five-year vesting period as described above.
Governance: Directors’ Report on Remuneration continued
82 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 4. For presentation purposes in the table above, the values of the discretionary shares are calculated as the full number of grant shares multiplied by 
US$16.6, the market value of a BGH share on 31 December 2012. However, for IFRS purposes, grant values of these shares are based on the  
market values of the same shares at the respective grant dates. The grant date of the discretionary contingent deferred shares for all executives  
was 15 February 2013, the date of award by the Board. The share price in US Dollars as at that date was US$21.5. Discretionary contingent deferred  
share compensation is subject to two-year vesting as described above.
5. Because (as described in detail above) the share-based compensation is deferred and contingent, an economic valuation of the compensation award 
would discount for those factors. In that sense, the total value of remuneration is overstated in the above table. The actual value of the share-based 
compensation and thus an executive’s total remuneration in respect of a given year will depend on the number of shares that vest in that year and the 
value of the shares at the time they vest or are sold, which could be a value greater or lesser than the value of the shares at 31 December 2012.
6. Other benefits include payments in respect of the Executive’s medical and life and incapacity insurance.

Irakli’s gain on the exercise of his share options was GBP 1,685,341 in 2012. The gain is defined as the difference between 
(a) the market price of the shares on the date on which the option was exercised and (b) the price actually paid for the 
shares, which is nil in this particular case, as indicated in the table above. 
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 83
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The market price of BGH shares during 2012 ranged from 
£9.30 to £13.30 per BGH share and the closing market 
price of a BGH share on 31 December 2012 was £10.30. 
With effect from 14 February 2013, outstanding share 
options are subject to the dividend equalisation mechanism 
described below in respect of all dividends paid on or after 
such date. 
The only vesting condition for Irakli’s fixed and discretionary 
contingent deferred share compensation is continued 
employment within the Group or leaving on a “good leaver” 
basis. The CEO is not considered a “good leaver”, and all 
his unvested fixed and discretionary awards shall lapse 
(unless the Supervisory Board determines otherwise), if he 
is dismissed for cause or departs from the Group other 
than for good reason. 
If the 2013 service agreement with the Bank expires and is 
not renewed upon substantially similar terms but Irakli is 
offered membership of the board of the Bank and/or of 
BGH, 50% of each of his unvested awards shall vest 
immediately and the remaining 50% shall (where he  
accepts the offer of board membership) continue to vest  
as normal or (where he refuses such offer) may, at the 
CEO’s discretion, either continue to vest as normal or the 
CEO may acquire some or all of the underlying shares  
for a specified price in accordance with the terms of the  
service agreement. If the CEO accepts the offer of Board 
membership, any remaining unvested awards when he 
ceases to be a board member shall, at his discretion,  
either continue to vest as normal or the underlying shares 
may be acquired for the specified price.
Any unvested awards shall vest immediately if ceases  
to be an executive by reason of death, disability, injury, 
redundancy or retirement at normal retirement age; if there 
is a change of control of the Bank or BGH; if the 2013 
service agreement is terminated by the Bank other than for 
cause or by Irakli for good reason; or if it expires and neither 
a renewed agreement nor Board membership is offered. 
Any unvested awards granted under Irakli’s 2010 service 
agreement with the Bank shall vest immediately on 
termination of the 2013 service agreement for any reason, 
except that (i) if the agreement is terminated by the Bank for 
cause, any unvested awards shall (unless the Supervisory 
Board determines otherwise) lapse, and (ii) if it is terminated 
by Irakli for any reason other than for good reason (and 
unless the Supervisory Board determines otherwise to his 
advantage), 50% of each of the unvested awards shall vest 
immediately and the remaining 50% shall, at his discretion, 
either continue to vest as normal or the underlying shares 
may be acquired for the specified price.
Governance: Directors’ Report on Remuneration continued
As provided in greater detail in the table above and  
based on BGH share market value as of 31 December 
2012, Irakli Gilauri’s compensation package for 2012 
comprised an aggregate fixed cash salary (from BGH and 
the Bank) of US$ 451,587, a fixed contingent deferred share 
compensation award of 90,000 shares in BGH (with a value 
of US$ 1,491,358) and a discretionary contingent deferred 
share compensation award (in respect of the Bank’s and 
Irakli’s performance during the year 2012) of 30,000 shares 
in BGH (with a value of US$ 497,119). These elements 
comprised 19%, 61% and 20% of his total compensation 
package, respectively. 
The average fixed cash salary for the executive 
management team (excluding Irakli Gilauri) in 2012 was 
US$143,361 and comprised on average 15% of an 
executive’s average compensation package. The fixed  
cash salary is structured to be a small portion of the overall 
compensation package, yet competitive enough to attract 
talent to the Group. 
The average fixed contingent deferred share compensation 
for the executive management team (excluding Irakli Gilauri) 
in 2012 was 26,875 shares (with a value of US$445,336) 
and comprised on average 47% of an executive’s average 
compensation package. Fixed contingent deferred share 
compensation is not performance based and consequently, 
forms a fixed portion of an executive’s compensation 
package. All fixed contingent deferred share compensation 
is subject to a five-year vesting period as outlined above. 
With 40% of an executive’s fixed contingent deferred shares 
vesting in the fifth year following the beginning of the work 
year, executive management are further motivated to focus 
on the long-term success of the Group. 
The average discretionary contingent share compensation 
for the executive management team (excluding Irakli Gilauri) 
in 2012 was 21,250 shares (with a value of US$ 352,126) 
and comprised on average 38% of an Executive’s average 
compensation package. 
The aggregate pool of shares available for discretionary 
contingent deferred share compensation is determined by 
the Remuneration Committee annually, based on a number 
of criteria including: (a) the overall performance of the Group 
over the year in respect of which the awards are to be 
granted, particularly its profitability; (b) the performance of 
the Bank relative to its competitors in Georgia and in the 
light of overall global market conditions; and (c) the market 
value of the shares at time of grant. 
84 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 In determining the number of shares over which individual 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation 
awards will be granted, the Remuneration Committee 
evaluates the executive’s role and its importance to the 
Group as well as the individual key performance indicators 
(KPIs) assigned to the executive, which reflect the 
executive’s required contribution to the Group’s overall key 
strategic and financial objectives. For the 2012 financial 
year, these objectives included: (a) financial objectives (e.g. 
operating profit, operating leverage, earnings per share, 
return on equity and return on assets); (b) business growth 
objectives (e.g. customer lending growth, client deposit 
growth, and fee and commission generation); (c) risk 
management objectives (e.g. capital strength, liquidity 
management and cost of credit risk); and (d) people 
development objectives (e.g. succession planning,  
training and development). In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee considers the executive’s “360 degree 
evaluation”, which is an exhaustive annual internal peer 
review system. In the case of the CEO, the Supervisory 
Board also assesses the CEO’s contribution and how he 
met his KPIs. In the case of other members of executive 
management, the CEO also discusses with the 
Remuneration Committee the executive’s individual 
contributions and how he or she met the KPIs. 
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is that discretionary 
contingent deferred share compensation will comprise less 
than 50% of an executive’s total compensation package. 
The Code, which requires disclosure of the compensation 
arrangements for all directors of premium listed companies 
on the London Stock Exchange, recommends for share-
based compensation of directors a minimum three-year 
vesting period, challenging performance conditions 
reflecting the company’s objectives, phased grants and 
clawback provisions. As mentioned above, the only Director 
of BGH who is eligible for any share-based compensation is 
the CEO, Irakli Gilauri, in his capacity as CEO of the Bank. 
When assessing his compensation arrangements as CEO 
of BGH, we also take into account the remuneration that  
he receives in his capacity as CEO of the Bank, which 
comprises a fixed salary and fixed and discretionary 
contingent deferred share compensation. Irakli’s fixed 
contingent deferred share compensation takes the form  
of awards over 90,000 shares per annum. As described 
above, Irakli’s fixed contingent deferred share compensation 
is subject to vesting over a five-year period while his 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation 
awards is subject to vesting over a two-year period.  
In compliance with the Code, awards of both fixed and 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation are 
phased (in that they are granted annually). While vesting is 
contingent, there are no clawback provisions. The number 
of shares awarded as discretionary contingent deferred 
share compensation in respect of any year is performance-
based, but there are no performance conditions (other than 
continued employment or leaving as a good leaver) for the 
vesting of such awards. For fixed contingent deferred share 
compensation, the number of shares awarded annually is 
determined in the executive’s service agreement. 
Although the terms of the CEO’s share-based 
compensation are not in line with the vesting 
recommendations of the Code, the Committee strongly 
believes that, with its high composition of both fixed and 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation, 
Irakli’s overall Bank compensation package satisfies the 
spirit of the Code. The weighted average vesting period of 
Irakli’s fixed and discretionary contingent deferred share 
compensation awarded in respect of 2012 is 3.5 years while 
the weighted average vesting period for all of executive 
management (including Irakli) fixed and discretionary 
deferred share compensation awarded in respect of 2012  
is 3.2 years.
The Policy adopted by the Committee, the Board and the 
Supervisory Board of the Bank in February 2013 contains a 
dividend equalisation mechanism whereby members of the 
executive management team who have been awarded fixed 
or discretionary contingent deferred share compensation 
which has not yet vested, will receive, at the time the 
contingent deferred shares actually vest, cash payments 
equal to the dividends paid on the underlying shares 
between the date of grant and the vesting date. Such 
dividend payments will be paid in Lari, converted from  
GBP using the exchange rate as at the date dividends  
were paid to other shareholders. This dividend equalisation 
mechanism applies to all unvested contingent deferred 
share compensation granted. 
In addition to the compensation outlined above and in 
accordance with the Group’s policy, the executive 
management team (including Irakli Gilauri) also receive 
benefits, which include medical insurance, life assurance, 
company car and participation in a pension scheme 
whereby the executive and the Bank each contribute a 
minimum of 1.0% of his or her gross monthly salary to the 
Bank’s defined contribution pension scheme and the Bank 
contributes an additional 1.0%. Should the executive decide 
to make an additional contribution to the pension fund, the 
Bank will match by contributing in a proportion of 0.2 to 1, 
up to a maximum of 1% of the executive’s monthly gross 
salary. The average value of total benefits received by a 
member of the executive management team (including Irakli 
Gilauri) per year is US$2,000. Non-Executive Directors do 
not receive any pension or other benefits. 
In 2012, the Bank’s aggregate contributions to Irakli Gilauri’s 
pension fund were US$2,186.

How did the Remuneration Committee 
discharge its responsibilities in 2012?
For 2012, the Remuneration Committee considered the 
following matters in line with its remit:
 – performance measures and targets to be applied to 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation

executive management team against set performance 
targets;
 – in line with the Group’s Policy, determine whether 
discretionary contingent deferred share compensation 
should be granted;
 – consideration of advisory bodies’ and institutional 
investors’ current guidelines on executive compensation, 
and assessment of the risk environment surrounding the 
Group’s current remuneration arrangements;
 – fixing compensation arrangements and agreeing 
executive management team contracts for the period 
beginning May 2013 for 2.5 or 3.5 year periods, in order 
to ensure that all executive management team contracts 
do not come up for renewal at the same time;
 – analysing the pay and employment conditions of 
employees of the Group and taking these into account 
when determining executive compensation for the period 
beginning May 2013 for the duration of executive 
management contracts, including comparing changes in 
pay and employment conditions across the Group as a 
whole versus the proposed pay and employment 
conditions of all levels of management; 
 – review of the Committee’s performance and its Terms of 
Reference; and
 – approval of the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Effectiveness
The performance of the Committee is reviewed each year 
as part of the Board Effectiveness Review, both by the 
Committee itself and by the Board as a whole. In carrying 
out this review, the Committee considered best practice 
recommendations.
The 2012 review concluded that the Committee continues 
to operate effectively.

Ongoing Training and Development
Over the course of the year, the Committee received 
ongoing training from the Company Secretary and other 
external professional firms. These sessions principally 
covered corporate governance best practice and investor 
remuneration guidance. The Committee will continue its 
ongoing training to further enhance its effectiveness. 
Looking Ahead to 2013
In 2013, the Committee’s focus will be on ensuring that  
the overall compensation structure for the CEO and 
executive management team and other senior employees  
of the Group remain appropriate in order to motivate 
executives while enhancing long-term shareholder value. 
The Committee is open to constructive suggestions from 
shareholders regarding the Group’s remuneration strategy 
and policy.

Neil Janin
Chairman of Nomination Committee
Chairman’s Overview
90 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 How did the Nomination Committee 
discharge its responsibilities in 2012?
The Committee reviewed the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and the Board Committees, 
looking at the need to refresh the Board, the balance 
and diversity of skills and experience on the Board and 
planning ahead for new Board appointments as well as 
future retirements. We undertook a skills analysis and 
considered the skills that are likely to be required in the 
future. In light of this analysis, we have begun to interview 
candidates for non-executive Directorial roles.
The Committee also discussed and developed succession 
plans for the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, non-
executive Directors and key senior managerial roles. As 
most of our Directors have served between three and six 
years, we will look to refresh the Board over the next few 
years, based on the skills required for the Group. As part of 
this discussion, the Committee reviewed and discussed the 
outcome of the Lord Davies’ Report on the proportion of 
women on boards and diversity in general. The Group has 
historically placed a high emphasis on diversity and will 
continue to do so looking forward. Geographic and gender 
diversity together with key technical expertise in banking, 
risk, accountancy, finance, technology and international 
business all form core components of our Board succession 
planning. Balancing all of these factors to maintain an 
effective Board is a delicate matter and we do not believe 
that imposing quotas is appropriate in this context.
Throughout the year, we have undertaken training in order 
to remain up to date on significant developments and how 
these might impact the Group. 
To ensure that the Committee is operating effectively, we 
carried out our Committee review at the time of the Board 
Effectiveness Review. The Committee is reviewed by the 
members themselves as well as by the Board as a whole.

Looking ahead to 2013
For 2013, the Committee will continue to focus on 
succession planning and Board and Committee 
refreshment. We will also look to have greater visibility of 
potential candidates for key senior positions with the Group.

Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Governance: Directors’ Report
Principal Activities and Business Review
BGH is the holding company for the Group. The Group 
operates globally and is principally engaged in the core 
businesses of retail banking, corporate banking, asset and 
wealth management as well as the synergistic businesses 
of insurance and healthcare and affordable housing.
We are required to present a fair review of our business 
during the financial year ended 31 December 2012, our 
position at year-end and a description of the principal  
risks and uncertainties that we face. This review enables 
shareholders to assess how the Directors have performed 
their duties under the Companies Act 2006. 
The Directors’ Report and the accompanying Consolidated 
Financial Statements have been drawn up from the date of 
incorporation of BGH (14 October 2011) to 31 December 2012. 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are 
prepared as if the Group is a continuation of the pre-existing 
group of companies with the Bank as its ultimate parent. The 
comparative financial statements as at and for the years 
ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are that  
of the group of companies consolidated with the Bank as  
its ultimate parent.

Articles of Association

a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. 
The Articles of Association are available on BGH’s  
website http://www.bogh.co.uk/en/corporate-governance
Share Capital
BGH was incorporated on 14 October 2011 (company 
number 07811410). At incorporation, the issued and fully 
paid-up capital was £50,001, comprised of one subscriber 
share and 50,000 redeemable shares. 
On 20 December 2011, in connection with the introduction  
of BGH as the new holding company for the Group, BGH 
issued a Prospectus detailing the tender offer of one BGH 
ordinary share for each ordinary share of Bank of Georgia, 
whether held in the form of an ordinary share or a global 
depositary receipt, in connection with an application for 
admission to the premium listing segment of the Official  
List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the  
London Stock Exchange. 
The tender offer was successful, and admission to the 
Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the 
London Stock Exchange took place on 28 February 2012. 
Upon the first issue of BGH shares to existing holders,  
the one subscriber share and 50,000 redeemable shares 
were acquired by the BGH for nil consideration and 
cancelled, resulting in a share capital of 35,909,383 
ordinary shares, with a nominal value of £6.00 each. 
BGH capitalised the full amount standing to the credit  
of the merger reserve and applied the sum so capitalised in 
issuing Class A shares credited as fully paid to the holders 
who validly accepted the tender offer. The Class A shares 
were non-voting , not entitled to any profit or assets or 
return of capital in the event of winding up and could be 
redeemed without prior notice from BGH.
Following admission, the Directors applied to the High 
Court of Justice of England and Wales to undertake  
a reduction of capital in order to create distributable 
reserves for BGH. On 20 March 2012, the Court Order 
approving the reduction of capital was registered with  
the Registrar of Companies and the nominal value of  
each of the ordinary shares in the capital of BGH  
was reduced from £6.00 to £0.01 and the reduction  
of capital created distributable reserves of approximately 
£299.5 million for BGH. At the same time as the registration 
of the capital reduction, BGH redeemed and cancelled  
all Class A shares and, as a result, BGH’s ordinary shares 
represented and continue to represent 100% of the total 
issued share capital of BGH.
On a show of hands, each member present at our general 
meeting has the right to one vote. On a poll, each member 
is entitled to one vote for every ordinary share held. 
Persons with direct or indirect interests in BGH shares or 
the ability to exercise voting rights over at least 10%, 25% 
or 50% (or such other percentages as a regulatory authority 
may determine from time to time) of the shares in any 
regulated Group company, must notify BGH as well as 
satisfy and comply with all regulatory requirements, as 
described in BGH’s Articles of Association.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of BGH’s shares that may  
result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on  
voting rights. No person has any special rights of control 
over BGH’s share capital and all issued shares  
are fully paid.
92 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 BGH may, by ordinary resolution, upon the recommendation 
of the Board, capitalise all or any part of an amount standing 
to the credit of a reserve or fund to be set free for distribution 
provided that amounts from the share premium account, 
capital redemption reserve or any profits not available for 
distribution should be applied only in paying up unissued 
shares to be allotted to members credited as fully paid and 
no unrealised profits shall be applied in paying up debentures 
of BGH or any amount unpaid on any share in the capital  
of BGH.
At the 2012 AGM, BGH was granted authority by 
shareholders to purchase up to 10% of BGH’s issued share 
capital. In 2012, no ordinary shares were purchased by 
BGH. This authority will expire at this year’s AGM. As such, 
a special resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM 
seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.
At the 2012 AGM, the Directors were also given the  
power to allot ordinary shares in BGH up to an amount 
approximately equal to two-thirds of the issued share 
capital of BGH (excluding treasury shares). This authority 
will expire at this year’s AGM. As such, an ordinary 
resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking 
shareholder approval to renew this authority.
In addition, at the 2012 AGM, the Directors were given  
the power to issue shares up to the equivalent of 5%  
of BGH’s issued share capital, including shares held  
in treasury, on a non-pre-emptive basis to ordinary 
shareholders. This authority will expire at this year’s AGM. 
As such, a special resolution is proposed in the Notice of 
AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.
Detailed explanatory notes to these resolutions will be  
set out in the Notice of AGM mailed to shareholders on or 
about 18 April 2013 and available on BGH’s website 
http:www.bogh.co.uk/en/investors
Other than the above, we have no current intention of 
issuing further share capital and no issue will be made 
which would effectively alter control of BGH without prior 
approval of shareholders in a general meeting.
Results and Dividends
BGH may by ordinary resolution declare dividends  
provided that no such dividend shall exceed the amount 
recommended by BGH’s Directors. The Directors may also 
pay interim dividends as appearto be justified by the profits 
of BGH available for distribution. 
As BGH is a holding company, BGH relies primarily  
on dividends and other statutorily and contractually 
permissible payments from its subsidiaries to generate 
revenues necessary to meet its obligations and pay 
dividend to its shareholders. 
As a result of the Bank’s strong financial performance and 
condition, BGH, as a controlling shareholder of the Bank 
has approved an annual dividend of GEL 1.5 on 5 April 
2013 for the year ended 31 December 2012, which will  
be paid by the Bank to its shareholders (including BGH) in 
May 2013. The BGH Board has recently recommended an 
annual dividend of GEL 1.5 payable in Sterling, which is 
subject to shareholders approval at the AGM. If approved  
it is intended that the dividend will be paid in sterling on  
19 June 2013 to shareholders on the UK register of 
members at the close of business in the UK (6:00 pm 
London time) on 7 June 2013.
Powers of Directors
The Directors may exercise all powers of BGH subject to 
applicable legislation and regulation and BGH’s Articles of 
Association.
Conflicts of Interest
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
have adopted a policy and procedure for the disclosure and 
authorisation (if appropriate) of conflicts of interest, and 
these have been followed during 2012.
Appointment and Retirement of Directors
The appointment and replacement of Directors is  
governed by BGH’s Articles of Association, the Code,  
the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The 
Articles may only be amended by a special resolution  
of the shareholders. 
The Board has the power to appoint additional Directors  
or to fill a casual vacancy amongst the Directors. Under  
the Articles of Association, any such Director holds office 
only until the next AGM and may offer himself/herself for 
re-election. The Articles of Association also require that  
at each AGM at least one-third of the Directors retire by 
rotation. The retiring Directors are eligible to stand for 
re-election. We note that the Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies 
should be subject to annual re-election. We abide by this 
recommendation and, as a result, we will all stand for 
re-election at the AGM.
Directors’ Remuneration
Directors’ fees are determined by the Board from time to  
time. Directors’ fees (as distinct from any salary, remuneration 
or other amount payable to a Director pursuant to other 
provisions of the Articles of Association or otherwise) may  
not exceed £750,000 per annum in aggregate or such higher 
amounts as may from time to time be determined by ordinary 
resolution of BGH. The fees paid to the Directors pursuant  
to their letters of appointment are shown on page 87 of this 
Annual Report.

The Directors’ beneficial interests in ordinary shares of BGH 
as at 31 December 2012 are shown on page 87 of this 
Annual Report.
Indemnity
Subject to applicable legislation, every current and former 
Director or other officer of BGH (other than any person 
engaged by the company as auditor) shall be indemnified 
by BGH against any liability in relation to BGH, other than 
(broadly) any liability to BGH or a member of the Group,  
or any criminal or regulatory fine.
Related Party Transactions
Details of related party transactions are set out in  
Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
on page 174 of this Annual Report.
Significant Contracts and Agreements
At no time during the year did any Director hold a material 
interest in any contracts of significance with BGH or any 
subsidiary of the Group. BGH is not party to any significant 
agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate 
following a change of control of BGH.
Political donations
The Group did not make any political donations or 
expenditures during 2012. 
Major Interests in Shares 
The following table lists shareholders with voting rights of 
more than 3% as of 31 December 2012 and 31 March 2013. 
The 31 March 2013 information has been derived from 
source available to BGH, primarily through regulatory filings.
The respective regulatory filings by shareholders are 
available on the BGH website: http://bogh.co.uk/en/

Community Investment
We are committed to building a sustainable business  
and a more sustainable society, and recognise our 
responsibility to invest in the communities in which we 
operate. We made a total investment of GEL 1.4 million  
in charities, sponsorships, community organisations  
and causes across our footprint during the year.
Creditor payment policy
The Group is committed to maintaining good commercial 
relationships with its suppliers. The Bank is responsible  
for agreeing, and then bringing attention to, terms and 
conditions with its suppliers. The Group’s policy is to pay 
creditors in accordance with agreed terms and conditions, 
provided the supplier has complied with them. BGH is a 
holding company and does not trade. Therefore, it is not 
considered meaningful to give a number of days’ purchases 
outstanding for BGH as at 31 December 2012. 
Code of Conduct and Ethics
The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics 
relating to the lawful and ethical conduct of the business, 
supported by the Group’s core values. The Code of 
Conduct has been communicated to all Directors and 
employees, all of whom are expected to observe high 
standards of integrity and fair dealing in relation to 
customers, staff and regulators in the communities  
in which the Group operates. Our Code of Conduct  
is available on our website http://www.bogh.co.uk/en/

Going Concern
The Group’s business, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position  
are described in the Business review – Overview of 
financial results, segment discussions, principal risks and 
uncertainties of this Annual Report (on pages 28 to 55). 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described in the Risk 
Management on pages 56 to 65. In addition Note 27 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements includes details of the 
Group’s financial instruments and its risk profile.
A description of the Group’s risks and risk management  
are also outlined in the Risks and Uncertainties and Risk 
Management sections on pages 46 to 65.
The Group has considerable financial resources to meet  
its financial needs. The Directors believe that the Group is 
well positioned to manage its risks successfully in the 
current uncertain economic environment.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that BGH and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable  
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accompanying Consolidated  
Financial Statements.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
We are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company 
law requires us to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under the law, we have elected to prepare 
the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable law.
Under company law, we must not approve the 
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements unless 
we are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and BGH and of the profit or 
loss of the Group and BGH for that period.
In preparing the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements, we are required to:
a) select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
b) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
c) state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and 
d) prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
We are also responsible for keeping adequate  
accounting records that are sufficient to show and  
explain BGH’s and the Group’s transactions, to disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of BGH and the Group and to enable us to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation.
We have further responsibility for safeguarding the  
assets of BGH and the Group and for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
We are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of BGH’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
Each of the us listed in the Board of Directors section  
of this Annual Report confirms that to the best of  
his/her knowledge:
(a) the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of BGH and the 
Group as a whole; and 
(b) the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and  
the position of BGH and Group as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
In accordance with section 418(2) of the Companies  
Act 2006, each of us that held office at the date of the 
approval of this Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as 
he/she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which BGH’s auditors are unaware and each of us has 
taken all reasonable steps to ascertain any relevant audit 
information and ensure that the Group statutory auditors 
are aware of such information.
Statement of Compliance
As BGH is listed on the London Stock Exchange, we 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code, save  
for Section D.1.1, which is described in greater detail in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report of this Annual Report.

1. The maintenance and integrity of the Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC  
website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the 
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, 
the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on

Independent Auditor’s Report: To the members of Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Bank of Georgia 
Holdings PLC for the year ended 31 December 2012 which 
comprise the Standalone statement of financial position, 
Consolidated statement of financial position, Consolidated 
income statement, Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, Consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
Consolidated statement of cash flows and the related notes  
1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company  
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
 a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors  
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 95, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2012 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;  98 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

1. Principal Activities
JSC Bank of Georgia (the “Bank”) was established on 21 October 1994 as a joint stock company (“JSC”) under the laws 
of Georgia. The Bank operates under a general banking license issued by the National Bank of Georgia (“NBG”; the 
Central Bank of Georgia) on 15 December 1994. 
The Bank accepts deposits from the public and extends credit, transfers payments in Georgia and internationally and 
exchanges currencies. Its main office is in Tbilisi, Georgia. At 31 December 2012 the Bank has 194 operating outlets  
in all major cities of Georgia (31 December 2011: 158, 31 December 2010: 142). The Bank’s registered legal address  
is 29a Gagarini Street, Tbilisi 0160, Georgia.
The Bank is the parent of a group of companies incorporated in Georgia and Belarus. Primary business activities  
include providing banking, leasing, insurance, healthcare, brokerage and wealth management services, to corporate 
and individual customers.
In December 2011, Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC (“BGH”), a public limited liability company newly incorporated in 
England and Wales, launched the Tender Offer (the “Tender Offer”) to exchange its entire ordinary share capital for 
an equivalent number of the Bank’s ordinary shares and thus to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital, 
including those shares represented by Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”), of the Bank. Following the successful 
completion of the Tender Offer on 28 February 2012 and subsequent acquisitions of the Bank’s remaining shares held 
by non-controlling shareholders by the Bank, BGH holds 99.62% of the share capital of the Bank as at 31 December 
2012, representing the Bank’s ultimate parent company. Together with the Bank’s subsidiaries, BGH makes up a group 
of companies (the “Group”). The list of the companies included in the Group is provided in Note 2. The shares of BGH 
(“BGH Shares”) were admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and 
admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange PLC’s Main Market for listed securities effective 28 February 2012 
(the “Admission”, Note 20). The Bank is the Group’s main operating unit and accounts for most of the Group’s activities.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC’s registered legal address is 84 Brook Street, London, United Kingdom W1K 5EH. Registered 
number of BGH is 7811410.
The treasury shares kept by the Bank for the purposes of its future employee share-based compensation, as of the 
Tender Offer expiration date have been fully converted into the BGH newly issued shares.
As at 31 December 2012, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the following shareholders owned more 
than 4% of the total outstanding shares of the Group. Other shareholders individually owned less than 4% of the

2. Basis of Preparation
General
These financial statements have been drawn up from the date of incorporation of BGH (14 October 201 1) to 31 December 2012. 
In accordance with the exemption permitted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the standalone income statement  
of BGH is not presented as part of these accounts. These consolidated financial statements are prepared as if the Group is a 
continuation of the pre-existing group of companies with the Bank as its ultimate parent. Comparative financial statements as 
at and for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are that of the group of companies consolidated with 
the Bank as its ultimate parent. Standalone profit of BGH for the year ended 31 December 2012 was GEL 22,476.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) effective for 2012 
reporting and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Bank and its Georgian-based subsidiaries are required to maintain their records and prepare their financial 
statements for regulatory purposes in Georgian Lari, while BGH and the Bank’s subsidiaries established outside 
of Georgia are in their respective local currencies. These consolidated financial statements are prepared under the 
historical cost convention except for the measurement at fair value of financial assets and liabilities held for trading, 
available-for-sale securities, investment properties and revalued property and equipment. No interest income or 
expense arose in relation to financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of Georgian Lari (“GEL ”), except per-share 
amounts and unless otherwise indicated. 
Going concern
The BGH’s Board of Directors has made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and 
is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is 
not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. 108 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted the following amended IFRS during the year:
Amendments to IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”
The Amendments were issued in October 2010 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. 
The amendment requires additional disclosure about financial assets that have been transferred to enable the users of 
the Group’s financial statements to evaluate the risk exposures relating to those assets. The amendment has no impact 
on the Group’s disclosures, financial position or performance.
Other amendments resulting from Improvements to the following standards did not have any impact on the accounting 
policies, financial position or performance of the Group:
 – IAS 12 Income Taxes (Amendment) – Deferred Taxes: Recovery of Underlying Assets
 – IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (Amendment) – Severe Hyperinflation and 
Removal of Fixed Dates for First-Time Adopter
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries, which are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights,  
or otherwise has power to exercise control over their operating and financial activities, are consolidated. Subsidiaries  
are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the 
date that control ceases. All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group 
companies are eliminated in full; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. When necessary, accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed to  
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured  
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification 
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. 112 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012
(Thousands of Georgian Lari)
3. Summary of Significant  
Accounting Policies (continued) 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the 
acquisition date fair value of the Group’s previously held 
equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value 
as at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, 
will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in 
profit or loss or as change to other comprehensive 
income. If the contingent consideration is classified  
as equity, it shall not be remeasured until it is finally  
settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess  
of the consideration transferred over the Group’s net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this 
consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets  
of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in 
profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units  
that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of 
the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and 
part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is 
included in the carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured 
based on the relative values of the operation disposed 
of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Investments in associates
Associates are entities in which the Group generally has 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or is otherwise 
able to exercise significant influence, but which it does not 
control or jointly control. Investments in associates are 
accounted for under the equity method and are initially 
recognised at cost, including goodwill. Subsequent 
changes in the carrying value reflect the post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. 
The Group’s share of its associates’ profits or losses is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement, and its 
share of movements in reserves is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. However, when the Group’s share 
of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in 
the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless the Group is obliged to make further payments to,  
or on behalf of, the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group  
and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the associates; unrealised losses  
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Financial assets
Initial recognition
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified  
as either financial assets at fair value through profit or  
loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, 
or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.  
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are 
measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments  
not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Group determines the classification 
of its financial assets upon initial recognition.
Date of recognition
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets 
are recognised on the trade date i.e. the date that the 
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular 
way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial 
assets that require delivery of assets within the period 
generally established by regulation or convention in 
the marketplace.
Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 113
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial 
assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market. They are not entered into 
with the intention of immediate or short-term resale and 
are not classified as trading securities or designated as 
investment securities available-for-sale. Such assets are 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. This calculation includes all fees paid or received 
between parties to the contract that are an integral part 
of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all  
other premiums and discounts. For investments carried  
at amortised cost, gains and losses are recognised in  
the consolidated income statement when the investments 
are impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement when the loans and receivables are 
derecognised or impaired, as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative 
financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or 
are not classified in any of the three preceding categories. 
After initial recognition available-for-sale financial assets are 
measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised 
in other comprehensive income until the investment is 
derecognised or until the investment is determined to be 
impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
reported in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the 
consolidated income statement. However, interest calculated 
using the effective interest method is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
Determination of fair value
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively 
traded in organised financial markets is determined by 
reference to quoted market bid prices for long positions 
and ask price for short positions at the close of business 
on the reporting date, without any deduction for 
transaction costs. 
For all other financial instruments where there is no  
active market, fair value is determined using valuation 
techniques. Valuation techniques include using recent 
arm’s length market transactions, which are determined 
not to be a result of a forced transaction, involuntary 
liquidation or distress sale, reference to the current market 
value of similar instrument, discounted cash flow analysis 
and other relevant valuation models.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the consolidated statement of 
financial position when there is a legally enforceable  
right to set off the recognised amounts and there is  
an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the  
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, 
amounts due from central banks, excluding obligatory 
reserves with central banks, and amounts due from credit 
institutions that mature within ninety days of the date of 
origination and are free from contractual encumbrances. 
Derivative financial instruments
In the normal course of business, the Group enters into 
various derivative financial instruments including forwards, 
swaps and options in the foreign exchange and capital 
markets. Such financial instruments are initially recognised 
in accordance with the policy for initial recognition of 
financial instruments and are subsequently measured at 
fair value. The fair values are estimated based on quoted 
market prices or pricing models that take into account the 
current market and contractual prices of the underlying 
instruments and other factors. Derivatives are carried as 
assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities 
when it is negative. Gains and losses resulting from these 
instruments are included in the consolidated income 
statement as gains less losses from interest rate swaps 
and gains less losses from foreign currencies translation 
differences, depending on the nature of the instrument.
Borrowings
Issued financial instruments or their components  
are classified as liabilities, where the substance of the 
contractual arrangement results in the group having  
an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial 
asset to the holder, or to satisfy the obligation other  
than by the exchange of a fixed amount of each or  
another financial asset for a fixed number of own equity 
instruments. Such instruments include amounts due  
to credit institutions and amounts due to customers 
(including promissory notes issued). These are initially 
recognised at the fair value of the consideration received 
less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains 
and losses are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement when the borrowings are derecognised as  
well as through the amortisation process.  114 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012
(Thousands of Georgian Lari)
3. Summary of Significant  
Accounting Policies (continued) 
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from 
the statement of financial position and the difference 
between the carrying amount of the liability and the 
consideration paid is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Subordinated debt
Subordinated debt represents long-term funds attracted 
by the Bank on the international financial markets or 
domestic market. The holders of subordinated debt  
would be subordinate to all other creditors to receive 
repayment on debt in case of the Bank liquidation. 
Subordinated debt is carried at amortised cost.
Leases
i. Finance – Group as lessor
The Group recognises finance lease receivables in the 
consolidated statement of financial position at a value equal 
to the net investment in the lease, starting from the date  
of commencement of the lease term. In calculating the 
present value of the minimum lease payments the discount 
factor used is the interest rate implicit in the lease. Initial 
direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the 
finance lease receivables. Lease payments received are 
apportioned between the finance income and the reduction 
of the outstanding lease receivable. Finance income is 
based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate  
of return on the net investment outstanding. 
ii. Operating – Group as lessee 
Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards  
of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Lease payments under  
an operating lease are recognised as expenses on  
a straight-line basis over the lease term and included  
into other administrative and operating expenses.
iii. Operating – Group as lessor
The Group presents assets subject to operating leases in 
the consolidated statement of financial position according 
to the nature of the asset. Lease income from operating 
leases is recognised in the consolidated income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term as other income. 
The aggregate cost of incentives provided to lessees is 
recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease 
term on a straight-line basis. Initial direct costs incurred 
specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset. 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there 
is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. 
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed  
to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence  
of impairment as a result of one or more events that has 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred 
‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact 
on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or 
the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the 
borrower or a group of borrowers is experiencing significant 
financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or 
principal payments, the probability that they will enter 
bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where 
observable data indicate that there is a measurable 
decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as 
changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults. 
Amounts due from credit institutions and loans to customers
For amounts due from credit institutions and loans to 
customers carried at amortised cost, the Group first 
assesses individually whether objective evidence of 
impairment exists individually for financial assets that are 
individually significant, or collectively for financial assets  
that are not individually significant. If the Group determines 
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an 
individually assessed financial asset, whether significant  
or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets 
with similar credit risks characteristics and collectively 
assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually 
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment  
loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included  
in a collective assessment of impairment. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has 
been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future 
expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred).  
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the  
use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. Interest 
income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying 
amount based on the original effective interest rate of the 
asset. Loans together with the associated allowance are 
written off when there is no realistic prospect of future 
recovery and all collateral has been realised or has been 
transferred to the Group. If, in a subsequent year, the amount 
of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases 
because of an event occurring after the impairment was 
recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is 
increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account.  
If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited 
to the consolidated income statement.
Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 115
The present value of the estimated future cash flows is 
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest 
rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate  
for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective 
interest rate. The calculation of the present value of the 
estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset 
reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less 
costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not 
foreclosure is probable. 
For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, 
financial assets are grouped on the basis of the Group’s 
internal credit grading system that considers credit risk 
characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical 
location, collateral type, past-due status and other 
relevant factors. 
Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that  
are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated  
on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with 
credit risk characteristics similar to those in the Group. 
Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of 
current observable data to reflect the effects of current 
conditions that did not affect the years on which the 
historical loss experience is based and to remove the 
effects of conditions in the historical period that do not 
exist currently. Estimates of changes in future cash flows 
reflect, and are directionally consistent with, changes  
in related observable data from year to year (such  
as changes in unemployment rates, property prices, 
commodity prices, payment status, or other factors that 
are indicative of incurred losses in the group or their 
magnitude). The methodology and assumptions used  
for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly  
to reduce any differences between loss estimates and 
actual loss experience. 
Write-off of loans to customers
All retail loans, except mortgages, are written off when 
overdue by more than 365 days. Retail mortgage loans 
are written off when overdue by more than 150 days.  
Write off of corporate loans overdue by more than  
150 days is subject to management discretion and is 
evaluated on a case by case basis, taking into account  
the current and expected positions of the loan/borrower.
Available-for-sale financial assets
For available-for-sale financial investments, the Group 
assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective 
evidence that an investment or a group of investments 
is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as 
available-for-sale, objective evidence would include a 
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
investment below its cost. Where there is evidence of 
impairment, the cumulative loss – measured as the 
difference between the acquisition cost and the current 
fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment 
previously recognised in the consolidated income 
statement – is reclassified from other comprehensive 
income to the consolidated income statement. Impairment 
losses on equity investments are not reversed through the 
consolidated income statement; increases in their fair 
value after impairment are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
In the case of debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, 
impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial 
assets carried at amortised cost. Future interest income is 
based on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using 
the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for 
the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The interest 
income is recorded in the consolidated income statement. 
If, in a subsequent year, the fair value of a debt instrument 
increases and the increase can be objectively related to an 
event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in 
the consolidated income statement, the impairment loss is 
reversed through the consolidated income statement.
Renegotiated loans
Renegotiated loans comprise carrying amount of financial 
assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired 
whose terms have been renegotiated.
Where possible, the Group seeks to restructure loans 
rather than to take possession of collateral. This may 
involve extending the payment arrangements and the 
agreement of new loan conditions. 
The accounting treatment of such restructuring is as follows: 
 – If the currency of the loan has been changed the old 
loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised. 
 – If the loan restructuring is not caused by the financial 
difficulties of the borrower the Group uses the same 
approach as for financial liabilities described below.
 – If the loan restructuring is due to the financial difficulties 
of the borrower and the loan is impaired after 
restructuring, the Group recognises the difference 
between the present value of the new cash flows 
discounted using the original effective interest rate  
and the carrying amount before restructuring in the 
provision charges for the period. In cases where the 
loan is not impaired after restructuring, the Group 
recalculates the effective interest rate.  116 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012
(Thousands of Georgian Lari)
3. Summary of Significant  
Accounting Policies (continued) 
Once the terms have been renegotiated, the loan is no 
longer considered past due. Management continuously 
reviews renegotiated loans to ensure that all criteria  
are met and that future payments are likely to occur.  
The loans continue to be subject to an individual or 
collective impairment assessment, calculated using  
the loan’s original or current effective interest rate. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised where:
 – the rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired;
 – the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset, or retained the right to receive 
cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an 
obligation to pay them in full without material delay to 
a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and
 – the Group either (a) has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of 
the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive  
cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred  
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset  
is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that 
takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset 
is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount  
of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the Group could be required to repay.
Where continuing involvement takes the form of a written 
and/or purchased option (including a cash-settled option 
or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent  
of the Group’s continuing involvement is the amount of the 
transferred asset that the Group may repurchase, except 
that in the case of a written put option (including a cash-
settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at 
fair value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement 
is limited to the lower of the fair value of the transferred 
asset and the option exercise price.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition  
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, 
and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Financial guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the Group gives 
financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit, 
guarantees and acceptances. Financial guarantees  
are initially recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements at fair value, in ‘Other liabilities’, being the 
premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition,  
the Group’s liability under each guarantee is measured  
at the higher of the amortised premium and the best 
estimate of expenditure required to settle any financial 
obligation arising as a result of the guarantee.
Any increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees 
is taken to the consolidated income statement. The 
premium received is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the life  
of the guarantee.
Taxation
The current income tax expense is calculated in 
accordance with the regulations in force in the respective 
territories that the Bank and its Subsidiaries operate.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in  
respect of temporary differences using the liability 
method. Deferred income taxes are provided for all 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases  
of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for 
financial reporting purposes, except where the deferred 
income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill  
or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit  
or loss. 
A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that  
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  
at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date. 
Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 117
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus and Cyprus also have various 
operating taxes that are assessed on the Group’s 
activities. These taxes are included as a component  
of other operating expenses. 
Investment properties
The Group holds certain properties as investments to  
earn rental income, generate capital appreciation or  
both. Investment properties are measured initially at  
cost, including subsequent costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, Investment properties is stated to fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair values of 
investment properties are included in the consolidated 
income statement as “Net gains from revaluation of 
investment properties”.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment, except for buildings, is carried at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing 
part of equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition 
criteria are met. Buildings are measured at fair value less 
depreciation and impairment charged subsequent to the 
date of the revaluation.
The carrying values of property and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may  
not be recoverable. 
Following initial recognition at cost, buildings are carried  
at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date  
of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment 
losses. Valuations are performed frequently enough to 
ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not 
differ materially from its carrying amount.
Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date 
is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the 
asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued 
amount of the asset. Any revaluation surplus is credited  
to the revaluation reserve for property and equipment 
included in other comprehensive income, except to the 
extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same 
asset previously recognised in the consolidated income 
statement, in which case the increase is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. A revaluation deficit is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement, except 
that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the 
same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the 
revaluation reserve for property and equipment.
An annual transfer from the revaluation reserve for  
property and equipment to retained earnings is made  
for the difference between depreciation based on the 
revalued carrying amount of the assets and depreciation 
based on the assets original cost. Additionally, accumulated 
depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against 
the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount 
is restated to the devalued amount of the asset. Upon 
disposal, any revaluation reserve relating to the particular 
asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Depreciation of an asset, including assets under 
construction, commences from the date the asset is  
ready and available for use. Depreciation is calculated  
on a straight-line basis over the following estimated  
useful lives:
Years
Buildings Up to 100
Furniture and fixtures 10
Computers and office equipment 5
Motor vehicles 5
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are 
reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each financial 
year-end. 
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the life of the 
related leased asset. 
Costs related to repairs and renewals are charged when 
incurred and included in other operating expenses, unless 
they qualify for capitalisation.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration 
transferred over the Group’s net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. Goodwill on an acquisition of a 
subsidiary is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on an 
acquisition of an associate is included in the investments  
in associates. Following initial recognition, goodwill is 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may be impaired.  118 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued
3. Summary of Significant  
Accounting Policies (continued) 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units,  
or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective 
of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are 
assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit  
or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated:
 – represents the lowest level within the Group at which the 
goodwill is monitored for internal management 
purposes; and
 – is not larger than a segment as defined in IFRS 8 
“Operating Segments”.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit (group of 
cash-generating units), to which the goodwill relates. 
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
(group of cash-generating units) is less than the carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment 
losses cannot be reversed in future periods. 
Intangible assets
The Group’s intangible assets include computer software 
and licences. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on  
initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets 
acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the  
date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of 
intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic lives of 4 to 10 years and assessed for impairment 
whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may 
be impaired. Amortisation periods and methods for intangible 
assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at each 
financial year-end. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortised, but tested for impairment annually either 
individually or at the cash-generating unit level.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software 
programs are recorded as an expense as incurred. 
Software development costs (relating to the design  
and testing of new or substantially improved software)  
are recognised as intangible assets only when the Group 
can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing 
the software so that it will be available for use or sale,  
its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the 
asset, how the asset will generate future economic 
benefits, the availability of resources to complete and  
the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during  
the development. Other software development costs  
are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Insurance and reinsurance receivables
Insurance and reinsurance receivables are recognised 
based upon insurance policy terms and measured at  
cost. The carrying value of insurance and reinsurance 
receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events  
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable, with any impairment loss recorded  
in the consolidated statement of income. 
Reinsurance receivables primarily include balances  
due from both insurance and reinsurance companies  
for ceded insurance liabilities. Premiums on reinsurance 
assumed are recognised as revenue in the same manner 
as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct 
business, taking into account the product classification  
of the reinsured business. Amounts due to reinsurers are 
estimated in a manner consistent with the associated 
reinsured policies and in accordance with the reinsurance 
contract. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are 
presented on a gross basis. 
An impairment review is performed on all reinsurance 
assets when an indication of impairment occurs. 
Reinsurance receivables are impaired only if there is 
objective evidence that the Group may not receive all 
amounts due to it under the terms of the contract that  
this can be measured reliably. 
Insurance liabilities
General insurance liabilities
General insurance contract liabilities are based on the 
estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled 
at the reporting date, whether reported or not, together  
with related claims handling costs and reduction for the 
expected value of salvage and other recoveries. Significant 
delays can be experienced in the notification and 
settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, 
particularly in respect of liability business, environmental 
and pollution exposures – therefore the ultimate cost of 
which cannot be known with certainty at the reporting date. 
Provision for unearned premiums
The proportion of written premiums, gross of commission 
payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent 
periods is deferred as unearned premium. The change  
in the provision for unearned premium is taken to the 
consolidated income statement in order that revenue is 
recognised over the period of risk or, for annuities, the 
amount of expected future benefit payments.  Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 119
Liability adequacy test
At each reporting date, a liability adequacy test is 
performed, to ensure the adequacy of unearned premiums 
net of related deferred acquisition costs. In performing the 
test, current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, 
claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well 
as investment income from assets backing such liabilities, 
are used. Any inadequacy is immediately charged to the 
consolidated income statement by establishing an 
unexpired risk provision.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate of the amount of obligation can 
be made.
Provisions for the risk of incurring losses on off-balance 
sheet commitments is estimated regularly based  
on the past history of actual losses incurred on  
these commitments.
Retirement and other employee benefit obligations
The Group provides management and employees of  
the Group with private pension plans. These are defined 
contribution pension plans covering substantially all full-time 
employees of the Group. The Group collects contributions 
from its employees. When an employee reaches the 
pension age, aggregated contributions, plus any earnings 
earned on the employee’s behalf are paid to the employee 
according to the schedule agreed with the employee. 
Aggregated amounts are distributed during the period 
when the employee will receive accumulated contributions. 
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group 
receive share-based remuneration, whereby employees 
render services as consideration for the equity instruments 
(“equity settled transactions”).
Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees 
is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on 
which they are granted. 
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised together 
with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, 
ending on the date when the relevant employee is fully 
entitled to the award (“the vesting date”). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The consolidated income statement  
charge or credit for the period represents the movement  
in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning  
and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for the awards that do not 
ultimately vest except for the awards where vesting is 
conditional upon market conditions (a condition linked  
to the price of the BGH’s shares) which are treated as 
vesting irrespective whether the market condition is 
satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions  
are satisfied. 
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modified. An additional expense is recognised 
for any modification which increases the total fair value of 
the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of 
the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as 
if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense 
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. 
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled 
award, and designated as the replacement award on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and the new awards 
are treated as if they were a modification of the original 
award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
Share capital
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares, other than 
on a business combination, are shown as a deduction 
from the proceeds in equity. Any excess of the fair value  
of consideration received over the par value of shares 
issued is recognised as additional paid-in capital. 
Treasury shares
Where BGH or its subsidiaries purchase BGH’s shares, the 
consideration paid, including any attributable transaction 
costs, net of income taxes, is deducted from total equity  
as treasury shares until they are cancelled or reissued. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued,  
any consideration received is included in equity. Treasury 
shares are stated at par value, with adjustment of  
premiums against additional paid-in capital.
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted  
from equity at the reporting date only if they are declared 
before or on the reporting date. Dividends are disclosed 
when they are proposed before the reporting date or 
proposed or declared after the reporting date but before 
the consolidated financial statements are authorised  
for issue.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position but are disclosed unless  
the possibility of any outflow in settlement is remote.  
A contingent asset is not recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position but disclosed when an 
inflow of economic benefits is probable.  120 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued
3. Summary of Significant  
Accounting Policies (continued) 
Income and expense recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific 
recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and 
expense is recognised:
Interest and similar income and expense
For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost and 
interest bearing securities classified as trading or available-
for-sale, interest income or expense is recorded at the 
effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash payments or receipts through the 
expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, 
where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial 
asset or financial liability. The calculation takes into account 
all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, 
prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental 
costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are 
an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future 
credit losses. The carrying amount of the financial asset or 
financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates 
of payments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is 
calculated based on the original effective interest rate and  
the change in carrying amount is recorded as interest 
income or expense. 
Once the recorded value of a financial asset or a  
group of similar financial assets has been reduced due  
to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be 
recognised using the original effective interest rate applied 
to the new carrying amount. 
Fee and commission income
The Group earns fee and commission income from a 
diverse range of services it provides to its customers. Fee 
income can be divided into the following two categories:
Fee income earned from services that are provided over  
a certain period of time
Fees earned for the provision of services over a period 
of time are accrued over that period. These fees include 
commission incomes and asset management, custody and 
other management and advisory fees. Loan commitment 
fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down and other 
credit related fees are deferred (together with any incremental 
costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the effective 
interest rate on the loan. 
Fee income from providing transaction services
Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the 
negotiation of a transaction for a third party – such as 
the arrangement of the acquisition of shares or other 
securities or the purchase or sale of businesses – are 
recognised on completion of the underlying transaction. 
Fees or components of fees that are linked to a certain 
performance are recognised after fulfilling the 
corresponding criteria.
Dividend income
Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive 
the payment is established.
Insurance premium income
For non-life insurance business, premiums written 
are recognised at policy inception and earned on a pro 
rata basis over the term of the related policy coverage. 
Estimates of premiums written as at the reporting date 
but not yet received, are assessed based on estimates 
from underwriting or past experience and are included 
in premiums earned.
Insurance claims 
General insurance claims incurred include all claim 
losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, 
including the related handling costs and reduction for the 
value of salvage and other recoveries and any adjustments 
to claims outstanding from previous years. 
Healthcare revenue
Healthcare revenue is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured on an accruals 
basis. When services are provided in exchange for dissimilar 
goods or services, the revenue is measured at the fair value 
of the goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of 
any cash or cash equivalent transferred. When the fair value 
of the goods or services received cannot be measured 
reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
goods of services given up, adjusted by the amount of  
any cash or cash equivalents transferred.
Revenue from sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods comprises revenue from 
sale of a completed property and other finished goods.
Revenue from sale of a completed property is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
real estate have been transferred to the buyer. If, however, 
the legal terms of the contract are such that the construction 
represents the continuous transfer of work in progress to 
the purchaser, the percentage of completion method of 
revenue recognition is applied and revenue is recognised 
as work progresses.
Revenue from the sale of other finished goods is 
recognised when the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, 
usually on delivery of the goods. Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 121
Continuous transfer of work in progress is applied when: (a) the buyer controls the work in progress, typically when 
the land on which the development is taking place is owned by the final customer and (b) all significant risks and 
rewards of ownership of the work in progress in its present state are transferred to the buyer as construction 
progresses, typically when buyer cannot put the incomplete property back to the Group. In such situations, the 
percentage of work completed is measured based on the costs incurred up until the end of the reporting period  
as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred.
Reclassifications
Due to the increased material size of healthcare business and other revenues from sale of goods, separate captions 
have been added to the income statement with a summary of these revenues and respective direct costs. The following 
reclassifications have been made to the year ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 consolidated income 
statements to conform with the year ended 31 December 2012 presentational requirements:

3. Summary of Significant  
Accounting Policies (continued) 
Functional, reporting currencies and foreign 
currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Georgian Lari, which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
BGH’s functional currency is British Pound Sterling. The 
Bank’s functional currency is US Dollar. Each entity in the 
Group determines its own functional currency and items 
included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency. Transactions in 
foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional 
currency, converted at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into  
the functional currency at the functional currency’s rate  
of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Gains and  
losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency 
transactions are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement as gains less losses from foreign currencies – 
translation differences. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates  
of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using  
the exchange rates at the date when the fair value  
was determined.
Differences between the contractual exchange rate of a 
certain transaction and the NBG exchange rate on the 
date of the transaction are included in gains less losses 
from foreign currencies (dealing). The official NBG exchange 
rates at 31 December 2012, 31 December 2011 and  
31 December 2010 were:
Lari to
 GBP

31 December 
2010
2.7393 1.7728 2.3500 2.2272 5.9093
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of the 
entities whose functional currency is different from the 
presentation currency of the Group are translated into 
Georgian Lari at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting 
date and, their income statements are translated at the 
weighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange 
differences arising on the translation are taken to other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a subsidiary or an 
associate whose functional currency is different from the 
presentation currency of the Group, the deferred cumulative 
amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating 
to that particular entity is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operations and translated at closing rate.
Hyperinflation accounting
With effect from 1 January 2011, the Belarusian  
economy has been considered to be hyperinflationary in 
accordance with the criteria in IAS 29 “Financial Reporting 
in Hyperinflationary Economies” (“IAS 29”). The standard 
requires that the financial statements prepared in the 
currency of a hyperinflationary economy be stated in 
terms of the measuring unit current at the reporting date.
In applying IAS 29, the Bank’s subsidiaries in Belarus,  
JSC Belarusky Narodny Bank (“BNB”) and BNB Leasing, 
LLC, have used conversion factors derived from the 
Belarusian consumer price index (“CPI”), published by the 
State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Belarus. 
The CPIs for the six year period and respective conversion 
factors after Belarus previously ceased to be considered 
hyperinflationary on 1 January 2006 are as follows:
Year Index, %
Conversion 
Factors
2006 106.6 390.2
2007 112.1 348.5
2008 113.3 307.2
2009 110.1 279.6
2010 109.9 254.1
2011 208.7 121.8
2012 121.8 100.0
All income and expenses, profits and losses are recalculated 
by applying the relevant adjustment factors. Monetary assets 
and liabilities are not recalculated because they are already 
expressed in terms of the monetary unit current as at the 
reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities (items 
which are not already expressed in terms of the monetary 
unit current as at the reporting date) are recalculated by 
applying the relevant index. The effect of inflation on BNB’s 
net non-monetary position is included in the income 
statement in net non-operating expenses.
Standards and interpretations that are issued but 
not yet effective
Up to the date of approval of the consolidated financial 
statements, certain new standards, interpretations and 
amendments to existing standards have been published 
that are not yet effective for the current reporting period 
and which the Group has not early adopted, as follows: Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 123
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
IFRS 9, as issued, reflects the first phase of the IASB’s 
work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to the 
classification and measurement of financial assets and 
financial liabilities as defined in IAS 39. The standard was 
initially effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013, but Amendments to IFRS 9 mandatory 
Effective Date of IFRS 9 and Transition Disclosures, issued 
in December 2011, moved the mandatory effective date to 
1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will 
address hedge accounting and impairment of financial 
assets. The Group will quantify the effect of the adoption 
of the first phase of IFRS 9 in conjunction with the other 
phases, at the time the other phases are issued, to 
present a comprehensive picture. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies  
to all entities including special purpose entities. The 
changes introduced by IFRS 10 will require management 
to exercise significant judgment to determine which 
entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be 
consolidated by a parent, compared with the requirements 
that were in IAS 27. In addition IFRS 10 introduces specific 
application guidance for agency relationships. IFRS 10 
replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements that addresses the accounting for 
consolidated financial statements. It also includes the 
issues raised in SIC-12 Consolidation — Special Purpose 
Entities. It is effective for annual periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2014. Earlier application is permitted. 
The Group is currently evaluating the possible effect  
of the adoption of IFRS 10 on its financial position  
and performance.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 11 removes the option to account for jointly 
controlled entities (JCEs) using proportionate 
consolidation. Instead, JCEs that meet the definition  
of a joint venture must be accounted for using the  
equity method. IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 Interests 
in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly Controlled Entities—
Non-monetary Contributions by Venturers and is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 
Earlier application is permitted. The Group expects that 
adoption of IFRS 11 will have no effect on its financial 
position and performance.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 12 is effective for annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2014. IFRS 12 includes all of the 
disclosures that were previously in IAS 27 related to 
consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the 
disclosures that were previously included in IAS 31 and 
IAS 28. These disclosures relate to an entity’s interests  
in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and 
structured entities. A number of new disclosures are  
also required. In particular, the Group will need to  
disclose more information about the consolidated  
and unconsolidated structured entities with which  
it is involved or which it has sponsored. However,  
the standard will have no impact on Group’s financial 
position or performance. 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS 
for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change 
when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather 
provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS 
when fair value is required or permitted. IFRS 13 is effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
Earlier application is permitted. The adoption of the IFRS 13 
may have effect on the measurement of the Group’s assets 
and liabilities accounted for at fair value. The Group is 
currently evaluating the possible effect of the adoption of 
IFRS 13 on its financial position and performance.
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (as revised in 2011)
As a consequence of the new IFRS 10 and IFRS 12, what 
remains of IAS 27 is limited to accounting for subsidiaries, 
jointly controlled entities, and associates in separate 
financial statements. The amendment is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (as 
revised in 2011)
As a consequence of the new IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, IAS 
28 has been renamed IAS 28 Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures, and describes the application of the 
equity method to investments in joint ventures in addition 
to associates. The amendment is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 124 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

3. Summary of Significant  
Accounting Policies (continued) 
Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits
The IASB has published amendments to IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits, effective for annual periods beginning on or  
after 1 January 2013, which involve major changes to the 
accounting for employee benefits, including the removal  
of the option for deferred recognition of changes in 
pension plan assets and liabilities (known as the “corridor 
approach”). In addition, these amendments will limit the 
changes in the net pension asset (liability) recognised in 
profit or loss to net interest income (expense) and service 
costs. The Group expects that these amendments will 
have no impact on the Group’s financial position.
Amendments to IAS 1 Changes to the Presentation of 
Other Comprehensive Income
The amendments to IAS 1 change the grouping of items 
presented in other comprehensive income. Items that could 
be reclassified (or recycled) to profit or loss at a future point 
in time (for example, net losses or gains on available-for-
sale financial assets) would be presented separately from 
items that will never be reclassified (for example, revaluation 
of buildings). The amendment affects presentation only  
and has no impact on the Group’s financial position or 
performance. The amendment is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures – Offsetting Financial 
assets and Financial Liabilities 
These amendments require an entity to disclose information 
about rights to set-off and related arrangements (e.g. 
collateral agreements). The disclosures would provide  
users with information that is useful in evaluating the effect 
of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. 
The new disclosures are required for all recognised financial 
instruments that are set off in accordance with IAS 32 
Financial Instruments: Presentation. The disclosures also 
apply to recognised financial instruments that are subject  
to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar 
agreements, irrespective of whether they are set off in 
accordance with IAS 32. These amendments will not 
impact the Group’s financial position or performance  
and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013.
Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities
These amendments clarify the meaning of “currently has a 
legally enforceable right to set-off”. It will be necessary to 
assess the impact on the Group by reviewing settlement 
procedures and legal documentation to ensure that offsetting 
is still possible in cases where it has been achieved in the 
past. In certain cases, offsetting may no longer be achieved. 
In other cases, contracts may have to be renegotiated.  
The requirement that the right of set-off be available for all 
counterparties to the netting agreement may prove to be a 
challenge for contracts where only one party has the right  
to offset in the event of default.
The amendments also clarify the application of the IAS 32 
offsetting criteria to settlement systems (such as central 
clearing house systems) which apply gross settlement 
mechanisms that are not simultaneous. While many 
settlement systems are expected to meet the new criteria, 
some may not. As the impact of the adoption depends 
on the Group’s examination of the operational procedures 
applied by the central clearing houses and settlement 
systems it deals with to determine if they meet the new 
criteria, it is not practical to quantify the effects now,  
but the Group will be evaluating the impact between  
now and the effective date. 
These amendments will become effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
Amendment to IFRS 1 – Government loans
These amendments require first-time adopters to apply 
the requirements of IAS 20 Accounting for Government 
Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, 
prospectively to government loans existing at the date  
of transition to IFRS. The amendment will have no impact  
on the Group. Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 125
Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Improvements to IFRS
The amendments are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. They will not have 
an impact on the Group.
 – IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards: This improvement clarifies that  
an entity that stopped applying IFRS in the past and 
chooses, or is required, to apply IFRS, has the option 
to re-apply IFRS 1. If IFRS 1 is not re-applied, an entity 
must retrospectively restate its financial statements as 
if it had never stopped applying IFRS.
 – IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: This 
improvement clarifies the difference between voluntary 
additional comparative information and the minimum 
required comparative information. Generally, the 
minimum required comparative information is the 
previous period.
 – IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment: This 
improvement clarifies that major spare parts and 
servicing equipment that meet the definition of 
property; plant and equipment are not inventory.
 – IAS 32 Financial Instruments, Presentation: This 
improvement clarifies that income taxes arising from 
distributions to equity holders are accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
 – IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting: The amendment 
aligns the disclosure requirements for total segment 
assets with total segment liabilities in interim financial 
statements. This clarification also ensures that interim 
disclosures are aligned with annual disclosures. 
4. Significant Accounting Judgements 
and Estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies, the Board of Directors and management use  
their judgement and make estimates in determining the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements. The most significant judgements and 
estimates are as follows: 
Fair value of financial instruments
Where the fair values of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the consolidated statement of 
financial position cannot be derived from active markets, 
they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques 
that include the use of mathematical models. The input  
to these models is taken from observable markets where 
possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of 
judgment is required in establishing fair values.
Measurement of fair value of investment properties and 
property and equipment 
The fair value of investment properties and buildings 
included in property and equipment is determined by 
independent professionally qualified appraisers. Fair  
value is determined using a combination of the internal 
capitalisation method (also known as discounted future 
cash flow method) and the sales comparison method. 
The estimates described above are subject to change 
as new transaction data and market evidence 
become available.
Allowance for impairment of loans and receivables and 
finance lease receivables 
The Group regularly reviews its loans and receivables  
and finance lease receivables to assess impairment. The 
Group uses its judgement to estimate the amount of any 
impairment loss in cases where a borrower is in financial 
difficulties and there are few available sources of historical 
data relating to similar borrowers. Similarly, the Group 
estimates changes in future cash flows based on the 
observable data indicating that there has been an adverse 
change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or 
national or local economic conditions that correlate with 
defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates 
based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk 
characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar 
to those in the group of loans and receivables. The Group 
uses its judgement to adjust observable data for a group of 
loans or receivables to reflect current circumstances. 
The Group considers the fair value of collateral when 
estimating the amount of impairment loss for collateralised 
loans and receivables and finance lease receivables. 
Management monitors market value of collateral on a 
regular basis. Management uses its experienced judgement 
or independent opinion to adjust the fair value to reflect 
current circumstances. The amount and type of collateral 
required depends on the assessment of credit risk of  
the counterparty.
In order to exclude post 2008 Georgia-Russia war  
and global financial crisis extraordinary trends from  
the assessment of collective impairment of loans,  
the Bank amended its approach in 2012. Namely,  
the historical loss rates that are applied for collective 
impairment are now calculated based on three-year 
history of net losses (including reversals) as opposed  
to five-seven-year history of net losses under previous 
approach. The impact of this change on profit from 
continuing operations before income tax expense  
for the year ended 31 December 2012 is GEL 20.1 million. 126 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

5. Business Combinations 
Acquisitions in 2012
JSC Insurance Company Imedi L International
On 24 April 2012 JSC Insurance Company Aldagi BCI (“Acquirer”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, fully 
acquired Meta LLC, which owned 51% of JSC Insurance Company Imedi L International (“Acquiree”), an insurance 
company operating in Georgia, thus acquiring control over the Acquiree. On 30 April 2012 the Acquirer purchased a 
34% stake in the Acquiree from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). On 21 May 2012  
the Acquirer purchased 89.58% shares in Imedi L Holding LLC, which owned 9.6% of the Acquiree’s shares, thus 
bringing the total ownership stake in the Acquiree to 94.6%. On 24 July 2012 the remaining stake of the Acquiree were 
purchased from LTD Saimedo. On 16 November 2012 the Acquiree was merged with the Acquirer. The fair values of 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, and goodwill arising from the Acquiree as at the date  
of acquisition were:

Net cash outflow 9,008
1  The fair value of the insurance premium receivables amounted to GEL 19,438. The gross amount of receivables is GEL 24,825. GEL 5,387 of the 
premium receivables has been impaired. 
2  Consideration comprised of GEL 26,879 pre-existing loan to JSC Insurance Company Imedi L International less GEL 28 pre-existing deposit and 
cash payments of GEL 9,625.
The Group decided to increase their presence and investment in Georgia’s underpenetrated and growing insurance and 
healthcare sector, by acquiring the country’s third largest insurance company, thus securing a leading position in the 
sector. Management considers that the deal will have a positive impact on the value of the Group. 
Since the acquisition date, the Group recorded GEL 306,038 and GEL 106,522 of revenue and profit, respectively. In the 
same period, GEL 9,263 and GEL 2,806 of revenue and profit, respectively comes from the Acquiree. If the combination 
had taken place at the beginning of the period, the Group would have recorded GEL 335,052 and GEL 103,460 of 
revenue and profit respectively. 
The primary factor that contributed to the cost of the business combination that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
was the positive synergy brought into the Group’s operations.  Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Applicable taxes in Georgia and Belarus include corporate income tax (profit tax), individuals’ withholding taxes, 
property tax and value added tax, among others. However, regulations are often unclear or non-existent and few  
precedents have been established. This creates tax risks in Georgia and Belarus, substantially more significant than  
typically found in countries with more developed tax systems. Management believes that the Group is in substantial  
compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations. However, the risk remains that relevant authorities could take  
differing positions with regard to interpretative issues. 146 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

(2011: up to 9.65%, 2010: up to 9.00%). During the year ended 2012 the Group paid up to 11.65% on US$  
subordinated debt (2011, 2010: up to 11.65%).
Some long-term borrowings from international credit institutions are received upon certain conditions (the “Lender 
Covenants”) that the Group maintains different limits for capital adequacy, liquidity, currency positions, credit exposures, 
leverage and others. At 31 December 2012, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 the Group complied with all the 
Lender Covenants of the borrowings from international credit institutions.

and International Financial Corporation (“IFC”), comprising US$ 26,044 thousand (GEL 43,441) each, had an equity 
conversion feature valid for 5 years from the loan granting date (the “Convertibility Period”). On 24 February 2012 EBRD

On 24 February 2012 EBRD and IFC utilised the convertibility feature and converted US$ 49,903 thousand of their  
loans to the Bank into the Bank’s shares (Note 18). Total number of ordinary shares issued under this transaction  
comprised 3,635,006.
On 28 February 2012 the Group completed the Tender Offer under which 35,909,383 of the Bank’s shares then 
outstanding (or 98.35 per cent) were converted into 35,909,383 shares of BGH (Note 1).
Share capital of the Group was paid by the shareholders in Georgian Lari and they were entitled to dividends in 
Georgian Lari before the Tender Offer and are entitled to dividends in British Pound Sterling after the Tender Offer.
Capital Reduction
Following the Admission (Note 1), the Directors of BGH undertook a reduction of capital in order to create distributable 
reserves for BGH. The original difference between the nominal value of BGH’s shares and the fair value of the Bank’s 
shares was credited to the merger reserve created in connection with the Tender Offer. It was the intention of BGH’s 
Directors that the maximum amount of distributable reserves should be created and therefore any merger reserve 
created in connection with the Tender Offer was capitalised into Class A shares. The Class A shares were allotted pro 
rata to holders of BGH shares. BGH Directors implemented a Court approved reduction of capital which reduced the 
original (Tender Offer) nominal value of BGH shares and cancelled all the Class A shares in issue resulting from the 
capitalisation of the merger reserve.
BGH shares had an original (Tender Offer) nominal value of GBP 6.00 per share. Following the reduction of capital  
the nominal value of BGH shares was reduced to GBP 0.01. Reduction of the capital created a new reserve on the 
statement of financial position of BGH (comprising the reduction of the original nominal value from GBP 6.00 to  
GBP 0.01 per share plus aggregate nominal amount of all of the Class A shares which were cancelled). The reduction  
of capital is a legal and accounting adjustment and did not, of itself, have any direct impact on the market value  
of BGH shares.
As a result of the capital reduction in BGH, the Group’s total additional paid-in capital outstanding at the time became 
distributable to the shareholders and was fully reclassified to retained earnings.
Treasury shares
The number of treasury shares held by the Group as at 31 December 2012 comprised 2,576,747 (31 December  
2011: 3,146,140, 31 December 2010: 1,509,086). Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Treasury shares of GEL 69 as at 31 December 2012 comprise the Group’s shares owned by the Group (31 December  
2011: GEL 1,208, 31 December 2010: GEL 1,072). Purchases and sales of treasury shares were conducted by BGH’s 
subsidiaries in the open market – the Bank, JSC BG Capital, BG Trading LLC, Galt and Taggart Holdings Limited LLC,  
GC Holdings LLC and JSC Insurance Company Aldagi BCI. 
During the year ended 31 December 2011, an increase in share capital of GEL 1,500 was made for future share based 
compensation purposes. As a result, treasury shares amounting to GEL 1,938 as at 31 December 2011 (2010: GEL 438)  
were kept by the Group’s custodian – Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited, acting as the trustee of the Group. Starting 
20 February 2012, all shares of the Bank kept by Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited were converted into the Group’s shares.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, 32,687 ordinary shares of GEL 33 par value and additional paid-in capital  
of GEL 620 have been vested as compensation to top management (2010: 38,789 ordinary shares of GEL 39 par value 
and additional paid-in capital of GEL 523). 
Dividends
On 7 June 2012, the Directors of Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC declared an interim dividend for 2012 of Georgian  
Lari 0.7 per share. The currency conversion date was set at 25 June 2012, with the official GEL–GBP exchange rate  
of 2.5626, resulting in a GBP denominated interim dividend of 0.2732 per share. Payment of the total GEL 23,618 
interim dividends was received by shareholders on 2 July 2012.
On 15 June 2011, the annual general meeting of shareholders of JSC Bank of Georgia declared 2011 dividends 
comprising Georgian Lari 0.3 per share, based on 2010 audited financial results. The declaration is effective from  
1 July 2011. Payment of the total GEL 9,169 dividends was received by shareholders on 18 July 2011.

shares of the Bank (Note 18). Their conversion decreased earnings per share from continuing operations. However, 
it also reduced the Group’s interest expense on these debt instruments and increased the total profit attributable to 
ordinary shareholders of the Group.

Executives’ Equity Compensation Plan
Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited (the “Trustee”) acts as the trustee of the Group’s Executives’ Equity Compensation 
Plan (“EECP”). 
In February 2010 the Bank’s Supervisory Board resolved to recommend to the Trustee to award 432,495 Bank’s 
ordinary shares in the form of restricted GDRs to the Group’s 19 executives pursuant to the EECP in respect of the  
year ended 31 December 2009. The awards are subject to three-year vesting, with a continuous employment being 
the only vesting condition. The Group considers 18 February 2010 as the grant date. The Group estimates that the 
fair value of the shares awarded on 18 February 2010 was Georgian Lari 17.29 per share.
Additionally, in March 2010 the Deputies of the CEO of the Bank and in May 2010 CEO of the Bank signed three-year fixed 
contingent share-based compensation agreements with the Bank for the total of 915,000 GDRs. The total amount of GDRs 
fixed to each executive will be awarded in three equal instalments during the 3 consecutive years starting January 2011, of 
which each award will be subject to a four-year vesting period. The Group considers 29 March 2010 as the grant date for the 
awards of the Deputies and 25 May 2010 as the grant date for the award of the CEO. The Group estimates that the fair value 
of the shares on 29 March 2010 was Georgian Lari 18.48 per share and the fair value of shares awarded on 25 May 2010

In March 2012 the Bank’s Supervisory Board resolved to award 220,000 ordinary shares of BGH to the members  
of the Management Board and 262,443 ordinary shares of BGH to the Group’s 28 executives. Shares awarded to  
the Management Board are subject to two-year vesting, while shares awarded to the other 24 executives are subject  
to three-year vesting, with continuous employment being the only vesting condition for both awards. The Group 
considers 6 March 2012 as the grant date. The Group estimates that the fair value of the shares awarded on  
6 March 2012 was Georgian Lari 26.07 per share.
The Bank grants share compensation to its mid-management employees too. In March 2012, in February 2011 and  
in February 2010, the Supervisory Board of the Bank resolved to award 42,600, 20,485 and nil ordinary shares to 
its mid-management employees, respectively. All these awards are subject to three-year vesting, with a continuous 
employment being the only vesting condition for all awards. The Group considers 6 March 2012, 21 February 2011  
and 18 February 2010 as the grant dates of these awards, respectively. The Group estimates that the fair values of  
the shares awarded on 6 March 2012, 21 February 2011 and 18 February 2010 were Georgian Lari 26.07, 35.86  
and 17.29 per share, respectively.
Summary 
Fair value of the shares granted at the measurement date is determined based on available market quotations.

27. Risk Management
Introduction
Risk is inherent in the Group’s activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement  
and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls. This process of risk management is critical to the Group’s 
continuing profitability and each individual within the Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or  
her responsibilities. The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, the latter being subdivided into 
trading and non-trading risks. It is also subject to operational risks. 
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology 
and industry. They are monitored through the Group’s strategic planning process.
Risk management structure
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is an independent body and is directly monitored by the Board. It has the overall responsibility for 
developing and implementation of overall risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies, principles, frameworks, policies 
and limits. The Audit Committee is responsible for the fundamental risk issues and manages and monitors relevant risk 
decisions covering, but not limited to: macroeconomic and environmental risks, general control environment, manual and 
application controls, risks of intentionally or unintentional misstatements, risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets, 
information security, anti-money laundering, information technology risks, etc.
Management Board
The Management Board has the responsibility to monitor and manage entire risk process within the Group, on a regular 
basis, by assigning tasks, creating different executive committees, designing and setting up risk management policies 
and procedures as well as respective guidelines and controlling their implementation and performance of relevant 
departments and committees.
Bank Asset and Liability Management Committee 
The Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is the core risk management body. It is responsible 
for managing the Bank’s assets and liabilities, all risks associated with them as well as overall financial structure of the 
Group. It is also primarily responsible for the funding, capital adequacy risk, liquidity risks and market risks of the Bank.
Internal Audit
Risk management processes throughout the Group are audited annually by the internal audit function that examines 
both the adequacy of the procedures and the Group’s compliance with the procedures. Internal Audit discusses the 
results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Audit Committee.
Risk measurement and reporting systems
The Group’s risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal 
circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting 
models. The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic 
environment. The Group runs three different basic scenarios, of which one is Base Case (forecast under normal 
business conditions) and the other two are Troubled and Distressed Scenarios, which are worse and the worst case 
scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group. These limits reflect 
the business strategy and market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, 
with additional emphasis on selected industries. In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing 
capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify  
early risks. This information is presented and explained to the Management Board, and the head of each business 
division. The reports include aggregate credit exposures and their limits, exceptions to those limits, liquidity ratios  
and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and changes to the risk profile. Senior management assesses  
the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly basis. The Management Board receives a 
comprehensive Credit Risk report and ALCO report once a month. These reports are designed to provide all the 
necessary information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group. 
For all levels throughout the Group, specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed in order to ensure that 
all business divisions have access to extensive, relevant and up-to-date information.
A daily briefing is given to the Management Board and all other relevant employees of the Group on the utilisation of 
market limits, proprietary investments and liquidity, plus any other risk developments. 160 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012

27. Risk Management (continued)
Risk mitigation
As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures 
resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity risks, credit risks, and exposures arising from 
forecast transactions. While these are intended for hedging, these do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
The Group actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks (see below for more detail).
Excessive risk concentration
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the 
same geographic region, or these counterparties represent related parties to each other, or have similar economic 
features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, 
political or other conditions. Concentrations also involve combined, aggregate exposures of large and significant credits 
compared to the total outstanding balance of the respective financial instrument. Concentrations indicate the relative 
sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographical location.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to 
focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio of both, financial assets as well as financial liabilities. Identified concentrations 
of credit risks or liquidity/repayment risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties failed to discharge 
their contractual obligations. The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is 
willing to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical, industry, product and currency concentrations, and 
by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits. 
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the 
creditworthiness of counterparties, including regular collateral revisions. Counterparty limits are established by the use of  
a credit risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is 
exposed and take corrective action.
Derivative financial instruments
Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as 
recorded in the statement of the financial position.
Credit-related commitments risks
The Group makes available to its customers guarantees which may require that the Group make payments on their 
behalf. Such payments are collected from customers based on the terms of the letter of credit. They expose the Group 
to similar risks to loans and these are mitigated by the same control processes and policies.

Past due loans to customers, analysed by age below, include those that are past due by not more than a few days. 
These loans are not impaired.
It is the Group’s policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio. This facilitates focused 
management of the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. The rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for  
the measurement of counterparty risk. All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in 
accordance with the Group’s rating policy. Attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
The credit risk assessment policy for non-past due and individually non-impaired financial assets has been determined 
by the Group as follows:
 – A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due no 
more than 30 days is assessed as a financial asset with High Grade; 
 – A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more 
than 30 but less than 60 days is assessed as a financial asset with Standard Grade; 
 – A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more 
than 60 days or borrower of this loan has at least an additional borrowing in past due more than 60 days as at 
reporting date is assessed as a financial asset with Sub-Standard Grade.

Impairment assessment 
The main considerations for the loan impairment assessment include whether any payments of principal or interest  
are overdue by any number of days or there are any known difficulties in the cash flows of counterparties, credit rating 
downgrades, or infringement of the original terms of the contract. The Group addresses impairment assessment in two 
areas: individually assessed allowances and collectively assessed allowances. Loans are considered to be individually 
impaired if they are past due by more than only a few days or there are clear indications that the borrower already faces 
business, financial or other type of problems that hinder its/his/her ability to serve contractual obligations with the 
Group. Impairment for all such loans is assessed individually, rather than applying standard collective impairment rates 
based on just prior history of losses of the Group.
Individually assessed allowances
For loan loss allowance determination purposes the Group considers all individually significant loans and classifies  
them between being individually impaired or not impaired. The allowance for those individually significant loans that  
are determined to be individually impaired (see definition above) is determined through individual assessment of the 
associated credit risk by assigning a proper credit rating. The allowances for non-significant loan that are determined  
to be individually impaired (see definition above) are also individually assessed. The allowance for losses for individually 
significant loans that are determined not to be individually impaired is assessed through the collective assessment 
approach described below. Items considered when determining allowance amounts include the sustainability of the 
counterparty’s business plan, its ability to improve performance once a financial difficulty has arisen, projected receipts 
and the expected dividend payout should bankruptcy ensue, the availability of other financial support and the realisable 
value of collateral, the timing of the expected cash flows and past history of the debt service of the borrower. Impairment 
losses are evaluated at each reporting date, unless unforeseen circumstances require more careful attention. 
Collectively assessed allowances
Allowances are assessed collectively for all loans (including but not limited to credit cards, residential mortgages, and 
unsecured consumer lending, commercial lending, etc.), both, significant as well as non-significant, where there is not 
yet objective evidence of individual impairment (see definition above). Allowances are evaluated on each reporting date 
with each portfolio receiving a separate review.
The collective assessment takes into account the impairment that is likely to be present in the portfolio even though 
there is not yet objective evidence of the impairment in an individual assessment. Impairment losses are estimated by 
taking into consideration the following information: historical losses on the portfolio, current economic conditions, the 
appropriate delay between the time a loss is likely to have been uncured and the time it will be identified as requiring an 
individually assessed impairment allowance, and expected receipts and recoveries once impaired. Local management  
is responsible for deciding the length of this period which can extend for as long as one year, depending on a product. 
The impairment allowance is then reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with the Group’s overall policy.
Financial guarantees and letters of credit are assessed and provision made in a similar manner as for loans.  Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Liquidity risk and funding management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and 
stress circumstances. To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its core deposit 
base, manages assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis. This incorporates 
an assessment of expected cash flows and the availability of high grade collateral which could be used to secure additional 
funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an 
unforeseen interruption of cash flow. The Group also has committed lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity 
needs. In addition, the Group maintains a cash deposit (obligatory reserve) with the NBG, the amount of which depends 
on the level of customer funds attracted.  166 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012
Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued
(Thousands of Georgian Lari)
27. Risk Management (continued) 
The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Group primarily on a standalone Bank basis, based on certain 
liquidity ratios established by the NBG. As at 31 December these ratios were as follows: 
2012 % 2011 % 2010 %
Average liquidity ratio 40.0% 36.9% 35.6%
Maximum liquidity ratio 49.1% 47 .2% 44.5%
Minimum liquidity ratio 31.1% 29.6% 29.1%
The average liquidity ratio is calculated on a standalone basis for JSC Bank of Georgia as the annual average (arithmetic 
mean) of daily liquidity ratios computed as the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities determined by the National Bank of 
Georgia as follows:
Liquid assets comprise cash, cash equivalents and other assets that are immediately convertible into cash. Those 
assets include investment securities issued by the Georgian Government plus Certificates of Deposit issued by NBG 
and do not include amounts due from credit institutions, other than inter-bank deposits, and/or debt securities of 
Governments and Central Banks of non-OECD countries, amounts in nostro accounts which are under lien, impaired 
inter-bank deposits; and amounts on obligatory reserve with NBG that are pledged due to borrowings from NBG.
Liabilities comprise the total balance sheet liabilities, less amounts due to credit institutions that are to be exercised  
or settled later than six months from the reporting date, plus off-balance sheet commitments with residual maturity 
subsequent to the reporting date of less than six months. Off-balance sheet commitments include all commitments 
except financial guarantees and letters of credit that are fully collateralised by cash covers in the Bank, and commitments 
due to dealing operations with foreign currencies. The maximum and minimum liquidity ratio are taken from historical data 
of the appropriate reporting years. 
The Group also matches the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on 
negative gaps compared to the Bank’s standalone total regulatory capital calculated per NBG regulation. The ratios are 
assessed and monitored monthly and compared against set limits. In the case of deviations amendment strategies/
actions are discussed and approved by ALCO.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted 
repayment obligations. Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately. 
However, the Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Bank could be 
required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by the Bank’s deposit retention history.

The Group expects that not all of the contingent liabilities or commitments will be drawn before expiry of the commitments.
The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts. Their liquidation has historically taken 
place over a longer period than indicated in the tables above. These balances are included in amounts due in less than 
three months in the tables above. 
Included in due to customers are term deposits of individuals. In accordance with the Georgian legislation, the Bank 
Group is obliged to repay such deposits upon demand of a depositor (Note 17).
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in 
market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchanges, and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to market 
risk into either trading or non-trading portfolios. Trading and non-trading positions are managed and monitored using 
sensitivity analysis. 
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of 
financial instruments. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates, 
with all other variables held constant, on the Group’s consolidated income statement. 
The sensitivity of the consolidated income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net 
interest income for the year, based on the floating rate non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 
31 December 2012. During the year ended 31 December 2012, year ended 31 December 2011 and year ended 
31 December 2010, sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity.

Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The 
Management Board has set limits on positions by currency based on the NBG regulations. Positions are monitored daily. 
The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2012 on its 
trading and non-trading monetary assets and liabilities and its forecast cash flows. The analysis calculates the effect  
of a reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held constant 
on the income statement (due to the fair value of currency sensitive non-trading monetary assets and liabilities). The 
reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari is calculated as a standard deviation  
of daily changes in exchange rates over the last month. A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net reduction 
in income statement or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase. During the year ended  
31 December 2012, year ended 31 December 2011 and year ended 31 December 2010, sensitivity analysis did  
not reveal any significant potential effect on the Group’s equity.

Prepayment risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that the Group will incur a financial loss because its customers and counterparties repay or 
request repayment earlier than expected, such as fixed rate mortgages when interest rates fall, or other credit facilities, 
for similar or whatever reasons.
The Group calculates the effect of early repayments by calculating the weighted average rates of early repayments  
across each loan product individually, applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying amount of respective 
products as at the reporting date and multiplying by the weighted average effective annual interest rates for each 
product. The model does not make a distinction between different reasons for repayment (e.g. relocation, refinancing 
and renegotiation) and takes into account the effect of any prepayment penalties, as the Group’s income.  Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 169
The estimated effect of prepayment risk on profit and equity of the Group for the year ended 31 December is as follows:
Effect

2012 (3,971)

Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail 
to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial 
loss. The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and 
responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, 
access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, including the use  
of internal audit. 
Operating environment
Most of the Group’s business in concentrated in Georgia. As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a  
well-developed business and regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy. 
Operations in Georgia may involve risks that are not typically associated with those in developed markets (including  
the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the country, and undeveloped debt and equity markets). 
However, over the last few years the Georgian government has made a number of developments that positively affect 
the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to create banking, judicial, 
taxation and regulatory systems. This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation (including new Tax Code and 
procedural laws). In the view of the Board, these steps contribute to mitigate the risks of doing business in Georgia. 
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist. The future 
stability of the Georgian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness  
of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the Government. However, the Georgian economy is 
vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world. 
28. Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments recorded at fair value
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
 – Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 – Level 2: techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly; and
 – Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.
The following table shows an analysis of financial instruments recorded at fair value by level of the fair value hierarchy:

The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments which are recorded at fair value 
using valuation techniques. These incorporate the Group’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would 
make when valuing the instruments. 
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly interest  
rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques 
include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs 
including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.
Trading securities and investment securities available-for-sale
Trading securities and investment securities available-for-sale valued using a valuation technique or pricing models 
primarily consist of unquoted equity and debt securities. These securities are valued using models which sometimes 
only incorporate data observable in the market and at other times use both observable and non-observable data. The 
non-observable inputs to the models include assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the investee, 
its risk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the 
investee operates.

as follows: 
For equities, the Group adjusted the price-over-book-value multiple by increasing and decreasing the ratio by 10%, which 
is considered by the Group to be within a range of reasonably possible alternatives based on the price-over-book-value 
multiples used across peers within the same geographic area of the same industry.

28. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)
The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial 
instruments which are not already recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value
For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short term maturity (less than thee months) it  
is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also applied to demand 
deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments
The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market 
interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments. The 
estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market 
interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity. 
29. Maturity Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The table below shows an analysis of financial assets and liabilities according to when they are expected to be 
recovered or settled. See Note 27 “Risk management” for the Group’s contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.

The Group’s capability to discharge its liabilities relies on its ability to realise equivalent assets within the same period  
of time. In the Georgian marketplace, where most of the Group’s business is concentrated, many short-term credits  
are granted with the expectation of renewing the loans at maturity. As such, the ultimate maturity of assets may be 
different from the analysis presented above. To reflect the historical stability of current accounts, the Group calculates 
the minimal daily balance of current accounts over the past two years and includes the amount in less than 1 year 
category in the table above. The remaining current accounts are included in on demand category.  174 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012
29. Maturity Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities (continued)
The Group’s principal sources of liquidity are as follows:
 –deposits; 
 – borrowings from international credit institutions; 
 – inter-bank deposit agreement;
 – debt issues;
 – proceeds from sale of securities;
 – principal repayments on loans;
 – interest income; and
 – fees and commissions income.
As at 31 December 2012 amounts due to customers amounted to GEL 2,693,025 (2011: GEL 2,735,222, 2010: GEL 
2,026,308) and represented 59% (2011: 71%, 2010: 61%) of the Group’s total liabilities. These funds continue to provide 
a majority of the Group’s funding and represent a diversified and stable source of funds. As at 31 December 2012 
amounts owed to credit institutions amounted to GEL 1,657,162 (2011: GEL 921,172, 2010: GEL 1,138,927) and 
represented 36% (2011: 24%, 2010: 34%) of total liabilities. 
In the Board’s opinion, liquidity is sufficient to meet the Group’s present requirements. 
30. Related Party Disclosures
In accordance with IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”, parties are considered to be related if one party has the  
ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational 
decisions. In considering each possible related party relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the 
relationship, not merely the legal form.
Related parties may enter into transactions which unrelated parties might not, and transactions between related  
parties may not be effected on the same terms, conditions and amounts as transactions between unrelated parties.  
All transactions with related parties disclosed below have been conducted on an arm’s length basis.

31. Capital Adequacy
The Group maintains an actively managed capital base to cover risks inherent in the business. The adequacy of the 
Group’s capital is monitored using, among other measures, the ratios established by the NBG in supervising the 
Bank and the ratios established by the Basel Capital Accord 1988. 
During year ended 31 December 2012, the Bank and the Group complied in full with all its externally imposed  
capital requirements.
The primary objectives of the Group’s capital management are to ensure that the Group complies with externally 
imposed capital requirements and that the Group maintains strong credit ratings and healthy capital ratios in order  
to support its business and to maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions  
and the risk characteristics of its activities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust  
the amount of dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. No changes 
were made in the objectives, policies and processes from previous years. 
NBG capital adequacy ratio
The NBG requires banks to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 12% of risk-weighted assets, computed 
based on the Bank’s standalone special purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with NBG regulations 
and pronouncements. As at 31 December 2012, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 the Bank’s capital 
adequacy ratio on this basis was as follows: 
2012 2011 2010
Core capital 739,880 512,238 494,128

Less: Deductions from capital (262,616) (184,323) (367 ,418)
Total regulatory capital 866,949 791,740 550,099
Risk-weighted assets 5,352,187 4,872,931 3,800,624
Total Capital adequacy ratio 16.2% 16.2% 14.5%
Regulatory capital consists of Core capital, which comprises share capital, additional paid-up capital, retained earnings 
including current year profit, foreign currency translation and non-controlling interests less accrued dividends, net long 
positions in own shares and goodwill. Certain adjustments are made to IFRS-based results and reserves, as prescribed 
by the NBG. The other component of regulatory capital is Supplementary capital, which includes subordinated 
long-term debt, preference shares and revaluation reserves.

Earnings and operating proﬁt numbers are stated, throughout the commentary, before exceptional items and certain re-measurements where applicable – 
see note 2 for deﬁnitions. The Directors believe this measure assists with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. The equivalent
amounts after exceptional items and certain re-measurements are reﬂected in note 4 and are reconciled at Group level in the Group Income Statement. Certain
re-measurements and exceptional items are described in note 6. Adjusted earnings and adjusted basic earnings per share are reconciled to their statutory
equivalents in note 11. All current ﬁnancial results listed are for the 12 months ended 31 December 2006. 
The Group adopted IFRS with effect from 1 January 2005. The comparative data for 2004 has been restated accordingly. IAS 32 and IAS 39 were adopted with effect 
from 1 January 2005, and the comparative data for 2004 does not reﬂect the effect of these standards. Amounts in years prior to 2004 are presented in accordance with
generally accepted accounting standards (GAAP) in the UK prevailing at the time. Turnover prior to 2004 excludes Accord trading revenue. 
All references to ‘the prior year’, ‘2005’ and ‘last year’ mean the 12 months ended 31 December 2005 unless otherwise speciﬁed. 
Throughout this Report references to British Gas include Scottish Gas.  Performance review
We achieved good underlying financial
performance despite the particularly
challenging circumstances which prevailed
throughout the year. 
In the winter of 2005/06 gas shortages
in the UK and increasing worldwide
demand for energy drove wholesale 
prices to record levels necessitating 
price increases to many of our customers.
The management team worked hard to
minimise the effect of these increases by
containing operating costs and developing
innovative products designed to protect
customers and preserve loyalty in
increasingly competitive markets.
Regrettably, despite these actions, we
lost one million residential energy accounts
during the year. British Gas Residential
returned to profit* by the end of the year
which, together with continued good
delivery in gas production, strong growth
in North America and the lower tax
charge, enabled the Group overall to
deliver sound earnings* growth.
The high commodity prices in the first
half of the year held up the price of assets
and the Board continued to exercise
financial discipline and invest only in
additional sources of supply where 
returns met our rigorous financial hurdles. 
In the latter part of the year, there was 
a fundamental change in the UK energy
market. New gas supply pipelines from
Norway and Holland, whose construction
was made possible by long-term
contracts entered into by British Gas, came
on-stream at a time when the country was
experiencing the warmest autumn since
records began. This change in the balance
of supply and demand, combined with a
fall in global oil prices, reversed previous
wholesale gas price trends. This enabled
British Gas to announce price reductions
from March 2007 when a portion of the
more expensive gas supplies to which we
are already committed will be exhausted.
Looking forward, it is our intention to strike
a fair balance between lower prices and
sustainable profits* in order to reward both
our customers and shareholders.
Returns to shareholders
The Board is proposing a final dividend of
8.0 pence (2005: 7.4 pence) for payment
in June 2007 bringing our full-year dividend
to 11.15 pence (2005: 10.5 pence). This
represents a 6% year-on-year increase, 
in line with our policy and commitment to
real growth in the ordinary dividend. As we
become more confident in the sustainability
of more benign market conditions, we will
be able to consider the reinstatement of
our share buyback programme should
surplus funds permit.
Corporate governance
Our reporting has always been open 
and transparent, and this year we have
refined our approach to include the 
latest EU legislative requirements. We
have integrated the key aspects of our
corporate responsibility performance 
within our Business Review (formerly the
Operating and Financial Review). Also in
the Business Review is a section on the
KPIs that the Board uses to measure
progress against strategy, as well as a
section on the main risks facing the Group.
Board changes
Sir Roy Gardner retired at the end of 
June. We are grateful to him for his
material contribution and commitment,
having led Centrica through a decade 
of considerable change. 
In July, Sam Laidlaw was appointed Chief
Executive of the Company bringing with 
him considerable experience in managing
and developing large scale international
energy businesses. Since taking up the
appointment he has made real progress 
in developing the long-term vision for the
Group and in sharpening the immediate
focus on improving the current performance
and efficiency of the organisation. 
Chairman’s Statement

including joint ventures and associates stated net of
interest and taxation, and before exceptional items
and certain re-measurements. Mark Clare left the Company in the
summer to take up an appointment
outside the industry, having made an
important contribution to the Group both
as Finance Director and, more recently,
Managing Director of British Gas
Residential. Patricia Mann OBE retired
from the Group after nine years valuable
service on the Board and her role of
Senior Non-Executive Director was
assumed by Mary Francis CBE. Sadly
Patricia died later in the year having
bravely fought a long-term illness. 
Phil Bentley who has ably served as
Finance Director and Managing Director,
Europe will move to the role of Managing
Director, British Gas following the
appointment of Nick Luff as Group
Finance Director. Nick brings with him
significant commercial experience. 
Jake Ulrich has taken on responsibility 
for the continental European operations.
At the beginning of the year we
established a main board committee to
lead our corporate responsibility strategy.
This is chaired by Mary Francis CBE and
includes the managing directors of each
business unit. 
I am confident that this new team will
bring renewed vigour and commitment 
to the successful development of Centrica
in the years ahead.
Our employees
Our employees worked particularly hard
throughout 2006 as they responded to 
the unusually demanding environment.
External pressures arising from turbulence
in the energy market were magnified by
the degree of change in systems, working
practices, organisation and management
within the Company and I thank them all
for their loyalty, hard work and dedication.
The upstream team once again made 
a material contribution to our financial
performance and demonstrated their
absolute professionalism in both the
operation of our offshore facilities and 
the rapid recovery of our Rough storage
platform following a fire earlier in the year.
Tragically the risks of working offshore
were again made evident when six people,
four of them Centrica employees, were
killed in a helicopter accident in Morecambe
Bay at Christmas with a seventh person 
still missing, presumed dead. Our thoughts
and deepest sympathies are with their
families and our thanks go to all the
employees who continue to help fulfil 
the UK’s energy needs under arduous 
and challenging conditions.
The future
We are entering 2007 under new
leadership but with continued commitment
to the twin goals of customer service 
and shareholder value creation. Lower
wholesale energy prices have provided 
us with the opportunity to reduce retail
prices and we expect the completion of
new systems to help address the service
levels. We will also continue our search for
cost-effective supply sources to rebalance
our market exposure and sharpen our
competitive edge. 
Our investment programme will be
driven by value and our cost structure 
will be the focus of continued stringent
appraisal. Innovation will be key to our
marketing effort and the application of 
our skills and service network to meet 
the growing consumer demand for 
energy efficiency will be at the heart of 
our endeavours. I look forward to 2007
with confidence in both our business
model and the management team.

Overview of 2006
Against a backdrop of unprecedented
volatility Centrica produced a solid set of
financial results. During the year the UK
experienced large fluctuations in wholesale
gas costs, particularly in the first quarter
when cold weather and fear of shortages
pushed the wholesale gas price to 250
pence per therm (p/therm). The six main
energy suppliers struggled to keep up with
this rate of rise in commodity costs and
implemented 13 separate tariff increases
during the first 10 months of the year.
Supply fears subsided in the second half
of the year as good progress was made
with the construction of the Langeled 
and BBL pipelines, both of which were
underpinned by British Gas contracts, 
and wholesale gas prices started to fall. 
The high wholesale prices in the first half
of the year materially impacted the supply
businesses. British Gas Residential made
a significant loss* in the first six months 
of the year and stubbornly high forward
wholesale prices forced us to follow other
suppliers in increasing retail prices for a
second time in September. The quantity
and magnitude of tariff increases across 
all suppliers hit consumer sentiment 
and resulted in high levels of customer
switching. Despite continuing to launch
innovative products, including the very
successful Fix and Fall offering, British Gas
lost 1,029,000 energy accounts during 
the year. The tariff increase in September
returned the business to profit* in the
second half of the year. Once the outlook
for wholesale prices became clearer
British Gas took the lead in announcing
a price reduction to residential customers
of 17% in gas and 11% in electricity,
effective from 12 March 2007. 
British Gas Business delivered further
customer growth and record profits* despite
the extremely challenging commodity
environment in the first half of the year.
British Gas Services suffered a difficult
start to the year due to the exceptionally
cold weather driving higher call outs.
However the business finished the 
year strongly as the changes we 
made to systems, management and
processes improved both operational 
and service measures.
Operationally the gas production
business performed well but production
volumes were restricted by maintenance
work during an extended summer outage
at the South Morecambe field and
management’s decision not to produce
from the field for a large portion of the
second half as a result of falling wholesale
prices and weak demand due to the
unusually warm weather. This fall in prices
at the end of the year greatly improved 
the ongoing position of the industrial and
commercial legacy contracts which were
significantly loss-making* overall during 
the year.
Centrica Storage had a challenging year.
In February 2006 a catastrophic failure 
and fire at the Rough storage field halted
operations. However an exceptional effort 
by the team delivered reliable injection 
in time to refill the field before the start 
of the winter production season, enabling
the asset to deliver another strong
financial result.
In North America, Direct Energy 
had another year of record figures with
turnover up 15% primarily due to strong
growth in business markets and Texas.
The Texas operation performed particularly
well, providing a large portion of the 21%
overall increase in North American profit*.
This was due particularly to improved
results in both the organic business, 
as it gained scale, and the incumbent
business, as the competitive market
structure, combined with our effective
procurement, enabled us to implement
proactive discounted price offerings to
customers. Despite this strong overall
growth, as part of a continual review of the
efficiency of the business, decisive action
was taken to reduce costs. This resulted
Financially, the business performed well in a difficult year. While good progress 
is being made there is further work to be done to improve the British Gas service
levels, reduce our cost base and develop our services, energy efficiency and
international businesses.
Delivering our strategy
Sam Laidlaw
Chief Executive
We are focusing firmly on
the priority of reducing
exposure to short-term
movements in the
wholesale gas price.
“
” Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
07
Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113
in 450 job losses during the year, 9% of
the total, primarily in Canada and in US
home services. 
The European business made
considerable progress as, overall, it moved
firmly into profit*. However the ongoing
negotiations between major companies 
in France, Spain and Holland provided
evidence of continued support within
European Union member states for
consolidation and the formation of national
champions ahead of the existence of 
full competition. 
The year ended on a tragic note with a
helicopter accident in the Morecambe Bay
area which claimed the lives of six people,
four of them long-standing and highly
committed Centrica employees with a
seventh person still missing, presumed
dead. Our thoughts are with all of their
families and friends. Centrica regards 
safety as a top priority, and is committed 
to providing a healthy and safe environment
for employees and the communities which
it touches. We have a range of appropriate
controls in place and these are subject to
regular review by the Board.
Business outlook
Since taking over from Sir Roy Gardner 
as the Chief Executive of Centrica in July 
of 2006, I have spent a large part of my 
first six months assessing the strengths 
and weaknesses of the business and 
the priorities going forward. My initial
observations are that the core businesses
remain strong and we are in an enviable
position in most of our chosen markets,
with good growth being achieved
internationally, particularly in North America.
In addition, after a difficult few years, the
wholesale pricing environment is starting to
improve. However it is clear that the returns
in our residential business in the UK have
been low and that we have proven to 
be overly exposed to the rapidly rising
wholesale cost of the commodities which
we supply to our customers. We have also
suffered dual running costs and delivered
less than satisfactory customer service as
we have moved to a new billing platform 
in British Gas, the efficacy and robustness
of which is still in the proving stage.
We will now seek to build on our
strengths, remove the weaknesses and
overcome the challenges. To do this
I have set out some clear priorities for 
the Company: 
Transform British Gas
Sharpen up the organisation and 
reduce costs 
Reduce risk by adding new sources of
gas and power
Build on our multiple growth platforms
We made some progress on this agenda
during the second half of the year. The
price increase in British Gas Residential
announced in July was followed later in
the year by a softening in wholesale gas
and power prices; this has returned this
business to profit* and allowed us to be
the first company to offer customers a
price reduction, announced in February.
We also launched our Essentials Tariff to
provide protection to our most vulnerable
customers. The service levels in our British
Gas Services business have shown a
significant improvement and our attention
is now firmly focused on service levels in
the residential business. 
We carried out an initial review of the
costs and processes in our business. As 
a result we took an exceptional non-cash
charge of £196 million which reflects the
write-down of our IT systems. We also took
an exceptional cash charge of £87 million
for the initial restructure of parts of the
corporate centre, British Gas Residential
and British Gas Services resulting in around
1,550 job losses. Together these charges
reduce ongoing costs with around 
£50 million saved in 2007. 
Our progress to date leaves me
optimistic for 2007. We will continue to
review the structure of our business and
put in place internal operational metrics
which will identify and drive further
efficiencies. British Gas Residential is 
on track to return to a more sustainable
operating margin* and to arrest the decline
in customer numbers assisted by the price
reduction, improving customer service and
ongoing innovation in our product offerings.
We are also focusing firmly on the
priority of reducing the exposure to short-
term movements in the wholesale gas
price. We continue to expect this to be
achieved through a mixture of upstream
asset acquisitions and contractual
arrangements. We will leverage Centrica’s
unique market position on both sides 
of the Atlantic to secure liquefied natural
gas for our customers and offer security 
of demand for producers.
In Centrica Energy we expect gas
production levels to be broadly flat on
2006. We renegotiated the terms of the
inter-company sales contracts on the
South and North Morecambe gas fields,
with the agreement of HM Revenue and
Customs, to establish a direct link to
month-ahead gas prices. We will also
commission the Maria, Thurne and 
Davy East fields. The industrial and
commercial contracts are forecast to
become profitable* as a result of lower
wholesale prices.
We expect to see further growth in British
Gas Business which is also benefiting from
the fall in wholesale prices and is retaining
strong customer renewal and loyalty
levels. In British Gas Services we expect
the investment we have made in new
systems, management and processes 
to deliver significantly improved financial
performance in 2007. In North America we
expect to continue to grow both revenue
and profit*, with further load growth in
business markets focused primarily 
in the northeastern United States and
increased profit* contribution from our
energy wholesale and trading activities.
Further expansion in continental Europe
remains an important element of our
growth plans. However while welcoming
the conclusions of the European
Commission’s Energy Review, that market
mechanisms need to be put in place to
encourage greater competition, we remain
cautious about the potential for making
further material inroads in the short term.
The recent publication of the Stern
report was significant in the development
of climate change policy in the UK.
Climate change is probably the most
significant environmental issue facing
current and future generations. Accordingly,
there is clear evidence that slowing or
stabilising global warming is taking on
greater importance for governments,
companies and consumers alike. While
Centrica already has the lowest carbon
intensity profile of the major UK power
suppliers we will continue to expand
our investments in the area of renewable
energy and promote the use of energy-
efficient technology by consumers. We 
will also capitalise on our unique expertise
and capability to deliver energy efficiency
advice, services and products to both 
our business and residential customers.
I expect 2007 to be an important year in
Centrica’s development. Although some of
our priorities will take longer to deliver fully,
I anticipate making real progress during
this year and delivering a step up in the
performance of the business.

America
Centrica Storage
Under our Direct Energy brand,
we are North America’s largest
competitive energy solutions
provider, serving residential and
business customers in Canada
and the US.
Our Rough storage facility is the
UK’s largest. It is supported by 
a gas processing terminal at
Easington, also managed by
Centrica Storage. From October
2006, Centrica Storage became
responsible for operating the
adjacent terminal receiving gas
from the Langeled pipeline. 
With the decline of supplies 
from the UK’s North Sea gas
fields, the need for large volume
storage has grown. Moving
forward, the UK will require
additional storage as traditional
seasonal swing producing 
fields deplete.
The regulatory landscape 
is fragmented, with robust
competition in business markets
across many states and
provinces, and residential
competition chiefly in Ontario,
Alberta, Texas and the
northeastern United States. 
We are growing our retail
energy and services businesses
in the deregulated markets.
As a source of value creation
we are developing our energy
management capabilities. 
Where we see value, our
intention is to acquire more
assets to support the supply 
of energy to our customers. 
We are progressing a number
of projects to increase the
capacity of Rough to take
advantage of the increased
demand for gas storage.

Some EU states have been 
slow to make the legislative
changes for the full opening 
of the market due in July 2007
but there are strong signs that
the EU is keen to apply more
pressure. North-west European
energy markets are increasingly
interconnected and with 
more open access greater
competition will be possible.
There are major opportunities
in the Benelux and German

Gas prices are falling now 
more gas is arriving in the 
UK. Lower gas prices, retiring
coal and nuclear plants and 
an increasingly stringent
emissions trading scheme
have improved the outlook 
for gas-fired power stations. 
Our construction of an 885MW
combined cycle gas turbine
power station at Langage in
Devon began.
We are developing an additional
252MW of wind generation 
and have secured a 600MW
electricity supply contract linked
to international coal prices.
We acquired gas acreage in the
UK, Norway, Nigeria and Egypt.

Group Key Performance Indicators
In this section, as part of our commitment to enhanced narrative reporting, the
Board and the Executive Committee have set out the key performance indicators
(KPIs) that we use to monitor progress against our strategy.
Measuring our performance
Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113
Description
Financial
Adjusted basic
earnings per share
(EPS)
Dividends per share
This measure of performance 
is calculated as profit before
exceptional items and certain 
re-measurements for the 
year, attributable to equity
shareholders of the parent
company, divided by the
weighted average number of
shares in issue during the year. 
This is the total dividend 
per share (excluding special
dividends) paid in respect 
of each financial year.
To deliver growth in adjusted
EPS. This measure is used 
as one of the performance
conditions in the Company’s
Executive Share Option Scheme
and Long Term Incentive
Scheme, details of which 
are on page 35.
TSR is used as one of the
performance conditions in the
Company’s Long Term Incentive
Scheme, details of which are 
on page 35.
To deliver real growth 
per annum.
Target
The 2006 dividend shows an
increase of 6% on the 2005
dividend which is in excess of 
the rise in the Retail Price Index.
We have seen a 7% growth 
in adjusted EPS during a
challenging year.
We have outperformed the 
FTSE 100 Index by 31% over 
a five year period.
Analysis/comment
The measure of adjusted EPS is
reported on the Group Income
Statement, part of the audited
Financial Statements.

Customer satisfaction
In 2006, we used a variety of 
measures across our business 
units to measure levels of customer
satisfaction. During 2007, a Group
customer KPI will be developed 
that recognises our position as 
a provider of energy and related
services to both domestic and
commercial markets. This
information will be included 
in our 2007 Annual Report.
Non-financial
We measure lost time injuries 
per 100,000 hours worked.
The majority of these are
incurred through slips, trips,
falls and manual handling. We
use both incidence rates and
active indicators to monitor
the effectiveness of the health 
and safety (H&S) preventative
programmes that we run
throughout the Group. 
The Centrica annual employee
survey measures engagement
and commitment levels for every
team at all levels across the
Group. The overall engagement
score reflects the attitudes and
opinions of our employees and
measures, on a scale of one to
five, their feelings about working
for Centrica.
We measure the carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases
emitted from our activities. This
comprises emissions from power
generation, gas production and
storage, energy usage, fleet
operations and business travel. 
Continue to target the reduction
and elimination of lost time
injuries across our business 
and have increasingly sought 
to adopt a ‘zero tolerance’
approach on prevention. 
To improve employee
engagement as part of
improving business
performance.
Continue to provide a range 
of energy efficiency services 
to help our customers reduce
their carbon footprint. We will
also look to deliver new energy
saving programmes across 
the Group.
We have established a solid
track record of continual
improvement and our underlying
performance in 2006 continues
to indicate the beneficial impact
of our H&S strategy. 
Our score shows a 
year-on-year increase and
several businesses have 
seen significant improvement.
2006 was the first year that
we have fully collated data to
calculate our Group carbon
footprint. We have the lowest
carbon intensity profile of any
large UK power supplier and
intend to further improve
efficiency at all levels.

This year saw commodity prices again
reach record highs with demand weighted
wholesale market gas and electricity up 
by 42% and 32% respectively on the
previous year to 57.10p/therm and
£47.13/MWh. This not only meant that 
the business made a loss* in the first 
half of the year but forced tariff increases
across the industry. 
These price increases resulted in an
overall rise in customer churn. At the 
end of December we had 16.0 million
energy accounts, a net loss of 1,029,000
accounts year-on-year. The effect of churn
on our business was reduced by the
launch of innovative product offerings,
such as the 2009 fixed price product and
Fix and Fall, which helped to maintain
sales at around 60,000 per week. 
Turnover increased by 18% to £7.1 billion
(2005: £6.0 billion) due to price increases
in March and September of 2006 and the
full-year effect of the September 2005
price rise, partially offset by lower customer
numbers and reduced consumption due
mainly to an unseasonably warm autumn. 
In the year we incurred a charge of 
£175 million (2005: £85 million) for our
share of the imbalance costs of the
national network. We believe that certain
industry processes systematically
disadvantage British Gas and we are
working with the regulator to make sure
that gas costs are more fairly allocated
across the entire industry. Overall gross
margin* increased by £59 million as the
increase in turnover more than offset the
higher commodity costs and the increase
in transportation and distribution charges
per customer. 
Operating costs increased to £1,029
million (2005: £974 million) as underlying
cost reductions were more than offset by
training and backfilling costs associated
with the migration of customers to the
new billing system, increased bad debt
costs and the cost of implementing two
price rises during the year.
Operating profit* for the year increased
by 6% to £95 million (2005: £90 million) 
as operating margins* recovered strongly
in the second half. 
We transferred 95% of our customer
accounts onto our new billing system by
the end of the year. We expect to have
transferred all customers by the end of
March 2007. The increase in calls around
the times of the tariff increases, coupled
with the ongoing system changes, meant
that customer service levels dropped in
the middle of the year. In the second half
of the year we increased front-line staff 
by 800 to improve customer service.
We took a pre-tax exceptional cash
charge of £36 million for restructuring 
the operation and the planned closure of
the British Gas Residential headquarters
building. These result in a benefit of 
£7 million in 2007 and around £16 million
thereafter. We also took a pre-tax exceptional
non-cash charge for systems write-down
of £178 million, resulting in reduced
amortisation charges, with around 
£28 million expected in 2007. 
Under the UK Energy Efficiency
Commitment British Gas installed more
than 13 million energy efficiency measures,
such as loft and cavity wall insulation and
low energy light bulbs, with an equivalent
carbon saving of 1 million tonnes,
benefiting more than 6 million households.
Beyond our legislative commitments, we
have a range of energy efficiency services
to help customers reduce their carbon
footprint. These include our Energy Savers
Report, a bespoke home energy efficiency
audit which 1.5 million householders
completed during the year.
In addition, British Gas was selected as
an accredited supplier for the government’s
Low Carbon Building Programme providing
access to grant funding of up to 50%. We
are the only company within this phase of
the programme to gain accredited supplier
status across all five microgeneration
technologies – solar photovoltaic, ground
source heat pumps, biomass, wind and
solar thermal. 
British Gas committed to provide 
£18.3 million of winter fuel rebates to
vulnerable customers during the year. 
We also continued to tackle fuel poverty
through our ‘here to HELP’ programme. It
reached more than 117,000 homes during
the year, installing free energy efficiency
products and identifying over £2.2 million
of unclaimed benefits. Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006

British Gas Business
Record proﬁts*, up 13% to £87 million
SME contract renewals topped 95%
‘Named’ point of contact for each customer 
This year brought unprecedented 
highs in commodity prices with significant
increases in input costs for both gas and
electricity. Despite having to raise prices 
to customers, we increased our total
supply points by 2.5% to 932,000 
(2005: 909,000) as increases in gross
churn rates in our tariff book were more
than offset by strong sales performance,
continued SME contract renewal levels 
of over 95% and further improvements 
in corporate customer retention. 
Turnover increased by 53% to £2.3
billion (2005: £1.5 billion) due to price
rises, higher customer numbers and
higher average consumption in both 
fuels as a result of winning a number 
of large corporate accounts. 
Operating profit* was up 13% to 
£87 million (2005: £77 million) despite 
a significant loss* being made in the 
tariff book prior to the price increase in
March. Profit* in the second half was
markedly higher as tariff increases took
effect and fourth quarter wholesale costs
reduced, improving margins across the
customer base. 
During the year operating costs
increased, driven by investments in a 
new billing system, rising absolute cost 
of debt on higher turnover and higher
sales and marketing costs. We made
progress on a customer service initiative
that will create a single named point of
contact for each customer and the
deployment of new technology and
processes which will rationalise our
invoicing and collection systems. 
We also continued to establish our
position as an industry leader in providing
real-time consumption data to help
customers improve energy efficiency.

British Gas Services
Service levels saw a marked improvement 
Turnover increased by 8%
Product relationships up 4% to 7 million
During the year British Gas Services
made significant progress on fixing
operational issues that were highlighted in
the first half, when temperatures below the
seasonal norm led to a record number of
call outs. These call outs put additional
pressure on operations and affected
service levels. Operational performance
improved considerably in the second 
half of the year as process and system
changes were implemented. This resulted
in a marked improvement in service 
levels in the latter part of the year. Most
importantly we coped with the period
covering the switch-on of central heating
systems in the autumn, which results 
in high overall demand, without any
significant issues with operations and
customer service. 
Turnover was up by 8% at £1.1 billion
(2005: £1.0 billion) as the total number 
of product relationships increased by 4%
over the prior year to just over 7 million.
The average price of central heating care
also increased reflecting initial structural
changes to pricing based more accurately
on the costs of servicing each customer.
In addition the second half of the year 
saw a stronger performance in the central
heating installation business with a 9%
increase in installation volumes on the
second half of last year, recovering much
of the fall in the first half. We installed
around 90,000 energy-efficient boilers in
the UK during the year and our engineers
are now providing solar thermal products
to domestic customers.
Operating profit* decreased by 8% to
£102 million (2005: £111 million) due to
the increased breakdown call outs and
extra cost of parts required for the repairs
in the first half of the year. The second 
half showed a year-on-year improvement
of 12%. 
During the year we significantly
restructured operations to reduce cost
and increase productivity, resulting in 390
job losses with an exceptional cash cost
of £48 million. This will have a payback 
of just over three years. We also wrote-
down certain unused functionality and
capitalised development costs within 
the systems portfolio. This resulted in a 
pre-tax exceptional charge of £18 million.

First green power from Barrow offshore wind farm 
Gas production
Operating profit* was down 15% to £864
million (2005: £1,020 million) due to a 37%
reduction in gas volumes partially offset by
a 35% increase in selling price. The 51%
reduction in Morecambe production
volumes was due to management
decisions to carry out remedial work on
South Morecambe’s cooler units during an
extended summer maintenance period and
our decision to switch off the field in response
to low intraday gas prices especially in the
fourth quarter of the year. 
This was partially offset by a 16%
increase in other production volumes
mainly due to the full-year effect of our
2005 acquisition of the Kerr McGee fields
and the acquisition of an increased share
in the Statfjord field. These fields
Centrica Energy faced a challenging
year and operating profits* were down
24% at £686 million (2005: £903 million)
due to lower gas production levels and the
forecast increased losses* in the industrial
and wholesale segment. 
For the year, market month ahead 
gas prices rose by 36% to 50.22p/therm
(2005: 36.82p/therm) and electricity rose
30% to £45.84/MWh (2005: £35.27/MWh).
The UK experienced huge fluctuations in
wholesale gas costs, particularly in the
early part of the year when cold weather
and fear of shortages pushed the wholesale
price per therm to 250 pence. Gas prices
reduced substantially in the second half 
of the year due to the increased flow of
gas through the newly constructed
Langeled and BBL pipelines.

contributed to the 47% increase in oil and
condensates production which reached
5.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE)
(2005: 3.8 MBOE) with average selling
prices of £34/BOE (2005: £29/BOE). 
The 36% increase in variable production
costs is due to the increased proportion 
of volumes from the newer fields where
depreciation levels are higher.
In addition to the £153 million acquisition
of a 4.84% stake in the Statfjord field we
invested £100 million in maintaining and
developing our upstream portfolio of
assets during the year. Of this, we invested
an initial £21 million in the Statfjord
depressurisation project to increase the
level of gas reserves and spent £46 million
on the development of Maria, Thurne and
Davy East. These new fields together with
the Statfjord project add 1,348 million
therms (mmth) of gas reserves and 11.6
million BOE for a total cost of £186 million. 
We also spent around £17 million on 
our focused gas exploration programme 
in the UK as we farmed into four projects.
We made a successful application under
the 24th UK offshore licensing round for
acreage around the Morecambe fields 
and opened an office in Stavanger to
enable us to participate successfully in 
the Norwegian licensing round where we
gained shares in four blocks in January
2007. We also have licence blocks in
Egypt and Nigeria which we started to
assess and have made an application
under the Trinidad licensing round.
Industrial sales and wholesaling 
The industrial sales and wholesaling
segment made an operating loss* of 
£210 million (2005: £156 million loss*).
Losses* from the legacy gas sales contracts
remained broadly flat at £171 million
(2005: £173 million loss*) as the increase
in input commodity costs was offset by 
an increase in the weighted average 
sales price combined with a reduction 
in volumes. Volumes reduced as three
contracts ended and the remaining
customers chose to buy from the
wholesale market when gas prices
softened. This reporting segment includes
certain operating costs of Centrica Energy;
these increased to £66 million (2005: £34
million) as we continued to expand our
upstream operations. 
Electricity generation
We generated 10.5TWh of power (2005:
11.6TWh) from our 3.4GW fleet of gas-fired
power stations in the period which was
down on the prior year due to a number 
of extended outages in our fleet. Total fleet Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006

The production facilities were returned
to operation less than 32 weeks after
the original incident. The force majeure
notice was lifted on 20 November, once
final operational testing was complete.
The restoration project involved
approximately 500,000 man hours
and was completed without any health
and safety lost-time incidents. The two
employees hospitalised at the time of
the incident have now recovered and
are back working on the platform.
The cost of the repairs and payments
made under the storage services contract
resulted in an exceptional cash cost to
the Group for the year of £48 million of
which £24 million is recognised in the
books of Centrica Storage.
Since recovery the reliability of the asset
has been re-established. Both injection
and production have experienced 99%
availability, and the reservoir was filled
by early November well in advance of
the winter production season.
Operating profit* before the exceptional
charge for the year was up 48% to
£228 million (2005: £154 million). This
was mainly due to a rise of 62% in
the average SBU price to 56.5 pence
(2005: 34.8 pence) and an increase in
the realised price of space sales, partially
offset by the 2005 sales of native gas of
£20 million not being repeated in 2006.
Despite extensive damage, it took 
only 16 weeks to recommission injection
at the facility. In restoring full production
capability the processes offshore 
were simplified to export wet gas 
rather than using offshore dehydration.
The main focus for Centrica Storage 
in 2006 was the recovery of operations
after the explosion and fire which caused
significant damage to the main offshore
platform of the Rough storage facility 
in February. 
load factor was 41% (2005: 49%). We
started work at Langage, Devon to build
an 885MW gas-fired plant on our
consented site. The total investment is
expected to be around £400 million and
commercial operations are due to start
during winter 2008/09. This will be the 
first power station to be built in the UK 
for five years. In November we announced
the acquisition of 85% of Coastal Energy
Limited who are seeking planning
permission to build the UK’s first Integrated
Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) 
power plant which would incorporate pre-
combustion carbon capture technology,
with the result of producing the lowest
carbon emissions of any fossil fuel plant 
in the UK. We also acquired an interest 
in a company developing a carbon
sequestration business.
We continued to participate in the
European Union (EU) Emissions Trading
Scheme. We believe it is the cornerstone
mechanism for reducing emissions across
the EU. In 2006 Centrica was involved in
15% of all EU carbon allowance trades. 
We also made a number of significant
investments through the United Nations
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) 
and invested in the largest private fund in
the carbon market. Centrica believes the
CDM is crucial to engaging developing
countries in emission reductions and has
committed to further investments in this area.
Renewables
In March we produced the first green
power from our 90MW joint venture
Barrow offshore wind farm. In November,
Airtricity started commissioning the 72MW
Braes of Doune wind farm and subject to
successful testing and handover from the
construction contractor, we will acquire 50%
of the equity from Airtricity for £42 million.
The award of the main construction
contracts for the two 90MW wind farms 
at Inner Dowsing and Lynn is almost
complete. First power from this project is
expected to be delivered in late 2008. We
also submitted an application for planning
consent for the 250MW Round Two Lincs
offshore wind farm. If successful, first power
from the project could be delivered in 2010.
Energy procurement
In April 2006 we agreed an innovative coal-
linked power purchase agreement with Drax
for the supply of 600MW of baseload power
over a 5¼-year period starting October
2007, indexed to international traded coal
prices and including a fixed clean seasonal
dark spread. 
We also completed an innovative 
three-year winter super peak electricity
generation tolling agreement with Rolls-
Royce Power Development to reduce
Centrica’s exposure to volatile short-term
market prices during these periods. The
contract commenced in October 2006,
with a total capacity of 245MW from
several small independent energy projects. 
In the last quarter of the year two key
pipeline projects, capable of meeting 
40% of the UK demand, underpinned 
by British Gas purchase contracts, were
commissioned. Langeled, underpinned 
by our 10 year 5.1BCM/year contract 
with Statoil, and BBL, underpinned by 
our 10 year 7.3BCM/year contract with
Gasunie started to deliver significant
amounts of gas to the UK.  Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006

Turnover topped £4 billion 
Operating proﬁt* grew by 21% to £223 million
Bought 244MW power station in Texas 
Recognising the need for greater
incentives on power procurement, we
have agreed a package with the regulator
that now enables us to earn a return on
the regulated electricity supply business.
Texas residential and small 
commercial energy
Turnover grew by 18% to £1,120 million
(2005: £953 million). This was largely
driven by growth in our organic customer
base in areas of Texas outside our
incumbent territory. In April we acquired
approximately 100,000 customers from
Entergy. In July, as part of a wider
agreement with the Public Utility
Commission we implemented a 5%
discount to our residential customers in
CPL/WTU which effectively removed those
customers from Price-to-Beat (PtB), and
then reduced prices by a further 6% at 
the start of 2007. The growth in scale of
the organic business, allied with effective
procurement across both businesses,
including the positive impact of the three
power stations, increased operating profit*
by 63% to £117 million (2005: £72 million).
Customer numbers increased as a result
of the acquisition of the customer base of
Entergy and continued strong competitive
sales in our organic business, partially offset
by the ongoing churn in the incumbent
customer base. In February we acquired
the Paris power station in northern Texas
and we completed three new wind power
purchasing agreements, which together
with the one signed in 2005, increased our
total contractual wind power capacity to
643MW. These investments are enabling 
us to offer our customers innovative
renewable energy plans.
Direct Energy continued to support 
the ‘Neighbor-to-Neighbor’ project in
Houston, with a US$1million (£540,000)
contribution. We work in partnership with
29 community agencies, which distribute
funds to vulnerable customers who are
unable to pay for their home electricity 
in emergency situations. 
Other USA residential and small 
commercial energy
Turnover grew by 19% to £247 million
(2005: £208 million) due to increased
customer numbers and higher retail
prices. We made encouraging progress 
in growing the customer base by 5%, 
with a strong performance in the New York
market. This combination of rising prices
and growing customer numbers was
offset by expenditure on growth and 
lower consumption due to very warm
weather at the end of 2006, resulting 
in a lower operating profit* of £12 million
(2005:£16 million).
Canada residential and 
small commercial energy
Turnover decreased by 7% to £1,425
million (2005: £1,533 million) with
increases in the deregulated business
being more than offset by reductions in
the regulated Alberta business. Operating
profit* reduced by 11% to £42 million
(2005: £47 million) as a result of the
removal of the business protection plan
rebate (BPPR) in Ontario, partially offset 
by increased profits* from equity gas
production and a significant reduction 
in employee numbers.
Our Alberta business moved into profit*
for the first time, although the competitive
market is growing slowly. Here the
regulated business has experienced a 
net customer decline to date of only 8%.
We now have around 95,000 competitive
customer accounts on-supply.

Our North American business has
continued its strong growth. Overall
turnover grew by 15% to £4.1 billion
(2005: £3.6 billion) driven primarily by 
the continued growth in business markets
and the organic residential business in
Texas. Operating profit* grew by 21% to
£223 million (2005: £185 million) primarily
due to higher profits* in Texas and the
home services business with adverse
exchange rate movements in the second
half negating the positive impact in the 
first six months. 
Despite this strong overall growth, 
as part of a continual review of the
efficiency of the business, decisive action
was taken to reduce costs. This resulted
in 450 job losses, 9% of the total, during
the year, primarily in Canada and in US
home services.  Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006

Europe
Turned a £9 million operating loss* into a £7 million proﬁt*
Entered German market
Full integration of SPE businesses in Belgium
In the Netherlands, we continued to 
grow our customer base through our
Oxxio brand. To support future growth 
we signed a tolling agreement with
Intergen for the output of a 400MW new
build combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)
at Rijnmond which we expect to begin
operations in 2009. We made significant
progress on the development and
installation of smart meters.
Our Luseo operation in Spain reduced
its supply operations due to the adverse
regulatory environment in Spain. However,
it continued to develop energy
management services to special regime
(renewable) generators and exploited other
profitable energy management activities.
We continued to grow our footprint in
Europe by creating a German subsidiary,
Centrica Energie GmbH, based in
Dusseldorf and recruited key staff. This 
is in response to positive developments 
in the legal and regulatory framework for
competition in German energy markets.
We are positioned to begin selling energy
to the commercial supply market in 2007.
The industry continues to consolidate 
in Europe with evidence of support for
national champions in France, Spain and
the Netherlands. While we continue to
review opportunities for developing our
business in continental Europe, this
remains a challenge in the current climate
and we will be robust in only pursuing
those opportunities which can deliver
long-term shareholder value. During the
year our European segment performed
well, delivering a £7 million operating
profit* (2005: operating loss* £9 million).
In Belgium we achieved full integration
of all previous businesses that made up
SPE and we now operate nationally 
under the Luminus brand. We transferred
500,000 Wallonian residential customers
on 1 January 2007, opened a new call
centre in Liège and we approved
investments in open cycle gas turbine
(OCGT) generation in Ghent and two 
wind farms. 
Home services
Home services performed well during 
the year with a 33% growth in operating
profit* to £68 million (2005: £51 million) 
on a turnover increase of 3%. This was
achieved primarily in Canada through
increased margins on heating, ventilation
and air conditioning sales and ongoing
operational efficiencies. The US home
services business remained stable despite
the backdrop of a severe downturn in the
US housing market.
In June we disposed of our remaining
19.9% holding in The Consumers’
Waterheater Income Fund for £65 million,
recording a one-off pre-tax gain of 
£7 million. Although we no longer have 
an equity share in the fund, we are still
required to consolidate the full financial
results of the fund owing to the continuing
close contractual relationship.
Business markets
We continue to invest heavily in this sector
and have seen significant growth with
volumes sold in gas and electricity rising
by 11% to 557mmth and 127% to 11.2TWh
respectively. Turnover grew by 88% to
£902 million (2005: £481 million).
During the year we successfully entered
12 new utility areas. The costs of doing
this, together with loss of the BPPR rebate
in Ontario, caused an increased operating
loss* of £21 million (2005: operating loss*
of £8 million). However, underlying gross
margins* remain healthy. This segment
includes a services business which has been
loss-making* and a turn-around plan for the
services business has already been executed.
Energy wholesale and trading 
During 2006 we widened the remit of our
existing wholesale and trading business 
to encompass taking future capacity in
natural gas transportation and storage 
and wind power contracts, so as to exploit
the expert resources already in place to
support retail procurement across the US
and Canada. We will continue to develop
these activities in the future. This segment
registered an operating profit* of £5 million
(2005: £7 million).

Group Financial Review
Centrica’s financial aim is to achieve a total
shareholder return (TSR) ranking in the first
quartile of UK FTSE 100 Index companies,
taking account of share price growth and
dividends received and reinvested over 
a sustained period. Centrica seeks to
maximise the return on capital it achieves 
in excess of its cost of capital, within a
prudent risk management framework. 
The Remuneration Report summarises our
TSR performance over recent years against
our comparator FTSE 100 Index group. 
The Group’s closing share price on 
31 December 2006 was 354.50 pence 
(31 December 2005: 254.75 pence), 
an increase of 39%, outperforming the
FTSE 100 Index by 28 percentage points
in the year.
Group turnover 
Group turnover from continuing operations
was up 22% at £16.5 billion (2005: 
£13.4 billion). The increase was driven
primarily by organic growth in the North
American business markets and the
residential business in Texas, and price
increases in British Gas Residential and
British Gas Business. 
Group operating profit
Group operating profit* from continuing
operations was down 5% at £1,442 million
(2005: £1,513 million), with the strong
growth in Centrica Storage and North
America being more than offset by reduced
profits* in gas production on lower volumes.
The results include £20 million non-recurring
profit* relating to the valuation of the Group’s
pension schemes due to the effect of new
pension legislation, introduced by the
Finance Act from April 2006, upon the
increased estimate of future amounts 
of pension commuted for a lump sum.
Earnings 
Group earnings* on a continuing basis
were up by 8% to £715 million (2005:
£661 million). The lower operating profits*
were more than offset by the reduction 
in the Group tax rate to 43% (2005: 52%)
due to the lower contribution from high 
tax rate upstream gas production. 
The statutory loss for the year was 
£155 million. The reconciling items
between Group earnings* and the
statutory loss are exceptional items 
and certain re-measurements that are
explained below.
Earnings per share and dividends 
Adjusted earnings per share* improved 
by 7% to 19.4 pence in 2006 from 18.2
pence in 2005. The Group reported a
basic loss per share of 4.3 pence, down
from basic earnings of 27.4 pence in
2005, reflecting the post-tax impact 
of exceptional charges and certain 
re-measurements.
In addition to the interim dividend of
3.15 pence per share, we propose a 
final dividend of 8.0 pence giving a total
ordinary dividend of 11.15 pence for the
year (2005: 10.5 pence).
Cash flow 
Group operating cash flow before working
capital adjustments was up from £1,936
million to £1,965 million but after working
capital adjustments, operational interest,
tax, exceptional charge and discontinued
items was down 36% at £737 million 
(2005: £1,144 million) primarily due to 
the working capital investment required 
by significant movements in the wholesale
prices. The net cash outflow from investing
activities increased to £720 million (2005:
£529 million), 36% higher than last year 
due to the receipt in 2005 of £184 million 
of disposal proceeds relating to the sale 
of British Gas Connections and Onetel. 
The net cash outflow from financing
2006 was a year of extreme volatility in wholesale commodity costs. 
Still Centrica produced sound growth in earnings* and the share price 
rose by 39%, outperforming the FTSE 100 by 28 percentage points.

Group Financial Review continued
UK listed companies are required to
comply with the European regulation to
report consolidated financial statements 
in conformity with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Group’s
significant accounting policies are
explained in note 2 to the Financial
Statements. Note 3 to the Financial
Statements explains the critical accounting
judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty arising in the preparation of 
the Financial Statements. The Group has
not made any material changes to its
accounting policies in the year ended 
31 December 2006.
Phil Bentley
Group Finance Director 
activities increased to £597 million (2005:
£335 million), an increase of 78% on 2005,
due mainly to a net increase in debt of 
£623 million in 2005, partially offset by 
the suspension of the share repurchase
programme, announced in February 2006,
resulting in a reduction in year-on-year cash
outflow of £365 million.
Net debt and interest
The Group’s net recourse debt level at 
31 December 2006 was £1,527 million
(2005: £1,060 million). This was up on
2005 due primarily to the increased
working capital requirement. This debt
includes £808 million of finance lease
commitments on the Humber and
Spalding power stations. Net interest
payable was £183 million (2005: £145
million) and was covered seven times 
by operating profit* (2005: ten times).
Net assets
Net assets decreased by 33% to 
£1,642 million (2005: £2,442 million). 
This is primarily due to the movement in
our derivative financial instruments which 
are marked-to-market, from an asset of
£0.6 billion at the end of 2005 to a liability
of £1.2 billion at the end of 2006. This
resulted in a charge of £931 million
(including joint ventures) arising on the net
mark-to-market movement on our energy
procurement activities recognised as
certain re-measurements in the Income
Statement, and a charge to reserves of
£939 million, where certain contracts have
achieved hedge accounting under IAS 39.
After the related deferred tax credits, these
movements account for a total reduction
in net assets of £1.2 billion. Exceptional
charges account for a further decrease in
net assets of £238 million after tax. These
are partially offset by a post-tax actuarial
gain on our pension liability of £332 million.
Exceptional items 
There is a pre-tax exceptional charge for
the year of £331 million (post tax £238
million). There are three elements. Firstly,
there is a non-cash charge of £196 million
relating to the write-down of systems
assets following a review of existing and
required future functionality within the
more focused Group. This will result in 
a reduction of £31 million in the 2007
amortisation charge. We also took an 
£87 million exceptional cash charge mainly
relating to the streamlining of the British
Gas Residential back-office, the planned
closure of the British Gas headquarters
building at Stockley Park, a restructuring
of the British Gas Services team and a
further streamlining of the group corporate
structure including the outsourcing of
parts of finance and HR, resulting in
around 1,550 job losses. This will deliver
benefits of £20 million in 2007 and
approximately £39 million in 2008. 
Finally there is an exceptional cash 
cost of £48 million relating to the 
Rough incident in February.
Tax credits of £93 million have been
recognised in respect of these costs.
Certain re-measurements
In our business we enter into a portfolio 
of forward energy contracts which include
buying substantial quantities of commodity
to meet the future needs of our customers.
A number of these arrangements are
considered to be derivative financial
instruments and are required to be fair
valued under IAS 39. Fair valuing means
that we apply the prevailing forward market
prices to these contracts. The Group 
has shown the fair value adjustments
separately as certain re-measurements 
as they are unrealised and non-cash in
nature. The profits* arising from the
physical purchase and sale of commodities
during the year, which reflect the prices in
the underlying contracts, are not impacted
by these re-measurements.
The statutory results include charges 
to operating profit relating to these re-
measurements of £931 million (2005: 
net credit of £455 million), primarily from
marking-to-market some contracts relating
to our energy procurement activities. As 
gas and power were delivered under these
contracts, the net in-the-money mark-to-
market positions were unwound generating
a net charge to the Income Statement in the
period of £287 million (2005: net credit of
£140 million). As the forward prices reduced
in 2006 the portfolio of contracts fair valued
under IAS 39 reported a net loss on
revaluation of £638 million (2005: credit 
of £298 million). The remaining £6 million
(2005: credit of £17 million) reflects the
proprietary trading positions relating to
cross-border capacity and storage
contracts. The £37 million (2005: £nil) 
credit to interest income relates to the re-
measurement of the publicly traded Units of
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. 
Acquisitions and capital expenditure
During the year the Group acquired a
further 4.84% interest in the Statfjord oil
and gas field from BP for £153 million, 
and the Paris Energy Centre, a 244 MW
gas fired combined cycle power plant in
Texas, for £32 million, along with a number
of smaller acquisitions.

We have a risk management process 
in place, which is designed to identify,
manage and mitigate business risk.
Regular reporting of these risks and the
monitoring of actions and controls is
conducted by the Audit Committee, 
which reports its findings to the Board.
This process is described in the Corporate
Governance section on page 32.
The factors described below highlight
risks and uncertainties which affect the
Group but are not intended to be an
exhaustive analysis of all the risks which
may arise in the ordinary course of business
or otherwise. Some risks may be unknown
to the Group and other risks, currently
regarded as immaterial, could turn out 
to be material.
UK customer service, brand and reputation
High wholesale prices and higher levels of
price volatility in the commodity markets
(see commodity prices below) have caused
all suppliers to increase prices to customers
which in turn have driven up customer
churn and adversely affected customers’
service levels. The Company has recently
engaged additional staff and implemented a
new billing system for residential customers
to help improve levels of customer service.
Further information on our approach to
customer service is available in the Corporate
Responsibility section on page 25.
Security of supply
As the indigenous gas reserves have
declined, the UK, and so the Company,
has become increasingly reliant on
supplies from mainland Europe and 
other parts of the world. Accordingly, a
key element of security of supply is access
to these reserves and the reliability of the
transmission and distribution networks
operated by third parties both in the 
UK and abroad. The potential threat of
terrorism in relation to certain markets 
and assets is an increasing risk.
To respond to this changing environment,
the Company has supported new
infrastructure development to bring gas 
to the UK. In addition we continue to take
steps to acquire assets to replace our
declining gas reserves. The Company will
continue to secure and develop such gas
and power assets in the UK and overseas
and continually review the security
arrangements to protect those assets.
Health, safety and the environment 
The Company faces inherent health and
safety risks due to the large scale onshore
and offshore assets that we operate, and
the millions of home visits our service
businesses in the UK and North America
make to customers each year. We are
committed to maintaining high standards of
health and safety, and our well developed
processes reflect this risk. Further
information on our approach to health 
and safety is available in the Corporate
Responsibility section on page 25.
The Company’s activities have an impact
on the environment. Climate change
presents risks and opportunities for our
business. The need for action to tackle
climate change was further emphasised 
in the Stern Review published in 2006.
Further information on our approach to
climate change is available in the Corporate
Responsibility section on page 25.
Outsourcing and offshoring
Centrica has entered into a number of
outsourcing contracts, some of which 
are offshore, in respect of certain support
functions for its UK and North America
businesses. As with any contractual
relationship, including outsourcing and
offshoring, there are significant inherent
risks to be considered and mitigated. 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Centrica, like all businesses, faces a number of risks and uncertainties as 
we conduct our operations. There are a number of risks that could impact the
Group’s long-term performance and steps are taken to understand and evaluate
these in order to achieve our objective of creating long-term, sustainable returns
for shareholders.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
The oversight and effective management
of complex contracts across multiple
service providers in the UK, North America
and India is a significant area of focus 
for Centrica’s management team. An
Outsourcing/Offshoring Governance
Group coordinates the Group’s approach
to outsourcing initiatives to ensure these
risks are properly managed.
Information systems
Large and effective information systems
are critical for the efficient management
and accurate billing of our customers and
to support our upstream trading activities.
Accordingly, the Company continues to
invest in such systems, most notably the
replacement of its UK customer management
systems. These extensive change
programmes are subject to implementation
risks and require the application of strong
project management and comprehensive
business continuity plans. 
Commodity prices
The Company’s energy requirements to
serve its gas and electricity customers are
dependent on the wholesale commodity
markets for gas, oil, coal, carbon and
power prices, all of which have been
volatile during 2006. While the outlook 
for 2007 suggests a more stable market
place, particularly in gas, driven by greater
liquidity as new pipelines to the UK come
into operation, this will always be subject
to external market events and factors.
Further consolidation particularly between
companies with significant upstream
resources could lead to a less liquid
market due to the reduction in available
counterparties with whom to trade. 
To manage this risk, the Company
optimises its asset and contract portfolio
based on comprehensive market analysis
and continuous assessment overseen by
the Financial Risk Management Committee.
The Company’s policy is to hedge a
proportion of the exposure for a number 
of years ahead matched to the underlying
profiles of our customers’ energy
requirements supplemented by the use 
of financial instruments such oil and gas
swaps, gas derivatives and bilateral
agreements for gas and power.
Consumption
Gas sales volumes, and to a lesser extent
electricity sales volumes, are affected by
temperature and other weather factors. 
In addition, customers’ demand behaviour
will be influenced by the national economic
climate, gas and electricity prices and an
increasing awareness of the environmental
impact of energy use. Furthermore, the
development and application of new
technologies, either from the use of
domestic energy generating units e.g.
micro-combined heat and power units,
and/or greater use of demand-side
management technology e.g. smart
metering, could affect demand in the
medium term. The Company monitors
consumption trends, develops weather
hedge strategies and seeks to inform
customers through the provision 
of energy saving advice and products. 
Level of competitive activity
The energy supply market in the UK is
highly competitive and increasingly so 
in North America. The Company also
operates in the competitive home 
services markets in both the UK and
North America. In the UK, competitive
pressures are increasing as existing
energy providers and other service
providers, such as insurance companies,
seek to strengthen their market position.
Active monitoring of customer trends and
competitor activity enables the Company 
to respond to changing circumstances 
by developing retention campaigns and
innovative customer propositions. 
The energy markets in the UK, North
America and Continental Europe are
subject to comprehensive operating
requirements as defined by the relevant
sector regulators and/or government
departments. As participants in these
markets, amendments to the regulatory
regime could have an impact on the
Company achieving its financial goals.
In the UK energy market, the regulator,
Ofgem, is undertaking a supply licence
review scheduled for completion in June
2007. The proposed changes were
published for the first time in December
2006 and Ofgem has proposed to retain
only a limited number of conditions that
are necessary for the energy market to
function properly and to protect the
interests of customers, in particular those
who are vulnerable. The final decision
document together with the new licence
conditions are expected in March 2007,
with the new licence conditions coming
into force in June 2007. The precise
extent of the remaining requirements 
is therefore uncertain. 
In January 2007, the regulated network
companies accepted Ofgem’s final
proposals for the five-year price controls
on gas and electricity transmission as 
well as a one-year price control on gas
distribution. The new arrangements will
apply to the network companies from 
1 April 2007. The proposals are expected
to result in an increase in transportation
charges, and so final prices to customers,
therefore potentially contributing to
customer churn. Ofgem is also conducting
a five-year gas distribution price control
review process. This activity will set
allowed revenues for the regulated gas
distribution network companies for the
period 2008 to 2013. As a supplier,
Centrica will be subject to any revisions to
policies or transportation charges resulting
from this review. At this early stage of the
process it is not possible to predict the
outcomes, and while all users of the gas
distribution networks would be affected,
this could again feed into higher costs 
and customer prices.
In July 2006, the Government published
its Energy Review entitled “The Energy
Challenge, Energy Review Report 2006”.
Policy consultations are currently ongoing
with an Energy White Paper expected in
Spring 2007. Centrica has been active
during this period of consultation to help
define policy on issues such as the future
of the Renewables Obligation and the
Energy Efficiency Commitment, measures
to improve the planning system for new
energy infrastructure projects and proposals
for changes to energy billing and metering.
We also continue to press for a firm
political commitment to the EU Emissions
Trading Scheme post-2012 which is
critical to new investment decisions 
being taken over the next few years. 
We have welcomed the Government
introduction of a Climate Change Bill
which sets in statute the Government’s
target to reduce carbon emissions by 60%
by 2050. We are moving ahead with the
commercial development and consenting
of our Teesside Carbon Capture and
Storage project. The final decision will
need to take into account the support
framework for low carbon technologies. 
There are positive signs regarding the
liberalisation of European energy markets.
In June, the EU Energy Commissioner
announced a strategic energy review that
has the creation of competitive markets at
its heart. The need for effective competition
is emphasised by the current level of
consolidation activity in Europe, with 
the potential emergence of national
champions, which could not only impact
our participation in Europe but also our
ability to source and transport gas across
continental Europe to the UK.

In North America, the risk of political 
or regulatory intervention remains an
uncertainty. In Texas, electricity competition
is currently under review by the Legislature
which could potentially lead to changes 
in market structure. In Ontario, we face
large scale electricity customer contract
renewals in a regulatory climate that 
is somewhat uncertain (especially with
respect to automatic renewals). In Alberta
the Department of Energy is mandated to
conduct a review regarding the progress
of the current competitive arrangements.
In order to mitigate these risks, we
continue to monitor political and regulatory
developments/agendas and engage 
with the relevant stakeholders through
comprehensive ongoing contact
programmes in place with regulators,
government ministers and senior officials.
Liquidity
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity
requirements for the Group are produced
frequently. These are stress-tested for
different scenarios and are reviewed
regularly by the Board to ensure that
sufficient headroom exists for at least a 
12-month period. The Group’s policy is 
to maintain a minimum level of committed
facilities and ensure that a proportion of debt
should be long-term and spread over a range
of maturities. As at 31 December 2006, the
Group had undrawn committed facilities 
of £1.3 billion, which were used to support
the US commercial paper programme. 
Currency 
Through wholly-owned US and Canadian
subsidiaries and wholly-owned and 
partly-owned European entities, the 
Group has operational exposure in US 
and Canadian dollars and euros. The
Group’s policy is to maintain the sterling
value of its foreign currency investment
through balance sheet hedging
instruments. Canadian dollar and euro
balance sheet translation exposure 
is hedged by maintaining a portfolio of
foreign currency financial liabilities which
approximate to the net asset value of 
the Canadian and euro-based operations.
US dollar balance sheet translation
exposure is hedged by borrowing 
on a short-term basis through a US
commercial paper programme.
All debt raised in US dollars through 
the US commercial paper programme
has been used as part of the translation
hedging operations described above. 
Interest rate 
The Group’s policy is to actively manage
interest rate risk on long-term borrowings
while ensuring that the exposure to fixed
rates remains within a 30% to 70% range.
This is achieved by using derivative
financial instruments, such as interest 
rate swaps, to adjust the interest basis 
of the portfolio of long-term debt. At the
year-end, debt had been raised on both 
a fixed and floating rate basis. 
Counterparty 
The Board’s policy is to limit counterparty
exposures by setting credit limits for each
counterparty, where possible by reference
to published credit ratings. Exposures are
measured in relation to the nature, market
value and maturity of each contract or
financial instrument. Surplus cash is
invested in short-term financial instruments
and only deposited with counterparties
with minimum credit rating of A3/A-/A-or
P1/A-1F1 from any Moody’s investors
served/Standard & Poor’s/Fitch Ratings
long-term and short-term ratings
respectively. Energy trading activities 
are undertaken with counterparties 
for whom specific credit limits are set. 
All contracted and potential exposures 
are reported to the Financial Risk
Management Committee. 
Pensions 
The Group maintains a variety of pension
schemes including defined benefit schemes.
The pension fund liabilities are partially
matched with a portfolio of assets, which
leaves potential risk around the mortality
rate, wage inflation and returns on assets.
In addition, actions by the Pensions
Regulators or the Trustees and/or any
material revisions to the existing pension
legislation could require increased
contributions by the Group to the 
pension fund.
Credit rating
The current strong credit rating of the
Group (long-term debt: A3 (Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s)), 
A negative outlook (Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services (S&P)); short-term debt: 
P-2 (Moody’s), A-1 negative outlook (S&P))
means that it benefits from high levels of
credit for its existing counterparty
relationships. Any material deterioration 
of this rating will mean that the Group 
will need to increase its levels of security
for existing energy procurement contracts
which may have a material effect on its
cash position or limit its ability to trade 
in commodity markets.

Mary Francis CBE
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and 
Chair, Centrica Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Centrica Group engages with a 
wide range of stakeholders in the UK 
and overseas, so that we can more
effectively manage the social, ethical and
environmental impact of our business
activities. We thereby seek to minimise
risk, create sustainable value for our
shareholders and contribute positively 
to wider economic development in the
regions in which we operate.
The Group’s business principles and
policies set out the standards of behaviour
we expect of our employees to ensure our
business is conducted in an ethical way.
We also encourage our business partners
to respect and adhere to our standards.
Information on our corporate

Source: PWC Saratoga – a measurement of ﬁnancial return for investment in employee remuneration, 
beneﬁts and training. CR governance 
At the beginning of the year, we changed
our governance arrangements for CR,
establishing a main board committee 
to lead our strategy. It is chaired by 
Mary Francis CBE, Centrica’s Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director, and
its members include the Managing Director
of each business unit. This reflects the
importance we attach to integrating CR 
in the business, its risk management and
strategic functions. During the year, we
focused on identifying the areas of Group
activity which have the greatest impact and
which present the most significant risks to
and opportunities for our business. 
The ever-growing need to address climate
change presents risks and opportunities
across our business. Upstream, we must
balance the economic and regulatory
aspects of emissions to ensure reliable
power supplies; downstream, there is a
significant and growing customer demand
for energy efficiency products and services;
and we know that whether or not we 
are perceived to be environmentally
responsible, increasingly affects our
reputation. Throughout our activities 
we aim to contribute to the creation of 
a sustainable, low-carbon future, while
ensuring the security of energy supplies. 
Mapping our carbon footprint
In order to develop a coordinated and
effective response to climate change we
undertook work to calculate the carbon
footprint of our operations. Our footprint 
– comprising emissions from power
generation, gas production and storage,
energy usage, fleet operations and
business travel – was 8.6 million tonnes 
of CO
2
/CO
2
e* in 2006. This work will
underpin our climate change strategy 
and determine how Centrica can adapt to
and mitigate against the effects of climate
change on the Company and on society
as a whole.
Carbon capture and storage
In addition to our ongoing investments in
wind farm developments, we announced
an acquisition with the opportunity to
participate, alongside partners, in the UK’s
first complete clean coal power generation
project. The project, in Teesside, would be
the first to couple integrated gasification
combined cycle technology with carbon
capture and storage capabilities. The
result would be a ‘clean coal’ power
station supplying electricity for British Gas
customers, together with a pipeline and
storage to capture the CO2 emissions.
Energy efficiency 
We continued to develop a range of energy
efficiency services to help customers reduce
their own carbon emissions. The British Gas
Energy Savers Report, a bespoke home
energy efficiency audit, was completed by
more than 1.5 million householders during
the year. In the business to business market,
both British Gas Business and Direct Energy
have innovative programmes to help
commercial customers reduce energy usage.
As a multi-national utility, providing
essential services to millions of customers
every day, understanding their evolving
needs is very important. Being responsible
and responsive in how we manage
relationships with our customers is 
central to our business strategy.
Investing in new systems
In 2006, we made significant progress in
installing a new multi-million pound billing
and customer management system 
in British Gas. During the process of
transferring customer accounts, we were
unable to maintain the high standards 
of service we strive for. Returning to 
an industry-leading position is a high 
priority for us. Our investments in new
systems, additional manpower and front-
line training are now delivering benefits 
to our customers.
Pricing 
High wholesale energy costs continued to
dominate the first half of the year. In the
UK this forced retail price increases from
all the major suppliers, including British
Gas. To lessen the impact, we created
innovative fixed price propositions and
developed a range of initiatives to help
millions of our most vulnerable customers.
For example, we committed to provide
£18.3 million of winter fuel rebates to
vulnerable customers. Our pricing policy
throughout this period of volatility has
been to protect customers by passing
through only a proportion of the full
wholesale market increases. We were
pleased to be the first UK supplier to
announce a price decrease for residential
customers. From 12 March 2007, we 
will reduce our standard tariffs for gas 
by 17% and for electricity by 11%. 
New social tariff
British Gas also introduced the UK’s
largest social energy tariff, aimed at cutting
gas and electricity bills for 750,000 of our
most vulnerable customers. The Essentials
Tariff provides additional help to vulnerable
customers, particularly those who use
prepayment meters.
The health and safety of our employees,
customers and others who could be affected
by our activities are a top priority for us. 
Our previously strong safety performance
was marred by two major incidents 
during the year. The first occurred when 
a pressure vessel on our Rough storage
facility failed catastrophically causing a 
gas release, explosion and residual fire. 
The crew evacuated but two people were
injured. The Health and Safety Executive
investigation concluded that this equipment
failure could not have been foreseen and
that the consequences of the failure were
lessened by our substantial investment in
the platform, its shutdown systems and
incident response arrangements since
acquisition in 2001.
The year ended on a tragic note with 
a helicopter accident in the Morecambe
Bay area which claimed the lives of six
people, four of them long-standing and
highly committed Centrica employees 
with a seventh person still missing,
presumed dead.  
Investigation indicates that neither
incident was the result of a defective 
safety management system within our 
own sphere of operations and that our
emergency response capability was 
rapid and comprehensive. However, in
both cases the impact on our employees
and their families has been traumatic
and tragic. We remain determined to
keep safety at the top of our agenda
and to be relentless in applying our zero
tolerance programmes.

Other than the two incidents described
above, we have continued to maintain 
our underlying improvement in safety
performance by reducing the injury
frequency rates in most businesses and
maintaining very low frequency rates in
others. Our performance is underpinned
by the application of a robust safety
management system, comprehensive
annual improvement plans, performance
targets and KPIs, throughout our UK and
international operations.
The calibre and the conduct of our 
people are central to building successful
relationships with our customers,
shareholders, suppliers and the
communities we serve. During 2006, 
the Group employed an average of 
33,718 people: 28,489 were employed 
in the UK; 5,032 in North America; and
197 in the rest of the world.
Engagement
Employees are regularly updated on our
performance against group strategy. Our
annual engagement survey measures the
attitudes and opinions of our employees.
In 2006, our overall engagement score
increased by 2% which, during a very
challenging period for the business,
demonstrates the commitment of our
people. The Group maintains regular
dialogue with representatives of local
employee consultative bodies and
recognised trade unions to ensure 
it fully understands employees’ views. 
Diversity and inclusion
The Group is committed to pursuing
equality and diversity in all its employment
activities and continues to support
initiatives to provide employment for
people from minority groups in the
community, including people with a
disability, carers and lone parents. To the
extent possible, people with a disability 
are offered the same employment training,
career development and promotion
opportunities as other employees. 
During the year we worked closely with
the Employers’ Forum on Age to prepare
for the introduction of the new UK age
regulations in October. An integrated
communication and training programme
was developed to support our employees
and managers, and we reviewed our
policies and procedures to maintain our
position as an inclusive employer.
Development and talent management
We invested over 400,000 hours in training
to equip our front-line employees with the
skills to use our new British Gas customer
management system. In addition we 
re-shaped our management learning
programme benefiting 800 managers. 
Our British Gas Engineering Academy
continued its work to recruit more women
and people from minority ethnic groups 
into our engineering workforce. We raised
awareness of careers in engineering
amongst young people.  
Reward
We continued to extend our flexible
benefits package and more than 10,400
employees now benefit from the scheme.
Our fourth annual equal pay audit showed
that the gender pay gap in Centrica
continues to narrow and compares very
favourably with published national norms. 
Centrica encourages employee share
ownership by operating a number of 
all-employee share schemes. In the 
UK 12,042 employees participated in
Sharesave and 6,031 participated in our
Share Incentive Plan. In North America
1,012 employees participated in our
Employee Share Purchase Plan.
By understanding our impact on the
communities in which we work, we can
develop successful partnerships that
benefit us both. We aim to deepen our
understanding of current issues of social
and environmental concern and contribute
to action that addresses them. We do this
by both supporting outside agencies and
encouraging our own employees to get
involved. In North America, Direct Energy
employees continued to take part in 
our ‘Dollars for Doers’ programme, with
paid time off to volunteer. In the UK, we
launched an initiative called ‘Centrica 
Get Involved’ enabling employees to take
advantage of volunteering opportunities
with paid time off from the Company.
During the year our people invested 
more than 13,000 hours of volunteering
activities, which equates to around
£300,000 of in-kind support. 
We must be attuned and responsive to 
the needs and opinions of our customers,
employees, suppliers and wider
stakeholder groups, and to emerging
changes in society and government. This
engagement is a continuous and dynamic
process which at every level – from our
Chief Executive meeting a senior politician,
to one of our engineers talking with a
customer – helps us shape our future
business direction. 
During 2006, we listened to our
stakeholder groups through direct
dialogue and a range of surveys. While
approaching particular issues from varying
perspectives, there was broad agreement
with our identification of key CR impact
areas. We will continue to listen to views
and respond to any concerns. 
Working with our suppliers
We made particular progress during the
year on engaging with our suppliers. We
ran a successful briefing session for our
group commercial team on managing CR
in our supply chain and hosted a round
table discussion on current and future
trends in supply chain responsibility with
11 of our main suppliers.
Helping to shape the policy environment
Centrica operates in highly regulated
markets. Public policy decisions
significantly affect all aspects of our
business operations from investment
decisions and entry into new markets, 
to consumer protection and employment
relations. We are committed to playing a
full and active role in the political process
to support the creation of an optimal
policy environment that will allow our
business to thrive, move towards a low-
carbon environment and deliver secure
energy supplies for our customers. 
During the year, we participated in
numerous policy consultations, principally
on energy and environmental matters. In
addition, our sustained efforts to push for
the creation of a fully liberalised European
energy market were rewarded when the
EU Energy Commissioner announced a
strategic energy review that has the creation
of competitive markets at its heart.
Investing in communities 
We contributed £7.4 million

to community causes through a
combination of cash, time and
in-kind support

Engaging stakeholders 
Our stakeholder groups
broadly concur with 
our identiﬁcation of key 
impact areas
1 Cash donations in the UK during the year amounted to £6.1 million (2005: £6.7 million). This included a donation of £3 million to the British Gas Energy Trust, which
supports vulnerable customers. In line with Group policy, no donations were made for political purposes. The Group, in the normal course of its business, has paid for 
its management to attend events at which politicians and other opinion-formers have been present, but does not consider these payments to be political donations.

Corporate Governance Report 
 
30
The Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. Throughout the year, the Company fully complied  
with the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the ‘Code’) save for the early adoption of the 2006 
revision to the Code as explained in the Remuneration Report on 
page 34. The Company applied the principles of the Code as set 
out in this report. 
The Board 
An effective Board of Directors leads and controls the Group. The 
Board, which met eight times during the year, has a schedule of 
matters reserved for its approval. This schedule and the terms of 
reference for the Executive, Audit, Remuneration, Nominations, 
Corporate Responsibility and Disclosure Committees are available 
on request and on our website www.centrica.com. 
The Board is responsible for: 
 the development of strategy and major policies; 
 the review of management performance; 
 the approval of the annual operating plan, the financial 
statements and major acquisitions and disposals; 
 the system of internal control; and 
 corporate governance. 
One of its meetings each year is substantially devoted to the 
development of strategy. Comprehensive briefing papers, including 
financial information, are circulated to each Director a week prior  
to Board meetings. A procedure is in place for Directors to obtain 
independent-professional advice in respect of their duties. The 
Directors also have access to the advice and services of the 
General Counsel & Company Secretary.  
Overall attendance by Directors at meetings during 2006 was: 
96% for the Board; 82% for the Audit Committee; 80% for the 
Remuneration Committee; 92% for the Nominations Committee; 
100% for the Corporate Responsibility Committee and 100% for the 
Disclosure Committee. The following Directors gave their apologies 
for absence in respect of one or more meetings: Helen Alexander 
(one Board, one Audit); Mary Francis (one Remuneration); 
Patricia Mann (two Audit, one Remuneration); Sam Laidlaw (one 
Nominations); Andrew Mackenzie (one Board, one Remuneration); 
Paul Rayner (two Remuneration); and Paul Walsh (one Board, one 
Audit, one Nominations, three Remuneration).  
Non-attendance at meetings was due to prior business or 
personal commitments and illness. Directors unable to attend  
Board or Committee meetings reviewed the relevant papers and 
provided comments to the Chairman or Committee Chairman,  
as appropriate. Each of the Non-Executive Directors has given  
an assurance to the Chairman and the Board that they remain 
committed to their role as a Non-Executive Director of the Company 
and will ensure that they devote sufficient time to it, including 
attendance at Board and Committee meetings. 
Board membership 
The names of the Directors and their biographical details, including 
the Board Committee membership, appears on page 29.  
Patricia Mann retired from the Board on 19 May 2006. On  
1 July 2006, Sam Laidlaw was appointed to the Board, succeeding 
Sir Roy Gardner, who retired on 30 June, as Chief Executive. Mark 
Clare resigned from the Board on 30 September 2006. On  
1 March 2007, Phil Bentley will be appointed as Managing Director, 
British Gas and Nick Luff will be appointed to the Board to replace 
him as Group Finance Director.  
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive, which has been formalised  
in writing and agreed by the Board; and there is a balance of 
Executive and independent Non-Executive Directors.  
Throughout the year, the Chairman and the other Non-Executive 
Directors were independent of management. In December 2006,  
as part of its annual review of corporate governance, the Board 
considered the independence of the Non-Executive Directors (other 
than the Chairman) against the criteria in the Code and determined 
that each remained independent. Patricia Mann remained 
independent until her retirement from the Board.  
Mary Francis succeeded Patricia Mann as the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director on 19 May 2006. 
Responsibilities of the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
include being available to shareholders if they have concerns that 
contact through the normal channels has failed to resolve or for 
which such contact is inappropriate.  
Throughout the year, the Non-Executive Directors, including  
the Chairman, met independently of management on a regular basis.  
Full details of Directors’ service contracts, emoluments and 
share interests can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 
34 to 41. 
Board appointments, evaluation and training 
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board. This is described in the 
section on the Nominations Committee below. All Directors joining 
the Board are required to submit themselves for election at the  
AGM following their appointment. Thereafter, they are subject to  
re-election every third year. The Non-Executive Directors are initially 
appointed for a three-year term and, subject to rigorous review and 
re-election, can serve up to a maximum of three such terms. In 
accordance with the Articles of Association, Roger Carr, Phil Bentley, 
Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff will retire from office at the 2007 AGM. 
Upon the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, Roger 
Carr and Phil Bentley will be proposed for re-election to serve further 
three-year terms and, being their first AGM since their respective 
appointments to the Board, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff will be 
proposed for election to serve initial three-year terms.  
During the year, the Board conducted, with the assistance  
of an independent external facilitator, JCA Group, a formal and 
rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its 
Committees and individual Directors. The Board evaluation built on 
the positive results and output from the previous year’s evaluation 
and covered a number of topics including the effectiveness of the 
Chairman and the Board as a whole, the individual contributions of 
the Non-Executive and Executive Directors, the mix of skills on the 
Board, the development of our strategy, risk management, Board 
processes and links between the Board and the businesses.  
The process adopted involved the same facilitator interviewing 
separately each of the Directors and the General Counsel & 
Company Secretary. In addition, the Senior Independent  
Non-Executive Director chaired a meeting of the independent  
Non-Executive Directors in the absence of the Chairman to appraise  
the Chairman’s performance. The output from those interviews  
was compiled into a report prepared by the facilitator and this was 
presented to the Board at its meeting in November 2006, along  
with a number of recommendations to address the issues raised.  
The evaluation report concluded that during the year, the  
Board had made significant progress in terms of addressing the  
key strategic challenges facing the Group, as well as the operational 
issues. The report also concluded that the appointment of a Chief 
Executive with extensive upstream experience would strengthen the 
workings of the Board. 
The Board will continue to review its procedures, its effectiveness 
and development in the year ahead.  
As part of the performance management system that applies  
to management at all levels across the Group, the Chief Executive’s 
performance is reviewed regularly by the Chairman and that of the 
other Executive Directors by the Chief Executive. The Remuneration 
Committee assesses the performance of the Executive Directors in  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

connection with its determination of remuneration levels as 
explained in the Remuneration Report on pages 34-41. 
The Directors receive ongoing training including an induction 
programme tailored to meet the needs of the individual. At Board 
meetings, the Directors also receive regular updates on changes 
and developments to the business, and to the legislative and 
regulatory environments. During the year, the Board was briefed on: 
commodity risk and hedging strategy; the risks and opportunities  
of upstream exploration activities; directors’ liabilities, including the 
new requirements relating to disclosure of information to the 
auditors; and the new narrative reporting requirements for the 
Annual Report and Accounts. 
Board committees 
The Board has delegated authority to a number of committees to deal 
with specific aspects of the management and control of the Group.  
The minutes of the meetings of these committees are made 
available to all the Directors on a timely basis. 
Board Committee membership was strengthened during the 
year, with all of the independent Non-Executive Directors now being 
members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. 
This membership structure gives the independent Non-Executive 
Directors detailed insight into the nature of the matters being 
discussed, brings continuity to membership and avoids undue 
reliance on particular individuals.  
The Corporate Responsibility Committee, formerly a sub-
committee of the Executive Committee, became a formal committee 
of the Board on 1 March 2006. 
Executive Committee 
During 2006, the Executive Committee comprised: the Executive 
Directors; the General Counsel & Company Secretary; the 
Managing Director, Centrica North America; the Group Human 
Resources Director; and the Managing Director, British Gas 
Services. Sam Laidlaw succeeded Sir Roy Gardner as Chairman of 
the Committee on 1 July. Mark Clare resigned from the Committee 
on 30 September. The Committee meets weekly to oversee the 
management of the Group and is the decision-making body for 
those matters not reserved to the Board and within the limits set out 
in the Group’s delegated authority and expenditure control policy. 
The following, with membership drawn from among Executive 
Directors and senior management, are sub-committees of the 
Executive Committee: the Group Risk Management Committee,  
the Group Financial Risk Management Committee and the Health, 
Safety and Environment Committee.  
Audit Committee 
During 2006, the Audit Committee comprised Paul Rayner 
(Chairman), Helen Alexander, Mary Francis, Andrew Mackenzie, 
Paul Walsh and Patricia Mann (until 19 May). Paul Rayner, the 
finance director of a FTSE 100 company, is identified as having 
recent and relevant financial experience, as required by the Code. 
The Audit Committee, which reports its findings to the Board,  
is authorised to: 
 monitor the integrity of the interim and annual financial statements, 
including a review of the significant financial reporting judgements 
contained in them; 
 review the Company’s internal financial controls, internal control 
and risk management systems; 
 monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function; 
 establish and oversee the Company’s relationship with  
the external auditors, including the monitoring of their 
independence; and 
 monitor matters raised pursuant to the Company’s 
whistleblowing arrangements. 
In 2006, the Audit Committee met four times and discharged  
its responsibilities as set out in its terms of reference. It received 
comprehensive reports from the Director of Business Assurance, 
senior management and the external auditors. The Committee 
commissioned further reports in response to developing issues, as 
appropriate, and, in respect of all ongoing issues, requested clear 
objectives, timetables and achievement milestones against which 
performance could be monitored.  
Significant areas of review during the year included the 
implementation of the new British Gas billing system, the risk  
control framework and risk mitigation, the risk profile of the Group’s 
business model, information security, gas imbalance and debt 
management, and compliance with the undertakings in respect of 
Centrica Storage Ltd. At each of its meetings, the Committee met 
with the external auditors, and separately with the Director of 
Business Assurance, in the absence of management. The issues 
discussed by the Committee and the conclusions reached were 
reported by the Committee Chairman to the next Board meeting. 
Note 5 to the Financial Statements on page 59 sets out the 
Group’s policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancies 
and advisory projects. The Board has approved policies that restrict 
the types of non-audit work that can be undertaken by the external 
auditors and restrict the employment by the Group of former 
employees of the external audit firms. The award of non-audit work 
within categories that the external auditors are permitted to carry out 
under the Board-approved policies is subject to pre-clearance by the 
Audit Committee if the fee exceeds specified thresholds. All non-
audit assignments awarded to the external auditors are reported to 
the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis, along with a full 
breakdown of non-audit fees incurred during the year. 
As a matter of best practice and in accordance with 
International Standard on Auditing (UK & Ireland) 260 and Ethical 
Statement 1 issued by the Accounting Practices Board, the external 
auditors have held discussions with the Audit Committee on the 
subject of auditor independence and have confirmed their 
independence in writing. 
Remuneration Committee 
The composition and responsibilities of the Remuneration 
Committee, together with an explanation of how it applies the 
principles of the Code in setting Executive Directors’ remuneration 
are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 41.  
Nominations Committee 
During 2006, the Nominations Committee comprised Roger Carr 
(Chairman), Helen Alexander, Paul Walsh, from 1 July, Sam Laidlaw 
and, from 19 May, Mary Francis, Andrew Mackenzie and Paul 
Rayner. Patricia Mann and Sir Roy Gardner were members of the 
Committee until 19 May and 30 June, respectively. Throughout the 
year, a majority of the Committee’s members were independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board for  
the appointment of replacement or additional Directors. It is also 
responsible for succession planning and Board evaluation. The 
Committee reviews the balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board against current and future requirements of the 
Company and, as appropriate, draws up a list of required attributes.  
During the year, the Committee met four times and considered 
the succession to Sir Roy Gardner as Chief Executive and Phil 
Bentley as Group Finance Director, for which external consultants 
were engaged. The Committee also considered the interim 
executive responsibilities prior to the commencement of a new 
Group Finance Director, the reappointment of Directors retiring  
by rotation at the AGM, the Board evaluation process (described 
above) and succession planning.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

Corporate Responsibility Committee 
Since the Corporate Responsibility Committee became a committee 
of the Board on 1 March 2006, it has comprised Mary Francis 
(Chairman) and senior management drawn from across the Group. 
Phil Bentley has been appointed to the Committee, with  
effect from 1 March 2007 and Mark Clare was a member until  
30 September 2006. The role of the Committee and details of the  
work it undertook during the year can be found on pages 24 to 26.  
Disclosure Committee 
The Disclosure Committee, which met regularly during the year, 
comprised the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and  
the General Counsel & Company Secretary. The Committee has 
responsibility for implementing and monitoring systems and controls 
in respect of the management and disclosure of inside information.  
Relations with shareholders 
The Company has a programme of communication with its 
shareholders. As well as share price information, news releases and 
annual reports, the Centrica website includes speeches from the 
AGM, presentations to the investment community and a section  
on shareholder services. 
As the website contains a wealth of up-to-date information, the 
Company wishes to use this as a primary means of communication 
with shareholders and a resolution to that effect will be proposed  
at the 2007 AGM. Shareholders can register to receive all their 
communications online, benefiting both themselves and the Company. 
The Board also believes that the AGM presents an important 
opportunity for dialogue with private shareholders, many of whom 
are also our customers. At the AGM, the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive present a review of the businesses of the Group. 
Representatives from across the Group are available to answer 
questions both before and after the meeting. 
All shareholders have the opportunity to cast their votes in 
respect of proposed AGM resolutions by proxy, either electronically 
or by post. Shareholders can cast their votes online by logging onto 
www.sharevote.co.uk, further details of which are provided in the 
Notice of Meeting. Shareholders who hold their shares within CREST 
can cast their votes by proxy using the CREST electronic proxy 
appointment service.  
The Company also holds regular meetings with its major 
shareholders. The Chairman attends the meetings at which the 
annual and interim results are presented to major investors and 
analysts. During the year, the Chairman met with a number of major 
institutional shareholders to gain a first-hand understanding of any 
issues or concerns they may have had. He reported his findings to 
the Board. This was in addition to the formal independent reports of 
investor feedback that are included with the papers for each Board 
meeting. An independent survey of shareholder opinion was also 
conducted during the year and the results of this survey were 
presented to the Board.  
Internal control 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
Identification, assessment and management of risks 
The Company places great importance on internal control and risk 
management. A risk-aware and control-conscious environment is 
promoted and encouraged throughout the Group. The Board, either 
directly or through its committees, sets objectives, performance 
targets and policies for management of key risks facing the Group. 
Details of the principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 
21 to 23 of this report. At each of its four meetings in 2006, the 
Audit Committee received a comprehensive internal control report,  
which allowed it to track a number of issues, monitor performance 
against objectives and ensure that necessary actions were taken to 
remedy any significant failings or weaknesses identified from those 
reports. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported the issues 
discussed and conclusions reached at the following Board meeting. 
Across the Group, each business has a Risk Management 
Committee that seeks to identify, assess and advise on the 
management of operational risks. In addition, the Group Risk 
Management Committee considers the risks that might affect  
the Company at Group level. The processes of newly-acquired 
companies are integrated with those of the Group. Centrica Storage 
Ltd, which is subject to undertakings given to the Secretary of State 
for Trade and Industry, operates separately but to the same standards 
of internal control and risk management as the rest of the Group. 
Assurance 
The business assurance function undertakes internal audit reviews 
according to a plan approved by the Audit Committee. The results 
of its work are reported to Audit Committee meetings. 
The Board’s review of the system of internal control 
The Board, with the advice of the Audit Committee, has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the system of internal control operated, as 
described above, throughout the period from 1 January 2006 to  
the date of this report and is satisfied that the Group complies  
with the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Board has a reasonable expectation that 
the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, we continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements, 
which are shown on pages 43 to 110. 
Directors’ Responsibility Statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing, in respect of each 
financial year, a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration Report and 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law, regulations 
and accounting standards. In preparing the Financial Statements, 
the Directors are responsible for ensuring that they give a true  
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group  
at the end of the financial year and the profit or loss of the Group  
for that period. 
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) pursuant to Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulations. The Parent Company Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. The 
Directors’ Report and the Remuneration Report have been 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and  
the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.  
In preparing the Financial Statements the Directors are  
required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements; and 
 prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business.  
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the Financial Statements.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

Other Statutory Information 
 
33
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Disclosure of information to auditors 
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that: so far as he/she is aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and he/she has taken all steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make him/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.  
Other Statutory Information
 
Directors 
Full details of Directors’ service contracts, emoluments and share

Directors’ indemnities 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Company entered into a deed of indemnity to the extent permitted 
by law with each of the Directors and the General Counsel & 
Company Secretary in 2006.  
The Company purchased and maintained directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance throughout 2006, which was renewed  
for 2007. Neither the indemnity nor insurance provide cover in the 
event that the Director or the General Counsel & Company 
Secretary is proved to have acted fraudulently. 
Major acquisitions and disposals 
Full details of acquisitions and disposals are disclosed in the 
Business Review on pages 5 to 26 and note 28 on page 85.

Events after the balance sheet date are disclosed in note 35 on 
page 102. 
Related party transactions 
Related party transactions are set out in note 32 on pages 91 to 92. 
Creditor payment policy 
It is the Group’s policy to: 
 agree the terms of payment in advance with the supplier; 
 ensure that suppliers are aware of the terms of payment; and 
 pay in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations.  
The number of days’ purchases outstanding as at 31 December 2006 
was 32 (2005: 34) for the Group (excluding Accord Energy Ltd) and

Authority to purchase shares 
The Company was authorised at the 2006 AGM to purchase its 
own shares, within certain limits and as permitted by the Articles of 
Association. A renewal of this authority will be proposed at the 2007 
AGM. Shares repurchased may be cancelled or retained as treasury 
shares to accommodate requirements for shares under the Group’s 
share incentive schemes. 
As part of a share repurchase programme a total of 8,950,000 
shares, each with a nominal value of 6
14
/81 pence, were repurchased 
and cancelled during the year for an aggregate consideration of  
£23 million. This comprised 0.2% of the issued share capital.  
The programme was suspended in February 2006. 
Material shareholdings 
At 21 February 2007, Centrica had received notice of the following 
material shareholdings pursuant to the Companies Act 1985:

voting rights attaching to Centrica shares pursuant to the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules. 
Auditors 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have expressed their willingness  
to be reappointed as auditors of the Company. Upon the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee, resolutions to reappoint 
them as the Company’s auditors and to authorise the Directors to

Remuneration Report 
 
34
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee 
During 2006, the Remuneration Committee comprised Helen 
Alexander (Chairman), Mary Francis, Paul Rayner, Paul Walsh  
and, from 21 February, Andrew Mackenzie. Patricia Mann was  
a member of the Committee until 19 May and, by way of early 
adoption of the 2006 revision to the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the ‘Code’), Roger Carr was a member from 26 July. 
The Committee met seven times during 2006. The Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference are available at www.centrica.com.  
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within 
formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework of executive 
remuneration and its cost to the Company. The Committee is also 
responsible for the implementation of remuneration policy and 
determining specific remuneration packages for each of the 
Executive Directors. It has access to the advice and views of the 
Group Reward Director (Cathy Aldwinckle), the Group Human 
Resources Director (Anne Minto), the General Counsel & Company 
Secretary (Grant Dawson), the Chief Executive (Sam Laidlaw, who 
replaced Sir Roy Gardner in July 2006) and external consultants.  
During the year, Kepler Associates (Kepler) acted as 
independent executive remuneration adviser to the Company  
and the Committee, having been formally appointed in 2005. The 
Committee also consulted, but did not formally appoint, Towers 
Perrin. Both remuneration consultants provided advice on 
executive compensation to assist in the formulation of the 
Committee’s recommendations. 
This report, which will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM 
for approval, explains how the Company has applied the principles 
of the Code that relate to Directors’ remuneration during the year. 
No Director is involved in the determination of, or votes on any 
matter relating to, his or her own remuneration. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy and framework 
It is the role of the Committee to ensure that the Group’s 
remuneration policy and framework provides competitive reward 
for its Executive Directors and other senior executives, taking into 
account the Company’s performance, the markets in which it 
operates and pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
In constructing the remuneration packages, the Committee 
aims to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each executive. Accordingly, a significant proportion 
of the remuneration package depends on the attainment of 
demanding performance objectives, both short- and long-term. 
The annual bonus scheme is designed to incentivise and reward 
the achievement of demanding financial and business related 
objectives. Long-term share-based incentives are designed to align 
the interests of Executive Directors and other senior executives 
with the longer-term interests of shareholders by rewarding them 
for delivering sustained increased shareholder value.  
In agreeing the level of base salaries and the performance-
related elements of the remuneration package, the Committee 
considers the potential maximum remuneration that executives 
could receive. The Committee reviews the packages and varies 
individual elements when appropriate from year to year. 
The Committee, assisted by Kepler and the internal advisers 
named above, conducted a thorough review of the Group’s 
executive incentive arrangements in late 2005 and early 2006.  
The purpose of this review was to ensure that the incentive 
arrangements: provided a strong alignment with the delivery of 
value to shareholders; reflected current best practice, while 
meeting the Group’s particular business needs; and would enable 
the Group to continue to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre 
management in a highly-challenging business environment. 
Following this review, the Committee proposed changes  
to the future policy and framework of executive remuneration 
arrangements in line with the above objectives and these were 
endorsed by shareholders upon the approval of new share-based 
incentive schemes at the 2006 AGM.  
In 2006, executive remuneration comprised base salary, 
annual performance bonus, an allocation of shares under the new 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), which was approved at the 
2006 AGM and, as part of the transitional arrangements to the new 
policy, a grant of options in April under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme (ESOS). In 2007, executive remuneration will comprise the 
above, but participation in the new Deferred and Matching Share 
Scheme (DMSS), based on the annual performance bonus in 
respect of 2006, will replace the ESOS. 
No further ESOS grants will be made on a regular basis, 
although the Committee will retain the discretion to make grants 
under the ESOS in the future if there are exceptional circumstances 
in which it considers it appropriate to do so. 
As a result of the changes under the new policy, the Committee 
expects that total remuneration for median performance will remain 
unchanged, but that total remuneration for upper quartile 
performance will be increased in line with market practice. 
A minimum shareholding policy requires the retention of a value 
of shares as follows: the Chief Executive – twice his base salary; all 
other Executive Directors – 1.25 times their base salary; and those 
senior executives immediately below Board level – base salary. 
The Centrica Management Pension Scheme (a contributory 
final salary arrangement) was closed to new employees on 30 June 
2003. Executive Directors in office prior to this date participated in 
that scheme during 2006. Alternative arrangements are made for 
new employees, including Executive Directors, after that date. Full 
disclosure of the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors 
are given on page 41. 
The Committee believes that these arrangements, which are 
further explained below, are important in providing a potential 
remuneration package that will attract, retain and continue to 
motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives in a 
marketplace that is challenging and competitive in both commercial 
and human resource terms. It is intended that this remuneration 
policy and framework, which is fully endorsed by the Board, will 
continue for 2007 and succeeding years. 
In 2006, the total compensation of the Executive  
Directors, detailed on page 37, consisted of components  
in the following proportions:

Note: Salary and benefits are the actual amounts received during 2006; other payments 
include an initial payment and salary supplement in lieu of pension paid to Sam Laidlaw –  
see page 41; pension, for those directors in the Centrica Management Pension Scheme,  
is the increase in actual transfer value for 2006 over the notional transfer value for 2005 less 
the Director’s contributions during 2006; pension for Sam Laidlaw is the actual amount  
of the contribution made by the Company to his personal pension; performance bonus  
is that payable in respect of 2006; and ESOS and LTIS are the estimated value, based  
on a Black-Scholes model, of the awards made in 2006, provided that all performance 
conditions are met in full at the end of the relevant performance periods.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

Components of remuneration 
Base salary 
The Committee seeks to establish a base salary for each Executive 
Director and other senior executives, determined by individual 
performance and having regard to market salary levels for similar 
positions in comparable companies derived from independent 
sources. Base salaries are reviewed annually. Base salary is the 
only element of remuneration that is pensionable. 
Annual performance bonus 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the annual 
performance bonus scheme to ensure that it remains competitive 
in the marketplace, continues to incentivise the Executive Directors 
and other senior executives and aligns their interests with those of 
shareholders. For 2006, the maximum bonus payable to Executive 
Directors, should every element of every objective be achieved in 
full, was 125% of base salary. The maximum bonus payable to 
other senior executives immediately below Board level, assuming 
all objectives are achieved in full, ranges between 100% and 
125%. In 2006, the maximum achievable bonus related to financial 
performance targets and business-related targets split, 64% and 
36% respectively for Executive Directors and 60% and 40% 
respectively for executives immediately below Board level. 20%  
of any annual bonus paid in 2007 will be deferred automatically  
and invested in the DMSS (see below). In line with current policy,  
a bonus will be forfeited if overall performance is deemed to 
Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) 
The initial award under the DMSS will be made in 2007 based  
on the 2006 annual bonus. 20% of the annual bonus payable to 
Executive Directors and other senior executives will be deferred 
automatically for a period of three years and invested in Centrica 
shares (deferred shares), during which time they cannot be 
withdrawn. Participants may elect to invest an additional amount 
in Centrica shares (investment shares) to be funded from actual 
bonus payable or the release of LTIS shares only which, when 
added to the value of the deferred shares, will bring the total 
amount invested up to 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus 
entitlement in respect of the preceding year. Deferred and 
investment shares will be matched with conditional shares 
(matching shares), which will be released upon the achievement, 
over a three-year period, of demanding three-year cumulative 
group economic profit performance targets. The number of 
matching shares that vest will be determined on a straight-line 
basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit to  
a two-times match for growth of 25% or above. To provide a  
closer alignment with the interests of shareholders, the number of 
matching shares that are released following the satisfaction of the 
performance condition will be increased to reflect the dividends 
that would have been paid during the three-year performance 
period. In the event of a change of control the number of matching 
shares that vest will be subject to time apportionment in line with 
best practice. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
As part of the transitional arrangements from the old remuneration 
policy adopted in 2001 and the new policy as outlined above and 
adopted in 2006, a grant of options was made in April, equal to 
200% of base salary and, at the same or lower rates, to certain 
other senior executives. Details of options granted to Executive 
Directors are shown on page 40.  
If, and to the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied, 
options normally become exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant. Performance 
conditions are based on the extent to which growth in the 
Company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS growth) exceeds 
growth in the Retail Prices Index (RPI growth) over a three-year 
performance period. 
In respect of each grant of options, the Committee has 
determined that, for the option to be exercisable in full, EPS growth 
must exceed RPI growth by 18 percentage points or more over the 
three-year performance period. No part of the option grant will be 
exercisable if EPS growth fails to exceed RPI growth by at least  
9 percentage points over the performance period. The proportion 
of the option grant exercisable by the executive will increase on a 
sliding scale between 40% and 100% if EPS growth exceeds RPI 
growth by between 9 and 18 percentage points over the 
performance period. 
Options granted from 2001 to March 2004 under the ESOS 
permitted the Company’s EPS to be measured annually for a 
further two years from the date of grant of the options, with the 
performance conditions increasing proportionately. Having 
reviewed market practice regarding the retesting of performance 
measures, the Committee removed this element in respect of all 
option grants from September 2004.  
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) 
Following shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM, a new LTIS was 
introduced pursuant to which conditional allocations of shares up 
to a maximum of 200% of base salary may be made to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives.  
In 2006, LTIS allocations equal to 150% of base salary were 
awarded to Executive Directors and, at lower rates, to certain other 
senior executives. The maximum number of shares that could be 
transferred to each Executive Director upon satisfaction of the 
performance conditions in full appears on page 39. 
The release of allocations will be subject to performance 
conditions over a three-year period:  
 half the shares in each allocation are subject to a performance 
condition based on the Company’s EPS growth relative to the 
growth in RPI. To vest in full, EPS growth must exceed RPI 
growth by 30 percentage points or more over the performance 
period. No part of the award will vest if EPS growth fails to 
exceed RPI growth by at least 9 percentage points over the 
performance period. The proportion of the award that will vest 
will increase on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%  
if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between 9 and 30 
percentage points over the performance period; and 
 the other half of the shares in each allocation are subject  
to a performance condition based on the Company’s Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the other 99 
companies in the FTSE 100 on the date of award with vesting 
reducing on a straight-line basis from 100% for upper quintile 
ranking to 25% for median ranking performance. 
To create a closer alignment with the interests of shareholders, 
the number of shares that are released following the satisfaction of 
the performance conditions will be increased to reflect the dividends 
that would have been paid during the three-year performance period. 
In the event of a change of control the number of shares that vest 
will be subject to time apportionment in line with best practice.

Prior to 2006, allocations of shares were made annually to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives under the old LTIS, in 
accordance with the remuneration policy adopted in 2001.  
Such allocations are released to the participant under normal 
circumstances after the three-year performance period, provided, 
and to the extent that, the performance conditions have been met. 
The actual number of shares released to the participant 
depends on the Company’s TSR over the performance period 
relative to the LTIS comparator group. The maximum annual 
allocation of shares only vests and is released to the executive if 
the Company’s TSR over the performance period is ranked in 25th 
position or above relative to the 99 other companies in the LTIS 
comparator group. No shares vest if the TSR over the performance 
period is ranked below 50th position in the LTIS comparator group. 
Between 25th and 50th position, shares vest on a sliding scale 
from 100% to 40%. 
The Committee has determined that, for the pre 2006 LTIS 
and for that part of the new LTIS subject to the comparative TSR 
performance conditions, the most appropriate comparator group 
for the Company is the companies comprising the FTSE 100 at the 
start of the relevant performance period (the LTIS comparator group). 
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of the performance 
measures and the specific targets set when considering each new 
allocation of shares under the LTIS. 
Prior to the release of share allocations under both the old  
and new LTIS arrangements, the Committee reviews whether the 
extent to which the performance conditions have been achieved is 
a genuine reflection of the Company’s financial performance. In 
assessing the extent of satisfaction of the performance conditions, 
the Committee uses data provided by Alithos Ltd (an independent 
third party) in respect of comparative TSR and audited figures in 
respect of adjusted EPS. 
Performance conditions under IFRS 
Following the adoption of IFRS in 2005, the Committee agreed, 
having taken advice from Kepler and having consulted with the ABI 
and the RREV, to continue with the financial target of economic 
profit in respect of the annual performance bonus and new DMSS 
and EPS in respect of the ESOS and the new LTIS, subject to 
certain adjustments to the figures calculated in accordance with 
IFRS. It was agreed that for the purposes of determining 
performance in respect of those schemes the relevant figures 
produced under IFRS should be adjusted for exceptional items  
and certain re-measurements arising on the application of IAS 32 
and IAS 39.

The above table compares the Company’s TSR performance  
with that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five years ended  
31 December 2006. 
As required by Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, a rolling 
definition of the FTSE 100 has been used, whereas the definition 
used for the purposes of the LTIS is the FTSE 100 as constituted 
at the beginning of the period. In order to demonstrate the delivery 
of shareholder value during the relevant performance period, the 
TSR graph for the LTIS award that vested in April 2006 is shown 
on page 39. 
Funding of share schemes  
In order to satisfy the release of shares under the LTIS and meet the 
requirements of the ESOS in 2006 newly-issued shares were used. 
It is the Company’s current intention to satisfy the requirements  
of its share schemes, in a method best suited to the interests of  
the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject 
to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares or using shares held 
in treasury. 
Pension 
The pension arrangements of the Executive Directors are fully 
disclosed on page 41. 
Other employment benefits 
In common with other senior management, Executive Directors  
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a company car, life 
assurance, private medical insurance and a financial counselling 
scheme. Such benefits are subject to financial limits as set out in 
appropriate policies. They are also eligible to participate in the 
Company’s HMRC-approved Sharesave Scheme and Share 
Incentive Plan, which are open to all eligible employees on the same 
basis, providing a long-term savings and investment opportunity. 
Service contracts 
It is the Company’s policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors’ service contracts does not exceed one year. The 
Executive Directors’ service contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate  
the employment by giving one year’s written notice and that the 
Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.  
In the case of new external appointments to the Board, the 
Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code,  
in order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It therefore 
reserves the right to offer contracts which contain an initial notice 
period in excess of one year, provided that after the first such 
period the notice reduces to one year. The Committee exercised 
this discretion in respect of the appointment of Sam Laidlaw, 
whose service contract allows for an initial notice period of two 
years. His notice period will reduce to one year in July 2008.  
The dates of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are  
set out in the table on page 37. 
External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Board believes that experience of other companies’ practices 
and challenges is valuable both for the personal development of  
its Executive Directors and for the Company. It is therefore the 
Company’s policy to allow each Executive Director to accept one 
non-executive directorship of another company, although the Board 
retains the discretion to vary this policy. Fees received in respect of 
external appointments are retained by the individual Director.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

In 2006, Phil Bentley received £57,417 as a Non-Executive Director 
of Kingfisher plc, and in respect of the period they were a director 
of the Company, Sam Laidlaw received £29,000 as a Non-
Executive Director of Hanson plc, Mark Clare received £28,250 as 
a Non-Executive Director of BAA plc and Sir Roy Gardner received 
£50,000 as a Non-Executive Director of Compass Group plc. 
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman do not hold 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles  
of Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown  
in the table below. Roger Carr’s letter of appointment contains  
a six-month notice period. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors 
are approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the 
Executive Committee, whose members are: the Executive Directors 
(Sam Laidlaw, Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich); and four other senior 
executives (Grant Dawson, General Counsel & Company Secretary; 
Deryk King, Managing Director, North America; Anne Minto, Group 
Human Resources Director; and Chris Weston, Managing Director, 
British Gas Services). 
Centrica’s policy on Non-Executive Directors’ fees takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and  
experience, their responsibilities and time commitment, as 
envisaged in the Code, and the fees paid by other companies. 
The current annual fees payable to the Non-Executive 
Directors are:  
The fees are normally reviewed every two years. The Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman, do not participate in any of the 
Company’s share schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes.

As at 31 December 2006, 12,255 shares and 4,009 shares (1 January 2006: nil and 2,591) were held by the respective Trustees  
of employee share trusts for the purposes of the LTIS and the Share Incentive Plan. As with other employees, the Directors are  
deemed to have a potential interest in those shares, being beneficiaries under the trust. As at 21 February 2007, 12,255 shares  
and 12,371 shares were held by the respective trustees. 
From 1 January 2006 to 22 February 2007, none of the Directors had any beneficial interests in the Company’s securities  
other than ordinary shares, nor any non-beneficial interests in any of the Company’s securities, nor in those of its subsidiary  
or associated undertakings.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

(i) At the end of the performance period to 1 April 2006, the Company ranked 40th in the relevant comparator group. Accordingly,  
75% of the original allocations were released to participants on 6 April 2006. The released shares were subject to income tax at the 
individual’s marginal rate and National Insurance contributions (NICs) at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at 
the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive 
Directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings  
as at 31 December 2006 on page 38. 
(ii) At the end of the performance period the Company’s TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator 
group. If, and to the extent that, the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Directors 
at the Trustee’s discretion as soon as practicable thereafter. 
(iii) The percentage of the allocation eventually to vest is dependent on the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three-year 
performance period: half of the shares (EPS shares) will be subject to a performance condition based on Centrica’s EPS growth 
relative to the growth in RPI (All Items) over three financial years. EPS growth will be calculated by comparing the Company’s 
adjusted EPS figure for the financial period preceding the date of allocation with that for the financial period three years later; and  
half of the shares will be determined by the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the other companies 
comprising the LTIS comparator group – the FTSE 100 at the start of the three-year performance period (the TSR shares). At the  
end of the performance period, the TSR performance condition will be measured, the same calculation made for all the other 99 
companies in the LTIS comparator group and a ranking list will be compiled. 
(iv) Following the resignation of Mark Clare on 30 September 2006, his LTIS awards made on 1 April 2004, 1 April 2005 and 3 April 2006 
were automatically forfeited. 
(v) Sir Roy Gardner did not receive an award of LTIS in 2006 due to his impending retirement. Having retired on 30 June 2006 the LTIS 
allocations made to him on 1 April 2004 and 1 April 2005 will be transferred at the end of their respective performance periods, 
subject to the achievement of performance conditions and they will be time-apportioned in accordance with the rules of the LTIS. 
(vi) As explained in the Notice of Meeting to convene the AGM held on 19 May 2006 (at which approval was sought and given by 
shareholders in respect of the new LTIS) the first awards under the new LTIS were made to participants other than the Executive 
Directors on 3 April 2006 (on the date that allocations would normally be made under the previous LTIS and within the 42 day period 
following the release of the Company’s annual results). The awards to the Executive Directors then in office could only be made after 
shareholder approval, but in order to align their awards with those of other participants, their first awards were deemed to have been 
made on 3 April 2006 for all purposes of the new LTIS, including the calculation of the number of shares, the adjusted EPS and 
relative TSR performance tests and the three-year vesting period.  
The following graph, provided by Alithos Ltd. (an independent third party), shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the 
relevant TSR comparator group. It has not been audited by the Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. It relates to the 2003 
LTIS allocations that vested in 2006:

(i) Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)  
Options were granted to the Executive Directors under the terms of the ESOS on 31 May 2001, 2 April 2002, 24 March 2003,  
18 March 2004, 1 April 2005 and 3 April 2006. Details of the operation of the scheme are provided on page 35. 
(ii) Sharesave Scheme  
The Company operates an HMRC-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme in the UK. The scheme is designed 
to provide a long-term savings and investment opportunity for employees. 
(iii) Mark Clare 
Mark Clare resigned on 30 September 2006. In accordance with the rules of the ESOS his outstanding options at this date lapsed.  
In accordance with the rules of the Sharesave his outstanding Sharesave option is exercisable within 6 months of his leave date as 
the options had been held for more than three years at the date of resignation. Mark Clare may only exercise those options to the 
extent of the savings made and interest due. 
(iv) Sir Roy Gardner 
Sir Roy Gardner retired on 30 June 2006. In accordance with the rules of the ESOS he exercised all his options except for those 
granted in 2005 which had not met the relevant performance conditions. Under the rules of the Sharesave, he was able to exercise 
his options to the extent of the savings made and interest due. 
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2006 (29 December) was 354.50 pence. The range during the 
year was 248.25 pence (low) and 359.75 pence (high).  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

Directors’ pensions 
The pension arrangements for the Executive Directors all of whom are members of the Centrica Management Pension Scheme, are 
shown below (with the exception of the Sam Laidlaw who joined the Company during the year and is not a member of any of Centrica’s 
pension schemes). The Centrica Management Pension Scheme is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme. 
Its rules provide for the following main features: 
 normal retirement at age 62 (see note on normal retirement age below); 
 right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service 
at Company’s request after age 55;  
 life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service; 
 spouse’s pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member’s prospective pension and, on death after retirement, 
half of the accrued pension. Children’s pensions are also payable; 
 members’ contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings; 
 pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
 pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies to pension 
accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
 no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC limits. Where these limits would restrict the pension promise due the Centrica 
Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) provides benefits on the salary in excess of the Scheme earnings cap to the level that would otherwise 
have been paid by the registered scheme. The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect 
of the registered portion of members’ benefits. No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits 
elsewhere, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain 
Centrica assets. An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the Company’s balance sheet.  
Finance Act 2004 
As a result of the changes brought about by the Finance Act 2004, Centrica transferred a portion of the unregistered element of Executive 
Directors’ pension benefits in CUPS to the registered Centrica Management Pension Scheme, thereby delivering some of the benefits 
previously provided via CUPS through the registered arrangement, up to the new Lifetime Allowance (LTA). Centrica did not however 
transfer any CUPS liabilities in excess of the LTA, which would have resulted in a higher tax rate being paid on the value of the benefits at 
5 April 2006. With effect from 6 April 2006, the contributions made by the Executive Directors are not restricted to the rate of 15% of the 
earnings cap and are based on the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to and pensionable salary at  
31 December 2006, with the exception of the values shown for Sir Roy Gardner and Mark Clare, which represent the total of their 
accrued pension at their dates of leaving of 30 June 2006 and 30 September 2006 respectively. The pension accrual rates for 2006  
as a percentage of pensionable salary are as follows for Phil Bentley, Mark Clare, Sir Roy Gardner and Jake Ulrich were 2.65%, 
2.46%, 4.11% and 3.71% respectively. 
(ii) The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2005  
by the rate of inflation (3.6%) and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2006. The rate of inflation used was 
3.6%, the annual rate to 30 September 2006, the date used for pension increases under the scheme. 
(iii) Sir Roy Gardner retired on 30 June 2006. The transfer value as at 31 December 2006 includes an uplift of £1,062,100 as a result of  
a change in the method of calculation of the transfer value for pensioners which did not apply at 31 December 2005 when he was still 
in service.  
(iv) Member contributions paid in the year were restricted to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings ‘cap’ up to 5 April 2006.  
This restriction was removed from 6 April 2006 so that contributions were deducted against total uncapped pensionable salary. 
Sam Laidlaw does not participate in the Centrica pension scheme. Under the terms of his contract of employment, he is entitled to a 
salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of any pension provisions. On joining the Company, a payment of £215,000 was made to 
his personal pension arrangements.

Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Centrica plc 
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Centrica plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash 
Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and 
Expense and the related notes. These Group Financial Statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the parent Company Financial 
Statements of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 
and on the information in the Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, 
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235  
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by  
our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group 
Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether, in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ 
Report – Business Review and the Directors’ Report – Governance) 
is consistent with the Group Financial Statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of  
the Combined Code (2003) specified for our review by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it  
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or  
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group Financial 
Statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the 
Remuneration Report, the Gas and Liquid Reserves, Five Year 
Record and Shareholder Information. We consider  
the implications for our report if we become aware of any  
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the  
Group Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend  
to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group 
Financial Statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group Financial Statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group 
Financial Statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006  
and of its loss and cash flows for the year then ended;  
 the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation; and 
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the Group Financial Statements.

1. General information 
Centrica plc is a Company domiciled and incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address  
of the registered office is given on page 33. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 
and in the Directors’ Report - Business Review on pages 6 to 26.  
The consolidated Financial Statements of Centrica plc are 
presented in sterling. Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with the policies set out in note 2. 
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements,  
the following Standards and Interpretations which have not  
been applied in these Financial Statements were in issue, but  
not yet effective: 
 IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the related 
amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007); this Standard  
will require additional disclosures on capital and financial 
instruments; and 
 IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009); this Standard replaces 
IAS 14 Segment Reporting and requires segmental information 
reported to be based on that which management uses internally 
for evaluating the performance of operating segments and 
requires increased disclosure relating to reportable segments. 
The Directors anticipate that the following Standards and 
Interpretations, which were also in issue but not effective at the 
date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no 
material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group: 
 IFRIC 7, Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, 
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies (effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006); 
 IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 (effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 May 2006); 
 IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment (effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006); 
 IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions 
(effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007); 
and 
 IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements (effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008). 
2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments 
and available-for-sale investments, and the assets and liabilities of 
the Group pension schemes that have been measured at fair value. 
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are 
hedged items in fair value hedges, and are otherwise carried at 
cost, are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable 
to the risks that are being hedged. The principal accounting 
policies adopted are set out below. 
The Group’s Income Statement and segmental note separately 
identifies the effects of re-measurement of certain financial 
instruments, and items which are exceptional, in order to provide 
readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s 
underlying performance, as described below. 
 
Certain re-measurements 
As part of its energy procurement activities the Group enters into  
a range of commodity contracts designed to achieve security of 
energy supply. These contracts comprise both purchases and 
sales and cover a wide range of volumes, prices and timescales. 
The majority of the underlying supply comes from high volume 
long-term contracts which are complemented by shorter-term 
arrangements. These short-term contracts are entered into for  
the purpose of balancing energy supplies and customer demand 
and to optimise the price paid by the Group. Short-term demand 
can vary significantly as a result of factors such as weather, power 
generation profiles and short-term movements in market prices. 
Many of the energy procurement contracts are held for the 
purpose of receipt or delivery of commodities in accordance  
with the Group’s purchase, sale or usage requirements and are 
therefore out of scope of IAS 39. However, a number of contracts 
are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are 
required to be fair valued under IAS 39, primarily because their 
terms include the ability to trade elements of the contracted 
volumes on a net-settled basis.  
The Group has shown the fair value adjustments arising on 
these contracts separately in the certain re-measurements column. 
This is because the intention of management is, subject to short-
term demand balancing, to use these energy supplies to meet 
customer demand. Accordingly management believe the ultimate 
net charge to cost of sales will be consistent with the price  
of energy agreed in these contracts and that the fair value 
adjustments will reverse as the energy is supplied over the life  
of the contract. This makes the fair value re-measurements very 
different in nature from costs arising from the physical delivery  
of energy in the period. 
At the balance sheet date the fair value represents the 
difference between the prices agreed in the respective contracts 
and the actual or anticipated market price of acquiring the same 
amount of energy on the open market. The movement in the fair 
value taken to certain re-measurements in the Income Statement 
represents the unwind of the contracted volume delivered or 
consumed during the period, combined with the change in fair 
value of future contracted energy as a result of movements in 
forward energy prices during the year.  
These adjustments represent the significant majority of  
the items included in certain re-measurements. In addition to 
these however the Group has identified a number of comparable 
contractual arrangements where the difference between the price 
which the Group expects to pay or receive under a contract  
and the market price is required to be fair valued by IAS 39.  
These additional items relate to cross-border transportation or 
transmission capacity, storage capacity and contracts relating to 
the sale of energy bi-products, on which economic value has been 
created which is not wholly recognised under the requirements of 
IAS 39. For these arrangements the related fair value adjustments 
are also included under certain re-measurements.  
These arrangements are managed separately from proprietary 
energy trading activities where trades are entered into speculatively 
for the purpose of making profits in their own right. These 
proprietary trades are included in the results before certain  
re-measurements. 
Certain re-measurements included within interest comprise  
re-measurement of the publicly traded units of The Consumers’ 
Waterheater Income Fund.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, certain 
items are presented separately as exceptional, where they are material 
to the result for the period and are of a non-recurring nature. Items 
which may be considered material and non-recurring in nature include 
disposals of businesses, business restructuring, the renegotiation  
of significant contracts and asset write-downs. We intend to follow 
such a presentation on a consistent basis in future periods. Items  
are considered material if their omission or mis-statement could,  
in the opinion of the Directors, individually or collectively, affect the 
true and fair presentation of the Financial Statements. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial 
Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year, 
and incorporate the results of its share of jointly controlled entities 
and associates using the equity method of accounting.  
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity  
so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up  
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, 
associates and jointly controlled entities to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses  
are eliminated on consolidation.  
Interests in joint ventures 
A jointly controlled entity is a joint venture which involves  
the establishment of an entity to engage in economic activity, 
which the Group jointly controls with its fellow venturers. Under the 
equity method, investments in jointly controlled entities are carried 
at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net 
assets of the jointly controlled entity, less any impairment in value in 
individual investments. The Income Statement reflects the Group’s 
share of the results of operations after tax of the jointly controlled 
entity (the equity method). 
Certain of the Group’s exploration and production activity is 
conducted through joint ventures where the venturers have a direct 
interest in and jointly control the assets of the venture. The results, 
assets, liabilities and cash flows of these jointly controlled assets 
are included in the consolidated Financial Statements in proportion 
to the Group’s interest. 
Interests in associates 
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an equity interest 
and over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried at 
cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in value in individual 
investments. The Income Statement reflects the Group’s share  
of the results of operations after tax of the associate.  
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can  
be reliably measured. Revenue includes amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business,  
net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. 
Energy supply: Revenue is recognised on the basis of energy 
supplied during the period. Revenue for energy supply activities 
includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers between 
the date of the last meter reading and the year end (unread). Unread 
gas and electricity is estimated using historical consumption 
patterns, taking into account the industry reconciliation process  
for total gas and total electricity usage by supplier, and is included  
in accrued energy income within debtors.  
Proprietary energy trading: Revenue comprises net gains and 
losses (both realised/settled and unrealised/fair value changes) 
from trading in physical and financial energy contracts.  
Storage services: Storage capacity revenues are recognised 
evenly over the contract period, whilst commodity revenues for  
the injection and withdrawal of gas are recognised at the point  
of gas flowing into or out of the storage facilities. 
Home services and fixed fee service contracts: Where the 
Group has an ongoing obligation to provide services, revenues are 
apportioned on a time basis and amounts billed in advance are 
treated as deferred income and excluded from current revenue. For 
one-off services, such as installations, revenue is recognised at the 
date of service provision. Revenue from fixed fee service contracts 
is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, 
reflecting the benefits receivable by the customer, which span the 
life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance being 
available throughout the contract term. 
Gas production: Revenue associated with exploration and 
production sales (of natural gas, crude oil and condensates) is 
recognised when title passes to the customer. Revenue from the 
production of natural gas, oil and condensates in which the Group 
has an interest with other producers is recognised based on the 
Group’s working interest and the terms of the relevant production 
sharing arrangements (the entitlement method). Differences 
between production sold and the Group’s share of production  
are not significant. 
Interest income: Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset 
to that asset’s net carrying value.  
Cost of sales 
Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced 
and purchased during the period taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by 
supplier, and related transportation, distribution, royalty costs and 
bought in materials and services.  
Home services’ and fixed fee service contracts cost of sales 
includes direct labour and related overheads on installation work, 
repairs and service contracts in the period.  
Employee share schemes 
The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed in 
the Directors’ Report – Corporate Responsibility on page 26, the 
Remuneration Report on pages 35 to 36 and in note 25, under 
which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured  
at fair value at the date of grant (excluding the effect of non  
market-based vesting conditions). The fair value determined at  
the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with  
a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based  
on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will vest  
and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the 
different schemes as follows: 
LTIS: awards up to 
2005 
A Black-Scholes valuation augmented  
by a Monte Carlo simulation to predict  
the total shareholder return performance

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Foreign currencies 
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, 
which is the functional currency of the Company and the Group’s 
presentational currency. Each entity in the Group determines its 
own functional currency and items included in the Financial 
Statements of each entity are measured using that functional 
currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded  
at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. All differences are included in the 
Income Statement for the period with the exception of exchange 
differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge 
against a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly 
to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they 
are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a currency other than 
the functional currency of the entity concerned are translated  
using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.  
For the purpose of presenting consolidated Financial Statements, 
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign subsidiary 
undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates are translated 
into sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
The results of foreign subsidiary undertakings, jointly controlled 
entities and associates are translated into sterling at average rates 
of exchange for the relevant period. Exchange differences arising 
from the re-translation of the opening net assets and the results  
are transferred to the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve, a 
separate component of equity, and are reported in the Statement of 
Total Recognised Income and Expense. In the event of the disposal 
of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign 
currency, the cumulative translation difference arising in the foreign 
currency translation reserve is charged or credited to the Income 
Statement on disposal.  
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings, foreign 
currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to hedge 
foreign currency net investments in foreign subsidiary undertakings, 
jointly controlled entities and associates are taken directly to 
reserves and are reported in the Statement of Recognised Income 
and Expense. All other exchange movements are recognised in the 
Income Statement for the period. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase 
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the cash paid 
and the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of 
other assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3, Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value  
at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal 
groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with 
IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value  
less costs to sell.  
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the  
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, 
jointly controlled entity or associate at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is 
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. If, after re-assessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess 
is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially 
measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of  
the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.  
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for 
impairment, annually, or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement 
and is not subsequently reversed.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated  
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-
generating units that expect to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-
generating units is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount  
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets  
of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, 
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal.  
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to 
reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.  
Other intangible assets  
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. For purchased application software, for 
example investments in customer relationship management and 
billing systems, cost includes contractors’ charges, materials, 
directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads. 
Capitalisation begins when expenditure for the asset is being 
incurred and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset  
for use are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially  
all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use are 
complete. Amortisation commences at the point of commercial 
deployment over the asset’s estimated useful economic life. The 
cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their 
fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The  
useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite  
or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over  
the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.  
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset 
are accounted for on a prospective basis by changing the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated  
as changes in accounting estimates.  
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating 
unit level. Such intangibles are not amortised. The useful life of an 
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually  
to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be 
supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.   Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
The amortisation period for the principal categories of intangible 
assets are as follows: 
Application software up to 10 years 
Licences up to 20 years 
Consents up to 25 years 
Contractual customer relationships up to 10 years 
Identifiable acquired brand – Dyno Indefinite 
Emissions trading scheme and renewable obligations certificates 
Granted CO2 emissions allowances received in a period are initially 
recognised at nominal value (nil value). Purchased CO2 emissions 
allowances are initially recognised at cost (purchase price) within 
intangible assets. A liability is recognised when the level of 
emissions exceed the level of allowances granted. The liability  
is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level  
of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of 
allowances ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in  
the liability recognised in operating profit. Forward contracts for  
the purchase or sale of CO2 emissions allowances are measured  
at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair  
value recognised in the Income Statement. The intangible asset  
is surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the 
consumption of economic benefit. As a result no amortisation is 
recorded during the period.  
Purchased renewable obligation certificates are initially 
recognised at cost within intangible assets. A liability for the 
renewables obligation is recognised based on the level of electricity 
supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance with 
percentages set by the UK government and the renewable 
obligation certificate buyout price for that period. The intangible 
asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting 
the consumption of economic benefit. As a result no amortisation  
is recorded during the period.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is included in the Balance Sheet  
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions  
for impairment. 
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or 
construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing  
the asset into operation. The purchase price or construction  
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any  
other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other property, plant  
and equipment, except exploration and production assets,  
are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to  
write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of individual 
assets over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation  
periods for the principal categories of assets are as follows: 
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years 
Plant 5 to 20 years 
Power stations up to 30 years 
Equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years 
Storage up to 28 years 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful economic lives on the same basis as for owned 
assets, or where shorter, the lease term.  
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
Residual values and useful lives are re-assessed annually and 
if necessary changes are accounted for prospectively. 
Exploration, evaluation and production assets 
Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised using the 
successful efforts method. Acquisition costs related to exploration 
and evaluation activities are capitalised. Exploration wells are 
initially capitalised and certain expenditure such as geological and 
geophysical exploration costs is expensed. If the prospects are 
subsequently determined to be unsuccessful on completion of 
evaluation, the associated costs are expensed in the period in 
which that determination is made. 
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant and 
equipment. Such costs relate to the acquisition and installation of 
production facilities and include development drilling costs, project-
related engineering and other technical services costs. Property, 
plant and equipment, including rights and concessions related to 
production activities, are depreciated from the commencement  
of production in the fields concerned, using the unit of production 
method, based on all of the proven and probable reserves of those 
fields. Changes in these estimates are dealt with prospectively.  
The net carrying value of fields in production and development  
is compared on a field-by-field basis with the likely discounted  
future net revenues to be derived from the remaining commercial 
reserves. An impairment loss is recognised where it is considered 
that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the 
net present value of future net revenues. Exploration and production 
assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.  
Decommissioning costs 
Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost  
of decommissioning gas production facilities at the end of the 
producing lives of fields, and storage facilities and power stations 
at the end of the useful life of the facilities, based on price levels 
and technology at the balance sheet date.  
Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates 
are dealt with prospectively. When this provision gives access to 
future economic benefits, a decommissioning asset is recognised 
and included within property, plant and equipment. For gas 
production facilities and off-shore storage facilities the 
decommissioning asset is amortised using the unit of production 
method, based on proven and probable reserves. For power 
stations the decommissioning asset is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the useful life of the facility. The unwinding of the 
discount on the provision is included in the Income Statement 
within interest expense.  
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a 
lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires 
an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is 
dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. Leases are classified 
as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held 
under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant 
and equipment at their fair value, or if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of 
the lease. The obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance 
charges in respect of future periods, are included within bank loans 
and other borrowings, with the amount payable within 12 months 
included in bank overdrafts and loans within short-term liabilities. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges  
and reduction of the finance lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income.  
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the  
relevant lease.   Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets  
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of any impairment loss. Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to  
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit)  
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.  
An impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change 
in the estimate used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. Where an 
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised as income immediately. After such a reversal  
the depreciation/amortisation charge, where relevant, is adjusted  
in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, 
less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining 
useful life. 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. No depreciation is charged in respect of non-current 
assets classified as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held 
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is 
regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the 
asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition. Management must be committed to the  
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
Inventories 
Inventories, excluding inventories of gas and oil, are valued on  
a first-in, first-out basis, at the lower of cost or estimated net 
realisable value, after allowance for redundant and slow moving 
items. Inventories of gas and oil are valued on a weighted average 
basis, at the lower of cost or estimated net realisable value, after 
allowance for redundant and slow moving items.  
Take-or-pay contracts 
Where payments are made to external suppliers under take-or-pay 
obligations for gas not taken, they are treated as prepayments  
and included within other receivables, as they generate future 
economic benefits. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes  
is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit 
credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are 
recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.  
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits is 
charged to the Income Statement over the periods benefiting from 
employees’ service. Past service cost is recognised immediately  
to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the 
benefits become vested. The difference between the expected 
return on scheme assets and the change in present value of 
scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time is 
recognised in the Income Statement within interest expense.  
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance 
Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
of the schemes as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, 
and as reduced by the fair value of the schemes’ assets. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, that can be 
reliably measured, and it is probable that the Group will be required 
to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at 
the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where 
the effect is material. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the Income 
Statement included within interest expense. 
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, UK petroleum revenue 
tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid  
(or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted, 
or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences 
identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that  
the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (if 
amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes) or the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not 
a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss. Temporary 
differences are differences between the carrying amount of the 
Group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base.  
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets 
within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group. Any 
remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis 
of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there 
will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the 
foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary 
difference can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except  
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can 
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised  
or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax 
consequences expected to fall from the manner in which the asset 
or liability is recovered or settled.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Financial instruments  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group 
Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised 
when the Group no longer has the rights to cash flows, the risks 
and rewards of ownership or control of the asset. Financial liabilities 
are de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is 
discharged, cancelled or expires. 
(a) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. Provision 
is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect the debts. Bad debts are written off when identified. 
(b) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments 
that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity.  
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on  
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own  
equity instruments.  
(c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current 
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to 
insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity 
of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the consolidated Cash Flow Statement,  
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents  
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
(d) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
All interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised  
at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, except when they are the hedged item in an 
effective fair value hedge relationship, where the carrying value is 
adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the 
hedged risks and the fair value movements are recognised in the 
Income Statement. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any issue costs, and any discount or premium. 
(e) Units issued by The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund 
Units issued by The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund which 
contain redemption rights providing unit holders with the right to 
redeem units back to the Fund, for cash or another financial asset, 
are treated as a financial liability and recorded at the present value 
of the redemption amount. Gains and losses related to changes 
in the carrying value of the financial liability are recognised in the 
Income Statement as interest income or interest expense.  
(f) Other financial assets 
Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial 
assets that are designated as available for sale, and are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are included within other financial 
assets within the Balance Sheet. Available for sale financial assets 
are subsequently recognised at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised directly in equity and 
presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, 
until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at 
which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
equity is included in the Income Statement for the period.  
Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement for equity 
investments classified as available for sale are not subsequently 
reversed through the Income Statement. Impairment losses 
recognised in the Income Statement for debt instruments classified 
as available for sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the 
fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.  
(g) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for 
physical gas, power and oil. The majority of these transactions take 
the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be 
held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the physical position  
in accordance with the Group’s expected sale, purchase or usage 
requirements, and are not within the scope of IAS 39. 
Certain physical gas, power and oil purchase and sales 
contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 because they net settle  
or contain written options. Such contracts are accounted for as 
derivatives under IAS 39 and are recognised in the Balance Sheet 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value  
on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken 
directly to the Income Statement for the year.  
The Group uses a range of derivatives for both trading and to 
hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign 
exchange and energy price risks, arising in the normal course of 
business. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by 
the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors. Further 
detail on the Group’s risk management policies is included within 
the Directors’ Report – Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 
21 to 23 and in note 33 to the Financial Statements.  
The accounting treatment for derivatives is dependent on 
whether they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes.  
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging 
purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure  
of the Group in line with the Group’s risk management policies and 
is in accordance with established guidelines, which require that the 
hedging relationship is documented at its inception, ensure that the 
derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective, and require 
that its effectiveness can be reliably measured. The Group also 
holds derivatives which are not designated as hedges and 
derivatives that are held for trading.  
All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date on which 
the derivative is entered into and are re-measured to fair value at 
each reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair 
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are offset and presented 
on a net basis only when both a legal right of set-off exists and the 
intention to net settle the derivative contracts is present.  
The Group enters into certain energy derivative contracts 
covering periods for which observable market data does not exist. 
The fair value of such derivatives is estimated by reference in part 
to published price quotations from active markets, to the extent 
that such observable market data exists, and in part by using 
valuation techniques, whose inputs include data, which is not 
based from observable markets. Where the fair value at initial 
recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price,  
a fair value gain or fair value loss will arise. This is referred to as a 
day-one gain or day-one loss. Such gains and losses are deferred 
and amortised to the Income Statement based on volumes 
purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such  
time observable market data becomes available. At such time 
observable market data becomes available, any remaining  
deferred day one gains or losses are recognised within the  
Income Statement. Recognition of the gain or loss that results  
from changes in fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or 
holding the derivative. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value 
are taken directly to the Income Statement and are included within 
gross profit or interest income and interest expense. Gains and 
losses arising on derivatives entered into for speculative energy 
trading purposes are presented on a net basis within revenue.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Embedded derivatives: Derivatives embedded in other financial 
instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate 
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are 
not carried at fair value, with gains or loss reported in the Income 
Statement. The closely related nature of embedded derivatives is 
re-assessed when there is a change in the terms of the contract 
which significantly modifies the future cash flows under the 
contract. Where a contract contains one or more embedded 
derivatives and providing that the embedded derivative significantly 
modifies the cash flows under the contract, the option to fair  
value the entire contract may be taken and the contract will be 
recognised at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in 
the Income Statement.  
(h) Hedge accounting 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified  
either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. 
Fair value hedges: A derivative is classified as a fair value hedge 
when it hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability. Any gain or loss from re-measuring  
the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately  
in the Income Statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Income 
Statement. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting 
if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or 
the Group revokes the designation. Any adjustment to the carrying 
amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective 
interest method is used is amortised to the Income Statement. 
Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall 
begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted 
for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.  
Cash flow hedges: A derivative is classified as a cash flow  
hedge when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows that is 
attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognised 
asset, liability or highly probable forecast transaction. The portion  
of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is effective, is 
recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness is recognised 
in the Income Statement. The gains or losses that are recognised 
directly in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the 
same period in which the highly probable forecast transaction 
affects income, for example when the future sale of physical gas or 
physical power actually occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost 
of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are 
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset 
or liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without 
replacement or rollover, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting  
or the Group revokes the designation.  
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the highly 
probable forecast transaction occurs. If the transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity 
is recognised in the Income Statement. 
Net investment hedges: Hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any 
gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in 
equity, any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in the Income Statement. On disposal of the foreign 
operation, the cumulative value of any gains or losses recognised 
directly in equity is transferred to the Income Statement.  
3. Critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies as 
described in note 2, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Financial Statements (apart from those involving 
estimations which are dealt with below). 
Finance lease – Third-party power station tolling arrangement  
The Group has entered into a long-term tolling arrangement with the 
Spalding power station and has determined that, based on the 
substance of the contractual terms, the arrangement is a finance lease. 
Subsidiary – The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund  
The Group holds a nil interest (2005: 19.9%) in The Consumers’ 
Waterheater Income Fund (the Fund), through its wholly owned 
subsidiary, Direct Energy Marketing Limited. The Fund’s units are 
traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Group has determined 
that the Fund is a subsidiary, due to the substance of the 
arrangements and has included the Fund on a consolidated basis 
within the Group’s Financial Statements. Units in the Fund held by 
third parties contain redemption rights providing the holder of such 
units with the rights to put the units back to the Fund for cash or 
another financial asset. The Group has determined that units 
issued by the Fund, which contain such redemption rights are 
financial liabilities.  
Emissions trading scheme  
The Group has been subject to the European Emissions Trading 
Scheme (EU ETS) since 1 January 2005. IFRIC 3, Emission Rights 
was withdrawn by the IASB in June 2005, and has not yet been 
replaced by definitive guidance. The Group has adopted an 
accounting policy, which recognises CO2 emissions liabilities when 
the level of emissions exceeds the level of allowances granted by 
the Government in the period. The liability is measured at the cost 
of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances 
held, and then at market price of allowances ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Movements in the liability are reflected within operating 
profit. Forward contracts for sales and purchases of allowances are 
measured at fair value.  
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT) 
The definitions of an income tax in IAS 12, Income Taxes, have led 
management to judge that PRT should be treated consistently with 
other taxes. The charge for the year, is presented within taxation 
on profit from continuing operations in the Income Statement. 
Deferred amounts are included within deferred tax assets and 
liabilities in the Balance Sheet. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty  
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  
The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite lived 
intangible assets are impaired at least on an annual basis. This 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating 
units to which goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are allocated. 
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate 
of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit 
and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value of those cash flows. Further detail on the assumptions 
used in determining value in use calculations is provided in note 14.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty continued 
Revenue recognition – unread gas and electricity meters 
Revenue for energy supply activities includes an assessment of 
energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the year end (unread). Unread gas and electricity is 
estimated applying industry standards and using historical 
consumption patterns taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage  
by supplier. Management apply judgement to the measurement  
of the estimated energy supplied to customers and to the valuation 
of that energy consumption. The judgements applied, and the 
assumptions underpinning these judgements are considered to  
be appropriate. However, a change in these assumptions would 
impact upon the amount of revenue recognised. 
Industry Reconciliation Process – cost of sales 
The industry reconciliation process is required as differences arise 
between the estimated quantity of gas and electricity the Group 
deems to have supplied and billed customers, and the estimated 
quantity the industry system operator deems the individual suppliers, 
including the Group, to have supplied to customers. This difference 
in deemed supply is referred to as imbalance. The reconciliation 
process can result in either a higher or lower value of industry 
deemed supply than has been estimated as being supplied to 
customers by the Group, but in practice tends to result in a higher 
value of deemed supply. The Group then reviews the difference  
to ascertain whether there is evidence that its estimate of amounts 
supplied to customers is inaccurate or whether the difference arises 
from other causes. The Group’s share of the resulting imbalance  
is included within commodity costs charged to cost of sales.  
Management estimate the level of recovery of imbalance which will 
be achieved either through subsequent customer billing or through 
the developing industry settlement process.  
Determination of fair values – energy derivatives 
Derivative contracts are carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value, 
with changes in fair value recorded in the Income Statement. Fair 
values of energy derivatives are estimated by reference in part to 
published price quotations in active markets and in part by using 
valuation techniques. More detail on the assumptions used in 
determining fair valuations is provided in note 33 (ii). 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is 
determined separately for each scheme under the projected unit 
credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in full in the period in which they occur. The key 
assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are based on the 
Group’s best estimate of the variables that will determine the 
ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, on which 
further detail is provided in note 30. 
Decommissioning costs 
The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the 
producing lives of fields is reviewed periodically and is based on 
proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology at the 
balance sheet date. Provision is made for the estimated cost of 
decommissioning at the balance sheet date. The payment dates  
of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain and 
dependent on the lives of the facilities, but are currently anticipated 
to be between 2007 and 2042.

(i) Inter-segment revenue is derived from recharges of energy procurement costs between Centrica Energy and other Group segments. 
Gas purchase costs are appropriately allocated to the revenue generating streams using a method which best reflects the 
consumption of gas within the Group. Electricity costs are recharged using a method which reflects the actual cost within the Group. 
(ii) Inter-segment revenue arising within Centrica Storage represents the provision of storage facilities to other Group companies, on an 
arm’s length basis. 
(iii) Accord energy trading carries out certain sales transactions on behalf of the Group’s Industrial sales and wholesaling segment.  
The Group considers that it is not reflective of the trading relationship between the segments to present these transactions as inter-
segment revenue within the Industrial sales and wholesaling segment. The comparative information has been restated accordingly. 
The effect of the restatement is to reduce gross segment revenue and inter-segment revenue for Industrial sales and wholesaling  
by £589 million for the year ended 31 December 2005. There is no effect on Group revenue or segment operating profit. 
(iv) The revenue presented for Accord energy trading comprises net gains and losses (both realised and unrealised/fair value changes) 
from trading in physical and financial energy contracts. Included within its net gains and losses is £18 million arising on fees charged 
to other Group segments (2005: £8 million). It is not representative of the transactions to present this amount within inter-segment 
revenue because the result is stated net within revenue.

(i) Operating profit before exceptional items and certain re-measurements includes a £20 million gain arising on revisions to the 
assumptions made in calculating the Group’s defined benefit pension liability. The Schemes’ rules were amended from 1 April 2006 
to allow employees to commute a larger amount of their pension to a cash lump sum on retirement, in line with changes in the 
Finance Act. Future revisions to the assumption will be reflected within the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. 
(ii) The results of discontinued operations before (losses)/profits on disposal of the business included costs of £11 million

(i) Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant, equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets, inventories, derivatives, receivables 
and operating cash. Unallocated assets comprise deferred tax attached to unallocable assets and liabilities, investments and 
derivatives designated as hedges of borrowings. The aggregate investment in each joint venture for each segment is analysed  
in note 16. 
(ii) Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities. Unallocated liabilities comprise items such as taxation, corporate borrowings, the 
Group pension deficit (which is not allocable between segments on a reasonable basis) and deferred tax attached to unallocable 
assets and liabilities.  
Corporate overheads are allocated to reportable segments for Group reporting purposes based on an assessment of the key drivers  
of each allocable cost.

It is the Group’s policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancy and advisory projects. Appointments are made taking into 
account other factors including expertise and experience. In addition, the Board has approved a detailed policy defining the types of work 
for which the auditors can tender and the approvals required. In the past, the auditors have been engaged on assignments additional to 
their statutory audit duties where their expertise and experience with the Group are particularly important, including tax advice and due 
diligence reporting on acquisitions.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

(i) The Group has written down certain of its recent major systems developments following a review of their existing and required  
future functionality. The cost comprises write-downs in British Gas Residential (£178 million) and British Gas Services (£18 million).  
A tax credit of £59 million was recognised in respect of these costs. 
(ii) Business restructuring costs comprise £67 million from staff reductions at the corporate centre (£3 million), British Gas Residential 
(£16 million), and British Gas Services (£48 million), and £20 million relating to the closure of the head office of British Gas Residential. 
A tax credit of £20 million was recognised in respect of these costs.  
(iii) Business restructuring costs in 2005 comprised £100 million resulting from staff reductions at the corporate centre (£23 million), 
British Gas Residential (£43 million), British Gas Services (£15 million), British Gas Business (£1 million) and £18 million relating  
to changes to the property portfolio. A tax credit of £23 million was recognised in respect of these costs.  
(iv) Centrica Storage operations at Rough suffered a major interruption caused by a fire in February 2006. Our investment in new 
emergency shutdown systems and prompt management action mitigated the damage to ensure no loss of life. Following a full 
assessment of the work needed to restore operations, the costs of the incident have resulted in an exceptional charge before 
taxation of £48 million (of which £24 million is recognised within Other operations). A tax credit of £14 million has been recognised  
in respect of the charge.

(i) As energy is delivered or consumed from previously contracted positions, the related fair value recognised in the opening balance 
sheet (representing the difference between forward energy prices at the opening balance sheet date, and the contract price of energy 
to be delivered) is charged or credited to the Income Statement. 
(ii) Represents fair value (losses)/gains arising from the change in fair value of future contracted sales and purchase contracts as  
a result of changes in forward energy prices between reporting dates (or date of inception and the reporting date, where later). 
(iii) Comprises movements in fair value arising on proprietary trades in relation to cross-border transportation or storage capacity,  
on which economic value has been created which is not wholly accounted for under the provisions of IAS 39. 
(iv) A tax credit of £284 million has been recognised in respect of re-measurement of energy contracts. A tax charge of £14 million  
has been recognised in respect of re-measurement of the units of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. 
(v) Certain re-measurements included within Group operating profit also include the Group’s share of the certain re-measurements 
relating to the energy procurement activities of joint ventures. Certain re-measurements included within interest comprise  
re-measurement of the publicly traded units of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. All other re-measurement is included  
within results before exceptional items and certain re-measurement.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

9. Taxation continued 
(i) The tax credit arising on the systems write-down in 2006 was £59 million (note 6 (a) (i)). 
(ii) The tax credit arising on the business restructuring costs in 2006 was £20 million (note 6 (a) (ii)). 
(iii) The tax credit arising on costs related to the Rough Storage incident was £14 million (note 6 (a) (iv)). 
(iv) The tax credit arising on re-measurement of energy contracts was £284 million. The tax charge relating to gains arising on  
re-measurement of the publicly traded units of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund was £14 million (note 6 (b) (iv)).  
(v) The effect of the increase of 10% to the UK supplementary charge from 1 January 2006 on the relevant temporary differences  
at 31 December 2005 was £9 million. 
(vi) Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in note 26. 
(vii) In 2005, tax credits relating to exceptional items amounted to £11 million, and the tax charge relating to certain re-measurements 
amounted to £149 million. 
Corporation tax is charged at 30% (2005: 30%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. The Group earns its profits primarily  
in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30%.  
A supplementary charge of 20% is also currently applicable on the Group’s UK upstream profits. Taxation for other jurisdictions is 
calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. 
(b) Factors affecting the tax charge for the year

11.  Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 
£155 million (2005: earnings of £1,012 million) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 3,643 million 
(2005: 3,688 million). The number of shares for 2005 excluded 3 million ordinary shares being the weighted average number of the 
Company’s own shares held in the employee share trust which were treated as treasury shares. 
There was a share repurchase programme in operation during the year as described in note 24. 
The Directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary 
share adjusted for certain re-measurements and exceptional items assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group. 
The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows:

and re-measurement of proprietary trades in relation to cross-border transportation or capacity contracts. Certain re-measurements 
included within interest comprise re-measurement of the publicly traded units of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. All other  
re-measurement is included within results before exceptional items and certain re-measurements. 
In addition to basic and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted earnings per ordinary share. Under 
this presentation, no adjustments are made to the reported earnings for either 2006 or 2005, but the weighted average number of shares 
used as the denominator is adjusted, for potentially dilutive ordinary shares. In 2006, no outstanding awards or options are considered to 
be potentially dilutive, because they would decrease the loss per share.

13. Other intangible assets continued 
Amortisation arising on application software and other intangible assets is charged to operating costs in the Income Statement. 
(i) Included within application software are amounts for billing and customer relationship management systems. At 31 December 2006 
the net book value of these systems is £101 million (2005: £323 million). The remaining amortisation periods of these systems range 
from five to 10 years. 
(ii) Brands represent the Dyno-Rod brand, acquired on the acquisition of the Dyno group of companies during 2004. In accordance with 
IAS 38 paragraph 88, management has ascribed the brand an indefinite useful life because there is no foreseeable limit to the period 
over which the Dyno brand is expected to generate net cash inflows. In reaching this determination, management have reviewed 
potential threats from competition, the risks of technological obsolescence and the expected usage of the brand by management. 
(iii) The Group has written down certain of its major systems developments following a review of existing and required systems 
functionality. The reduced functionality has occurred as a result of changes to the Group structure since the beginning of the 
development projects and recognition of the reduced benefits arising from the systems as ultimately implemented. Costs associated 
with functionality no longer in use have been written off. The charge to intangible assets includes write-downs in British Gas 
Residential of £178 million and £18 million in British Gas Services. 
(iv) There are no internally generated intangible assets (2005: £nil).

(i) In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, the provisional fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of Segebel SA 
were reassessed within 12 months of the acquisition date, and the comparative information restated. The goodwill arising on 
acquisition has reduced by £23 million as a result of the restatement.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

14. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives continued 
(ii) During 2006, the aggregation of assets comprising certain cash-generating units within North America, specifically the Canada 
region, changed from a regional to a product method of aggregation. This resulted from reporting hierarchy changes and will allow 
management to more effectively monitor those businesses. The impact of this change is that the 2005 cash-generating units Canada 
residential energy – west and Canada residential energy – east have been replaced by cash generating units Canada mass markets 
and Canada Direct Energy business services in the current year. 
(iii) Comprises goodwill balances allocated across multiple cash-generating units. The amount of goodwill allocated to each cash- 
generating unit is not significant compared to the aggregate carrying value of goodwill reported within the Group. 
Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that amounts might 
be impaired. The impairment test involves determining the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units, which corresponds to the  
fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. Value in use calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for the cash- 
generating units noted above. These are determined using cash flow budgets, which are based on business plans for a period of five 
years. These business plans have been approved by the Board and are valid when the impairment test is performed. The plans are based 
on past experience as well as future expected market trends. Cash flows beyond the five-year plan period used in the value in use 
calculations are increased in line with historic long-term growth rates in the UK, or where applicable the US, Canada, Belgium and  
the Netherlands. Discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts in determining recoverable amounts are derived from the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital and for North American cash-generating units range from 9.4% to 9.5%, and for UK and Europe cash- 
generating units range from 8.5% to 11.1% on a pre-tax basis. Growth rates used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the period 
covered by the most recent forecasts range from 0% to 3%.  
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations determining recoverable amounts for the specific cash-generating units noted 
above are: 
British Gas Business 
 Budgeted gross margin: for existing contract customers this is based on contracted margins. For new and renewal contract customers 
this is based on achieved gross margin in the period prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted in some areas to reflect 
market conditions. For tariff customers this is based on current prices in the period prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted 
for Centrica’s view of the forward energy curve.  
 Budgeted market share: based on the average market share achieved immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted 
for growth forecasts based on sales and marketing activity.  
British Gas Services – Dyno-Rod 
 Budgeted franchise fee income: based on the average income achieved immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, 
adjusted for growth forecasts based on sales and marketing activity.  
 Budgeted cost growth: based on the cost growth in the period prior to the approval of the business plan. 
Texas residential energy 
 Budgeted gross margin: based on the average gross margin achieved prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted for 
management’s expectations of a post-price to beat environment.  
 Budgeted customer numbers: based on past experience in the three years prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted for  
an expected marginal decline in customer numbers.  
 Budgeted consumption: based on past experience of the average consumption per customer prior to the approval of the  
business plan.  
 Budgeted prices: based on a combination of Centrica’s view of forward gas and power prices in Texas immediately prior to the 
approval of the business plan and the price impact of targeted margins. 
Canada mass markets 
 Budgeted gross margin: for existing customers this is based on contracted margins. For new or renewal customers this is based on 
achieved gross margin in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan. 
 Budgeted market share: based on average market share achieved in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, 
adjusted for growth and decline assumptions specific to each of the competitive and regulated businesses.  
 Budgeted market prices: for existing customers this is based on contracted prices. For new or renewal customers, this is based on 
Centrica’s view of forward gas and power prices in Canada.  
 Budgeted consumption: based on past experience of the average consumption per customer prior to the approval of the business plan.  
Canada Direct Energy business services 
 Budgeted gross margin: for commodity gross margin, this is based on Centrica’s view of forward gas and power curves, immediately 
prior to the approval of the business plan while adding historically known gross margin targets by business line. For services gross 
margin, this is based on past experience immediately prior to the approval of the business plan.  
 Budgeted market share: based on average market share achieved in the period prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted  
for growth forecasts supported by sales and marketing activity.  
 Budgeted churn: based on past experience of the average churn prior to the approval of the business plan.  
 Budgeted consumption: based on past experience of the average consumption per customer prior to the approval of the  
business plan.  
 Budgeted market prices: based on Centrica’s view of forward gas and power curves immediately prior to the approval of the  
business plan.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

14. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives continued 
Canada home services 
 Budgeted gross margin: based on achieved gross margin in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan. 
 Budgeted revenue growth: based on the average achieved revenue growth for the three-year period prior to the approval of the 
business plan, uplifted for additional product offerings. 
US home services 
 Budgeted gross margin: based on achieved gross margin in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan.  
 Budgeted revenue growth: based on the average achieved revenue growth in the Canada home services group over the last three 
years prior to the approval of the business plan, uplifted for growth targets based on expected market penetration in certain key US  
state markets. 
Europe – Oxxio 
 Budgeted revenue growth: based on revenue in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, uplifted for expected 
growth in customer base, cross selling of products and reduction of customer churn.  
 Budgeted gross margin: based on the average gross margin in periods prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted for the 
expected impact arising from the unbundling of the gas and electricity markets going forward.  
 Budgeted operating expenditure: based on historical trends adjusted for cost improvement programmes including process 
optimisation implemented. 
Europe – SPE 
 Budgeted gross margin: based on the achieved gross margins in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan. 
 Budgeted customer numbers: based on customer numbers prior to the approval of the business plan adjusted for improvements 
resulting from further liberalisation of the Belgian energy market.  
 Budgeted market price: based on management’s view of forward gas and power prices in Belgium immediately prior to the approval  
of the Business plan.  
 Budgeted consumption: based on the average consumption per customer prior to the approval of the business plan. 
Centrica is of the opinion that, based on current knowledge, expected changes in the aforementioned key assumptions on which the 
determination of the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units to exceed the 
recoverable amounts.

(i) On 28 September 2005, the Group entered into a 50/50 joint venture (Segebel SA) with Gaz de France. Segebel SA holds a 
controlling stake of 51% in SPE SA, a Belgian energy company. At the time of the acquisition, SPE SA acquired the Group’s 50/50 
joint venture energy supply business, Luminus NV, for shares. The acquisition of Luminus NV by SPE SA was treated as a partial 
(24.5%) disposal by the Group, resulting in a loss of £1 million. In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, the provisional 
fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of Segebel SA were reassessed within 12 months of the acquisition date, and the 
comparative information restated. The goodwill arising on acquisition has reduced by £23 million, and the share of net assets 
acquired at acquisition has increased by £23 million as a result of the restatement. 
(ii) On 19 September 2005, the Group acquired the remaining 40% stake in Humber Power Limited, and accordingly Humber Power 
Limited has been treated as a subsidiary of the Group from that date. The Group’s 60% share of the assets and liabilities of Humber 
Power Limited were consolidated in the Group Balance Sheet at the date of acquisition.  
(iii) On 11 October 2005 the Group disposed of its 49% share holding in AccuRead Limited for cash consideration of £11 million, 
resulting in a pre-tax profit on disposal of £8 million. 
(b) Share of joint ventures’ assets and liabilities 
The Group’s share of joint ventures’ gross assets and gross liabilities at 31 December 2006 principally comprises its interests  
in Barrow Offshore Wind Limited (renewable power generation) and Segebel SA (energy supply). The Group also acquired a 55% joint 
venture interest in Coots Limited (CO2 pipeline construction) during the year. The Group’s share of the assets and liabilities of Coots 
Limited at 31 December 2006 is £nil.

In addition to the minimum lease payments, tolling charges are payable, calculated based on effective operating hours of the station. In 
the year, £18 million of tolling charges were paid in respect of the Spalding tolling contract (2005 included the Humber tolling contract up 
to the date of the Group’s acquisition of the remaining stake in Humber Power Limited: £20 million). The Group has an option to extend 
the Spalding tolling arrangement. To exercise this option, notice must be given to the operator, prior to 30 September 2020. Should this 
option be exercised, by serving further notice the Group has an option to purchase the station. At this time, the generator has the option 
to retain the station and terminate the tolling contract. Valuation of these options will be determined by an expert panel, appointed by both 
parties. The minimum lease payments and the tolling charges based on equivalent operating hours are subject to escalation based on  
a market of indices. There are no restrictions under the finance leases in either the current or prior year.

At the balance sheet date the Group had certain deductible temporary differences of £318 million (2005: £576 million) available for 
utilisation against future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams. These assets may be carried forward indefinitely. 
At the balance sheet date temporary differences of £36 million (2005: £66 million) existed in respect of the Group’s overseas 
investments. The deferred tax liability arising on these temporary differences is estimated to be £8 million (2005: £8 million), which has 
been provided. At the balance sheet date there were current deferred tax assets of £32 million (2005: £nil) and liabilities of £34 million 
(2005: £nil). 
Current tax assets of £98 million (2005: £nil) include £94 million of recoverable petroleum revenue tax (PRT). This sum is a refund  
of instalment payments made during the second half of 2006 which are in excess of the final liability. PRT instalment payments are 
calculated by reference to the previous period’s profitability not the profits of the period in which they are paid. The excess will be repaid  
in March 2007.

(i) During the year the Group undertook a significant restructuring programme to achieve its stated cost reduction targets. The 
restructure involved a reduction in roles of 1,544 and the exit of the British Gas Residential head office. The provision represents 
costs relating to surplus properties, redundancy and other costs relating to reorganisations. The element relating to surplus properties 
was calculated with reference to the expected cost to the date of the exit of the lease, including costs for dilapidations and marketing 
for the vacant building. The charge to income for the year included £87 million for exceptional redundancy and other reorganisation 
costs (note 6). The exceptional charge comprises staff reduction costs at the corporate centre (£3 million), British Gas Residential 
(£16 million), British Gas Services (£48 million), and changes to the property portfolio (£20 million). The majority of these sums  
are expected to be utilised during 2007. Included within the provision for 2005 were liabilities arising in the pension schemes of  
£13 million in respect of redundancy costs. In 2006 such liabilities of £17 million have been included within the pension liability on  
the Balance Sheet. 
(ii) The sales contract loss provision relates to the acquisition of a portfolio of gas customers by the Group. Certain of the contracts 
acquired were identified as being out of the money at the date of acquisition, and the sales contract loss provision was established  
in respect of them. The acquisition was not considered to constitute a business combination under the requirements of IFRS 3. 
(iii) Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of 
their useful lives. The estimate has been based on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet 
date. The timing of decommissioning payments are dependent on the lives of the facilities but are anticipated to occur between 2007 
and 2042. The charge to income includes £10 million of notional interest (2005: £10 million). 
(iv) In previous years, the Group renegotiated certain long-term take-or-pay contracts which would have resulted in commitments to pay 
for gas that would be excess to requirements and/or at prices above likely market rates. The provision represents the net present 
cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the renegotiations, which are due for settlement in 2008 based  
on the reserves in a group of third-party fields. The movement in the year included £11 million released to the Income Statement 
following a revision of the estimated future payments. The charge for the year includes £5 million of notional interest. 
(v) Other provisions include outstanding litigation for a number of items (none of which are individually significant) and provision for 
National Insurance payable in respect of Long Term Incentive Scheme liabilities. The National Insurance provision was based on a 
share price of 354.50 pence at 31 December 2006 (31 December 2005: 254.75 pence) and is expected to be utilised between 2007 
and 2009. 
(vi) Acquisitions and disposals of other provisions included utilisation of provisions relating to the cost of disposal of the AA (£15 million) 
and Onetel (£2 million), and release of a provision in respect of the disposal of Onetel (£10 million, note 28). Acquisitions and 
disposals of decommissioning provisions wholly related to the disposal of the Hewett gas field.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on 31 December 2006 was 354.50 pence (2005: 254.75 pence). 
(i) During the year, the Company purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 8.95 million ordinary shares at prices ranging from 248.43 
pence per share to 254.98 pence per share, with an average of 250.30 pence per share. The total cost of the purchases including 
expenses was £23 million which has been charged against distributable reserves, of which £0.6 million related to the nominal value 
and has been recognised in the capital redemption reserve. The share repurchase programme is currently suspended. 
(ii) The Centrica Employees Share Trust was established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company by subscription or purchase, with 
funds provided by way of interest-free loans or by capital contribution from the Company to satisfy rights to shares on the vesting of 
allocations made under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements. Dividends due on shares held in trust are waived in 
accordance with the trust deed. All administration costs are borne by the Group. During the year 7.6 million shares were issued 
to the Trust and subsequently released in order to satisfy exercises of awards under employee share schemes. The Trust received  
a capital contribution from the Company in order to fund the subscription. The Company has deemed the consideration received  
for the shares to be equivalent to the fair value of the shares vesting (£9 million). There were nil million shares held by the Trust at  
31 December 2006 (2005: nil million).

25.  Share-based payments 
Centrica operates six employee share schemes – the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), 
Sharesave, the Share Award Scheme (SAS), the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP). These are 
described in the Directors’ Report – Corporate Responsibility on page 26 and in the Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 36. There were 
no other share-based payment transactions during the period. 
ESOS 
Under the ESOS the Board may grant options over shares in Centrica plc to employees of the Group. Options are granted with a fixed 
exercise price equal to the market price of the shares at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is ten years. Awards under the 
ESOS are generally reserved for employees at senior management level and above and 77 employees are currently eligible to participate. 
Options granted under the ESOS will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the growth in earnings 
per share over that period exceeding RPI growth by more than 18 percentage points. The number of options becoming exercisable is 
reduced on a sliding scale if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between nine and 18 percentage points. Options granted up to March 
2004 also permit retesting of EPS growth annually for a further two years. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within 
the Group. Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. Early exercise has been taken into account by estimating the expected life of the options. The fair values and the related 
assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

LTIS 
Under the LTIS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are made to employees of the Group. Awards under the LTIS are generally reserved 
for employees at senior management level and above and 259 employees are currently eligible to participate. For awards made up to 
2005, the number of shares that are to be released to participants is calculated subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) 
during the three years following the grant date, compared to the TSR of other shares in the FTSE 100 Index over the same period. The 
number of shares released is reduced on a sliding scale if Centrica’s TSR is ranked between 50th and 25th. Shares are released to 
participants immediately following the end of the period in which TSR performance is assessed, but release of shares is subject to 
continued employment within the Group at the date of release. Allocations were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
Performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations, through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. For awards made 
from 2006, the vesting of only half of each award is made on the basis of TSR performance. For this half of the award, the calculation of 
TSR performance as compared to the TSR of other FTSE 100 Index shares is consistent with awards made to the end of 2005, except 
that allocations are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The number of shares released is increased on a sliding scale between 
25% and 100% if Centrica’s TSR is ranked between 50th and 20th. The vesting of the remaining half of awards made since 2006 is 
dependent on earnings per share (EPS) growth. This is considered a non-market condition under IFRS 2 and dividends attach to the 
awards, requiring the shares to be fair valued at market value on the date of grant. The likelihood of achieving the performance conditions 
is taken into account in calculating the number of awards expected to vest. For shares that vest on awards made from 2006 (for both 
TSR and EPS portions) the cash payment is increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid on them during the performance 
period. The fair values and the related assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

Sharesave 
Under Sharesave the Board may grant options over shares in Centrica plc to UK-based employees of the Group. Options are granted 
with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the three days prior to invitation which is three to 
four weeks prior to the grant date. Employees pay a fixed amount from salary into a savings account each month, and may elect to save 
over three or five years. At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds 
saved, including interest earned. If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw the funds saved, and the options 
expire. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group. Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model. The fair values and the related assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

SAS 
Under the SAS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are made to employees of the Group. Awards under the SAS are generally reserved 
for certain selected employees at middle management levels, based on recommendation by the executive. There is no contractual 
eligibility for SAS and each year’s award is made independently from previous awards. For the 2006 award, 452 employees were eligible 
to participate. Allocations are subject to no performance conditions and vest unconditionally subject to continued employment with the 
Group in two stages – half of the awards vesting after two years, the other half vesting after three years. On vesting, additional shares or  
a cash payment are made to reflect dividends that would have been paid on the allocations during the retention period. The fair value is 
therefore considered to be the market value at date of grant. The fair values and related assumptions used to calculate the cost to the 
Group are as follows:

SIP 
Under SIP, employees in the UK may purchase ‘partnership shares’ through monthly salary deductions. The Company then grants one 
‘matching share’ for every two purchased, up to a maximum of 20 matching shares per employee per month. Both partnership shares 
and matching shares are held in a trust initially. Partnership shares may be withdrawn at any time, but matching shares are forfeited if  
the related partnership shares are withdrawn within three years from the original purchase date. Matching shares vest unconditionally  
for employees after being held for three years in the trust. Vesting of matching shares is also subject to continued employment within  
the Group. Matching shares are valued at the market price at the grant date. The average fair value of these awards during the year  
was £2.97 (2005: £2.36). A reconciliation of matching shares held in trust is as follows:

Merger reserve 
On 17 February 1997 BG plc (formerly British Gas plc) demerged certain businesses (grouped together under GB Gas Holdings Limited 
(GBGH)) to Centrica plc. Prior to demerger, the companies comprising the Centrica businesses were transferred to GBGH, a subsidiary 
undertaking of BG plc. Upon demerger the share capital of GBGH was transferred to Centrica plc and was recorded at the nominal value 
of shares issued to BG plc shareholders. In accordance with sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985, no premium was 
recorded on the shares issued. On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the Company’s shares issued and the 
amount of share capital and share premium of GBGH at the date of demerger, was credited to a merger reserve. 
Capital redemption reserve 
In accordance with section 170 (1) of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has transferred to the capital redemption reserve an 
amount equal to the nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled. The repurchase of shares includes transaction 
costs charged directly to the profit and loss reserve of £nil (2005: £1 million).  
Revaluation reserve 
During 2005, the revaluation of the Group’s existing interest in Humber Power Limited to fair value, following the acquisition by the Group 
of the remaining 40% stake in the company, was recorded as a revaluation reserve adjustment.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

28.  Acquisitions and disposals 
(i) Acquisitions 
During the year the Group acquired the Paris Energy Centre and related gas pipeline through a 100% acquisition of Tenaska III Inc and 
Willowtex Pipeline Co. The Group also acquired the assets including customer base of Entergy Solutions Ltd. Other smaller acquisitions 
are described in section (c).  
The acquisition method of accounting was adopted in all cases. The analysis of assets and liabilities acquired, and the fair value  
of these acquisitions are as shown below. All intangible fixed assets were recognised at their respective fair values.  
The residual excess over the net assets acquired on each acquisition is recognised as goodwill in the Financial Statements.  
The fair values stated are provisional because the Directors have not yet reached a final determination on all aspects of  
the fair value exercise.

The Group acquired the assets including more than 100,000 residential and commercial customers in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth 
areas and South Texas from Entergy Solutions Ltd on 24 April 2006. The acquired assets contributed profit after tax of £nil to the Group 
for the period from 24 April 2006 to 31 December 2006. 
(c) Other acquisitions 
The Group acquired the upstream gas assets of Frio Pipeline Co on 10 October 2006 (consideration £3.3 million, goodwill £nil) and  
the assets of Mr. Air Conditioning and Heating Inc on 16 October 2006 (consideration £0.5 million, goodwill £0.4 million) and 85% of  
the voting share capital of Coastal Energy Limited (consideration £1 million, goodwill £nil). The acquired businesses contributed to a loss  
after tax of £1 million to the Group from their respective dates of acquisition up to 31 December 2006. 
The pro-forma consolidated results of the Group, as if the 2006 acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the period include 
revenues of £16,513 million and a loss after tax of £154 million. The pro-forma results have been calculated using the Group’s accounting 
policies. In preparing the pro-forma results, revenue and costs have been included as if the business were acquired on 1 January 2006 
and intercompany transactions had been eliminated. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group 
that would have occurred had the purchases actually been made at the beginning of the period presented, or future results of the 
combined Group. 
During 2006 the Group paid £50 million of deferred and contingent consideration in relation to prior year acquisitions, of which  
£40 million related to the acquisition of CPL/WTU in 2002. 
(ii) Disposals 
Continuing operations 
During 2006 the Group paid £3 million for the construction and delivery of assets related to the order book of British Gas Connections 
Limited, which was disposed in 2005. Assets are expected to be constructed for the next four years. 
Discontinued operations 
During 2006 adjustments were made to the consideration received for the disposal of the AA in 2004 and Onetel in 2005. These included 
a £15 million payment in respect of the AA, for which provision had previously been made. The finalisation of the Onetel disposal has 
resulted in a charge to the Income Statement of £8 million, net of a £3 million tax credit. At the time of the disposal, the Group agreed to 
provide 225,000 customer connections each year until 2008, and recognised a provision of £13 million in respect of the marginal cost of 
the connections. During the year the Group exited this agreement for a payment of £21 million. £10 million of the provision was unutilised 
and has been released. £33 million has been received in respect of finalisation of working capital disposed.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

30.  Pensions 
Substantially all of the Group’s UK employees at 31 December 2006 were members of one of the three main schemes: the Centrica 
Pension Scheme (formerly the Centrica Staff Pension Scheme), the Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme and the Centrica Management 
Pension Scheme (the approved pension schemes). The Centrica Pension Scheme (final salary section) and the Centrica Management 
Pension Scheme (a final salary scheme) were closed to new members from 1 April 2003. The Centrica Pension Scheme has an open 
career average salary section. The Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme (final salary section) was closed to new members from 1 April 
2006, and a career average salary section was added to the scheme at that date. These schemes are defined benefit schemes, and  
are tax-approved funded arrangements. They are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the 
qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers’ contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees 
and proceeds from the schemes’ assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes. 
The Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees whose benefits 
under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the earnings cap. The Group also has a commitment to provide certain pension 
and post retirement benefits to employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (Canada). 
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March 2004, the 
Unapproved Pension Scheme at 6 April 2005 and the Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan at 14 June 2005. These have been 
updated to 31 December 2006 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19. Investments have been valued, for this purpose, 
at market value. At 31 December 2006, all of the schemes reported deficits when valued for the purposes of IAS 19.

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.00 2.85
Discount rate 5.00 4.85
Inflation assumption 3.00 2.85
The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination  
of standard actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include a medium cohort allowance for future 
improvements in longevity, as published by the Institute of Actuaries. The assumptions are equivalent to future longevity for members  
in normal health approximately as follows: 
Life expectancy at age 65 for a member: 
Male

Male

Female
Years 
Currently aged 65 20.2 21.7  18.8 22.7
Currently aged 45 21.3 22.9  20.6 24.5
At the most recent actuarial review of the schemes there were approximately 20,850 male (2005: 19,850) and 11,050 female  
(2005: 11,050) members and beneficiaries.  
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant  
data. The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes. 
Impact of changing material assumptions Change in assumption Indicative effect on scheme liabilities

Net pension liability (207) (571)
(i) £17 million of the liability relates to loss on curtailments included within exceptional restructuring costs arising in the year  
(2005: £13 million). In 2005, this amount was reflected in restructuring provisions within the Balance Sheet. In 2006 it has  
been included with the pension liability. 
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective expected 
returns on separate asset classes. The return on separate asset classes were derived as follows: the expected rate of return on equities is 
based on the expected median return over a ten-year period, as calculated by the independent company actuary. The median return over 
a longer period than ten years was not expected to be materially dissimilar. The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly 
from actual market yields for UK gilts and corporate bond stocks. The rate above takes into account the actual mixture of UK gilts, UK 
corporate bonds and overseas bonds held at the balance sheet date. The expected rate of return on property takes into account both 
capital growth and allowance for expenses, rental growth and depreciation. The expected rate of return on cash is comparable to current 
bank interest rates. 
Included within schemes’ liabilities above are £27 million (2005: £32 million) relating to unfunded pension arrangements. Included 
within other non-current financial assets are £29 million (2005: £31 million) of money market investments, held by the Law Debenture 
Trust on behalf of the Company, as security in respect of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme.

exceptional items and certain re-measurements. Future revisions to the assumption will be reflected within the Statement of

A full actuarial valuation is carried out at least triennially for the independent scheme Trustees by a professionally qualified independent 
actuary. The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to 
meet future liabilities. Actuarial valuations of the approved schemes as at 31 March 2006 are currently underway. Until the valuations are 
concluded, contributions will continue to be paid in accordance with the 2004 funding plan.  
The Centrica Pension Scheme (final salary section) and the Centrica Management Pension Scheme were closed to new members 
from 1 April 2003. The Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme (final salary section) was closed to new members from 1 April 2006. Under 
the projected unit method, used to value pension liabilities under IAS 19 for closed plans, the current service cost is expected to increase 
over time as members approach retirement.   Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

(a) Commitments 
At 31 December 2006, the Group had placed contracts for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to £447 million 
(2005: £108 million), and for the acquisition of intangible assets of £1,082 million (2005: £137 million). Commitments in relation to the 
acquisition of property, plant and equipment include £219 million in respect of the construction of a power station at Langage, £99 million 
in respect of construction of the Lynn and Inner Dowsing wind farms, £72 million in respect of the redevelopment of the Statfjord field, 
and £42 million in respect of the acquisition of the Braes of Doune wind farm. Commitments in relation to the acquisition of intangible 
assets include renewable obligation certificates of £869 million (2005: £103 million), carbon emissions certificates of £122 million  
(2005: £nil) and certified emission reduction certificates of £91 million (2005: £nil). 
At 31 December 2006 the Group had commitments of £44 million (2005: £49 million) relating to gas storage contracts in North 
America, and £21 million (2005: £nil) relating to contracts with out-source service providers. Other commitments at 31 December 2006 
amount to £52 million (2005: £13 million). 
(b) Decommissioning costs 
The Group has provided certain guarantees and indemnities to BG Group plc in respect of the decommissioning costs of the Morecambe 
gas fields. The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide security, in respect  
of such guarantees and indemnities, to BG International Limited, which, as original licence holder for the Morecambe gas fields, will  
have exposure to decommissioning costs relating to the Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully discharged by the Group. The 
security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields falls below 150% of the estimated 
cost of such decommissioning. The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force unless and until the 
costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant Department of Trade and Industry decommissioning 
notice in respect of the Morecambe gas fields has been revoked.

The total of future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received  
under non-cancellable operating sub-leases at 31 December 17 16
Lease and sub-lease payments recognised as an expense in the year were as follows: 
 Minimum lease payments 67 80
 Contingent rents – renewables 
(i)
 30 25
 Contingent rents – other – 1
(i) The Group has entered into long-term arrangements with renewable providers to purchase physical power, renewable obligation 
certificates and levy exemption certificates from renewable sources. Payments made under these contracts are contingent on actual 
production, and therefore the commitment to a minimum lease payment included above is £nil. Payments made for physical power 
are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and disclosed as contingent rents. 
(d) Contingent liabilities 
The Group is currently in dispute with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on a technical matter concerning intra-group transfer 
pricing of gas produced within the UK Continental Shelf. The Group has taken the advice of leading tax counsel, and believes that the risk 
that HMRC will succeed in its arguments is remote or slight. 
The Group has a number of outstanding disputes arising out of its normal activities, for which provisions have been made, where 
appropriate, in accordance with IAS 37. None of the provisions are individually significant. 
(e) Guarantees and indemnities 
The Company has £1,300 million of bilateral credit facilities (2005: £1,000 million). Hydrocarbon Resources Limited and British Gas 
Trading Limited have guaranteed, jointly and severally, to pay on demand any sum which the Company does not pay in accordance  
with the facility agreements. 
The Group has given guarantees in connection with the finance lease obligations referred to in note 20. A fixed collateral payment 
amounting to £240 million (2005: £245 million) is required in the event of Centrica plc failing to retain at least one credit rating which is  
not on credit watch above the BBB+/Baa1 level, and further collateral of £240 million (2005: £245 million) is required if the credit rating 
falls further.   Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

31.  Commitments and contingencies continued 
Group companies have given guarantees and indemnities, subject to certain limitations, to various counterparties in relation to wholesale 
energy trading and procurement activities, and to third parties in respect of gas production and energy transportation liabilities. 
In connection with their energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered into contracts 
under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in credit 
worthiness. The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration. 
Following the closure of the British Gas Energy Centres Limited (Energy Centres) operations in July 1999, guarantees have been 
signed on certain former Energy Centres’ properties as a result of reassignment of leases. 
(f) Other 
The Group’s use of financial instruments is explained in the Directors’ Report – Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 21 to 23  
and in note 33. 
(g) Commodity purchase contracts 
The Group procures gas and electricity through a mixture of production from owned gas fields and power stations and procurement 
contracts. Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices. They 
also include gas contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation. Further information about  
the Group’s procurement strategy is contained in note 33 (i). 
Commodity purchase commitments are estimated, on an undiscounted basis, as follows: 
 
2006
£m 
2005
£m 
Within one year 7,800 8,500
Between one and five years 16,100 16,500
After five years 10,400 10,600
 34,300 35,600
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual 
reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis. The resulting monetary commitment is based on 
the minimum quantities of gas that the Group is contracted to pay at estimated future prices. 
The estimated commitment to make payments under gas procurement contracts differs in scope and in basis from the principal value 
of energy derivatives disclosed in note 33. Only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and included in 
note 33. In addition, the volumes used in calculating principal values are estimated using valuation techniques. Contractual commitments 
which are subject to fulfilment of conditions precedent are excluded.

their employment by the Group. Key management personnel and their families purchase gas and electricity from the Group for domestic 
purposes on an arm’s length basis. 
33.  Financial instruments  
Exposure to commodity price risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and liquidity risk arises in the normal course of 
the Group’s business. Derivative financial instruments are entered into to reduce exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest 
rates and foreign exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments are also entered into for trading purposes. The Group also enters into 
primary financial instruments to finance the Group’s operations in the normal course of business. A financial instrument is defined in  
IAS 32 as any contract which gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. 
Further detail on the Group’s risk management policies is included within the Directors’ Report – Principal Risks and Uncertainties on 
pages 21 to 23. 
(i) Risks 
(a) Commodity price risk 
The most significant financial risk facing the Group relates to commodity prices, in particular for gas and electricity. Commodity price risk 
arises as a result of contracted or forecast retail sales of gas and electricity not being fully matched by equity production or procurement 
contracts with equivalent volumes, time periods and pricing. The risk is primarily that market prices for commodities will move adversely 
between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which the purchase cost is fixed, thereby potentially reducing 
expected margins. 
The Group monitors exposure to commodity price risk using volumetric limits set as a combination of long-standing target ranges and 
specific shorter-term targets for both gas and electricity. The volumetric limits are supported by the use of Value at Risk (VaR) and Profit at 
Risk (PaR) methodologies. 
Commodity price risk is managed through a mixture of production from owned gas fields and power stations, energy procurement  
and energy sales contracts. This reduces the volume of gas and electricity which remains to be procured at market prices. Procurement 
contracts include: 
 short-term forward market purchases and sales of gas and electricity at fixed prices; 
 long-term electricity contracts whose prices are indexed to coal prices which provides fuel diversity to electricity supply; 
 long-term electricity contracts with wind farms at a fixed or variable price; 
 short and long-term contracts to buy carbon credits; 
 long-term gas contracts whose prices are determined based on historic or forward quoted gas prices up to 12 months in advance  
of the period the gas is delivered, thus stabilising procurement and sales prices and eliminating exposure once the price has  
been determined; 
 long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation, which stabilise prices but also result in some exposure to other commodities  
and indices. The non-gas indexation in long-term gas contracts includes oil and oil products, coal and general indices such as the 
Producers Price Index (PPI). The contract prices are determined based on forward quoted prices for the commodities and indices  
up to 12 months in advance of the period in which the gas is delivered; and 
 long-term financial swaps (up to five years forward) based on energy market price indices. 
The volume variability in the contract portfolio is actively managed in order to optimise the use of the contracts.  
Certain of these procurement and sales contracts constitute derivative financial instruments which are within the scope of IAS 39 
whose fair value is recorded in the Financial Statements. The fair values of these contracts are subject to change resulting from changes  
in commodity prices, except for contracts which are indexed to the market price of the commodity which is the subject of the contract, 
and for which the price is not fixed in advance of delivery. 
Commodity price risk also arises from proprietary trading activity. These exposures are subject to volumetric limits on open exposures 
and to VaR limits. 
To manage the commodity price risk associated with gas and electricity purchase requirements the Group has entered into physical 
and financial gas, electricity and carbon purchase contracts, certain of which it has accounted for as cash flow hedges. The hedged  
item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet customer demand. The hedging instruments are fixed-price forward purchase 
contracts. The net fair value of commodity cash flow hedging instruments was a £484 million liability at 31 December 2006  
(2005: £481 million asset). Cash flow hedging has been discontinued for hedges of future oil production where the forecast production 
was not expected to occur in the anticipated timescale. Hedge ineffectiveness has arisen on certain cash flow hedges of future electricity 
sales where unseasonably high temperatures resulted in forecast demand being lower than originally expected. 
Commodity contracts are subject to legal and contract risk. The fair values of field-specific depletion contracts are by their nature also 
subject to reserves risk and other operational risks associated with gas production.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

33.  Financial instruments continued 
(b) Credit risk 
Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the financial benefits of contracts with a specific counterparty will be lost if a counterparty defaults 
on its obligations under the contract. This includes any cash amounts owed to the Group by those counterparties, less any amounts 
owed to the counterparty by the Group where a legal right of set-off exists and also includes the fair values of contracts with individual 
counterparties which are recorded in the Financial Statements. 
Energy wholesale and trading  
Counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved 
limits. The majority of significant exposures are with A-rated counterparties or better. A credit risk adjustment is made to the fair values  
of financial instruments in accordance with the credit rating of the counterparty. No credit risk adjustment is made to financial instruments 
under a joint operating agreement where operators are contractually required to fulfil the obligations of any defaulting party. 
Downstream businesses 
Exposure to credit risk arises in the normal course of operations as a result of the potential for a customer defaulting on their payable 
balance. In the case of business customers, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s credit worthiness and financial strength 
both before commencing to trade and during the business relationship. For residential customers, credit worthiness is ascertained 
normally before commencing to trade by reviewing an appropriate mix of internal and external information. An ageing of receivables  
is monitored and used to manage the exposure to credit risk. 
Collateral 
Centrica employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk including margining, various forms of bank and Parent Company 
Guarantees and Letters of Credit. In all cases the aim of setting up a credit risk mitigation instrument is to upgrade the credit risk to a 
better equivalent rating than the stand-alone rating of the counterparty. At 31 December 2006 Centrica had pledged £61 million of cash 
collateral (2005: £687 million of which £624 million related to cash collateralised on Letters of Credit provided by banks on borrowings 
relating to South Morecambe gas production) and had received £33 million (2005: £537 million) of cash collateral principally under margin 
calls to cover exposure to mark-to-market positions on derivative contracts. Most collateral paid or received is interest bearing and free  
of any restrictions over its use. 
Centrica also uses master netting agreements or netting provisions to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties 
where master netting agreements are held. 
Credit risk exposures 
With the exception of retail customers, the Group considers that 100% of its credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries 
or with financial institutions. There were no other significant concentrations of credit risk at 31 December 2006 (2005: none). The maximum 
credit exposure of financial instruments within the scope of IAS 39, without taking account of collateral, is represented by the balance 
sheet carrying amount for all financial assets.

(c) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group suffers financial loss due to changes in the value of an asset or liability or in the value of future 
cash flows due to movements in interest rates. Any financial asset or liability on which interest is paid or received will be subject to interest 
rate risk. The Group’s policy is to actively manage the interest rate risk on long-term recourse borrowings while ensuring that the 
exposure to fixed interest rates remains within a 30% – 70% range.  
Interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are used to manage interest rate risk within the 
Group. The net fair value of fair value interest rate hedging instruments was a £12 million liability at 31 December 2006 (2005: £3 million asset) 
and the net fair value of cash flow interest rate hedging instruments was a £28 million liability at 31 December 2006 (2005: £44 million liability).

(xiv) Other bank loans related to a bank’s interest in the Centrica Gas Production LP, a limited partnership, which was formed  
during 2005. The bank ceased to be a limited partner during 2006 and the arrangement with the bank was brought to an  
end on 11 August 2006. 
(d) Currency risk 
Currency risk is the risk that the Group suffers financial loss as a result of changes in the value of an asset or liability or in the value 
of future cash flows due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Through wholly-owned US, Canadian and European 
subsidiaries, the Group has exposures to US dollars, Canadian dollars and euros. The Group’s policy is to protect the sterling  
value of overseas investments by entering into net investment hedges. The Group commercially hedges all significant exposures  
to foreign currencies arising from operating activities where practicable. There were no material unhedged financial assets or  
liabilities at 31 December 2006 other than in the Group’s functional currencies, except for £28 million of assets denominated in  
euros (2005: £92 million of liabilities denominated in euros). The euro assets and liabilities represent short-term cash flow timing 
differences and the fair value of gas and electricity commodity contracts. 
Net investment hedges 
Centrica hedges the carrying value of its overseas investments through holding either foreign currency debt or entering into foreign 
currency derivatives or a mixture of both. Centrica enters into short-term foreign exchange forwards and medium-term cross-currency 
interest rate swaps to hedge the net investments. Changes in the sterling value of borrowings or derivatives are used to offset changes  
in the sterling value of the investments. The net fair value of net investment hedging instruments at 31 December 2006 was a £115 million 
liability (2005: £468 million liability), consisting of borrowings of £117 million (2005: £377 million) and derivative financial instruments of a 
£2 million asset (2005: £91 million liability). The borrowings of £117 million (2005: £377 million) comprise £49 million US dollar commercial 
paper (2005: £377 million) and £68 million euro floating rate note (2005: £nil). 
Cash flow hedges 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the risk that future foreign currency cash flows vary with changes in foreign 
exchange rates by fixing the sterling value of a specified foreign currency amount on a specified basis. The net fair value of derivative 
financial instruments designated as currency cash flow hedging instruments at 31 December 2006 was a £1 million liability  
(2005: £8 million liability). 
The maturity analysis of amounts included in the cash flow hedging reserve, which includes fair value gains and losses in relation  
to commodity, interest rate risk and currency hedges is as follows:

(e) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities. Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements 
of the Group are produced frequently. The cash forecasts are stress-tested for different scenarios and are reviewed regularly to ensure 
sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period. The Group’s policy includes maintaining a minimum level of committed 
facilities of £800 million less available cash resources and that at least 50% of net debt (excluding non-recourse debt) over £200 million 
should be long-term, spread over a range of maturities. 
Borrowings 
At 31 December 2006, the Group had undrawn committed bank borrowing facilities of £1,300 million (2005: £1,000 million). These facilities 
mature in 2010. In addition the Group has access to a number of uncommitted facilities. 
The principal debt facilities in use by the Group at 31 December 2006 consisted of a US commercial paper programme of US$2,000 
million (2005: US$2,000 million) and a Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme of US$3,000 million (2005: US$2,000 million). At  
31 December 2006, US$200 million (2005: US$658 million) had been issued under the commercial paper programme and bonds totalling 
£1,183 million (2005: £415 million) were outstanding under the EMTN programme. The commercial paper issued was held in US dollars 
to hedge the Group’s net investments in North America and other exposures to US dollars within the Group. The EMTN includes a euro 
floating rate note which was used to hedge the Group’s net investments in Europe. 
(ii) Fair values 
The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments together with the carrying amounts included in the Group Balance Sheet are  
analysed below. Balances excluded from the scope of IAS 32 comprise trade and other receivables with a carrying value of £265 million  
(2005: £296 million), trade and other payables with a carrying value of £329 million (2005: £274 million) and provisions of £406 million 
(2005: £354 million).

The principal value differs in scope and in basis from the estimated commitment to make payments under procurement contracts, 
disclosed in note 31 (g). The principal value provides an indication of the scope of the use of derivatives but does not reflect the risk  
the Group is exposed to from entering into derivatives.

The major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of derivative financial instruments are as follows: 
Energy derivatives 
Commodity price risk is managed through a mixture of production from owned gas fields and power stations, energy procurement and 
energy sales contracts. Certain of these procurement and sales contracts constitute derivative financial instruments which are within the 
scope of IAS 39 and whose fair value is recorded in the Financial Statements. These fair value balances therefore represent only a part  
of the Group’s overall energy procurement activities. The criteria for determining treatment of contracts in accordance with IAS 39 are 
outlined in note 3. 
The fair values represent the unrealised gains and losses from holding commodity contracts at the balance sheet date, for delivery  
in future periods, that are not indexed to the market price of the commodity which is the subject of the contract or for which the price is 
fixed in advance of delivery. These fair values are subject to change resulting from changes in commodity prices, and may not be realised. 
The methods and assumptions applied in determining fair values are described under ‘UK markets’ and ‘North American markets’ below. 
The effect of changes in assumptions, and sensitivities to changes in commodity prices, are set out in ‘Effect of changes in assumptions 
and sensitivities’ below. 
The net fair value of the contracts at 31 December 2006 included within energy derivatives in the derivative financial instruments table 
on page 97 is a £1,098 million liability (2005: £690 million asset) and consists of the following balances:

The aggregated principal value of energy derivatives (sales and purchases), and its range of maturities, which provides an indication of  
the underlying maturity profile, is contained in the table on page 97. The cash flows arising in relation to these contracts will occur either 
as physical delivery takes place over the life of the individual contracts, or as a result of the contracts being traded or may not be realised 
depending on market price movements. The Group’s strategy for entering into energy derivatives, and a summary of the terms and 
conditions of these contracts, is outlined on pages 92 and 93. 
Certain other commodity contracts are outside the scope of IAS 39 and are not fair valued in the Financial Statements. The disclosures 
that follow relate only to the fair values of contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

33. Financial instruments continued 
UK markets 
Fair values of commodity contracts are estimated by reference in part to published price quotations in active markets and in part by using 
valuation techniques. Management consider the UK markets for gas and electricity to be active for up to two years, with reliable broker 
quotes and published prices available for this period. In the active period of the market, financial instruments are valued against forward 
market prices available at the balance sheet date. Outside the active period financial instruments are valued using commodity prices 
derived using assumptions that are based on market expectations and reasonably reflect all factors that market participants would 
consider in setting a price. Forecast prices are derived for the commodities which are the subject of the contracts (primarily gas and 
electricity) and for commodities whose indices are incorporated in the price calculation formulae of certain long-term contracts. These 
include oil and oil products, coal, and general indices such as the Producer Price Index (PPI). Fair values are discounted based on the 
yields on zero-coupon bonds with differing maturity dates as available in the market, and interpolated to arrive at monthly rates. 
The total change in fair value estimated using valuation techniques that was recognised in the Income Statement during the year ended 
31 December 2006 amounted to a loss of £117 million (2005: loss of £91 million). The net fair value of commodity contracts recorded in 
the Financial Statements determined using valuation techniques at 31 December 2006 is a £262 million liability (2005: £170 million liability). 
Assumptions made in determining fair values 
The most significant assumptions incorporated in the valuation techniques used to value commodity contracts at 31 December 2006 are 
as follows: 
 new gas infrastructure capacity will strengthen the direct linkage between UK and continental European gas prices in the medium-term; 
 a potential oversupply of gas to the UK market will lower prices during this time; 
 interaction between US and European gas prices will occur in certain periods as cargoes of LNG may be directed to either European 
or US markets; 
 European gas prices will retain significant oil linkage in the medium-term although liberalisation of the European gas market should 
weaken the linkage between oil prices and gas prices in the long-term; 
 electricity prices are derived from gas prices, carbon prices and the clean spark spread (the margin between gas and carbon input 
prices and electricity sales prices). Gas-fired power stations are assumed to determine the long-run marginal price of electricity in  
the UK for the foreseeable future; 
 oil prices are based on the views held by a number of independent external market experts; 
 UK coal prices are based on the assumption that market prices will be dominated by the cost of imported coal and that the price  
of coal shows some linkage to the price of oil; 
 for contracts with volume optionality it is assumed that counterparties act to maximise the economic value of the contract; and 
 it is assumed that markets would allow the sale or purchase of each commodity in equivalent volumes to those contracted at the 
forecast market price. 
Effect of changes in assumptions and sensitivities 
Either of the following alternative assumptions, or a combination of these alternative assumptions, would significantly increase forecast 
gas and electricity prices both within and outside the active period of the market: 
 higher oil prices and continued strong linkage between oil and gas prices; and 
 lower supply to the UK gas market, for instance due to insufficient new infrastructure being put in place, or due to higher worldwide 
competition for gas supplies. 
The impact of changing to either of these reasonably possible alternative assumptions, individually or in combination, would be to 
decrease the net fair value liabilities for commodity contracts outside the active period of the market at 31 December 2006 by an 
estimated £43 million (2005: increase to the net fair value liabilities of an estimated £35 million). 
Management consider it likely that the occurrence of these alternative assumptions would be accompanied by an increase in gas  
and electricity prices in the active period of the market. An average increase of 15p/th for gas and £11/MWh for electricity is considered 
reasonably possible at 31 December 2006. The impact of such increases in gas and electricity prices in the active period would be to 
decrease net fair value liabilities at 31 December 2006 by £382 million (2005: an average increase of 20p/th for gas and £15/MWh for 
electricity was considered reasonably possible at 31 December 2005 leading to an increase to the net fair value assets of an estimated 
£686 million). 
In combination the increase in gas and electricity prices in the active and inactive periods would decrease net fair value liabilities at  
31 December 2006 by an estimated £425 million (2005: increase to the net fair value assets of an estimated £651 million). A combination 
of the following alternative assumptions would significantly decrease forecast gas prices both within and outside the active period of  
the market: 
 lower oil prices and continued linkage between oil and gas prices; 
 a discontinuation of the linkage between oil and gas prices in the medium-term; 
 liberalisation in the European gas market, if this were to result in increased competition between gas producers; and 
 a degree of oversupply to the UK gas market resulting from new infrastructure or lower worldwide demand for gas.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

33.  Financial instruments continued 
The impact of changing to a reasonably possible combination of these alternative assumptions would be to increase the net fair value 
liabilities for commodity contracts outside the active period of the market at 31 December 2006 by approximately £82 million (2005: 
decrease to the net fair value liabilities of an estimated £20 million). 
Management consider it likely that the occurrence of these alternative assumptions would be accompanied by a decrease in gas 
prices in the active period of the market. An average decrease of 13p/th for gas and £9/MWh for electricity is considered reasonably 
possible at 31 December 2006. The impact of such decreases in gas and electricity prices in the active period would be to increase net 
fair value liabilities at 31 December 2006 by £349 million (2005: an average decrease of 20p/th for gas and £15/MWh for electricity was 
considered reasonably possible at 31 December 2005 leading to a decrease to the net fair value assets of an estimated £681 million). 
In combination the decrease in gas and electricity prices in the active and inactive periods would increase net fair value liabilities at  
31 December 2006 by an estimated £431 million (2005: decrease to the net fair value assets of an estimated £661 million). 
The impacts disclosed above result from changing the assumptions used for fair valuing commodity contracts to reasonably possible 
alternative assumptions at the balance sheet date. These impacts are not necessarily indicative of the changes in fair value that would 
occur if these events actually take place in the future, as contractual positions change over time. The fair value impacts only concern 
those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39 and should not be construed as a measure of the Group’s exposure  
to cash flow risk resulting from changes in commodity prices. 
North American markets 
Management consider the North American markets for gas and electricity to be active for between one and five years and vary depending 
on delivery point. The fair value of financial instruments recorded in the Financial Statements is primarily based on quoted market prices  
in active markets. 
Management consider an average increase in gas prices of 13p/th (2005: 16p/th) and an average increase in electricity prices of 
£13/MWh (2005: £10/MWh) reasonably possible at 31 December 2006. The impact of such increases in commodity prices would be  
to decrease net fair value liabilities at 31 December 2006 by £630 million (2005: increase net fair value assets by £777 million). 
Management consider an average decrease in gas prices of 9p/th (2005: 15p/th) and an average decrease in electricity prices of 
£7/MWh (2005: £9/MWh) reasonably possible at 31 December 2006. The impact of such decreases in commodity prices would be to 
increase net fair value liabilities at 31 December 2006 by £363 million (2005: decrease net fair value assets by £704 million). 
The impacts disclosed above result from changing the assumptions used for fair valuing commodity contracts to reasonably possible 
alternative assumptions at the balance sheet date. These impacts are not necessarily indicative of the changes in fair value that would 
occur if these events actually take place in the future, as contractual positions change over time. The fair value impacts only concern 
those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39 and should not be construed as a measure of the Group’s exposure  
to cash flow risk resulting from changes in commodity prices. 
Foreign exchange derivatives 
Fair values have been determined with reference to closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

34.  Fixed fee service contracts 
Fixed fee service contracts are entered into with home services customers in the UK and North America (Central Heating Care, Boiler and 
Controls Care, Gas Appliance Care, Gas Appliance Check, Plumbing and Drains Care, Kitchen Appliance Care and Home Electrical Care 
in the UK, and Heating Protection Plus, Cooling Protection Plus and Plumbing and Drains Protection in North America). These contracts 
continue until cancelled by either party to the contract. These plans incorporate both an annual service element and a maintenance element. 
Fixed fee service contracts protect purchasers of these contracts against the risk of breakdown of electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling 
and household appliances, resulting in the transfer of an element of risk from contract holders to Centrica. Benefits provided to customers 
vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into, however generally include repair and/or replacement of the 
items affected. 
The risk and level of service required within the maintenance element of the contracts is dependent upon the occurrence of uncertain 
future events, in particular the number of call outs, the cost per call out and the nature of the fault. Accordingly the timing and amount of 
future cash outflows related to the contracts is uncertain. 
The key terms and conditions that impact future cash flows are as follows: 
 provision of labour and parts for repairs, dependent on the agreement and associated level of service; 
 one safety and maintenance inspection in every year of the agreement (for Central Heating Care, Boiler and Controls Care, Gas 
Appliance Care and Gas Appliance Check in the UK, and Heating Protection Plus and Cooling Protection Plus in North America); 
 one safety and maintenance inspection in every continuous two-year period of the agreement (for Home Electrical Care, Kitchen 
Appliance Care and Plumbing and Drains Care); 
 no limit to the number of call outs to carry out work included within the selected agreement; and 
 caps on certain maintenance and repair costs within fixed fee contracts. 
Revenue from fixed fee service contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, reflecting the benefits 
receivable by the customer which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance potentially being required at any 
point within the contract term. 
Cost of sales relates directly to the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home services, the cost of which is accounted for 
over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a given year. 
The costs of claims under the fixed fee service contracts will be the costs of the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home 
services. These costs are accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a 
given year. No further claims costs are accrued. 
Weather conditions and the seasonality of maintenance can impact the number of call outs, the cost per call out and the nature of 
the fault. Centrica’s obligations under the terms of its home services fixed fee service contracts are based on the following types of 
uncertain future events taking place within the contract period: 
 boiler, radiator, controls, hot water cylinder and pipe work breakdown; 
 gas fire, water heater, wall heater and gas cooker breakdown; 
 hot and cold water pipe, overflow, cold tank, toilet siphon and radiator valve breakdown; 
 washing machine, tumble drier, dishwasher, fridge, freezer, cooker, oven, hob and microwave oven breakdown; 
 fixed electrical wiring system, fuse box, light switch, wall socket, circuit breaker and transformer breakdown; 
 ventor motor, circuit board, direct drive motor and flame sensor breakdown; and 
 evaporator and condenser fan motor breakdown. 
Centrica actively manages the risk exposure of these uncertain events by undertaking the following risk mitigation activities: 
 an initial service visit is performed for central heating care. If, at the initial visit, faults that cannot be rectified are identified, the fixed fee 
service contract will be cancelled and no further cover provided; 
 an annual or bi-annual safety and maintenance inspection is performed to ensure all issues are identified prior to them developing into 
significant maintenance or breakdown issues; and 
 caps on certain maintenance and repair work are incorporated into fixed fee service contracts to limit liability in areas considered to be 
higher risk in terms of prevalence and cost to repair. 
The Group considers the adequacy of estimated future cash flows under the contracts to meet expected future costs under the 
contracts. Any deficiency is charged immediately to the Income Statement. 
Service requests are sensitive to the reliability of appliances as well as the impact of weather conditions. Each incremental 1% increase 
in service requests would impact profit and equity by approximately £7 million. The contracts are neither exposed to any interest rate risk, 
significant credit risk, nor are there any exposures relating to embedded derivatives.

35.  Events after the balance sheet date 
The Directors propose a final dividend of 8.0 pence per share (totalling £293 million) for the year ended 31 December 2006. The dividend 
will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 May 2007. These Financial Statements do not reflect 
this dividend payable, which will be accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending  
31 December 2007. 
On 8 February 2007 the Group’s subsidiary The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund acquired the water heater rental business  
of Toronto Hydro Energy Services Inc for consideration of C$41 million (£18 million) in cash. Management considers it impracticable  
to disclose information about the fair value of the net assets acquired since the findings of the valuation exercise are not yet available. 
In January 2007 the Group was awarded participation in four exploration licences located in the Norwegian Sea and Northern  
North Sea. The Group will have an operated interest in three licences, with non-operatorship in one block. In addition the Group has  
been awarded two exploration licences located in the East Irish Sea, adjacent to Centrica’s Morecambe fields.

The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund (the Fund) is also consolidated as part of the Group. The Group has determined that the Fund 
is a subsidiary due to the substance of the arrangements. The Fund commenced operating on 17 December 2002. On 27 April 2006,  
the 19.9% interest held in the Fund by Direct Energy Marketing Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centrica plc, was transferred to  
its wholly-owned subsidiary, DEML Investments Limited. On 23 June 2006, DEML Investments Limited disposed of its 19.9% interest. 
Therefore, at 31 December 2006 Centrica held a nil% interest in the Fund (2005: 19.9%). Up until 23 June 2006, DEML Investments 
Limited held 100% of the class B exchangeable units in Waterheater Holding Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the Fund. Class B 
exchangeable units were exchangeable into units of the Fund and attracted comparable voting rights to units of the Fund. Units of the 
Fund are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
(i) All principal undertakings are indirectly held by the Company, except for Centrica Holdings Limited, which is a direct subsidiary 
undertaking. The information is only given for those subsidiaries which in the Directors’ opinion principally affect the figures shown  
in the Financial Statements. 
(ii) The Centrica Gas Production LP is a ‘qualifying partnership’ and is included on a consolidated basis within the Financial Statements 
of the Group. It has no share capital. Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, a Centrica Group company, exercises management of the 
partnership as the general partner. Its registered office is Millstream, Maidenhead Road, Windsor SL4 5GD.

comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent 
Company Financial Statements have been prepared under  
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the Remuneration Report that is described  
as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group Financial 
Statements of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2006. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Remuneration Report and the parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and United  
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company Financial 
Statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be  
audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent 
Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view and 
whether the parent Company Financial Statements and the part  
of the Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We 
also report to you whether in our opinion the information  
given in the Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report – 
Business Review and the Directors’ Report – Governance)  
is consistent with the parent Company Financial Statements.  
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received  
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or  
if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration  
and other transactions is not disclosed.  
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent Company 
Financial Statements. The other information comprises only the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the 
Remuneration Report, the Gas and Liquid Reserves, Five Year Record 
and Shareholder Information. We consider the implications for our 
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the parent Company Financial Statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent 
Company Financial Statements and the part of the Remuneration 
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the parent Company Financial Statements, and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent Company Financial Statements and  
the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent 
Company Financial Statements and the part of the Remuneration 
Report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 the parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2006; 
 the parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent  
with the parent Company Financial Statements.

Notes to the Company Balance Sheet

i. Principal accounting policies of the Company 
Accounting principles 
The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and under the historical  
cost convention and the Companies Act 1985. 
Basis of preparation 
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985. The Company’s 
profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2006 was £1,939 million (2005: £11 million). 
Employee share schemes 
The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Directors’ Report – Corporate Responsibility on page 26, the 
Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 36, and in note 25 to the Group Financial Statements, under which it makes equity-settled share-
based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant (excluding the 
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions). For share-based payments to employees of the Company, the fair value determined at 
the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Equity-settled 
share-based payments which are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the 
vesting period of the award, with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, based on the Group’s estimate 
of the number of awards that will vest, and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: 
LTIS: awards up to 2005 A Black-Scholes valuation augmented by a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total  
shareholder return performance 
LTIS: 2006 EPS awards  Market value on the date of grant 
LTIS: 2006 TSR awards A Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total shareholder return performance 
Sharesave Black-Scholes 
ESOS Black-Scholes using an adjusted option life assumption to reflect the possibility of early exercise 
Share Award Scheme Market value on the date of grant 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange. Exchange differences on monetary 
assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. 
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values,  
of individual assets over their estimated useful lives at periods ranging from five to 20 years.  
Leases 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are held in the Balance Sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment as necessary. Current asset investments 
are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Pensions and other retirement benefits 
The Company’s employees participate in a number of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 30 to the Group 
Financial Statements. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a consistent 
and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes. The charge to the profit and 
loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in the accounting period. Details of the defined benefit schemes of the 
Group (accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies detailed in note 2 to the Group Financial Statements) can be 
found in note 30 to the Group Financial Statements.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

i. Principal accounting policies of the Company continued 
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at  
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial 
Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the Financial Statements. 
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can  
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless, by the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to sell 
the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the Financial Statements. Deferred tax is not 
recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if 
and when the replacement assets are sold. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the 
balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been 
entered into by the subsidiary or associate. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Financial instruments 
The Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments are consistent with those of the Group, and are disclosed in note 2 to the 
Group Financial Statements. The Company’s financial risk management policies are consistent with those of the Group and are described 
in the Directors’ Report – Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 21 to 23 and in note 33 to the Group Financial Statements.  
The Company is exempted by FRS 25 from providing detailed disclosures in respect of its financial instruments because the Company 
is included within the Group’s consolidated accounts and its financial instruments are incorporated into the disclosures in note 33 to the 
Group Financial Statements. 
ii. Directors and employees 
Included within the Company’s profit and loss charge for the year are wages and salaries costs of £91 million (2005: £90 million),  
social security costs of £9 million (2005: £6 million) and other pension and retirement benefit costs of £25 million (2005: £18 million). 
The average number of employees of the Company during the year was 1,529 (2005: 1,580), all of whom were employed in the UK.

Electronic communications 
Recent changes in legislation mean that, subject to the necessary 
authority being passed at the forthcoming AGM, Centrica is now 
able to offer shareholders the opportunity to receive shareholder 
documentation via its website. These changes, introduced by the 
Government, recognise the increasing role that the internet plays  
in timely communications. 
You may now choose either to: 
 receive shareholder documentation by website communication 
by providing us with an email address (to do this, please go  
online to www.centrica.com/ecomms); or 
 continue to receive shareholder documentation in hard copy (to 
do this, please complete and return the personalised prepaid 
form of election attached to the enclosed AGM proxy card so 
that it is received no later than 30 June 2007). If you do not 
return the form you will be taken, subject to the necessary 
authority being passed at the AGM, to have agreed to receive 
shareholder documentation via the website.  
Shareholders who receive shareholder documentation from 
Centrica electronically can in future:  
 view the Annual Report on the day it is published; 
 have access to significantly greater volumes of information 
about Centrica; 
 cast their AGM vote electronically; and  
 access details of their individual shareholding quickly and 
securely online.  
This new legislation provides shareholders with the opportunity  
to access information in a timely manner and helps Centrica  
to reduce both its costs and its impact on the environment. 
The Centrica website 
The Centrica website at www.centrica.com provides news and 
details of the Company’s activities, plus information on the share 
price and links to our business sites. 
The investor information section of the website contains  
up-to-date information for shareholders including the Company’s 
latest results and key dates such as dividend payment dates. It 
also holds historical details such as past dividend payment dates 
and amounts, and a comprehensive share price information 
section. Visit www.centrica.com/shareholders. 
Centrica shareholder helpline 
Centrica’s shareholder register is maintained by Lloyds TSB 
Registrars, which is responsible for making dividend payments  
and updating the register.

 transfer of shares; 
 change of name or address; 
 lost share certificate; 
 lost or out-of-date dividend cheques and payment of dividends 
into a bank or building society account; and 
 death of the registered holder of shares or any other query

The Centrica FlexiShare service 
 
 
By transferring your shares into FlexiShare you will benefit from: 
 low-cost share dealing facilities provided by a panel of 
independent brokers; 
 quicker settlement periods;  
 no certificates to lose; and 
 a dividend reinvestment plan – your cash dividend can be used 
to buy more Centrica shares (for a small dealing charge) which 
are then credited to your FlexiShare account. 
FlexiShare is a ‘corporate nominee’, sponsored by Centrica and 
administered by Lloyds TSB Registrars. It is a convenient way  
to manage your Centrica shares without the need for a share 
certificate. Your share account details will be held on a separate 
register and you will receive an annual confirmation statement. 
Participants will have the same rights to attend and vote at general 
meetings as all other shareholders. There is no charge for holding 
your shares in FlexiShare, nor for transferring in or out at any time. 
For further details about FlexiShare, please call the Centrica 
shareholder helpline on 0870 600 3985 or visit 
www.centrica.com/flexishare. 
Direct dividend payments 
Dividends can be paid automatically into your bank or building 
society account. This service has a number of benefits: 
 there is no chance of the dividend cheque going missing  
in the post; 
 the dividend payment is received more quickly as the cash  
is paid directly into the account on the payment date without  
the need to pay in the cheque and wait for it to clear; and 
 a single consolidated tax voucher is issued at the end of each 
tax year, in March, in time for your self-assessment tax return. 
Direct dividend payment also helps Centrica improve its  
efficiency by reducing postage and cheque clearance costs.  
To register for this service, please call the Centrica shareholder 
helpline on 0870 600 3985 to request a direct dividend payment 
form, or download it from our website at 
www.centrica.com/shareholders. 
Overseas dividend payments 
A service has been established to provide shareholders in over  
30 countries with the opportunity to receive Centrica dividends 
in their local currency. For a small fixed fee, shareholders can  
have their dividends automatically converted from sterling and  
paid into their bank account, normally within five working days  
of the dividend payment date. For further details, please contact 
the Centrica overseas shareholder helpline on +44 121 415 7061. 
Buying and selling shares in the UK 
If you wish to buy or sell certificated Centrica shares, you will  
need to use a stockbroker or high street bank which trades on  
the London Stock Exchange. There are many telephone and online 
services available. If you are selling, you will need to present your 
share certificate at the time of sale. FlexiShare (details above) offers 
a year-round, low-cost dealing service to its participants.  Directors’ Report – Business Review p05 Directors’ Report – Governance p27 Financial Statements p43 Shareholder Information p113

Centrica plc FTSE 100 Relative
Dec 2006 Jan 2001
We achieved a good underlying financial
performance despite the challenging
circumstances through the year and
delivered sound earnings* growth. 
In the winter of 2005/06, gas
shortages in the UK and increasing
worldwide demand for energy drove
wholesale prices to record levels,
necessitating price increases. The
management team sought to minimise
the effect of these by containing costs
and developing innovative products.
Later in the year, new gas pipelines
from Norway and Holland, underpinned
by contracts entered into by British
Gas, came on-stream. This change 
in the balance of supply and demand,
combined with a fall in global oil prices
and a warmer than expected autumn,
lowered wholesale gas prices, enabling
British Gas to announce price reductions
from March 2007. 
The Board proposes a final dividend
of 8.0 pence for payment in June 2007,
bringing our full-year dividend to 
11.15 pence, representing a 6% 
year-on-year increase. If more benign
market conditions continue, we may 
be able to consider reinstating our
share buyback programme.
Management changes
Sam Laidlaw became Chief Executive 
in July, following Sir Roy Gardner’s
retirement. Mark Clare, Managing
Director of British Gas Residential,
left the Company. Patricia Mann OBE retired,
and her role as Senior Non-Executive
Director was assumed by Mary Francis
CBE. Sadly, Patricia died later in the year. 
Phil Bentley moves to the role of
Managing Director, British Gas, following
the appointment of Nick Luff as Group
Finance Director. Jake Ulrich is now
responsible for our continental
European operations.
We established a main Board
committee to lead our corporate
responsibility strategy, chaired by 
Mary Francis. 
Our employees
Our employees worked particularly 
hard in responding to the unusually
demanding environment. I thank them
all for their loyalty and dedication. 
Tragically the risks of working offshore
were again made evident when six
people, four of them Centrica employees,
were killed in a helicopter accident in
Morecambe Bay at Christmas, with a
seventh person still missing, presumed
dead. Our thoughts and deepest
sympathies are with their families.
The future
We begin 2007 under new leadership
and with continued commitment to the
twin goals of customer service and
shareholder value creation. Lower
wholesale energy prices have provided
us with the opportunity to reduce retail
prices and we expect the completion 
of new systems to help address the
service levels. We will also continue our
search for cost-effective supply sources
to rebalance our market exposure and
sharpen our competitive edge.
Our cost structure will be the focus 
of continued stringent appraisal, and
our commitment to meet the growing
consumer demand for energy efficiency
will be at the heart of our endeavours.

British Gas Against a backdrop of unprecedented
volatility Centrica produced a solid set
of financial results. 
Our UK retail businesses have had 
a difficult year, but all have met the
challenges with determination.
High wholesale prices meant British
Gas Residential made a significant 
loss* in the first six months of the year.
Despite continuing to launch innovative
products, including the very successful
Fix and Fall offering, we lost 1,029,000 
energy accounts.
Once the outlook for wholesale
prices became clearer, British Gas 
took the lead in announcing a price
reduction to residential customers 
of 17% in gas and 11% in electricity,
effective from 12 March 2007. 
British Gas Services finished 
the year strongly as the changes we 
made to systems, management and
processes improved both operational
and service measures.
A fire at the Rough storage facility 
led to a four-month shutdown. An
exceptional effort by the Centrica
Storage team restored operations 
in time for the start of the winter
production season, enabling the asset
to deliver another strong financial result.
In North America, Direct Energy 
had another year of record figures 
with turnover up 15%, primarily
because of strong growth in business
markets and in Texas. Despite this
strong overall growth, decisive action
was taken to reduce costs, resulting 
in 450 job losses during the year. 
The European business made
considerable progress, moving firmly
into profit*. 
Centrica regards safety as a top
priority and is committed to providing 
a healthy and safe environment for
employees and the communities it
touches. It was, therefore, distressing
that the year ended on such a tragic 
note with a helicopter accident in the
Morecambe Bay area, claiming the lives
of six people, four of them long-serving
Centrica employees, with a seventh
person still missing, presumed dead. 
We have set up a memorial trust in 
their name. 
Outlook
The core businesses remain strong and
we are in an enviable position in most 
of our markets. 
In addition, the wholesale pricing
environment is starting to improve.
However, it is clear that the returns 
in our residential business in the UK
have been low and we have been 
over-exposed to the rapidly rising
wholesale cost of the energy we 
supply to our customers. We have 
also delivered less than satisfactory
customer service in British Gas as 
we moved our customer data from a
number of old systems on to a single
computerised system.
I have set out some clear priorities: 
Transform British Gas; 
Sharpen up the organisation and
reduce costs; 
Reduce risk by adding new sources
of gas and power;
Build on our multiple growth platforms.
We made some progress on this
agenda during the second half of the
year. As well as the price reduction, 
we launched our Essentials Tariff 
to provide protection to our most
vulnerable customers. The service
levels in our British Gas Services
business have shown a significant
improvement and our attention is 
now firmly focused on service levels 
in the residential business. 
We have restructured parts of 
the corporate centre, British Gas
Residential and British Gas Services,
resulting in around 1,550 job losses.
We will continue to review the structure
of our business and seek further
efficiencies. British Gas Residential is 
on track to return to a more sustainable

We expect gas production levels 
to be broadly flat on 2006 in Centrica
Energy and we should see further
growth in British Gas Business. In
British Gas Services we believe the
investment we have made in new
systems, management and processes
will deliver significantly improved
financial performance in 2007. 
In North America, revenue and profit*
are expected to increase, with further
growth in business markets mainly 
in the northeastern United States.
Further expansion in continental Europe
remains important. However, we remain
cautious about the potential for making
further inroads in the short term.
Global warming is taking on 
greater importance for governments,
companies and consumers alike. While
Centrica already has the lowest carbon
intensity profile of the major UK power
suppliers, we will continue to expand
our investments in the area of renewable
energy and promote the use of energy-
efficient technology by consumers. 
We will also capitalise on our unique
expertise and capability to deliver
energy efficiency advice, services 
and products to our business and
residential customers. 
I am optimistic for 2007, which 
I feel sure will be an important year 
in Centrica’s development. I anticipate
making real progress and delivering 
a step up in the performance of 
the business.

Calling direct
Our business customers have 
told us they don’t like being 
passed around departments.
So British Gas Business is
providing all business customers
with an account manager such as
Sheena Raichura (pictured) who 
will be their single named point 
of contact with a direct phone 
line and email address.
Every account manager will
manage a portfolio of customers
and be responsible for handling all
of their queries and product needs.
The focus is on building successful
and profitable relationships.
This approach breaks the mould
in the energy markets and is
generating excitement and positive
reaction among business customers.
Ninety-five per cent of
our small and medium-sized 
enterprise customers renewed 
their contracts with British Gas
Business during 2006.
Overnight success
The new British Gas Services
distribution centre in Leicester has
been designed to speed up repairs 
for our customers. Parts ordered by
6:30pm can be delivered to engineers
by 7:45am the next day. The centre
stocks 28,000 different parts and
issues around 21,800 items every day.
Centrica plc Annual Review 2006

Business Review Turnover increased by 18% to 
£7.1 billion, and operating profit*
rose by 6% to £95 million. 
At the end of December, we had 
16 million energy accounts, a net loss
of 1,029,000. But launching innovative
products, such as Fix and Fall, has
helped to contain customer losses. 
We moved 95% of our customer
accounts on to our new billing system
but this transfer process, combined
with increased calls experienced when
prices went up, meant customer
service levels dropped. In response, 
we increased front-line staff by 800. We
plan to make ongoing cost savings by,
for example, closing some of our offices.
We installed more than 13 million
energy efficiency measures, such as 
loft and cavity wall insulation, with an
equivalent carbon saving of 1 million
tonnes. We also have a range of energy
efficiency services, including our Energy
Savers Report, which 1.5 million
customers completed in 2006.
British Gas was selected as an
accredited supplier for the Government’s
Low Carbon Building Programme, the
only company to gain that status across
all five microgeneration technologies.
Low temperatures in early 2006 led 
to a record number of call-outs, which 
put extra pressure on operations and
affected service levels. But operational
performance improved considerably in
the second half as process and system
changes were implemented. This
restructure resulted in 390 job losses.
In addition, the second half of the
year saw a stronger performance in the
central heating installation business with
a 9% increase on the same period last
year, recovering much of the fall in the
first half.
Turnover was up by 8% at 
£1.1 billion as the number of contracts
rose by 4% to just over 7 million.
Operating profit* went down by 8% to
£102 million because of the increased
breakdown call-outs and the extra cost
of parts required for the repairs in the
first half of the year. The second half
showed a year-on-year improvement 
of 12%. 
During the year, we installed around
90,000 energy-efficient boilers and our
engineers are now providing solar thermal
products for domestic customers.
We increased our total supply points 
by 2.5% to 932,000, despite increasing
prices to customers. Higher churn rates
were more than offset by a strong sales
performance, small and medium-sized
enterprise (SME) contract renewal levels
of over 95% and further improvements
in retaining corporate customers. 
Turnover rose by 53% to £2.3 billion
because of price rises, growing
customer numbers and higher average
consumption as a result of winning a
number of large corporate accounts. 
Operating profit* climbed 13% to 
£87 million despite a significant loss*
before the price increase in March.
Profit* in the second half was markedly
higher as tariff increases took effect and
wholesale costs reduced. Operating
costs went up, partly because of
investments in a new billing system 
and higher sales and marketing costs. 
We made progress on a customer
service initiative that will create a 
single named point of contact for 
each customer and on the deployment 
of new technology and processes. 
We also continued to establish 
our position as an industry leader 
by supplying smart meters that 
provide real-time consumption 
data to help customers improve 
their energy efficiency.

Gas 
Operating profit* from gas production
was down 15% to £864 million due 
to a 37% reduction in gas volumes.
Morecambe production volumes 
were down 51%, partly because 
we switched the field off in response 
to lower gas prices. 
In addition to a £153 million
acquisition of a 4.84% stake in the
Statfjord field, we invested £100 million
on maintaining and developing our
upstream assets. We also spent around
£17 million on gas exploration in the UK. 
We successfully participated in
exploration licensing rounds, and now
have areas in Norway, Egypt, Nigeria
and the UK. We have also entered the
Trinidad licensing round.
Electricity 
We generated 10.5TWh of power from
our 3.4GW fleet of gas-fired power
stations, down on the previous year. 
We started building a £400 million
885MW gas-fired plant at Langage in
Devon, the first power station to be built
in the UK for five years. Commercial
operations are to start during winter
2008/09. In November, we bought 
85% of Coastal Energy Limited, which
is seeking planning permission to build
the UK’s first clean coal-powered plant
to incorporate leading edge carbon
capture technology. It will produce the
lowest carbon emissions of any fossil
fuel plant in the UK. We also acquired
an interest in a company developing 
a carbon sequestration business.
We continued to participate in the 
EU Emissions Trading Scheme and 
are involved in 15% of all EU carbon
allowance trades. 
Renewables
In March, we added to our renewable
power portfolio and produced the 
first green power from our 90MW 
joint venture Barrow offshore 
wind farm. The award of the main
construction contracts for the two
90MW wind farms in the Wash is almost
complete. First power is due in late
2008. We also submitted a planning
application for a 250MW wind farm 
off the Lincolnshire coast. 
Energy procurement
We signed an innovative coal-linked
power purchase agreement with Drax
power station for the supply of 600MW
of baseload power over five years,
starting in October 2007. 
In the final quarter, two key pipeline
projects underpinned by British Gas
contracts started delivery. The pipelines
are capable of supplying 40% of 
UK demand.
The main focus in 2006 was the recovery
of operations after the explosion and 
fire that caused significant damage 
to the main offshore platform of the
Rough storage facility in February.
The restoration project involved
about 500,000 man-hours and was
completed with no health and safety
lost-time incidents. 
The cost of the incident resulted 
in an exceptional cost to the Group 
of £48 million. 
Operating profit* was up 48% to
£228 million. This was mainly from 
a rise of 62% in the average standard
bundled unit price.

Securing future

Rough is ready
Centrica Storage runs the UK’s
largest storage facility at Rough,
holding more than 70% of the 
gas the country keeps in store. 
The business is seeking to expand
Rough’s capacity to meet the
growing need for gas storage 
in the UK.
Piping in investment
British Gas contracts have
underpinned the investment 
by a consortium of Norwegian
companies in the new Langeled
pipeline from Norway to the UK.
We are set to receive about 
a fifth of the gas that comes via
the pipeline through a 10-year 
£6 billion contract with Statoil. 
This investment is another example
of how the Company is securing
long-term gas supplies for its
British Gas customers as well
as answering the UK’s need 
for new gas sources. 
Centrica Energy managed 
the construction of the terminal at
Easington on the Yorkshire coast
which is receiving gas from the
pipeline. Centrica Storage is now
operating the terminal.
The opening of the 745-mile
Langeled pipeline, the world’s
longest subsea pipeline, in October
2006 helped bring an immediate 
fall in wholesale gas prices. An
increased supply of gas into the 
UK is set to bring greater stability 
to prices. Securing our position
internationally
Checklist for a better
customer experience
Our Canadian home services 
team has developed a process
known as the ‘perfect visit’ to give
customers more for their money 
from a service call.
Once, technicians such as
Marcello Natalizio (pictured) just
cleaned furnaces (boilers) and then
serviced them. Now they also give
customers diagnostic information
about the condition and performance
of their energy appliances, using an
eight-point checklist. 
The checks identify likely
component failure so repairs can 
be carried out before a fault occurs.
Benefits include a reduction in
repeat calls of 23%, translating into 
a CAN$1 million (£430,000) saving, a
decrease in workload peaks and an
improvement in customer satisfaction.
The idea was developed with
contributions from customers, who
said they wanted to know more
about the equipment being serviced.
Texas power push
Direct Energy bought the 244MW gas-fired
Paris Energy Center in February 2006 to
secure power supplies for its 950,000
customers in Texas. The purchase, our third
power plant in the state, has strengthened
our upstream portfolio and means we 
can meet 27% of peak demand from 
our own resources. 
Centrica plc Annual Review 2006

Business Review continued Our North American business has
continued its strong growth. Overall,
turnover grew by 15% to £4.1 billion
driven primarily by the continued growth
in business markets and the organic
residential business in Texas. Operating
profit* climbed by 21% to £223 million,
mainly because of higher profits* in 
Texas and the home services business. 
Despite this strong overall growth, 
as part of a continual review of the
efficiency of the business, decisive
action was taken to reduce costs. 
This resulted in 450 job losses, mostly
in Canada and US home services. 
Energy
Our Alberta business moved into 
profit* for the first time, although the
competitive market is growing slowly.
Here the regulated business has
experienced a net customer decline 
of only 8%. We now have around
95,000 competitive customer 
accounts on supply.
Turnover in Texas grew by 18% mainly
because we attracted more customers
outside our incumbent territory. 
In April, we acquired about 100,000
customers from Entergy. We bought 
the Paris power station in February and
completed three wind power purchasing
agreements. Our total contractual wind
power capacity is now 643MW, enabling
us to offer our customers innovative
renewable energy plans.
In the US, we made encouraging
progress in growing customer numbers
by 5%, with a strong performance in the
New York market. The combination of
higher retail prices and more customers
was offset by expenditure on growth and
by lower consumption brought on by
very warm weather at the end of 2006. 
Home services 
Home services performed well with a
33% growth in operating profit*. This
was achieved mainly in Canada through
better margins on heating, ventilation
and air conditioning sales as well as
operational efficiencies. 
Business markets
We continue to invest heavily in the
business sector and have seen significant
growth with volumes sold rising by 11%
in gas and 127% in electricity. 
We entered 12 new utility areas. But
the costs involved contributed to a bigger
operating loss*. However, underlying
gross margins* remain healthy.
Energy wholesale and trading
We widened the remit of our wholesale
and trading business to encompass
buying future capacity in gas
transportation and storage and wind
power contracts. The aim is to utilise
the expert trading team we have in
place to support retail procurement
across the US and Canada.
Community support
Direct Energy continued to support 
the ‘Neighbor-to-Neighbor’ project in
Houston with a US$1 million (£540,000)
contribution. We work in partnership
with 29 community agencies which
distribute funds to vulnerable customers
who are unable to pay for their home
electricity in emergency situations.
Our European businesses performed
well, turning last year’s £9 million
operating loss* into a £7 million profit*.
In Belgium, we integrated all the
businesses that made up SPE and 
we now operate nationally under the
Luminus brand. 
In the Netherlands, we grew our
customer base through our Oxxio
brand and signed a tolling agreement
with Intergen for the output of a
400MW combined cycle gas turbine
power station. 
Our Luseo operation in Spain
continued developing energy
management services to renewables
generators and exploited other energy
management opportunities.
We also created a German subsidiary,
Centrica Energie, based in Dusseldorf,
and are positioned to begin selling
energy to the commercial supply
market in 2007.

stakeholders in the UK and overseas,
so we can more effectively manage 
the social, ethical and environmental
impact of our business activities. The
Group’s business principles set out the
standards of behaviour we expect of 
our employees and our suppliers. 
Here is a summary of our 
corporate responsibility (CR) progress 
during the year. More detail will be
provided in our 2006 Corporate
Responsibility Report, available in May
2007 at www.centrica.com/responsibility.
We have changed our governance
arrangements for CR, establishing a 
main board committee to lead our
strategy. It is chaired by Mary Francis
CBE, Centrica’s Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director. 
Tackling climate change
Addressing climate change presents 
risks and opportunities across our
business. Our aim is to contribute 
to the creation of a sustainable, 
low-carbon future, while ensuring 
the security of energy supplies. 
We have undertaken work to
calculate the carbon footprint of our
operations. Our footprint – emissions
from power generation, gas production
and storage, energy usage, fleet
operations and business travel – was
8.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
(CO
2
) or CO
2 
equivalent* in 2006. 
In addition to our investments in wind
farm developments, we are taking part in
the UK’s first complete clean coal power
generation project, on Teesside, which
will capture and store the CO
2
it produces.
We continued to develop a range 
of energy efficiency services to help
customers reduce their own carbon
emissions. British Gas supplied more
than 13 million energy efficiency
products, with an equivalent carbon
saving of 1 million tonnes, benefiting
more than 6 million households.
Pricing 
To lessen the impact of high prices, 
we created innovative schemes to 
help our most vulnerable customers.
For example, we committed to provide
them with £18.3 million of winter fuel
rebates and introduced the UK’s largest
social energy tariff, which will reduce
bills for 750,000 vulnerable customers.
Health and safety 
The health and safety of our employees,
customers and others who could be
affected by our activities are a top priority
for us. 
Our previously strong safety
performance was marred by two major
incidents during the year. In the first,
two people were injured during a fire
and explosion at our Rough storage
facility. The second was a helicopter
accident in the Morecambe Bay area
which claimed the lives of six people,
four of them long-standing Centrica
employees with a seventh person still
missing, presumed dead.
In neither of these incidents was
there any indication that our own safety
management processes were defective.
However, this highlights the need 
for constant vigilance and a need to
continuously seek safety improvements.
Valuing our people
We recorded a 2% increase in our
overall engagement survey score, 
which measures the attitudes and
opinions of our employees. British 
Gas Business was recognised as the
number one large employer in the UK
by the Financial Times. 
Our fourth annual equal pay 
audit showed that the gender pay 
gap in Centrica continues to narrow
and compares very favourably with
published national norms. 
Diversity and inclusion
We worked closely with the Employers
Forum on Age to prepare for the
introduction of the new UK age
regulations in October. Our British 
Gas Engineering Academy continued 
its work to recruit more women and
people from minority ethnic groups 
into our engineering workforce. 
Investing in communities 
We contributed £7.4 million** 
to community causes through 
a combination of cash, time and 
in-kind support. 
In North America, Direct Energy
employees continued to take part in 
our ‘Dollars for Doers’ programme, 
with paid time off to volunteer. In the
UK, we launched an initiative called
‘Centrica Get Involved’ enabling
employees to take advantage of
volunteering opportunities with 
paid time off from the Company.

Energy saving
Our Energy Savers Report, which
can be accessed online, enables
customers to save money and
reduce their carbon dioxide
emissions. Around 1.5 million
customers have completed 
a report, and have received 
energy and environmental ratings 
as well as advice on a range 
of energy-saving measures. 
Blowing in the wind
Centrica is committed to renewable
energy and has now opened two
wind farms, the most recent being
an offshore wind farm off the coast
of Barrow.
The 90MW wind farm, a joint
venture between Centrica and
Danish energy company DONG,
was opened in September 2006 
and can supply power to around
65,000 homes and help save
200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide
emissions every year.
The Company’s £50 million
investment is part of the £750 million
we plan to spend on renewable
projects in the coming years and 
is a clear indication of how seriously
we view the campaign against
global warming.
Our onshore wind farm, at the
Glens of Foudland in Aberdeenshire,
is generating 80GWh of electricity
per year.
We are also set to develop 
two more offshore wind farms in 
the Greater Wash off the coast of
Lincolnshire and will take a 50%
share in the Braes of Doune
onshore wind farm in Scotland,
which started construction during
the year.

(i) Certain re-measurements included within operating profit comprise re-measurement arising on our energy procurement activities and re-measurement of proprietary trades in
relation to cross-border transportation or capacity contracts. In our business we enter into a portfolio of forward energy contracts which include buying substantial quantities of
commodity to meet the future needs of our customers. A number of these arrangements are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are required to be fair valued
under IAS 39. Fair valuing means that we apply the prevailing forward market prices to these contracts. The Group has shown the fair value adjustments separately as certain 
re-measurements as they are unrealised and non-cash in nature. The profits arising from the physical purchase and sale of commodities during the year, which reflect the prices in
the underlying contracts, are not impacted by these re-measurements. Certain re-measurements included within interest comprise re-measurement of the publicly traded units of
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. All other re-measurement is included within results before exceptional items and certain re-measurements. 
As permitted by IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, certain items are presented separately as exceptional, where they are material to the result for the period and are 
of a non-recurring nature. Items which may be considered material and non-recurring in nature include disposals of businesses, business restructuring and the renegotiation 
of significant contracts and asset write-downs. We intend to follow such a presentation on a consistent basis in future periods. Items are considered material if their omission 
or mis-statement could, in the opinion of the Directors, individually or collectively, affect the true and fair presentation of the Financial Statements. Centrica plc Annual Review 2006

Respective responsibilities of
Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing
the Annual Review and Summary Financial
Statements in accordance with United
Kingdom law. Our responsibility is to report 
to you our opinion on the consistency of 
the Summary Financial Statements within
the Annual Review and Summary Financial
Statements with the full Annual Financial
Statements, the Directors’ Report
(comprising the Directors’ Report – 
Business Review and the Directors’ Report –
Governance) and the Remuneration Report,
and its compliance with the relevant
requirements of section 251 of the United
Kingdom Companies Act 1985 and the
regulations made thereunder. We also 
read the other information contained in 
the Annual Review and Summary Financial
Statements and consider the implications 
for our statement if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Summary Financial
Statements. This statement, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body 
in accordance with section 251 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion,
accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this
statement is shown or into whose hands it
may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our work in accordance with
Bulletin 1999/6, ‘The auditors’ statement on
the summary financial statement’ issued by
the Auditing Practices Board. Our reports
on the Company’s full Annual Financial
Statements describe the basis of our audit
opinions on those Financial Statements and
the Remuneration Report. 
Opinion
In our opinion the Summary Financial
Statements are consistent with the full
Annual Financial Statements, the Directors’
Report (comprising the Directors’ Report –
Business Review and the Directors’ Report
– Governance) and the Remuneration
Report of Centrica plc for the year ended 
31 December 2006 and comply with the
applicable requirements of section 251 
of the Companies Act 1985, and the
regulations made thereunder.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors,
London 22 February 2007
The auditors have issued an unqualified
report on the Annual Financial Statements
and Remuneration Report containing no
statement under section 237 (2) or section
237 (3) of the Companies Act 1985. The
auditors report in respect of consistency
between the Directors’ Report and the Group
Financial Statements is also unqualified.
These Summary Financial Statements are
a summary of the full Centrica Annual Report
and Accounts and the narrative reports
contain information from the Directors’
Report but not the full text of that report.
They do not contain sufficient information to
allow as full an understanding of the results
and state of affairs of the Group and of its
policies and arrangements concerning 
the Directors’ remuneration as would be
provided by the full Report and Accounts. 
The full Report can be downloaded from
our website at www.centrica.com or can be
obtained for 2006 and/or future years, free
of charge, by contacting the Centrica
shareholder helpline (see page 21 for
contact details).
An interim dividend for 2006 of 3.15 pence
per share was paid on 15 November 2006.
The Directors recommend that, subject to
approval at the AGM, a final dividend of 
8 pence per share will be paid on 13 June
2007 to those shareholders registered on 
27 April 2007. This would make a total
ordinary dividend for the year of 11.15 pence
per share (2005: 10.5 pence per share).
The Group is committed to the highest
standards of corporate governance.
Throughout the year, the Company fully
complied with the provisions of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance
(the ‘Code’) save for the early adoption of
the 2006 revision to the Code as explained
in the Summary Remuneration Report on
page 19. A report on how the principles
were applied is set out in the Corporate
Governance Report in the Annual Report
and Accounts and is summarised below.
The Board
An effective Board of Directors leads and
controls the Group. The Board, which met
eight times during the year, has a schedule
of matters reserved for its approval. This
schedule and the terms of reference for 
the Board’s primary committees (Executive,
Audit, Remuneration, Nominations,
Corporate Responsibility and Disclosure
Committees) are available on request and on
our website www.centrica.com. Membership
of these committees is shown on page 15. 
The Board is responsible for:
the development of strategy and 
major policies;
the review of management performance;
the approval of the annual operating
plan, the financial statements and major
acquisitions and disposals;
the system of internal control; and
corporate governance.
One of its meetings each year is substantially
devoted to the development of strategy.
Comprehensive briefing papers, including
financial information, are circulated to each
Director a week prior to Board meetings. 
Board appointments, evaluation 
and training
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent
procedure for the appointment of new
directors to the Board which is described 
in the full Report and Accounts. During 
the year, the Board conducted, with the
assistance of an independent external
facilitator, JCA Group, a formal and rigorous
evaluation of its own performance and that
of its committees and individual Directors. 
The Directors receive ongoing training
including an induction programme tailored
to meet the needs of the individual. 
At Board meetings, the Directors also
receive regular updates on changes and
developments to the business, legislative
and regulatory environments. 
Internal control
The Audit Committee reviews regular
internal control reports, tracks issues,
monitors performance against objectives
and ensures necessary actions are taken 
to remedy any significant failings or
weaknesses identified from those reports.
The Board of Directors, with the advice 
of the Audit Committee, has reviewed the
effectiveness of the internal control system,
as described above, operated throughout
the period from 1 January 2006 to the 
date of this report, and is satisfied that the
Group complies with the Turnbull Guidance
on Internal Control.

Corporate Governance This is a summary of the full Remuneration
Report, which is contained in the Annual
Report and Accounts, copies of which

Composition and role of the
Remuneration Committee
During 2006, the Remuneration Committee
comprised Helen Alexander (Chairman),
Mary Francis, Paul Rayner, Paul Walsh 
and, from 21 February, Andrew Mackenzie.
Patricia Mann was a member of the
Committee until 19 May and, by way of
early adoption of the 2006 revision to the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance
(the ‘Code’), Roger Carr was a member
from 26 July. The Committee met seven
times during 2006. The Remuneration
Committee’s terms of reference are available
at www.centrica.com. 
The Committee makes recommendations
to the Board, within formal terms of reference,
on the policy and framework of executive
remuneration and its cost to the Company.
The Committee is also responsible for the
implementation of remuneration policy and
determining specific remuneration packages
for each of the Executive Directors. 
During the year, Kepler Associates (Kepler)
acted as independent executive remuneration
adviser to the Company and the Committee,
having been formally appointed in 2005. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration
policy and framework
It is the role of the Committee to ensure 
that the Group’s remuneration policy and
framework provides competitive reward 
for its Executive Directors and other senior
executives, taking into account the
Company’s performance, the markets in
which it operates and pay and conditions
elsewhere in the Group.
In constructing the remuneration
packages, the Committee aims to achieve
an appropriate balance between fixed and
variable compensation for each executive.
Accordingly, a significant proportion of the
remuneration package depends on the
attainment of demanding performance
objectives, both short- and long-term. 
The annual bonus scheme is designed 
to incentivise and reward the achievement
of demanding financial and business related
objectives. Long-term share-based
incentives are designed to align the interests
of Executive Directors and other senior
executives with the longer-term interests of
shareholders by rewarding them for delivering
sustained increased shareholder value. 
In agreeing the level of base salaries 
and the performance-related elements 
of the remuneration package, the
Committee considers the potential
maximum remuneration that executives
could receive. The Committee reviews the
packages and varies individual elements
when appropriate from year to year.
The Committee, assisted by Kepler 
and internal resource, conducted a
thorough review of the Group’s executive
incentive arrangements in late 2005 and
early 2006. 
The purpose of this review was to ensure
that the incentive arrangements: provided 
a strong alignment with the delivery of value 
to shareholders; reflected current best
practice, while meeting the Group’s
particular business needs; and would enable
the Group to continue to attract, retain and
motivate high-calibre management in a
highly-challenging business environment.
Following this review, the Committee
proposed changes to the future policy and
framework of executive remuneration
arrangements in line with the above objectives
and these were endorsed by shareholders
upon the approval of new share-based
incentive schemes at the 2006 AGM. 
In 2006, executive remuneration
comprised base salary, annual performance
bonus, an allocation of shares under the
new Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS),
which was approved at the 2006 AGM and,
as part of the transitional arrangements to
the new policy, a grant of options in April
under the Executive Share Option Scheme
(ESOS). In 2007, executive remuneration 
will comprise the above, but participation 
in the new Deferred and Matching Share
Scheme (DMSS), based on the annual
performance bonus in respect of 2006, 
will replace the ESOS.
No further ESOS grants will be made on
a regular basis, although the Committee will
retain the discretion to make grants under
the ESOS in the future if there are
exceptional circumstances in which it
considers it appropriate to do so.
As a result of the changes under the 
new policy, the Committee expects that
total remuneration for median performance
will remain unchanged, but that total
remuneration for upper quartile performance
will be increased in line with market practice.
As a matter of policy, the notice periods
of the Executive Directors’ service contracts
do not exceed one year. The Committee
exercised its discretion in respect of the
appointment of Sam Laidlaw, whose service
contract allows for an initial period of two
years. This notice period will reduce to one
year in July 2008.
The Committee believes that these
arrangements are important in providing 
a potential remuneration package that will
attract, retain and continue to motivate
Executive Directors and other senior
executives in a marketplace that is
challenging and competitive in both
commercial and human resource terms. 
It is intended that this remuneration policy
and framework, which is fully endorsed 
by the Board, will continue for 2007 and
succeeding years.
Components of remuneration
For 2006, the maximum annual
performance bonus payable to the
Executive Directors should every single
element of every objective be achieved in 
full was 125% of base salary. The current
objectives comprise financial performance
targets (64%) and business-related targets
(36%). A bonus will be forfeited if the
Committee considers overall performance 
to have been unsatisfactory.
In April 2006, options were granted to
Executive Directors equal to 200% of base
salary and, at the same or lower rates, to
certain other senior executives.
The performance conditions for the
ESOS are based on the extent to which
growth in the Company’s adjusted earnings
per share (EPS growth) exceeds growth 
in the Retail Prices Index (RPI growth) over 
a three-year performance period.
In 2006, LTIS allocations equal 
to 150% of base salary were awarded 
to Executive Directors and, at lower 
rates to certain other senior executives. 
The release of allocations will be subject 
to performance conditions over a 
three-year period: 
half the shares in each allocation are
subject to a performance condition
based on the Company’s EPS growth
relative to RPI. To vest in full, EPS 
growth must exceed RPI growth by 
30 percentage points or more over 
the performance period. No part of 
the award will vest if EPS growth fails 
to exceed RPI growth by at least 
9 percentage points over the performance
period. The proportion of the award that
will vest will increase on a straight-line
basis between 25% and 100% if EPS
growth exceeds RPI growth by between
9 and 30 percentage points over the
performance period; and
the other half of the shares in each
allocation are subject to a performance
condition based on the Company’s Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance
relative to the other 99 companies in 
the FTSE 100 on the date of award with
vesting reducing on a straight-line basis
from 100% for upper quintile ranking to
25% for median ranking performance.
Centrica plc Annual Review 2006

Summary 
Remuneration Report The Committee has determined that, for that
part of the LTIS subject to the comparative
TSR performance conditions, the most
appropriate comparator group for the
Company is the companies comprising 
the FTSE 100 at the start of the relevant
performance period. 
The initial award under the Deferred and
Matching Share Scheme will be made in
2007 based on the 2006 annual bonus. 20%
of the annual bonus payable to Executive
Directors and other senior executives will be
deferred automatically for a period of three
years and invested in Centrica shares
(deferred shares), during which time they
cannot normally be withdrawn. Participants
may elect to invest an additional amount in
Centrica shares (investment shares) to be
funded from actual bonus payable or the
release of LTIS shares only which, when
added to the value of the deferred shares,
will bring the total amount invested up to
50% of the individual’s maximum bonus
entitlement in respect of the preceding year.
Deferred and investment shares will be
matched with conditional shares (matching
shares), which will be released upon the
achievement, over a three-year period, of
demanding three-year cumulative group
economic profit performance targets.
The following graph compares the
Company’s TSR performance with that 
of the FTSE 100 Index for the five years
ended 31 December 2006. 
Other employment benefits
In common with other senior management,
Executive Directors are entitled to a 
range of benefits, including a company car,
life assurance, private medical insurance
and a financial counselling scheme. 
The Centrica Management Pension
Scheme (a contributory final salary
arrangement) was closed to new employees
on 30 June 2003. Executive Directors 
in office prior to this date participated 
in that scheme during 2006. Alternative
arrangements are made for new employees,
including Executive Directors, after that date.
The Executive Directors are also eligible,
on the same basis as other employees, 
to participate in the Company’s 
HMRC-approved Sharesave and Share 
Incentive Plan.

Electronic communications
Recent changes in legislation mean
that, subject to the necessary authority
being passed at the forthcoming AGM,
Centrica is now able to offer shareholders
the opportunity to receive shareholder
documentation via its website. 
These changes, introduced by the
Government, recognise the increasing
role that the internet plays in timely
communications.
You may now choose either to:
receive shareholder documentation
by website communication by
providing us with an email address
(to do this, please go on line to
www.centrica.com/ecomms ); or,
continue to receive shareholder
documentation in hard copy (to do
this, please complete and return
the personalised prepaid form of
election attached to the enclosed
AGM proxy card so that it is
received no later than 30 June
2007). If you do not return the form
you will be taken, subject to the
necessary authority being passed
at the AGM, to have agreed to
receive shareholder documentation
via the website. 
Shareholders who receive shareholder
documentation from Centrica
electronically can in future: 
view the Annual Report on the 
day it is published;
have access to significantly 
greater volumes of information
about Centrica;
cast their AGM vote electronically; 
access details of their individual
shareholding quickly and securely. 
This new legislation provides
shareholders, with the opportunity to
access information in a timely manner
and helps your Company to reduce
both its costs and its impact on 
the environment.

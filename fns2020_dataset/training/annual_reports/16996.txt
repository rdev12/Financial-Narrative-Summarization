THE COMPANY IS A LEADING
INDEPENDENT DESIGNER,
MANUFACTURER AND INSTALLER
OF HIGH QUALITY BESPOKE
FLEXIBLE PIPELINE PRODUCTS,
SYSTEMS AND SOLUTIONS FOR
OIL AND GAS TRANSPORTATION.
Our pipeline portfolio includes established
product lines such as dynamic flexible
risers and static flowlines, for deep and
ultra-deepwater environments, and high
temperature/high pressure products
for drilling applications. With over 850
employees, Wellstream has offices and
facilities in the UK, Brazil, USA and
Australia. Further information regarding
Wellstream and its products and
services can be accessed at
www.wellstream.com.
The business, founded in 1983, sets out
to pursue its strategic aim of providing
innovative technologies and services
that facilitate cost effective, reliable
hydrocarbon production within the
Water Column.
Wellstream has been working in partnership
with the oil and gas industry for well over
two decades to develop flexible flowline and
riser solutions. In that time the Company
has responded to rapidly changing industry
trends by constantly expanding its product
portfolio and service offering.
The offshore marine environment provides
an exceptionally harsh operating
environment, even in the most benign of sea
conditions. Although offshore installations
were first used as far back as 1946 in the
Gulf of Mexico, it was the advent of floating
production systems from the mid-1970s
which enabled the development of remote
subsea reservoirs that has driven the
subsea industry to where it is today.
Flexible riser technology was a key enabler
for these floating production systems,
which now operate in water depths in
excess of 2,000m and have a capacity
to store 2 million barrels of oil in locations
many hundreds of kilometres from the
nearest coastline. Flexible pipe is
manufactured with unbonded concentric
layers of metallic wires, tapes and extruded
polymers that form a structure which can
withstand not only the constantly changing
forces of a marine specific environment but
also the characteristics of the transported
fluids, which are often highly corrosive
and at high temperatures and pressures.
The stresses imposed on a flexible riser
vary considerably relative to the distance
from the surface or seabed. Wellstream’s
design engineers ensure every flexible
riser is capable of meeting a service life
in excess of 20 years and that it will
additionally withstand extreme wave events
that may occur during its operational life.
In the 10 years since Wellstream became
the first flexible pipe supplier to qualify
flexible pipe structures for operation in
2,000m water depth (WD), we have
continued to push the boundaries of
flexible pipe technology to meet the
challenges of subsea production.
Current challenges faced include the
development of structures that can resist
the high pressure characteristics of
deepwater developments in the Gulf of
Mexico and the qualification of polymers
and steels to resist the highly corrosive
production fluids present in the giant
Pre-Salt discoveries offshore Brazil.

ANADARKO CAESAR TONGA –
HIGH PRESSURE
Awarded to Wellstream in August 2008,
the contract from Anadarko for the
supply of two 2,300m 15,000psi risers
represented a major technical and
manufacturing challenge; more typical
risers are designed to operate in 1,500m
WD with 6,000psi pressures. The
qualification programme for this contract
required new materials and designs to
meet the operating requirements. The
resulting structure is one of the most
complex ever produced by Wellstream
and the industry.
Since the first samples of the qualification
pipe were produced in late 2008,
excellent results have been achieved
enabling manufacture to commence for
delivery in early 2010. Two successful
burst tests have achieved pressures in
excess of 33,000psi. Dynamic bending
and tension fatigue tests have been
completed, simulating over 125 years
service. These tests will continue to
destruction – equivalent to over 1,000
years’ service.

BRAZIL PRE–SALT: TUPI
PROJECT ILLUSTRATION
AND NEW WELLSTREAM
RECORD
In 2009, first commercial production
began of the giant Pre-Salt discoveries in
2,000m to 2,500m water depths and up
to 300km offshore Brazil in the Santos
Basin. Although it is too early accurately
to estimate the potential of this cluster of
discoveries, industry analysts have
provisionally estimated that there could
be over 30 billion barrels of recoverable
reserves in the area requiring more than
40 FPSO (Floating Production Storage
and Offloading) vessels.
Wellstream has played a major role in
the development of the first commercial
project, the 6.5bn barrel TUPI field, having
been awarded the entire flexible pipe scope
for the TUPI Extended Well Test (EWT).
This comprised technically challenging
4 inch gas lift and 6 inch production
risers and flowlines. Wellstream’s flexible
pipes have now been supplied and
installed and are currently operating at
2,140m water depth, establishing a new
record for Wellstream’s flexible pipes.
These high technology flexible pipes
have proven to be an effective solution
for the Pre-Salt development.
As a result, Wellstream has been
awarded a number of key contracts to
supply flexible products for further phases
of the TUPI project – the first major
development in the Pre-Salt.
Flexible pipelines have many advantages
over the traditional alternative steel rigid
pipe. These include the ability to provide:
superior fatigue resistance which means
they are often the only technical solution
for connecting floating production
vessels to wells on the seabed in highly
dynamic marine environments
cost effective installation solutions
through reduced installation times and
utilisation of a wide range of offshore
installation vessels
staged development, allowing
customers to utilise early production
technologies which generate early cash
flows and reduce development risk
reductions in project execution risk
through parallel execution of major
elements of the project including drilling,
construction of the production facility
and installation of the subsea facilities
reduced costs for future developments
through re-use of existing flexible
pipelines
development of technically challenging
fields where production fluids are highly
corrosive, at extreme temperature or
pressure or where significant insulation
is required to ensure the temperature
of the production fluid is maintained
subsea tie backs where the seabed is
uneven, space is restricted or the field
layout is complex.
As water depths increase and reservoirs
become more technically challenging,
flexible pipe becomes mission critical.
From 2007 to 2009, Wellstream
produced approximately 40% of the
world’s flexible pipeline products.
Customers include major oil & gas
companies such as Petrobras, BP ,
Chevron, ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton;
Independent Oil Companies such as
Apache, Anadarko Petroleum, Devon
Energy and Addax Petroleum; as well
as oilfield services companies such as
Subsea 7 and Saipem.
Wellstream’s success is based on strong
technology supported by continuous
research and development, industry
leading engineering and manufacturing
processes and a focus on working
collaboratively with customers and
partners. 06/07

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT
AGAINST DIFFICULT TRADING
CONDITIONS, THE GROUP
HAS MAINTAINED A STRONG
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE,
WITH REVENUE GROWTH, LOWER
NET DEBT AND EARNINGS IN
LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS.
The rapid fall in oil prices at the end of
2008, and the on-going financial crisis
in the first half of 2009, significantly
interrupted the investment phase and
pace of offshore developments outside
Brazil. However, a recovery during the
second half of 2009 has left current oil
prices substantially above the level
required to ensure offshore developments
are economic. This, and returning
customer confidence as the global
economy recovers, leaves the Board
more optimistic regarding the outlook
for the business.
As a manufacturer of specialist products,
the Group is uniquely positioned to
benefit from long term growth within a
critical sector of the oil and gas industry.
During the year we completed the
expansion of our production capacity,
extended our product qualification
envelope and improved the operational
efficiency of the Group. This will enable
us to capitalise on the significant growth
opportunities that are clearly available.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group achieved record revenues in
the 12 months to 31 December 2009 of
£400.7m (2008: £369.9m). Profitability
was below that achieved in a record
2008, nevertheless, the Group generated
diluted earnings per share of 34.2p
(2008: 52.3p); the second highest result
the Group has ever achieved. Operating
activities generated strong cash flow
of £39.7m (2008: £36.3m). We propose
to maintain our full year dividend at
10p (2008: 10p).
OPERATIONS
Throughout the year, Wellstream’s business
in Brazil has performed exceptionally well
and the production facility has run close
to full capacity. Our Brazilian team has
secured a number of key contracts to
supply flexible products for the initial
phases of the TUPI project – the first
major Pre-Salt development. In June we
also commenced a major programme
that will see us qualify a broad range of
Wellstream products for use in deepwater
Pre-Salt developments. This positions
the Group well for what is a significant
market opportunity.
Outside of Brazil, trading conditions have
been more challenging during 2009.
The financial crisis in 2008 resulted in
customers postponing final investment
decisions and in response to this market
weakness we undertook a Group-wide
cost reduction programme.
STRONG OPERATIONAL
PERFORMANCE, WITH
REVENUE GROWTH,
LOWER NET DEBT,
AND EARNINGS IN LINE
WITH EXPECTATIONS. 08/09
CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
Notwithstanding the difficult market,
the Group has moved forward on a
number of fronts and 2009 has seen
some significant achievements for the
business including;
Successful delivery of the TUPI
Extended Well Test (EWT) project
for Petrobras
On-going awards under the four year
Framework Agreement with Petrobras
which total some £200 million
Securing additional leased land
adjacent to our Niterói facility
Manufacture of the first high pressure
(15,000psi) risers for Anadarko
Petroleum’s Caesar Tonga project
in the Gulf of Mexico
Successful divestment of our onshore
FlexSteel
TM
business
Substantial completion of our first
major installation project through
the Seastream Joint Venture.
Further, 2009 has seen the Group
achieve its best ever safety performance
with a Lost Time Incident (LTI) free
year in Newcastle and a record safety
performance in Niterói. This is a fantastic
achievement and the result of a long-
standing and continuing focus on
delivering the highest safety standards
across the entire business.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
During the year we appointed two
directors to the Board, Luis Araujo
and Alasdair MacDonald. Both bring
significant sector experience and abilities
and I look forward to working closely
with them.
Gordon Chapman, our CEO was
unfortunately taken ill and is recuperating
at home. The Board and staff wish him
well for a speedy recovery. Alasdair
MacDonald was appointed as Acting
CEO in his absence and I thank him
for his contribution.
OUTLOOK
The Group has successfully addressed
a number of challenges in 2009 which
positions us well to benefit from an upturn
in the oil and gas industry as a whole,
and the subsea sector in particular.
The flexible pipeline market has seen
compound growth rates of 7%-10%
(a)
per annum and the drivers for this growth
are still very much intact. The outlook for
the sector remains positive despite short
term uncertainty outside Brazil and our
focus on developing critical technology
and integrated solutions will allow us to
further benefit from this.
Looking forward, the potential for
significant growth in Brazil is clear and
evidence of an improvement in market
activity elsewhere supports some
optimism, although the Board’s near
term outlook remains unchanged.
Finally, I pay tribute to the professionalism
of our staff whose hard work and
dedication have delivered this strong
operational performance.

We look forward with optimism as the
oil and gas industry continues to explore
ever deeper and more remote oil and gas
fields where the production facilities are
dependent upon flexible pipe. The Group
has performed very well in a buoyant
Brazilian market and exceeded its
operational targets. The long term future
is bright and the restructuring steps taken
during the year will maintain the Group’s
ability and skills to take advantage of the
long term growth within our sector.
SERVICE
“We commit, we deliver, no excuses”
is our mantra. We have a long tradition
of excellent customer service and
responsiveness which is one of our
key differentiators over our competitors.
We are very proud of our quality record
where our design specifications and
attention to detail have resulted in an
excellent record of delivering flexible
pipe that has performed beyond
customer expectations. This is a tribute
to our organisation and to our people
who continue to demonstrate a
dedication to meeting customer needs
and I record my thanks to them.

MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS
DURING THE YEAR
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS DURING
THE YEAR INCLUDE SECURING
ADDITIONAL LEASED LAND
ADJACENT TO THE NITERÓI
PLANT OF APPROXIMATELY
55,000M
2
.
This gives us the capacity to further
expand the Brazil factory as the market
dictates and to offer logistics support and
other services. The site is particularly well
located in relation to the new Pre-Salt
TUPI discovery and we are pleased to
have secured the flexibility that this facility
offers. This will also place us in a stronger
position to access the wider South
Atlantic basin including the target
market of West Africa.
Earlier in the year we increased capacity
in the Niterói facility by 80% to 270nKms
pa, which together with an increase of
15% in Newcastle to 300nKms pa,
gives a total capacity Group wide of
570nKms pa. Total throughput for the
plants increased by 19% to 436nKms
in 2009 (2008: 367nKms).
We were awarded the contract to supply
flowlines and risers for the TUPI Pre-Salt
Extended Well Test (EWT) project.
Subsequently we were pleased to be
awarded the contract to supply flexible
pipelines for further phases of the project.
This, along with the Caesar Tonga
contract for 15,000psi high pressure
risers, demonstrates our customers’
confidence in Wellstream’s cutting edge
technology expertise.
We divested our FlexSteel onshore
business for £19.6m in September to
Prime Natural Resources Inc. This has
enabled us to concentrate more fully
on our core offshore business.
During the year we also undertook a cost
restructuring exercise to position the
Group for the downturn. During this
process we have been careful to retain
the knowledge and skills critical to
remaining a world class manufacturer
and to be able to rapidly respond to a
recovery in the market.
We substantially completed our first major
installation contract offshore North
Western Australia under the Seastream
joint venture. A total of 54Kms of flexible
pipe product was installed using
Wellstream equipment. The completion
of this project represents a significant
milestone for the business and the
experience gained allows us to look
forward with confidence to delivery
of future installation projects. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

OFFSHORE MARKET OVERVIEW
AND FUTURE TRENDS
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE
FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE
DRAMATIC FALL IN OIL PRICES
AT THE END OF 2008 WERE FELT
THROUGHOUT THE OIL AND
GAS INDUSTRY DURING 2009.
These two factors combined to cause
delays in project awards throughout the
year. However, a recovery in the second
half of 2009 has seen oil prices stabilise
around $60/bbl to $70/bbl. Long term,
the fundamentals of the sector in which
Wellstream operates remain very positive,
and current oil prices are substantially
above the level required to ensure floating
production projects are economic and
this should set the stage for a recovery.
Despite the slow down in contract
awards, the number of FPSO projects in
the bidding phase has remained constant
and the number of FPSOs being planned
has increased from last year. Between
2009 and 2013, expenditure on FPSO
systems is expected to increase by
40% from $4.4bn to $6.2bn
(c)
.
Oil and gas remains the world’s dominant
energy source, and accessible resources
onshore and in shallow water areas
offshore are diminishing. Oil companies
are therefore continuing to focus on
exploring and developing offshore in
deepwater utilising subsea and floating
production technologies. Flexible
pipelines are a critical element of
the majority of these developments;
connecting the wellheads to the surface
via flexible flowlines and risers. Thus,
the increased use of these facilities in
combination with subsea completions
has been one of the drivers for rapid
growth in Wellstream’s business.
National Oil Companies, and in particular
Petrobras, continued to invest significantly
during 2009 in order to sustain their long
term growth plans. Petrobras has stated
that they require 4,000Km of flexible
pipe products between 2009 and 2013;
primarily to develop their recent Pre-Salt
discoveries. This demand, combined
with increasing activity levels driven by
other International and Independent
Oil companies in Brazil, will underpin
production in our Brazilian facility
going forward.
Elsewhere, long term demand growth
is evident in both Asia and West Africa
and this potential is further supplemented
by the recent increase in interest around
FLNG (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas)
developments; all of which will require
significant volumes of flexible pipeline
products.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
The market for flexible pipelines and
risers is a subset of a larger “deepwater
pipeline” market which includes alternative
rigid pipeline solutions. These compete
with flexible solutions and converting
these developments into projects that
utilise flexible pipeline products provides
the potential for growth. Conversion of
these projects has the potential to grow
the market by over 50%. Enabling this
growth and increasing the adoption rate
of flexible pipeline technology is central
to Wellstream’s strategy.
In addition to project development driven
demand, 2009 has seen an increase in
the number of enquires regarding integrity
management for either ageing installed
infrastructure, or complex new
developments. This therefore, is seen
as an emerging market segment which
presents Wellstream with significant
opportunities for further growth.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
16/17
THE 2008 ANNUAL REPORT
HIGHLIGHTED THE 1,034BAR
(15,000PSI) PRESSURE RATING
PROGRAMME UNDERTAKEN WITH
ANADARKO PETROLEUM AND
DESCRIBED SOME OF THE WORK
THAT WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN. 
As with all developments that significantly
enhance the performance envelope, it has
successfully employed cross-functional
teams, utilising specialists from R&D,
engineering, analysis, materials, testing
and manufacturing. This has ensured that
we have met the stringent industry safety
standards and also the performance
criteria for the high pressure market.
The programme through 2009 has
continued to produce results which
showcase the capability of the proposed
high pressure riser design. Static tests,
including burst, tension and hydrostatic
collapse results, continue to prove how
our design methodologies predict
product performance. For the hydrostatic
collapse, there was the added benefit
that the results demonstrated capability
beyond 3,000m, far exceeding current
market requirements. 
Moving into 2010, the dynamic fatigue
tests continue to progress well and the
milestones for in-service lifetime have
already been met, and the programmes
now continue as validation data for our
in-house software that is used to predict
service life. 
Building on the success of the 
TUPI EWT, we are participating in the
TUPI qualification programme, which
encompasses gas lift, water injection, gas
injection and production structures, and 
is planned to be concluded in 2010. This
programme is enhancing our database for
materials exposed to super-critical carbon
dioxide and for full product tests at the
extremes of the Pre-Salt design envelope.
Our commitment to the Pre-Salt began
ahead of the main TUPI qualification
contract, resulting in significant progress
on our materials tests with more than
3,000 samples. This programme is
therefore already supplying valuable 
data to our design teams to meet the
challenges on the Pre-Salt. Likewise, 
the full-scale tests are already underway
with an extensive programme of almost
100 tests for the TUPI structures and
again, some structures are presenting
successful results far exceeding the 
field requirements of 2,500m. 
We will continue to build our local R&D
capability in Brazil where we will focus on
the demands of the deepwater Pre-Salt
but also to enhance our global provision.
We are developing our relationship with
the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro -
COPPE, where a number of research

BRAZIL
During the year 36 projects were worked
on for Petrobras ranging in value from
£0.3million up to £55million. Most notable
were the Cachalote, Petrobras P51,
Marlim Leste Module 2 and Barracuda
Caratinga projects. Also completed
during the year was the Peregrino project
for Statoil’s South Atlantic Holdings.
REST OF THE WORLD
A diverse range of projects were
undertaken, generally smaller in scale
than in Brazil. Projects were undertaken
for Maersk, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil,
Chevron, Anadarko Petroleum, BHP
Billiton, Total, BP , Statoil, Mariner Energy,
Halliburton, CNR and PetroSA. 
INSTALLATION
Seastream largely completed the base
scope of its first major project in North
Western Australia. Seastream performed
the offshore works over a nine month
period utilising the new build Sea Trucks’
construction vessel “Jascon 25”. 
SUPPL Y CHAIN
During 2009 the supply chain risks arising
from the global economic recession were
successfully managed. We experienced
some disruption in the first half due to a
one-off material processing challenge.
While this impacted the business in H1
we were able to mitigate its effects and
supplies for the remainder of the year
were unaffected.
Increased localisation of supplies into
Brazil was a key feature of the year. This
helped to offset the risks arising from the
global recession by reducing logistics
costs and lead times and the widening 
of the pool of available suppliers.
Renewal of key long term agreements 
will provide for continuity of competitive
supply and the development of new
products to support the Group’s product
development objectives. To achieve
economies of scale the key raw materials
of carbon steels, stainless steels and
polymers continue to be sourced 
globally with local supply prioritised 
where applicable.
The Group continues to reinforce ethical
trading within the supply chain working
closely with the QHSE function to monitor
key competencies in this field. We
conduct regular visits to suppliers to
monitor their performance, facilities 
and systems including environmental
management systems.
The supply chain is an integral part of 
the Group’s corporate risk monitoring
process to ensure that all potential risks
and sustainability are fully assessed and
managed.

KEY PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS (KPIs)
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
WELLSTREAM IMPLEMENTS A
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE
BUSINESS.
At the start of every year the critical
success factors are reviewed and key
performance indicators are set. As 
the business environment changes so
may the critical success factors and
associated KPIs. The Board monitors
these KPI targets and assesses
performance against these targets
throughout the year. These KPIs are
cascaded throughout the business and
more detailed KPIs are also created that
align with geographical centres and
business functions. 
KPI targets exist throughout the business.
Their significance changes as the
business develops. Increased focus 
on cash as a whole has been reflected in
a change to the key supply chain metric.
(1) EBITDA defined as operating profit before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation is a measure 
of profitability within the business.
(2) Offshore margin measures the profit generated 
on offshore projects in the year. It is calculated by
deducting materials, transportation and other project
costs from revenue on a contract by contract basis.
(3) Working capital measured as a percentage of 
trailing revenue (Last 12 months of rolling revenue) 
is a measure of cash used within the supply chain 
as a whole.
(4) Throughput is measured in normalised kilometres
(nKms) as a measure of capacity utilisation. 
(5) The KPI for technology reflects return on research 
effort. The target is six times return. The measure is 
new 2009 work revenues or cost savings arising from
development work in the period 2004-2008 divided 
by 2009 projected internal/external non-staff spend.
(6) Offshore orders are the value of future revenue added to
backlog on receipt of a customer order. It is a measure
of the rate at which we win new business.
(7) The QHSE measure is a leading indicator, “Percent
Safe”. It is based on audits that are carried out over 
200 days in the year which specifically measure
adherence to job risk evaluation.

COMMITTEE AND BOARD.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible
for risk management within the Group.
The Audit Committee reviews the risk
management process and reports its
findings to the Board. 
Risk mapping is used which includes an
assessment of operational, financial,
strategic, compliance and environmental
risks and mitigating actions. Key risks
highlighted at the 2009 year-end include:
PETROBRAS IS A KEY
CUSTOMER OF WELLSTREAM
Petrobras commanded over 59% of
Wellstream’s business in 2009 and we
continue to focus on diversifying our
client base.
SUPPL Y CHAIN 
Wellstream’s supply chain is critical to the
operation and for certain material types
there are sole source vendors for which
the risk is elevated. Through 2009 we
have worked closely with the suppliers
and have maintained good levels of quality
and delivery after some initial disruption
and attendant materials processing issues
experienced in the first quarter. There
have been no major interruptions to the
supply base during the remainder of the
year. The establishment of effective long
term vendor framework agreements
remains an integral part of the supply
chain strategy.
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION
Wellstream’s business is founded on a
relatively small number of high value
customers including Petrobras. If
requested project lead times from these
customers change significantly, revenue
and margin performance could be put at
risk. In order to mitigate this, Wellstream
continues to broaden its customer base,
develop new relationships in selected
regions and apply the principle of
focussed account management to its
strategically targeted customer base.
RISK AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW: 24/25
VOLATILITY OF THE 
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY
The price of oil and gas and levels of
business confidence across oil and gas
markets are key drivers for Wellstream’s
business. The trends towards the use 
of deepwater, floating production and
subsea technologies are also important.
A sustained and significant reduction in 
oil and gas prices and/or a reduction 
in business confidence or continued
volatility as seen over recent months
could have an adverse impact on the
level of customer spending. To mitigate
this exposure Wellstream strives to
maintain in-depth market intelligence, 
to gather and use client feedback and
to plan capacity, throughput and its
cost base so that any downturn can
be weathered effectively.
MARGIN PRESSURE AND
COMPETITION RISK
The current downturn has inevitably 
put pressure on margin as we react to
industry drivers to cut cost and remain
competitive. These pressures are likely 
to persist. By aggressively challenging 
our cost base we have retained our
competitiveness. We are beginning 
to see some signs of the pressures
easing with increasing FPSO deliveries.
Reduced backlog worldwide has led to
increased competitive pressure and
competitor expansion may increase 
these pressures further however 
barriers to entry remain high.
INSTALLATION
Where it is a customer preference, 
we can offer flexible pipe on an installed
basis utilising EPCI (Engineering,
Procurement, Construction, and
Installation) style contracting, managing
all the services necessary to install flexible
pipe and other water column ancillaries.
Risks of offering our flexible pipe on an
installed basis can differ from those
associated with flexible pipe supply; in
particular possible project delays, broader
competition impacting project margin and
potential execution risk. We manage this
by closely monitoring project execution
and by negotiating appropriate
contractual terms. 
Treasury and financial risk are described
in the Financial Review.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
(CSR) We have also continued to prioritise our
links with education supporting a number
of programmes for all ages. 
Knowledge Transfer Partnership with
Newcastle University – 2 year
sponsored post-doctoral programme
MSc in Subsea Engineering &
Management at Newcastle University,
in which Wellstream engineers will
participate in delivering the course
material
foundation course degree in Subsea
Engineering at Newcastle college
an apprenticeship scheme at our
manufacturing facility in Newcastle,
combining work place learning and full
and part time study at local Newcastle
colleges for nine young employees, and
we continue to be actively involved 
in Young Enterprise North East,
sponsoring their annual awards in 
2009 and in 2010 look to continue 
this support and increase the
involvement of Wellstream employees
in programmes that inspire success of
youngsters at school through contact
with business. 
We have been involved with PetroSA as
part of its Corporate Social Investment
policy which in 2009 saw Wellstream
send 30 computers to South Africa to be
used to establish a computer laboratory
at Sipho Hashe combined school located
at Kwa-Zakheke in Port Elizabeth and
agreement for the secondment of three
graduate engineers from PetroSA to
Wellstream for a three month training
programme in the design and
manufacture of flexible pipe.
BRAZIL
In 2009 our Brazilian facility has
continued support to the local Ilha da
Conceição Association’s work and again
sponsored the annual 10º 5km Ilha da
Conceição running and walking race 
in Niterói.
Additional support has been provided to
“at community” based projects. Under
Law Rouanet, which allows for a tax
exemption on donations or sponsorships
of cultural projects, our Brazil facility has
supported the Fight for Peace (Luta Pela
Paz) institution which works to overcome
division and violence and promote the
potential of young people through boxing,
martial arts, education programmes and
youth support services, and Wellstream’s
Community Choir – “Os Flexíveis”.
USA
Staff in the USA support a number 
of charities, in particular United Way
which supports local hospices and
Scouts’ clubs.
AUSTRALIA
As part of Seastream’s first offshore
installation project, safety was
incentivised by a charity donation
programme. To date a number of
organisations have received donations,
including Motor Neurone Disease, 
Cancer Council and Beyondblue
Depression Research, as a result 
of good safety performance from
Seastream.

CULTURE
Wellstream believes that significant
competitive advantage can be derived
from our people in terms of their know-
how, experience and how they go about
their work. We strive to create a culture of
enabling people to perform and operate
to the best of their ability, and in providing
the right structure, processes and
support for them to do their job. 
VALUES & OPPORTUNITY 
Wellstream has a flat style organisation
which makes us more responsive to
customers’ needs and business
opportunities. A key strength is our ability
to build partnerships with customers,
suppliers, employees and with the local
communities in which we operate.
Wellstream’s core values underpin the
way we work with these stakeholders. 
POLICY AND PRACTICE 
Wellstream has a range of established
employment polices and practices
applying local variation where necessary
including a strong emphasis on health
and safety policies. Policies are agreed
with trade union representatives, in 
both Brazil and the UK, where formal
negotiation frameworks exist. Overall
accountability for employment policies
lies with our Acting Chief Executive
Officer who reports on employment
issues to the Board. 
EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY
The Group commits to policies against
discrimination on the grounds of gender,
race, ethnicity, disability, age, nationality,
sexuality, religion or belief, or marital
status. In doing so, we strive to create
an equality culture where all our people
are treated fairly and equally.
TALENT DEVELOPMENT
In 2009 we continued to place emphasis
on building capability throughout the
business to ensure that employees are
fully equipped to do their job and to
provide the future talent pool for 
the Group. 
Graduates – we continued to invest 
in graduate recruitment in 2009. 
To supplement our technology and
engineering graduate intake of the
previous two years, this year we
targeted commercial graduates in 
our sales, procurement and finance
functions. 
Interns – our Brazil facility supported
some 25 internship students in 2009,
across the full range of workplace
disciplines. Interns are university
students who combine academic 
study with workplace training and, in
Wellstream, carry out specific jobs
rather than work shadow.
Apprentices – in the UK, we increased
our intake of young apprentices 
during the year, with nine joining our
manufacturing facility in April 2009 in
both engineering and operations roles.
As part of their four year programme,
apprentices combine practical on the
job training with day release at college.
The Group sponsored 17 degree
programmes in 2009 relevant to the
subsea industry.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT
AND TRAINING 
During 2009, we developed a
competency framework for our
Manufacturing, Technology and Projects
and Engineering functions. In support 
of our Continuous Improvement and lean
manufacturing philosophy, this framework
will enable manufacturing operators to
become fully competent at all stages 
of the production line.
All of our UK managers completed a five
day IOSH training course during 2009 to
equip them with a deeper understanding
of their team safety management
responsibility. 75% of our manufacturing
operators and lead operators have
undertaken accredited business
improvement training, qualifying them 
in NVQ and BTEC. 
In Brazil, we exceeded performance
measures set by the Brazil Association 
for Training, with 92% of our employees
having participated in training and
development during 2009, averaging 
60 hours per employee. This compares
favourably with Brazilian labour averages
when compared with data from the
Brazilian Association for Training and
Development.
UNIVERSITY LINKS
Collaboration with Newcastle University
and local industry resulted in the
development of an MSc in Subsea
Engineering and Management which 
was launched in October 2009 together 
with a subsea college foundation degree,
broadening and strengthening the profile
of subsea engineering in the North East
of England.
INVESTORS IN PEOPLE
RETENTION AND HEADCOUNT
Our investment in training and
development is recognised by retaining
our Investors in People standard for the
11th consecutive year. This confirms the
strength and quality of our training and
development provision, leadership,
performance management and
communication within the Company.
Delivering our business objectives
depends upon our ability to identify,
attract, retain and manage skills
effectively. We deploy suitable reward
systems and strive to be the employer of
choice. Our Company wide turnover rate
continues to be low, with an annualised
turnover figure under 3.5%, exclusive of
the restructuring undertaken during 2009.
COMMUNICATION AND
ENGAGEMENT
During times of change, it has been very
important for us to remain focussed on
engaging with our employees. As part of
our internal communication plan, we have
applied increased rigour to our employee
briefing processes, including employee
‘town hall’ forums with management. 
We engage regularly and formally with
union representatives in both Brazil and
the UK in respect of negotiating employee
terms and conditions. In the UK, our
relationship is with the GMB via a joint
consultative committee. This is
supplemented by employee forums 
with management.

Company has focused on delivering HSE
improvements by developing the HSE
culture with considerable success.
HEALTH & SAFETY
During 2009, the Company continued on
its ‘Journey to Zero’ by consolidating and
developing the 2008 HSE improvement
programmes with significant success. The
Company has worked hard to ingrain its
fundamental belief that “nothing we do is
so urgent or important that we cannot
take the time to do it safely”. The ‘Journey
to Zero’ programme includes the percent
safe programme which is a behavioural
safety programme which includes
enhanced near miss and observational
reporting. HSE Management Systems –
provide the framework for controlling 
risks and include the following elements;
HSE Resource – provide competent
support and advice
IOSH training – for line managers
and operators
% Safe Auditing – daily behavioural audit
Take 2 – pre-job assessment checklist
Deal with it – near miss reporting system
Just Culture – performance
management tool
The Wellstream Way – continuous
improvement
Tool Box Talks – pre-job briefings.
NEWCASTLE FACILITY
At the Newcastle site the Lost Time
Incident Rate (LTIR) reached Zero for
the first time since 2000 and the Total
OSHA Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR),
reached its lowest point in the Group’s
history. This change in the TRIR
represents an 81% improvement since
the commencement of the Journey 
to Zero programme in January 2007. 
We are delighted to have consolidated
the real improvement in key metrics 
on which we reported last year.
NITERÓI FACILITY
In Niterói, the trends for H1 were initially
adverse however our reporting systems
identified the trends and as a result,
stronger management focus was
implemented on leading metrics. The
trend is now reversed and is on target
to match Newcastle’s excellent record.
These improvements in performance
have been instrumental in allowing the
Group to retain once again ROSPA

SAFETY INITIATIVES
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
The Group HSE programme ‘Journey 
to Zero’ has continued, in addition
the following HSE initiatives have further
contributed to the Health and Safety
performance improvements over the
last year.
Revitalisation of our near miss
reporting system – Implementation 
of a weekly review meeting has
significantly improved workforce
engagement and closeout rates which
has in turn ensured the credibility of 
the processes. This resulted in a 
10% improvement in closure rates.
Embedding the ‘Percent Safe’ 
auditing programme – Building on the
programme which was implemented 
in 2008 to increase the focus on
behavioural rather than workplace
elements. This has ensured all
personnel maintain their focus on the
critical element of health and safety
management.
The Wellstream Way – This is the 
brand name for the Group’s Continuous
Improvement Programme which was
implemented in 2008. Following the
successful launch of the programme
many benefits are being realised through
the application of lean philosophies. 
A significant exercise commenced in
2009 reviewing all existing business
processes in support of the
development of our Enterprise 
Resource Planning processes.
5c auditing process – In addition 
to our ‘Journey to Zero’ programme
Wellstream adopted the continuous
improvement process based on the
Japanese 5S principles.
Hazard Boards – Each Work Centre
Team summarised the areas’ Hazards
and Control Measures on a Hazard
Board which is clearly displayed on
the Work Centre. This is used as an
induction tool for visitors to the area
and has increased risk awareness 
of the Work Centre Teams.
IOSH Managing Safely – This was
critical in developing the safety
knowledge of Wellstream Supervisory
personnel. This programme built on the
successes achieved through the
implementation of the IOSH Working
Safely training that was rolled out to
non-supervisory employees throughout
2007 and 2008.
ENVIRONMENT
Wellstream Newcastle has been certified
to ISO 14001 since 2001. Our Brazil
facility has implemented the requirements
of the Environmental Management system
which is certified to ISO 14001. Full
accreditation is expected in H1 this year.
As part of our ISO 14001 management
system the Group implemented a number
of environmental improvements in 2009.
CASE STUDY:
Wellstream’s Newcastle site is situated 
on the banks of the River Tyne. This 
was recognised as an area of potential
environmental risk. In 2009, the Group
reviewed chemical storage and “bunding”
arrangements on site which resulted in
the installation of a drain bladder in the
main discharge point to the River Tyne 
to ensure that drains can be isolated to
prevent any spillages reaching the river 
in an emergency. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
HEAL TH AND 
SAFETY INITIATIVES
ENERGY MANAGEMENT
Wellstream undertook its first carbon
footprint survey in 2008. This exercise
was repeated in 2009. We have reduced
our carbon footprint during 2009 by in
excess of 10% and have targeted a
further 10% reduction on our 2008
baseline for 2010. 
2009 has also seen the introduction 
of carbon management processes in
preparation for the introduction of the
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy
Efficiency Scheme in 2010. This will be 
a key challenge for the Group in 2010.
A number of other improvement
opportunities have been identified within
our manufacturing facilities. These 
will release further energy reduction
opportunities once implemented.
ETHICAL TRADING POLICIES
Wellstream has a robust business conduct
policy that ensures the Group trades
legally, fairly, openly, honestly and with
transparency in all dealings. The policy
is highly visible and governs the actions
of all employees in the conduct of
Wellstream’s business and in respect
of the Group’s dealings with customers,
suppliers, clients, contractors and
intermediaries. The Group’s business
conduct policy covers gifts and hospitality,
international business relationships,
conflicts of interest, confidential information
and the reporting of misconduct.
The Group completed additional training
to enhance the above with a view also to
providing adequate procedures in relation
to both the forthcoming UK Bribery Act
and the USA Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act. The Group is committed to following
a stringent fraud and anti-corruption
policy to ensure all business is conducted
in a legal, fair and honest manner. This
policy governs the actions of all employees
and is accessible to all. The Group will
not tolerate fraud, corrupt, dishonest 
or illegal activity amongst employees,
customers, suppliers or intermediaries. 
Wellstream also operates under the
guidance of a whistle blowing policy. The
whistle blowing policy states the course of
action an employee should take if they
have concerns. All policies are available to
view on the website www.wellstream.com.

(2008: £13.6m) upon which lower margin
was earned and restructuring costs
of £5.0m. 
On 30 September 2009 the Group’s
onshore business was sold to Prime
Natural Resources Inc for £19.6m
generating a profit of £5.0m on disposal. 
The Group’s Profit for the year of £34.5m
(2008: £52.7m) contributed to improved
Net Debt at the year end of £38.7m
(2008: £65.8m) and diluted earnings
per share of 34.2p (2008: 52.3p).
REVENUE 
Revenue for the year ended 31 December
2009 increased by 8.3% to £400.7m
(2008: £369.9m). This included £14.6m
(2008: £13.7m) from the discontinued
onshore operations.
Offshore revenue grew by 8.4% to
£386.1m (2008: £356.2m) driven by the
continuing ramp up of production in the
Niterói facility and increased installation
revenues offset, to some extent, in the
Newcastle facility where revenue
generation reduced during the year. 
A weaker product mix, primarily in the
Newcastle facility, and a generally
deflationary environment for input costs
caused a reduction of 19% in the average
revenue per normalised kilometre of
offshore pipe.
GROSS MARGIN
Gross Profit for the year ended
31 December 2009 was £87.9m
(2008: £117.8m).
Offshore Gross Profit of £86.44m
(2008: £118.3m) benefitted from
installation activities albeit with a dilutive
margin. The core offshore pipe business
delivered a lower contribution versus
2009; material cost reductions of 14% 
per normalised kilometre only partially
offset the corresponding reduction in
revenue and additional production costs
were incurred in Brazil as a result of its
increased capacity. 
Gross Profit in the discontinued onshore
operations was £1.43m (2008: £0.5m
loss) which reflected a mix change
towards larger diameter, higher pressure
product being sold into a developing
South American market.
OPERATING PROFIT
Administrative expenses were £37.8m
(2008: £37.8m). Underlying these
expenses is a build up in the Brazilian
infrastructure and lower costs in the UK.
Leverage achieved over this cost base
reflects increased installation activity and
initial savings from cost reduction plans
announced during 2009.
Resultant Operating profit before
restructuring costs of £51.2m (2008:
£81.0m) includes a net contribution 
of £0.4m (2008: £3.1m loss) from the
discontinued onshore operations.
Operating profit before restructuring 
costs was £25.9m in the second half of
the year versus £25.3m in the first half. 
During the year the Newcastle facility saw
reducing activity and backlog as a result
of a general slowdown in market demand
outside of Brazil. Consequently it was
necessary to address the Group’s global
cost base. The cost of these actions was
£5.0m. Initial savings were evident in the
latter months of 2009 and will be seen
increasingly through 2010.
FINANCING COSTS
Net financing costs incurred in the year
totalled £3.4m (2008: £3.5m). The first
half of the year was characterised by
lower interest rates than were seen in
2008. The second half of the year
reflected higher interest rate margins
payable under the Group’s increased
facilities offset, to some extent, by 
interest received on cash held overseas. 
PROFIT BEFORE TAXATION
Profit before taxation of £42.8m (2008:
£77.5m) is stated after restructuring costs
of £5.0m and a contribution from
discontinued operations of £0.4m. 
FINANCIAL
REVIEW 36/37
TAXATION
The effective rate of taxation for the
Group was 31.0% (2008: 30.5%). 
A relative increase in profits earned in
Brazil, which are taxed at 34% underlies
the increased average rate.
SALE OF ONSHORE
OPERATIONS
On 30 September 2009 Wellstream
completed the sale of all assets that
comprised its onshore operation for a
consideration of £19.6m. All proceeds
from this sale have been received and a
post tax profit on sale of £5.0m recorded.
Revenue from the discontinued onshore
operations was £14.6m (2008: £13.7m)
in the period, generating operating profit
of £0.4m (2008: £3.1m loss).
EPS
Earnings per share for the year ended
31 December 2009 was 34.6p
(2008: 52.9p) and diluted earnings per
share was 34.2p (2008: 52.3p). Profit
earned on the sale of onshore operations
offset the restructuring costs in the year.
Second half earnings per share of 17.7p
were marginally ahead of the 16.9p
earned in the first half.
DIVIDEND
It is the Company’s aim to pay a dividend
covered some 4-5 times by profit after tax
across the trading cycle. The Company
paid an interim dividend of 4p (2008: 4p)
in October 2009 and proposes a final
dividend of 6p per share (2008: 6p). 
If approved the final dividend will be
payable on 11 June 2010 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business 
on 21 May 2010. The ex dividend date
will be 19 May 2010. 
OPERATING CASH FLOW
Cash flow from operations was £62.7m
(2008: £49.5m). Focus throughout the
year on working capital was evidenced 
by significantly lower inventory and trade
debtor balances. At the year end
inventory represented 10 weeks’
production (2008: 13 weeks) and debtors
amounted to 29 days sales (2008: 76
days). However, lower activity in the
Newcastle facility during Q4 2009 and the
ensuing reduction in customer deposits,
left overall working capital, excluding
provisions, £4.2m below that of 2008.
Taxation payments of £21.1m (2008:
£10.0m) include an acceleration of
Brazilian tax. 
The net cash increase from operating
activities in the year was £39.7m 
(2008: £36.3m).
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE 
AND RECEIPTS
Net capital expenditure of £16.9m
(2008: £51.1m) included completion of
the Brazil capacity expansion, purchase
of installation equipment and background
expenditure on reels and plant and
machinery.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
During the year net proceeds on new
financing amounted to £4.8m; the Group
utilised a net £3.0m of additional debt
from its increased UK facility and a further
£1.8m under its ICMS (sales tax) facility
with the Rio State Government. 
NET DEBT
Net Debt at 31 December 2009 of
£38.7m (2008: £65.8m) included net
cash of £34.8m (2008: £0.1m). This 
cash balance was largely held overseas
reflecting significant debtor receipts late 
in the year and the increased size of
operations outside of the UK.
TREASURY AND 
FINANCIAL RISK
The Group’s day to day cash requirements
and its capital investment programme are
financed through loan and debt facilities
totalling £150m (2008: £96.9m). 
FINANCIAL
REVIEW WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
FINANCIAL REVIEW
IT IS THE COMPANY’S AIM TO PA Y
A DIVIDEND COVERED SOME 4-5
TIMES BY PROFIT AFTER TAX
ACROSS THE TRADING CYCLE.
These were refinanced in July 2009 by
Lloyds and Bank of Scotland with
additional capacity being provided by
Barclays. This refinancing was undertaken
primarily to underwrite capital expenditure
and working capital associated with an
enhancement of the Group’s offshore
installation capability.
The new facility comprises an amortising
term loan of £60m, drawn-down
periodically on short term fixed interest
rates and a revolving credit facility that is
accessed when needed either on short
term fixed interest rates or at variable
interest rates. Since draw-down the
majority of debt has been provided under
the term loan. This facility reduces at the
end of each six month period by £5m,
commencing June 2010, until its expiry in
December 2012. The Group also has a
facility to draw down a local currency
denominated loan of up to £26.8m with
the Rio State government; to date 
£13.4m of this facility has been utilised.
Although a substantial part of the Group’s
revenue and profit is earned outside of the
UK, subsidiaries generally trade in either
local currency or Sterling. As a result, the
Group is not normally exposed to significant
foreign exchange transactional risk. 
The Group does occasionally generate
revenue in a third party currency and,
where this occurs, the potential risk is
assessed against any natural hedges that
exist within the Group before any financial
hedges are considered. The Group also
has an exposure to foreign currency that
arises upon the translation of overseas
results into Sterling.
The Group did not hold any financial
instruments to hedge either currency or
interest rates at the year end or at the date
of this report though increased activity in
Brazil did necessitate hedging consequent
currency exposures that arose during the
second half of 2009.
The nature of the Group’s offshore
business necessitates it trading with a
limited number of customers and the
acceptance of the credit risk that ensues
from a number of large contracts with
these customers. The Group seeks to
contract its business in such a way that 
it receives regular stage payments from 
its customers that are appropriate to the
stage of completion of the contract. This
payment profile is approved by senior
management in advance of accepting
a contract and is monitored subsequent
to acceptance at regular intervals. 
This approach and the Group’s customer
profile which consist largely of national 
and international oil companies with well
established and substantial credit histories,
significantly mitigate the risk of financial
loss from default.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have considered current
business conditions, financial forecasts
including cash flows and sensitivities,
internal planning and control procedures
and financial risks summarised above
together with those identified in the Chief
Executive’s Review on pages 11 to 33.
Whilst acknowledging each carries with it
some uncertainty, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Company
and the Group have adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason,
the directors continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the accounts.

During the year executive directors and senior employees were granted nominal cost share options which vest over a three
year period when certain performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee are met. Further details are given in
the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Shares have been issued under the Performance Share Plan and SAYE share scheme following the disposal of our onshore
business, FlexSteel and a redundancy programme in Newcastle. The first award under the Performance Share Plan in 2007
has vested in full as the targets were exceeded. Further details are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Further details are provided in the Chief Executive’s Review on page 16 and Note 6 to the financial statements.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Information about the use by the Company and its subsidiaries of financial instruments is given in note 25. The Company
approved a hedging policy for foreign exchange limiting the total amount hedged to a maximum of 50% of the forecast net
foreign currency cash flow in any six month period. The Company utilises no other financial instruments.
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
A special resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to amend the Company’s Articles of Association in order
to update them to reflect the implementation of the final provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This will include the deletion
of any reference to the authorised share capital of the Company, as under the Companies Act 2006, the requirement for a
company to have an authorised share capital has been abolished. The Company’s issued share capital as at 29 March 2010
was 99,800,025, ordinary shares of £0.01 each, each credited as fully paid.
The only changes that took place to the share capital of the Company during the year were an issue of ordinary shares to the
Chairman under his contract of engagement as more fully described on page 60 and the issue of shares under the employee
share plans.
The resolutions being proposed at the Annual General Meeting include resolutions to allow the directors to allot ordinary
shares and to disapply pre-emption rights in certain circumstances, in line with recent guidance issued by the Association
of British Insurers (the “ABI”).
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares are set out in the Company’s Articles, copies of
which can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to the Company Secretary.
There are no restrictions on transfer or voting of securities in the Company and there are no agreements known to the
Company which might result in such restrictions. There are no shareholders carrying special rights with regard to control of
the Company. No shares held by employee share schemes of the Company have rights regarding control of the Company
that are not directly exercisable by employees.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 12 May 2009, the Company was authorised, to purchase up to
9,964,225 of its own shares at a price between the nominal value and 105 per cent of the market price. The resolutions
being proposed at the Annual General Meeting include a resolution to renew this authority. 46/47

DIRECTORS’ REPORT / CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMBINED CODE
The Financial Services Authority requires listed companies to disclose how they have applied, and complied with, the
provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined Code. For the 12 months to 31 December 2009, the Company has
complied fully with the provisions set out in section 1 of the Combined Code, except provision A.3.2 which states that at
least half the Board (excluding the Chairman) should comprise independent non-executive directors. Gordon Chapman, our
CEO fell ill in August and has not yet returned to work. Alasdair MacDonald was appointed to the Board as an executive
director and as Acting CEO in September. With the appointment of Alasdair MacDonald as an executive director, there are
five executive directors excluding the Chairman on the Board and four non-executive directors.
THE BOARD
Board composition and independence
At the date of this report, the Board of Wellstream Holdings PLC consists of the Chairman, five executive directors and four
independent non-executive directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and each has clearly
defined responsibilities. The Chairman’s appointment was renewed on a rolling 12 month basis from May 2010 and is
expected to continue for a further three years. Further details are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Chairman’s main role is to lead the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role and setting its agenda.
The Chairman is also responsible for ensuring that the directors receive accurate, timely and clear information; a process that
is reviewed annually. Regular presentations are made to the Board on all aspects of the business including Strategy, Health
and Safety, R&D, Technology and Risk. The Chairman also ensures that the Company maintains clear communication with
shareholders, facilitates the effective contribution of non-executive directors and ensures constructive relations between
executive and non-executive directors. The Chairman regularly meets the non-executive directors without the executive
directors being present. The Chairman normally devotes two days a week to the business of the Company paying particular
attention to assisting in framing and developing strategy and ensuring its implementation. This time commitment has
increased since the absence of the CEO Gordon Chapman. Following its annual review, the Nomination Committee is satisfied
that the Chairman is able to dedicate significant time to the business and that there has been no significant change in the level
of his commitments since the last review.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for implementing Company strategy and managing the Company. This function is
currently carried out by the Acting CEO Alasdair MacDonald who has assumed all the functions of the Chief Executive Officer.
The Board aims to embody an appropriate balance of skills and experience to support the Company’s strategy and
performance and has consequently appointed experienced non-executive directors who bring to the Company a wealth of
skills and knowledge of the oil and gas industry. Two new directors were appointed in the year. Luis Araujo, head of our Brazil
business was appointed to the Board in March 2009. The second appointment was Alasdair MacDonald in September 2009
who assumed the role of Acting CEO. Francisco Gros, a non-executive director, was on sick leave between June and
September and was unable to attend some meetings of the Board. His role as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee was
assumed by Sir Graham Hearne during his period of recuperation however he was able to attend all 6 Committee meetings.
It is the role of the Nomination Committee to consider the appropriate balance and composition of the Board in terms of its
skill set, industry experience and diversity. It is the combination of these skills that provide the Board with the knowhow and
judgement effectively to manage risk and execution of business strategy on behalf of our shareholders. This is kept under
regular review.
Wellstream’s executive directors are drawn predominantly from across the subsea and oilfield services sector.
Over a career spanning thirty years, Chairman John Kennedy is well known in the industry, and has global experience in
operations, and merger & acquisitions together with strong city connections. Alasdair MacDonald, our Acting CEO has a
20 year background in subsea operations management and business development and has an in-depth knowledge of the
competitor landscape having held a number of senior roles within the subsea oil and gas sector. Luis Araujo combines
substantial knowledge of operational matters together with a deep understanding of our customer base and opportunities in
Brazil. Chris Braithwaite has previously worked in a number of senior operations and project management roles within both
engineering & construction and oilfield technology companies. Finally, Chris Gill, Finance Director has 20 years’ multi-industry
finance experience at a senior level including companies outside of the oil and gas sector.
Our non-executive directors are also drawn largely from the oil and gas industry and oilfield services industries. Sir Graham
Hearne is the former Chairman and Chief Executive of Enterprise Oil. Pat Murray is former CEO of Dresser, Inc, the energy
infrastructure and oilfield services company. Neil Gaskell was former treasurer of Royal Dutch Shell and Francisco Gros was
Governor of Brazil’s Central Bank and CEO of Petrobras and is Vice Chairman of OGX, the largest Brazilian private sector oil
and natural gas company. CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE REPORT
48/49
The letters of engagement for Neil Gaskell, Sir Graham Hearne, Pat Murray and Francisco Gros will be reviewed prior to
their expiry of the initial fixed three year term in May 2010. All of the non-executive directors, Neil Gaskell, Francisco Gros,
Sir Graham Hearne and Pat Murray are considered to be independent non-executive directors.
The Board is satisfied that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the
judgement of these directors. Sir Graham Hearne is recognised as the Senior Independent non-executive Director and is
available to shareholders should they have concerns that cannot be resolved through normal channels with the Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer or Finance Director. The independent non-executive directors meet annually without the Chairman
present and review the performance of the Chairman.
The non-executive directors are appointed for three year terms under letters of appointment and are entitled to a fee for
their services. They are not entitled to participate in any of the Company’s share schemes and are not eligible to join the
Company’s pension scheme. Other than their fees, no non-executive director received remuneration from the Company during
the year except for Pat Murray who received payment of US$30,000 for consultancy work regarding Brazil.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Annual General
Meeting or by any person during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office.
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board has approved a schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board’s attention. The types of decisions
taken by the Board include the approval of the Group’s strategy and annual budget and financial statements, acquisitions
or disposals, documents sent to the Company’s shareholders, changes in capital structure, dividends and matters relating
to its committees and evaluation of risk. Operational decisions are delegated to the Company’s management.
The Board holds ultimate responsibility for the management and success of the Group, developing strategy, scrutinising
performance and maintaining internal controls and corporate governance. Responsibility for the day-to-day management
of the Group is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer (currently the Acting CEO). The Acting Chief Executive Officer is also
responsible for all environmental and risk matters together with all employee/HR matters and external stakeholder issues.
The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for managing the operating functions of the Company.
All directors are to be appointed via the recommendation of the Nomination Committee chaired by the Senior Independent
non-executive Director, Sir Graham Hearne. Directors must retire and offer themselves for re-election by shareholders every
three years in accordance with the Articles of the Company.
All directors joining the Group benefit from a tailored induction process familiarising them with the Company and updating
their existing skills based on reports to the Board, factory visits and briefings from advisers. This training includes
environmental and social issues. Regular Board meetings are held in Brazil in addition to the UK. Site visits are also
arranged for the directors as well as receiving presentations from business unit heads.
A formal evaluation of the effectiveness during the year of the Board, board committees and of individual directors
was carried out. The results of the evaluation were reported to the Board.
The non-executive directors are available to meet shareholders through the year to discuss any concerns. No such meetings
were requested or took place during the year.
The Board holds meetings on a regular basis, at least five per year and additionally for specific purposes as and when
required. There were five formal meetings during the year together with a number of ad hoc meetings to consider specific
items of a more routine nature between Board meetings. Twenty Board meetings were held in the year to 31 December
2009. Six meetings are scheduled in 2010. The number of meetings of the Board and of its committees held during the
year is shown opposite, together with the attendance details of each director or committee member: WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

Audit Committee
The current members of the Committee are Neil Gaskell (Chairman of the Committee), Sir Graham Hearne and Pat Murray
who are all independent non-executive directors. All members of the Committee are financially literate non-executive
directors and Neil Gaskell is considered to have “recent and relevant financial experience”.
Further details about the Committee are included in the Audit Committee Report on page 52.
Remuneration Committee

and Pat Murray, all independent non-executive directors.
Sir Graham Hearne assumed the temporary chairmanship of the Committee during the period of recuperation during
the sick leave of Francisco Gros. Pat Murray assumed the Chairmanship of the Committee on 15 January 2010.
The Committee met six times during the year and attendance was 100% for all members of the Committee. Its principal

performance targets agreed by the Committee. Further details about the Committee and details of the remuneration
of directors are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 62.
Nomination Committee
Remit

at the conclusion of their term of office and the re-election by shareholders of any director under the retirement by rotation
provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association. CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE REPORT
50/51
Membership and Governance
The Committee comprises Sir Graham Hearne, Senior Independent non-executive Director and Chairman of the Committee,
John Kennedy and Francisco Gros and the majority are independent non-executive directors. The other non-executive
directors and Chief Executive Officer attend periodically, by invitation only. The Committee’s Terms of Reference setting out
the remit delegated to it by the Board can be found on the Company’s website.
Activities
The Committee met five times during the course of 2009, to:-
•
recommend the appointment of Luis Araujo and Alasdair MacDonald as directors of the Company. Luis Araujo’s
appointment to the Board underlines the growth and significance of Brazil to the Group. Alasdair MacDonald, who
originally joined Wellstream to oversee the Group’s Corporate Development function was also recommended for
appointment to the Board as Acting CEO in September, to cover the CEO Gordon Chapman’s period of extended
absence due to illness.
•
consider and propose the renewal of the Chairman’s contract which is a rolling 12 month contract, expected to extend a
further three years from May 2010.
•
progress its search for non-executive directors, in order to broaden the global business experience available to the Board.
In conducting its searches, the Committee has engaged the services of external executive search providers.
•
progress succession planning within the business to assist in ensuring that the Group has adequate future resources.
It also conducted an evaluation of its own performance which was found to be effective.
Conflicts of Interest
Under the Companies Act 2006, each director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest
that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The requirement is very broad and could apply,
for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation. The Articles of
Association approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting gave the directors authority to approve such
situations in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The processes employed in 2009 were reviewed and found to be effective. In accordance with the Companies Act 2006,
each director declared any conflicts or potential conflicts for the consideration of the Board as a whole. None was
considered material and all other directorships held were continued to be authorised by non-conflicted directors. Other than
as disclosed in Note 31 of the financial statements, there are no related-party transactions involving the directors to report.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control. Such a system is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has monitored the effectiveness of the Group system of internal control during the year and reviewed reports
received from the Audit Committee addressing the result of its review of the risk assessment process as a whole. In
accordance with provision C. 2.1 of the Combined Code, the Board can confirm that throughout 2009 it maintained an
appropriate and effective system of internal controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk
management systems.
The key procedures, which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control, are as follows:-
Indication of Business Risks
Significant business risks are recorded and reported against by a senior executive who is responsible to the Board for
these matters. In identifying significant risks to which the Group is exposed the results of any relevant internal audit work
and agreed mitigating action are taken into account. Regular reviews and periodic updates with senior executives and
management are carried out and the results reported to the Audit Committee and the Board. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Quality and Integrity of Personnel
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training courses.
High quality personnel and HR management processes are seen as an essential part of the control environment.
Management Structure
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group. The management of the Group as a whole is delegated to the Chief
Executive Officer and the executive directors. Each executive director has been given responsibility for specific aspects of
the Group’s affairs. A clearly defined organisation structure exists within which individual responsibilities are identified and can
be monitored. The conduct of individual businesses is delegated to the local executive management teams. These teams are
accountable for the conduct and performance of their businesses within the agreed business strategy. Subject to delegated
authorities, they have full authority to act subject to the reserved powers and sanctioning limits laid down by the Board and
to Group policies and guidelines.
Internal Audit
The Group has an established internal audit process. It has an agreed programme of activities to review compliance with
procedures and assess the integrity of the control environment. Internal audit acts as a service to the business by assisting
with the continuous improvement of controls and procedures. Actions are agreed in response to its recommendations and
these are monitored by the Audit Committee to ensure that satisfactory control is maintained.
Budgetary Process
A comprehensive budgeting system is in place, with annual budgets for all operating subsidiaries. The combined budget is
subject to consideration and approval by the Board. Management information systems provide the directors with relevant
and timely information required to monitor financial performance.
Investment Appraisal
Budgetary approval and defined authorisation levels regulate capital expenditure. As part of the budgetary process, the
Board considers proposals for research and development programmes.
Whistle Blowing Policy
The Group has in place a whistle blowing policy by which concerns may be reported and investigated confidentially. The
Audit Committee reviewed the process by which the policy is brought to the attention of employees and recommended
further actions to enhance its awareness together with further training to enhance anti-corruption measures.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Dialogue with Institutional Shareholders
Most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director. The Chairman, Senior Independent non-
executive Director and other directors are available for discussion with shareholders. All directors receive regular shareholder
feedback so as to understand their issues and concerns.
CONSTRUCTIVE USE OF THE AGM
The Annual General Meeting is to be held on 12 May 2010 at which all directors will attend, and shareholders are
encouraged to attend and to raise areas of interest or concern to directors.
Investor roadshows have been carried out to brief analysts and shareholders on the Company’s activities and information
is regularly posted to the website.
E communications
Accompanying this report is a letter to shareholders asking how shareholders wish to receive Company communications,
either electronically, via the website or in paper form. 52/53
AUDIT COMMITTEE
REPORT
OVERVIEW
The members of the Committee are Neil Gaskell Chairman, Pat Murray and Sir Graham Hearne. Their biographies are given
on pages 38 and 39. All members are financially literate, independent non-executive directors, and the Board has
determined that Neil Gaskell has relevant financial and audit committee experience. The Committee met three times during
the year and attendance was 100% for all members of the Committee. The Audit Committee invites the Group’s Finance
Director, the Internal Auditor, and the lead partner, and other senior representatives of the external auditors to attend all of its
meetings. Other senior management are invited to attend as required for the Committee to discharge its duties. The
Committee held two private meetings during the year with the external auditor without the presence of executive
management.
Summary of the role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board’s oversight of:
•
the integrity of the Group’s financial statements
•
the Group’s compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements
•
the external auditor’s qualifications and independence
•
the performance of the Group’s internal audit process, and of the external auditors
•
the adequacy of the Group’s financial disclosure, and
•
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems.
During the year the Audit Committee has evaluated and reported to the Board about the appropriateness of accounting
policies and practices, areas of accounting judgement, the effectiveness of internal controls, the risk management process
and the results of the external audit and internal audit work. It has reviewed the Annual Financial Statements for 2008 and
the unaudited interim report for the first half of 2009 and recommended formal adoption of the financial statements and
reports by the Board.
The Committee oversees Internal Audit. The Committee has approved the Audit programme for the year and reviewed all
reports on the audits and other investigations undertaken by Internal Audit. In September the Committee temporarily
appointed PwC to provide an Internal Audit service during the absence of the Internal Auditor on maternity leave.
The Audit Committee manages the relationship with external auditors on behalf of the Board. It has reviewed the external
auditor’s independence and performance, approved the terms of their appointment, the audit plan and remuneration for
2009. The external audit partner was replaced by rotation in 2009 after completion of the 2008 audit. The Committee has
an established policy for limiting non-audit and non-audit related services supplied by the external auditors. It has set a
target that fees for non-audit services should not normally exceed audit and audit related fees unless specifically approved
by the Committee. The audit and audit related fees for 2009 amounted to £217,000. Non-audit fees totalled £214,000 and
were related to tax compliance (£148,000) and remuneration advice (£66,000). Non-audit fees have reduced by 25% over
2008 and are below the level of audit and audit related fees. This is in line with the policy of the Committee that non-audit
fees should not exceed audit and audit related fees without prior approval of the Committee. The Committee concluded that
the independence of the external auditors continues to be maintained.
The Committee has also decided that it will be reviewing the appointment of auditors to the Company. This is good practice
and recognises that Deloitte have fulfilled this role for seven years.
The Committee carried out an evaluation of its effectiveness in March which was found to be effective.
The Terms of Reference are posted to the Company’s website and are kept under review. There were no changes during
the year.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the
work of the Committee.

REMUNERATION REPORT
WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT / DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the statutory requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8
(Quoted Companies: Directors’ Remuneration Report) to the Large and Medium sized Companies and Company’s (Accounts
and Reports) Regulations 2008 and meets the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and of the
Combined Code on corporate governance. In addition to meeting statutory requirements, the Remuneration Committee (the
“Committee”) takes into account best practice guidelines including guidance produced by the Association of British Insurers
(“ABI”) and the National Association of Pension Funds (“NAPF”).
The Committee’s policy on directors’ remuneration is to:
− provide competitive remuneration packages necessary to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of an appropriate
calibre
− promote the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives by providing remuneration packages that contain
appropriately motivating targets based on performance
− align senior executives’ remuneration with the long term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders, including
employees.
The report outlines the principles under which the Company’s directors are compensated. The Companies Act 2006 requires
the report to be put to a shareholders’ vote at the AGM on 12 May 2010 where the Chairman of the Committee will be
available to answer questions. The Companies Act 2006 further requires the Company’s auditors to report on certain parts
of this report, specifically the director’s share interests and emoluments, and to provide an opinion as to whether those
parts have been properly prepared. The audited section of this report can be found on pages 60 to 62.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Membership and role
During 2009, Francisco Gros was Chairman of the Committee, the other members of the Committee were Sir Graham
Hearne and Pat Murray. All members of the Committee are considered to be independent non-executive directors. Francisco
Gros was on sick leave for part of the year and Sir Graham Hearne assumed the Chairmanship of the Committee during this
period. The Committee’s primary role is to make recommendations to the Board on the framework of remuneration for the
executive directors and Chairman.
The Committee meets formally at least twice per year. No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration and none of
the Committee had during the year any personal interest in matters to be decided or any conflicts of interest, other than as a
shareholder of the Company. Six Committee meetings were held during the year and attendance at all meetings was 100%
by all members of the Committee. Following a review post year end, Pat Murray assumed the Chairmanship of the
Committee on 15 January 2010.
In 2009, the Committee retained the services of Deloitte LLP’s executive remuneration advisors to provide independent
advice on remuneration matters. Such advice included advice on executive directors’ compensation. As Deloitte are also
the Company’s auditors, the Audit Committee has considered the independence of the auditors in relation to the provision
of non-audit services to the Company and has concluded that the independence of the auditors is not compromised.
The Company’s Chairman, John Kennedy, and Chief Executive Officer, Gordon Chapman, attended Committee meetings, by
invitation, in order to provide advice and context on setting remuneration for the other executive directors and members of
senior management. Alasdair MacDonald, in his capacity as Acting Chief Executive Officer since September 2009, also
attended by invitation.
The Committee is a formal Committee of the Board and has powers delegated to it by the Board. Its remit is set out in its
Terms of Reference, which have been adopted by the Board and are available on the Company’s website at
www.wellstream.com. 54/55
DIRECTORS’
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Committee’s remit is to make recommendations to the Board on the:
•
Overall framework of executive and senior management remuneration policy and practice, the design and targets for
performance related pay schemes and the design of Company share incentive plans prior to approval by the Board and
shareholders.
It determines;
•
the specific remuneration of all of the executive directors, members of senior management and the Chairman, including
any annual cash bonus, where appropriate, and share incentive payments.
The Committee undertook the following activities during the year:
•
Award of 2008 bonuses
•
Setting 2009 annual bonus targets and assessing progress against targets
•
Setting the level of individual grants and performance conditions for the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
•
Assessment of remuneration for Luis Araujo and Alasdair MacDonald as newly elected members of the Board and the
remuneration of Alasdair MacDonald whilst fulfilling the role of Acting CEO
•
Reviewing a proposal to implement an all employee share incentive plan
•
Considering the Chairman’s fees for his re-engagement
•
Recommending the vesting conditions of the PSP awards for managers who left Wellstream’s employment.
In April 2009, the Committee wrote to certain major shareholders advising them of the thinking and policy behind a change in
remuneration policy to meet investor concerns on the balance of risk and reward and the disclosure of performance targets.
The Committee sought to address:
•
the anticipated reduction in the growth rate of the Group following the very high levels of growth achieved since flotation
•
the impact of an anticipated slow down in development projects in the oil and gas sector as a result of substantially
reduced oil and gas prices and the overall economic downturn
•
the general concerns expressed by institutional shareholders that executive compensation levels for quoted companies
should reflect current conditions including the reduced level of share prices on public exchanges.
As a result of the review, the Committee decided to freeze base salaries for 2009 for directors and senior management.
The annual cash bonus targets were amended from a single EBITDA measure to three target measures of EBITDA, a cash
conversion measure, and an individual performance measure providing 60%, 20% and 20% of the award respectively.
Further details of the targets are given later in this report.
For Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards the percentage of salary available for award was reduced in the case of the
CEO from 125% to under 50% of base salary with reductions applied to other directors and senior management.
The performance criteria were also amended, from a single aggregate earnings per share measure to a combination of an
earnings per share growth measure and a cash conversion measure. The Committee believes that these measures more
closely align the directors’ interests with shareholder value, reflect more general shareholder concerns and take account of
market conditions. This is part of the Company’s broader objective of ensuring that an appropriate balance is struck between
how profits are apportioned between retentions, remuneration and dividends to shareholders. For the future, the policies
outlined above will continue throughout 2010 and will be regularly reviewed.
The Committee recognised that the lack of disclosure of precise performance measures for awards in 2007 and 2008 raised
questions with institutional shareholders. These targets are fully disclosed later in this report together with further detail of the
performance measure for awards made in 2009.
Following the year end, the Committee have again decided to freeze the base salaries of the executive directors and senior
management for 2010. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

REMUNERATION POLICY AND PRACTICE
Executive Directors
The Committee sets its remuneration levels at a level sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors and key executives
of the calibre needed to achieve the Company’s objectives and deliver shareholder value. The Company looks to reward
executives for short term and long term performance both at a Company and individual level utilising three main
remuneration tools: in the short term, base salary and benefits and annual cash bonus; and for the long term the PSP .
In addition there are pension contributions to a money purchase scheme. Benchmarking data is reviewed which includes
all sector analyses of the FTSE 250 and other published survey data. The Committee believe that the remuneration tools
represent an appropriate mix of incentives which reflects the Company’s needs, establishes an appropriate balance between
fixed and variable remuneration, and is based on targets that are appropriately stretching, verifiable and relevant and which
take account of risk.

REMUNERATION REPORT
56/57
BASE SALARY
The Committee determines executive directors’ base salaries at the beginning of the year, effective 1 January each year. In
2009, given the prevailing external environment as explained above, remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in
the Group as a whole, the headcount reduction announced in Newcastle during the first quarter of 2009 and change in shift
patterns, it was agreed that executive directors would not be awarded any increases in base salary.
Executive Director Base salary at Base salary at
1 January 2009 1 January 2008
Gordon Chapman, Chief Executive Officer £409,000 £409,000
Chris Braithwaite, Chief Operating Officer £289,000 £289,000
Chris Gill, Finance Director £259,000 £259,000
Luis Araujo*, Executive Director £252,208 –
Alasdair MacDonald, Acting CEO £259,000 –
*Luis Araujo’s salary is denominated in Brazilian Reais and is translated to sterling at the average rate for the year.
Luis Araujo and Alasdair MacDonald were made directors of the Board on 10 March 2009 and 21 September 2009
respectively. Their salaries above reflect a full 12 month period. Consistent with the decision not to award any base salary
adjustments to executive directors in 2009, neither was awarded an increase in base salary as a result of their appointment
to the Board.
ALLOWANCES AND BENEFITS IN KIND
In addition to base salary, UK based executive directors receive a car allowance, private medical insurance, pension
contributions, life assurance and long term incapacity insurance. Luis Araujo, based in Brazil, receives a fully expensed
car as part of his remuneration package, and other benefits consistent with the Brazil employment market.
ANNUAL CASH BONUS
In March each year, the Committee determines the level of cash bonus earned, based upon the achievement of both Group
and personal performance objectives which are agreed at the beginning of the previous year. Such objectives are established
with the aim of incentivising the directors to implement the Group’s strategy and achieve targets which are directly linked to
the performance of the Group.
Stretch bonus targets for 2009 were based on the achievement of EBITDA (60% of the award), a cash conversion metric
(20% of the award) and a personal performance target (20% of the award). During 2009 all directors achieved a full award
under the cash conversion metric, no award under the EBITDA metric with the balance being made up by achievement of
the personal performance metric.
As mentioned below, cash bonus awards actually paid for 2009 ranged from 30% to 68% of salary compared with 80%
to 100% of salary in 2008.
The Committee made discretionary awards to three individuals, one to acknowledge the performance during 2009 of
Wellstream in Brazil under the direction of Luis Araujo and secondly to Alasdair MacDonald Acting CEO and Chris Gill
Finance Director to recognise additional responsibilities in the absence of the CEO who is currently away on sick leave. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

2010 ANNUAL BONUS
The structure of the performance measure for the 2010 annual bonus will be 30% order intake, 30% EBITDA, 20% cash
conversion and 20% for the achievement of personal performance objectives. The maximum bonus opportunity will replicate
that of 2009.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP) – SHARE INCENTIVE
The Company has in place a Performance Share Plan in which the Group’s executive directors and senior management
participate. Participants receive performance related share awards each year, which vest after three years, subject to the
participant’s continued employment and the extent to which performance conditions have been met. The market value of the
shares at date of grant is normally limited to 100% of the CEO’s base salary and 80% for other executive directors, although
the Committee has the authority to increase this up to 200% in exceptional circumstances.
2007 award
The 2007 award was subject to the aggregate EPS performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee. Those targets
were exceeded and accordingly the awards vest in full.
2009 award
In 2009, PSP awards were granted as follows:
PSP Grant as Number of Date of Exercise
Executive Director a % of salary Shares Award Price
Gordon Chapman
Chief Executive Officer 46% 35,336 12 May 2009 1p
Chris Braithwaite
Chief Operating Officer 37% 19,788 12 May 2009 1p
Chris Gill
Finance Director 37% 17,668 12 May 2009 1p
Luis Araujo
Executive Director 31% 13,082 12 May 2009 1p
Alasdair MacDonald
Acting CEO 26% 12,367 12 May 2009 1p
The PSP performance criteria are designed to achieve alignment with shareholder return and reward for the delivery of
strong executive performance. In 2009, the Committee approved a new measure for the PSP awards, being 50% for the
achievement of an EPS growth measure and 50% for the achievement of a cash conversion measure. The Committee
agreed entry and stretch targets. The vesting of the 2009 PSP awards has therefore been made subject to the following
performance measures, calculated over the three years from 1 January 2009 using 2008 as a base year.

The performance targets for awards made in 2010 will be set in a similar manner and will be disclosed in the Directors’
Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2010.
As part of its remit, the Committee regularly looks at the performance conditions attached to the scheme. The Committee
reviewed the performance criteria in early 2010 and concluded that they remain appropriate for awards scheduled as part
of the PSP annual cycle of awards made in March 2010.

OTHER SCHEMES
The Company operates a tax-approved Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme in the UK, whereby options may be granted at up
to a 20% discount to market value at the date of the grant. The executive directors do not participate in the scheme except
Alasdair MacDonald who joined the SAYE scheme before he was appointed to the Board and has 1,976 share options. A
Share Appreciation Rights scheme operates overseas which mirrors the UK SAYE scheme whereby staff receive cash
bonuses determined by the rise in the Company’s share price over a three year savings period on an initial discounted fixed
price.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (SIP)
The Committee recently recommended, in principle, the implementation of a tax-approved all employee Share Incentive
Plan (the “SIP”) with the option to award free shares to a maximum value of £3,000 or partnership shares to a maximum of
£1,500 per employee per annum. The SIP is aimed at providing employees with an additional opportunity to further align
their interests with those of shareholders. The SIP will be submitted for shareholder approval at the AGM on 12 May 2010
and details of the SIP are set out in the Notice of AGM. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
The executive directors have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years’ notice by either party.
None of the contracts have provisions for compensation, other than salary and benefits, to be payable upon early termination
of contracts, nor do contracts contain any liquidated damages clauses or make provision for change of control.
Directors’ service contract notice periods from the Company are summarised below.
Date of contract Notice period
John Kennedy 11 April 2007 12 months
Gordon Chapman 11 April 2007 12 months
Alasdair MacDonald 21 September 2009 12 months
Chris Braithwaite 11 April 2007 12 months
Chris Gill 7 January 2008 12 months
Luis Araujo 10 March 2009 12 months*
The Chairman, John Kennedy’s existing three year contract expires in May 2010. He has signed a one year rolling contract
expected to continue for a further three years.
*Luis Araujo’s employment is governed by Brazilian employment law, accordingly his notice period is 30 days plus a right to
11 months’ salary in return for certain non-compete restrictive covenants.
All service contracts and letters of engagement will be available for inspection before and during the Annual General Meeting.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The non-executive directors’ fees are set by the Board and are reflected in their three year service agreements which will be
reviewed in 2010. Their fees are determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and are based
upon independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar size companies and reflect the time commitment
and responsibilities of the role. The basic fee paid to Sir Graham Hearne, Senior Independent non-executive Director is
£60,000, and the basic fee of the other non-executive directors is £50,000 per annum.
The non-executive directors receive further fees of £7,000 per annum (2008: £5,000), for chairing committees of the Board.
In addition, both Francisco Gros and Pat Murray receive a fee of £3,000 per annum in recognition of the additional time they
spend attending meetings in the UK on Wellstream’s business. Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the
Company’s share schemes and are not eligible to join the Company’s pension scheme.
During the course of the year, Pat Murray undertook some consultancy work regarding Brazil on behalf of the Company and
received a fee of US$30,000.
DIRECTORS’ FEES
At this year’s AGM, shareholders are being asked to approve changes to the Articles of Association which include an
increase in the cap on the amount of directors’ fees to £750,000. This is intended partly to increase the headroom which the
Company has in order to give it more flexibility should it wish to increase the number of directors to the Board. DIRECTORS’

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT / STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and the
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the Parent Company
financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of
the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that
directors:
•
properly select and apply accounting policies;
•
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
•
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance; and
•
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•
the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion:

as at 31 December 2009 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the

POLICIES

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Wellstream Holdings PLC (“t th he e  C Co om mp pa an ny y”) is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006
and is domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Group comprises Wellstream Holdings PLC and its subsidiaries. The nature of
the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and within the directors’ report.
2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
In the current year the Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standard 2 (revised) and International Accounting
Standard 23 (revised). 
IFRS 2 has been amended to change the definition of vesting conditions and to clarify the treatment of cancellations of 
non-vesting conditions. Vesting conditions are now limited to service and performance conditions only. All other conditions
are non-vesting conditions, and are factored into grant date fair value. If the counter-party of the entity can choose whether
to meet a non-vesting condition, as is the case with the Group’s SAYE schemes and Performance Share Plan, the failure 
by either party to meet the non vesting condition will be treated as a cancellation resulting in immediate recognition of the
remaining IFRS2 charge. The change in accounting policy has not been applied retrospectively as the effect of doing so
would not be material to the Group, and therefore no restatement has been made to previous periods. 
IAS 1 (revised) requires the presentation of a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement, separate from the
income statement. As a result, the consolidated statement of changes in equity has been included in the primary statements,
showing changes in each component of equity for each period presented.
IAS 23 (revised) requires that eligible borrowing costs incurred in respect of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the
cost of those assets. This change in accounting policy is not retrospective and so does not impact on previously stated
results. The impact on the current period is also immaterial.
The following new IFRSs and amendments to IFRSs, IASs and IFRIC interpretations have been issued but have not 
been early adopted by the Group.
•
IFRS 1 Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters (Issued 23 July 2009), (Effective January 2010).
•
IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share based Payment Transactions (Issued 18 June 2009), (Effective January 2010).
•
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Issued 12 November 2009), (Effective January 2013).
•
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (Issued 4 November 2009), (Effective Date January 2011).
•
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement (Issued 26 November 2009), (Effective January 2011).
•
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments (Issued 26 November 2009), (Effective July 2010).
The directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material
impact on the financial statements of the Group. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“I IF FR RS Ss s”) and the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting
under IFRSs. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Directors have considered current business conditions, financial forecasts including cash flows and sensitivities, internal
planning and control procedures and financial risks summarised above together with those identified in the Chief Executive’s
Review on pages 11 to 33. Whilst acknowledging each carries with it some uncertainty, the directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of Wellstream Holdings PLC
(the Company) and the enterprises under its control (its subsidiaries). Control is defined as the ability to govern the financial
and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. Adjustments are made, where necessary, to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with Group policies. All intra-Group
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Jointly controlled entities are those entities over which the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s proportionate share of the entities’ assets, liabilities, income and
expenses with items of similar nature on a line by line basis, from the date that joint control commences, until the date that
joint control ceases.
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of
the consideration given exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least
annually, with impairments being recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating
units for the purpose of impairment testing. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, being the date of transition to IFRSs, has been retained at the
previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are shown at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line
basis over its expected useful life as follows:
•
Leasehold improvements – between 15 and 30 years
•
Freehold buildings – 30 years
•
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 15 years 
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Property, plant and equipment are impaired if its recoverable amount falls below its carrying value. Impairment losses are
charged to the income statement immediately. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income
statement.
Assets under construction represent buildings and plant pending installation, and are stated at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Costs include construction and other directly attributable costs. No provision for depreciation is made until
such time when the assets are completed and ready for use.
WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
72/73
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their current location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the average cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and bank overdrafts, where there is right of offset. Bank overdrafts are
presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. Interest received is classified
within operating activities in the cash flow statement as it represents interest received on operational working capital.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before exchange gains / (losses) on financing, finance income and finance expenses.
Recognition of revenue and costs under construction contracts
The Group follows the generally accepted practice of accounting for construction contracts. Under this method, revenue 
and costs are recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by reference to the extent to which
obligations identified at the commencement of the contract are considered to have been met. These obligations may be
contractual or non-contractual. Variations in contract work and incentive payments are included to the extent that they 
have been formally agreed with the customer.
Profit is only recognised where the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated. Typically, for pipe manufacture 
contracts, this means that profit is recognised on a stage of completion basis. For installation contracts, profit is recognised
in accordance with the risk profile of the contract as assessed by management. The pattern of revenue recognition for
installation contracts will depend on individual contract circumstances and terms. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that contract costs incurred will be recovered. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period
in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected
loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Recognition of revenue other than under construction contracts
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
With the exception of goods sold under construction contracts, sales of goods are recognised when the risks and rewards
of ownership are transferred, which is typically when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is charged as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs which
are expected to generate probable future economic benefits are capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. All research expenditure, and any other development
expenditure, is charged to the income statement.
Borrowing costs
Eligible borrowing costs incurred in respect of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs.
Leasing
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account current and deferred taxation. The charge
is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is
recognised in equity.
The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.   
Deferred taxation is provided for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for eligible employees. The pension costs are charged to the profit 
and loss account as they become payable. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in
independently administered funds. The amount charged against profits represents the contributions payable to the 
schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Foreign currencies
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using their functional currency. The functional
currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.     
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at the market rates
ruling at the balance sheet date. Trading results are translated at the average rates for the period. Exchange differences
arising on the consolidation of the investment in overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, together with those on foreign
currency loans accounted for as net investment hedges, are taken to equity.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation
reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and are subsequently measured at the higher of:
•
the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent
Liabilities and Contingent Assets; and
•
the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the
revenue recognition policies set out above.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-
term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 74/75
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to
the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Where
appropriate, the Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency and interest rate swaps and caps, to
reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate movements. The Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative
or trading purposes. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Under IFRS derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the
balance sheet date. The Group has chosen not to use hedge accounting to date and therefore changes in the fair value 
of any derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Share based payments  
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity settled share options granted is recognised as an employee expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the date of grant and the charge is only amended if vesting does not take place due to non-
market conditions not being met. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is
expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of awards that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured
using the Black Scholes option pricing model.
With respect to share based payments, a deferred tax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The tax base is then
compared to the cumulative share based payment expense recognised in the income statement. Deferred tax arising on the
excess of the tax base over the cumulative share-based payment expense recognised in the income statement has been
recognised directly in equity outside the statement of comprehensive income as share based payments are considered to 
be transactions with shareholders. 
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its own financial
statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the share based payment charge
recognised in the consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
Key estimates and judgments in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Management considers the key estimates and judgments made in the financial statements to be as follows:
•
Recognition of revenue and costs under construction contracts
Revenue and costs under construction contracts are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity
at the balance sheet date, where the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably. Stage of completion is determined by
reference to the extent to which obligations identified at the commencement of the contract are considered to have been met.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it
is probable that contract costs incurred will be recovered.
The determination of whether the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, the stage of completion of contract activity
and the probability that contract costs incurred will be recovered can be inherently difficult to estimate and require management
judgement. The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of construction contracts are regularly reviewed in 
the light of the most current information available.
•
Share based payments
Share based payment charges are calculated based upon the fair value of equity settled options granted to employees of 
the Group. The fair value is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. These calculations require the use of
estimates (note 27).

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in
issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average
number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of the outstanding share options allocated under employee
share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price. It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are
converted at the beginning of the accounting period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings 
by the diluted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below:

of integrity management. Whilst the Group initially holds 25% of the share capital of RWR Systems Limited, the joint venture
agreement provides that its rights to control and to economic benefits are jointly shared with the other venturers. It therefore
consolidates 33% of the entity’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

£000 £000
Cost and net book value at 1 January and 31 December 39,107 39,107
Accumulated amortisation is £nil at 1 January and 31 December 2009.
Existing goodwill relates entirely to the initial purchase of the offshore business and has been allocated to that business,
which is considered to be a single cash generating unit. Upon further acquisitions goodwill acquired in a business will be
allocated to the cash generating units that expect to benefit from that business acquired.
The basis on which the recoverable amount has been determined is the value in use. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the following year’s operating budget approved by the directors and
preliminary forecasts for the two years thereafter.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10%. In determining the discount rate, management considered the
Group’s weighted average cost of capital and the Group’s incremental borrowing rates. The discount rate best reflects 
the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the cash generating units. Consideration
has also been given to other risks such as currency risk and country risk.
Discounted cash flow projections for the next three years exceed the carrying value of Goodwill and other non-current assets
and therefore no impairment of goodwill is evident as at 31 December 2009.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the assumptions would cause the carrying value of any
cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount, and therefore there are no key assumptions that require disclosure. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

23. PROVISIONS
During 2009 the Group undertook a restructuring exercise which gave rise to redundancy costs totalling £5,041,000 
(note 6). In accordance with IAS 37 a provision of £3,436,000 has been recognised at the balance sheet date which 
reflects management’s best estimate of the Group’s remaining liability in respect of these redundancy costs. All amounts 
are expected to be paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

Principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
Bank loan and overdraft
During the year the Group completed a refinancing of its bank loans with a £150,000,000 facility comprising of a £60,000,000
term loan and a £90,000,000 revolving credit facility. The term loan will fall in value by £5,000,000 at six monthly intervals from
30 June 2010 with a final repayment of £35,000,000 due on 31 December 2012. The revolving credit facility will remain at
£90,000,000 until repayment on 31 December 2012. Interest on drawn funds is charged at a margin of between 2.25% and
3.00% above LIBOR.
Bank borrowings are secured by fixed and floating charges over the net assets of Wellstream International Limited and a 
share pledge over that portion of Wellstream do Brasil Industria e Servicos Ltda that is not secured under the Rio State
Government Loan.
Rio State Government loan
This facility is provided by the State Government of Rio de Janeiro and has a maximum value of £26,785,000 (2008:
£22,488,000). The loan is drawn down progressively on a monthly basis. The value of the monthly draw down is calculated
as the lesser of 9% of gross monthly revenue or 70% of the ICMS tax payable on sales in the month.
Interest on the Rio State Government loan is charged at 6.0%. The average effective interest rate for the year was 6.0%.
Borrowings under the Rio State Government loan are secured by fixed and floating charges over certain items of plant and
equipment with a carrying value of £10,941,000 (2008: £9,372,000) and a bank guarantee to the value of £5,329,000.  NOTES TO

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists
of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 24, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders
of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes
in equity.
Financial risk management objectives
The Board monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. These risks include market risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk.
Where appropriate, the Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge
these risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is approved by the Finance Director and any such financial derivatives
are reported to the Board of Directors. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose its financial instruments to risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes the bulk of its business in Sterling or in the local currency of its overseas operations. Trade carried 
out in any other currency is by exception and as such any exposure to transactional currency risk can be easily identified. 
In such circumstances natural hedges are first sought and if significant residual exposure exists, it is hedged using derivative
financial instruments. There were no such contracts in existence at the year end.
The Group has considerably expanded its activities in Brazil during the current and prior years. With this expansion it has
developed a significant Brazilian Real denominated operating cost base, a potential exposure exists to the extent that local
currency sales fall below this level.
In addition to this, a further exposure exists within the Group due to US dollar and Euro denominated material costs; 
this exposure exists to the extent that these costs are not covered by corresponding revenues. In both 2008 and 2009, 
Euro denominated exposure was not significant.
Although the Group did not hold any financial instruments to hedge currency risk at the balance sheet date, the increased
activity in Brazil did necessitate the hedging of consequent currency exposures during the second half of 2009.
The Group has significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities by virtue of its overseas
operations. At the reporting date they were as follows:
Liabilities Assets
2009 2008 2009 2008
£000 £000 £000 £000

25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the Brazilian Real and US Dollar.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% (2008: 10%) increase in Sterling against the relevant foreign
currencies, being management’s reasonable assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity
analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period
end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
Where assets exceed liabilities in respect of monetary items denominated in a foreign currency, a 10% increase in Sterling
against that currency results in a reduction of profit and / or other equity. For a 10% weakening of Sterling against the
relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit and other equity, and the balances below 
would be negative.

Recognised in profit – – (386) (431)
Interest rate risk management and sensitivity analysis
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
At the period end fixed interest rate loans represented 19% (2008: 91%) of total borrowings.
The Group had no interest rate swaps at the year end.
If interest rates had been 0.5% (2008: 0.5%) higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for
the year ended 31 December 2009 would decrease/increase by £209,000 (2008: decrease / increase by £123,000). 0.5% is
management’s reasonable assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the
Group. The Group contracts all of its significant business in such a way that it receives regular stage payments from its
customers that are appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract. The payment profile is approved by senior
management in advance of accepting the contract and is monitored subsequent to acceptance at regular intervals. This
approach and the Group’s customer profile which consists largely of national and international oil companies with well
established and substantial credit histories, significantly mitigates the risk of financial loss from default.
At 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008 there were credit risks associated with the concentration of the offshore
business into a limited number of large contracts with a limited number of customers and counterparties. Information about
these major customers and their geographic profile is included in note 5. No significant unrecovered receivables have arisen
as a result of this risk.
At 31 December 2009 past due but not impaired receivables totalled £10,593,000 (2008: £42,606,000), of which
£9,995,000 has been received since the year end.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Trade and other
receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral obtained. NOTES TO

Shares of the Company became listed for the first time on admission to the London Stock Exchange on 1 May 2007. The
directors therefore do not consider the Company’s historic share price volatility to be a suitable basis on which to set an
expectation for the purpose of option valuations. Therefore the expected share price volatility was determined by reference 
to historic volatilities in the share prices of a selection of UK companies operating in the same industry as the Group.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate for
the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural conditions and forfeiture.
The risk free rate has been determined by reference to yields on UK government gilts. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

Performance bonds are entered into in the normal course of operations and require the Group to make payments to third
parties in the event that the Group does not satisfy its obligations under the terms of any related contracts.
At 31 December 2009 the Group had granted guarantees and performance bonds to third parties totalling £15,876,000
(2008: £17,475,000). Of this total £6,462,000 (2008: £9,580,000) is in respect of Seastream JV Australia Pty Limited, the
jointly controlled entity in which the group has a 50% holding.
The Group has put in place a joint and several guarantee of financial support, limited to the Group’s share of Seastream
JV Australia Pty Limited’s liabilities, should the jointly controlled entity find itself unable to pay liabilities as they fall due.
The Company is liable, jointly and severally with other members of the Group under guarantees given to the Group’s bankers
in respect of overdrawn balances on certain Group bank accounts and in respect of other overdrafts, loans and guarantees

GENERAL MEETING WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 
NOTICE OF AGM
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Dear Shareholder
2010 Annual General Meeting
It is my great pleasure to be writing to you enclosing the Notice convening the AGM of the Company, to be held at 11am 
on Wednesday, 12 May 2010 at Credit Suisse, 2nd Floor, 45 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5JG. The formal Notice which details
the business to be considered at the meeting is set out on pages 104 to 108 of this document. The purpose of this letter is
to explain certain elements of that business to you. A summary of the action to be taken by shareholders is set out at the
end of this letter, on page 103.
Business to be considered at the AGM
This year, as well as the standard matters usually dealt with at an annual general meeting (“AGM”), there are six additional
items of business (Resolutions 9 to 14). Under the Company’s Articles of Association, at each AGM of the Company one
third of the directors retire by rotation. This year the AGM will include motions to re-elect individually Sir Graham Hearne 
CBE, Mr Francisco Gros and Mr Pat Murray and to elect Mr Alasdair MacDonald who was appointed to the board on 
21 September 2009. Short biographical details of each director appear on pages 38 and 39 of the Annual Report. Having
considered the performance of, and contribution made by, each of the directors, the board remains satisfied that the
performance of each director continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to the role and, as such,
recommends their re-election.
The six additional items of business for consideration at the AGM, of which resolutions 10, 11, 12 and 13 will be proposed 
as special resolutions, are explained in this letter below. Explanatory notes on all the business to be considered at this year’s
AGM appear on pages 109 to 115.
Resolution 9 – Directors’ power to allot shares
Paragraph (A) of this resolution would give the directors the authority to allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal
amount equal to £332,666.74 (representing 33,266,674 ordinary shares of £0.01 each). This amount represents
approximately one-third of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 29 March 2010.
In line with recent guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers (the “ABI”), paragraph (B) of this resolution would
give the directors authority to allot ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders up to
an aggregate nominal amount equal to £665,333.48 (representing 66,533,348 ordinary shares), as reduced by the nominal
amount of any shares issued under paragraph (A) of this resolution. This amount (before any reduction) represents
approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 29 March 2010. If this authority is
exercised, the directors intend to follow ABI guidance issued from time to time (including as to the re-election of directors).
The authorities sought under paragraphs (A) and (B) of this resolution will expire at the earlier of 30 June 2011 (the last date
by which the Company must hold an AGM in 2011) and the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2011.
The directors have no present intention to exercise either of the authorities sought under this resolution.
As at the date of the Notice, no ordinary shares are held by the Company in treasury.
Resolution 10 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights
This resolution will be proposed as a special resolution, which requires a 75% majority of the votes to be cast in favour. 
It would give the directors the authority to allot ordinary shares (or sell any ordinary shares which the Company elects to 
hold in treasury) for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
This authority would be limited to allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other
equity securities if required by the rights of those shares or as the board otherwise considers necessary, or otherwise up to
an aggregate nominal amount of £49,900.01 (representing 4,990,001 ordinary shares). This aggregate nominal amount
represents approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 29 March 2010. In respect of this
aggregate nominal amount, the directors confirm their intention to follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption Company’s
Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three year period where the Principles
provide that usage in excess of 7.5% should not take place without prior consultation with shareholders.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL 
GENERAL MEETING
Allotments made under the authorisation in paragraph (B) of resolution 10 would be limited to allotments by way of a rights
issue only (subject to the right of the board to impose necessary or appropriate limitations to deal with, for example,
fractional entitlements and regulatory matters).
The authority will expire at the earlier of 30 June 2011 (the last date by which the Company must hold an AGM in 2011) 
and the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2011. 
Resolution 11 – Power to purchase shares
Resolution 11 will be proposed to enable the Company to purchase in the market up to a maximum of 9,980,002 ordinary
shares (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital on 29 March 2010) for
cancellation at a minimum price of £0.01 per share and a maximum price of not more than 5 per cent above the average of
the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from The London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five
business days immediately preceding the day on which that ordinary share is purchased. 
The authority will expire at the earlier of 30 June 2011 (the last date by which the Company must hold an AGM in 2011) 
and the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2011.
The directors would not expect to purchase ordinary shares in the market unless, in the light of market conditions prevailing
at the time, they considered that to do so would enhance earnings per share and would be in the best interests of
shareholders generally. Further, the directors expect that if any ordinary shares were to be purchased, such shares would be
cancelled. Any purchases made by the Company will be announced no later than 7.30am on the business day following the
transaction.
Resolution 12 – Amending Articles of Association
It is proposed in resolution 12 to adopt new Articles of Association (the “New Articles”) in order to update the Company’s
current Articles of Association primarily to take account of the coming into force of the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations, 
the implementation of the last parts of the Companies Act 2006 and amendments to the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001.
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised in the explanatory notes. Other changes, which 
are minor, technical or clarifying in nature and also some more minor changes which merely reflect changes made by the
Companies Act 2006, the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations and the Uncertificated Securities Regulations have not 
been noted.
It is proposed that the New Articles will take effect immediately following the conclusion of the AGM.
Resolution 13 – Notice of general meetings
This resolution is required to reflect the implementation in August 2009 of the Shareholder Rights Directive. The regulation
implementing the Shareholder Rights Directive has increased the notice period for general meetings of the Company to 
21 days. The Company is currently able to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice and would like
to preserve this ability. In order to be able to do so, shareholders must have approved the calling of meetings on 14 days’
notice. Resolution 13 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, when it is intended
that a similar resolution will be proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic voting under
the Shareholder Rights Directive before it can call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice.
Resolution 14 – Share Incentive Plan
It is proposed in resolution 14 to approve the new Wellstream Holdings PLC Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) in order to provide
employees with an opportunity to invest in the Company and align their interests with those of shareholders. The SIP allows
for free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and dividend shares to be offered to employees. The Board decides
which type(s) of share award will actually be offered to employees. 
The principal provisions of the SIP are summarised in the Appendix to the Notice of AGM dated 31 March 2010. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006
to publish on a website.
13. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may
do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). CREST
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a service
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate
action on their behalf.
14. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland
Limited’s specifications, and must contain the information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST
Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment 
of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA 19) not later than 48 hours before the time for holding the
meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to
the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry 
to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
15. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should note that Euroclear
UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system
timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of
the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member,
or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular
time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system
and timings.
16. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

NOTICE OF AGM
EXPLANATORY NOTES ABOUT THE RESOLUTIONS TO BE PROPOSED AT THE AGM
RESOLUTION 1
Annual Accounts and Reports for 2009 
The Directors will present to Shareholders at the AGM the Company’s annual accounts for the financial year ended
31 December 2009, together with the Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Auditors’ Report on
those accounts and on the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
RESOLUTION 2
Re-appointment of the Auditors 
The Directors are proposing the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditors to the Company and, following standard
practice, seek authority to determine the Auditors’ remuneration.
RESOLUTIONS 3, 4 AND 5
Re-election of Directors Retiring by Rotation
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, one third of the directors must retire at each AGM, selected according to their
length of service and elapsed time since their last re-election. Sir Graham Hearne, Francisco Gros and Pat Murray are each
required to stand for re-election. The Board believes that each of them should be re-elected, subject to Shareholder
approval, because they have each continued to be effective members of the Board and demonstrate commitment to their
respective roles.
RESOLUTION 6
Election of Directors 
The Board proposes a motion to elect Mr. Alasdair MacDonald who was appointed to the Board on
21 September 2009. 
RESOLUTION 7
Remuneration Report 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require listed companies to present the Directors’ Remuneration
Report for shareholder approval at each AGM. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 53 to 63 of the
Company’s Annual Report enclosed with this notice. The Remuneration Committee, which assisted the directors in the
preparation of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, has unanimously approved the report and the directors have also
unanimously approved the report. 
RESOLUTION 8
Dividend 
The Board proposes to declare a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2009 of 6p per ordinary share payable to
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 21 May 2010.
RESOLUTION 9
Authority to Allot Shares 
This resolution is to renew, for a further year, the general authority to allot shares given to the Board at the last AGM of 
the Company. The resolution will give the Board a general authority to allot up to 33,266,674 ordinary shares of 1p each
representing approximately 33.3% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 29 March 2010 which is the latest
practicable date before publication of this notice. The resolution will also give the Board authority to allot up to an additional
33,266,674 ordinary shares of 1p each representing approximately 33.3% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
as at 29 March 2010, which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice, provided certain conditions apply,
including that the additional authority only applies to fully pre-emptive rights issues. The Company did not hold any of its 
own shares as treasury shares as at 29 March 2010 which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. 
The directors have no present intention to use this authority, which will expire at the end of the next AGM of the Company
held after the passing of this resolution or close of business on 30 June 2011 whichever is earlier. As is normal practice, the
directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent AGMs. 110/111
NOTICE OF ANNUAL 
GENERAL MEETING
RESOLUTION 10
Disapplication of Statutory Pre-emption Rights 
The Companies Act 2006 requires that, subject to certain exceptions, before directors of a company can issue any new
shares for cash, the new shares must first be offered to existing shareholders proportionately to their existing shareholdings.
However, it may sometimes be in the interests of the Company for the directors to allot shares other than to existing
shareholders in their existing shareholdings.
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003 permits the Company to purchase its own
shares and, rather than cancel those shares, to hold them as treasury shares, in which case they would carry no voting
rights and no entitlement to any dividend for as long as they are held as treasury shares. The treasury shares may be sold for
cash, transferred for the purposes of employee share schemes, or cancelled. 
This resolution would allow the directors to allot shares for cash or sell treasury shares for cash to an aggregate maximum of
4,990,001 ordinary shares of 1p each, representing approximately 5% of the number of issued ordinary shares in the capital
of the Company as at 29 March 2010 which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice.
The Company did not hold any of its own shares as treasury shares as at 29 March 2010 which is the latest practicable date
before publication of this notice. The authority provided by this resolution would permit the directors to sell any such shares
held as treasury shares for cash without first offering them pro rata to existing shareholders. 
The authority the directors are seeking will expire at the next AGM of the Company held after the passing of this resolution or
close of business on 30 June 2011, whichever is earlier. They intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent AGMs.
The directors are not currently contemplating any issue of new shares.
RESOLUTION 11
Authorising Market Purchase of its Own Shares by the Company 
The Company is seeking a general authority to make market purchases of its own shares in a certain price range. This does
not mean that the Company will buy its own shares at any particular price or indeed at all. The directors are not currently
intending to use this authority but wish to retain the flexibility to do so in the future. If the Company were to use this authority,
it would only buy shares on the London Stock Exchange and the Board would only use the power to buy shares after
considering the effect on earnings per share and the benefits for longer-term shareholders.
The Company intends that any shares purchased would either be cancelled or would be held by the Company as treasury
shares, in which case they would carry no voting rights and no entitlement to receive any dividend for as long as they are
held as treasury shares.
The authority would expire at the end of the next AGM of the Company held after the passing of this resolution or close of
business on 30 June 2011, whichever is earlier. The directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent AGMs. 
The maximum number of shares the Company can buy is 9,980,002 ordinary shares in total (representing approximately
10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 29 March 2010 which is the latest practicable date before
publication of this notice). The minimum price that can be paid for an ordinary share is 1p being the nominal value of an
ordinary share. The maximum price that can be paid for an ordinary share is 5% over the average of the middle market
prices for an ordinary share, derived from the Daily Official List of The London Stock Exchange, for the five business days
immediately before the day on which the share is contracted to be purchased.
RESOLUTION 12
Changes to the Company Articles
1. The Company’s objects
The provisions regulating the operations of the Company are currently set out in the Company’s Memorandum of
Association and Articles of Association. The Company’s Memorandum of Association contains, among other things,
the objects clause which sets out the scope of the activities the Company is authorised to undertake. This is drafted
to give a wide scope.
The Companies Act 2006 significantly reduces the constitutional significance of a company’s memorandum of
association. The Companies Act 2006 provides that a memorandum will record only the names of the subscribers
and the number of shares each subscriber has agreed to take in the company. Under the Companies Act 2006 the
objects clause and all other provisions which are contained in a company’s memorandum of association, for existing
companies at 1 October 2009, are deemed to be contained in the company’s articles of association but the company
can remove these provisions by special resolution. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 
NOTICE OF AGM
Further, the Companies Act 2006 states that unless a company’s articles provide otherwise, a company’s objects 
are unrestricted. This abolishes the need for companies to have objects clauses. For this reason the Company is
proposing to remove its objects clause together with all other provisions of its Memorandum of Association which, 
by virtue of the Companies Act 2006, are to be treated as forming part of the Company’s Articles of Association as 
of 1 October 2009. Resolution 12(a) confirms the removal of these provisions for the Company. As the effect of this
resolution will be to remove the statement currently in the Company’s Memorandum of Association regarding limited
liability, the New Articles also contain an express statement regarding the limited liability of Shareholders.
2. Authorised share capital and unissued shares
The Companies Act 2006 abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and the 
New Articles reflect this. Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any time allot because
allotment authority continues to be required under the Companies Act 2006, save in respect of employee 
share schemes.
3. Allotment authority and disapplication of pre-emptive rights
Under the Companies Act 1985, it was common practice to include in the articles of association an authority for
directors to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights. However, investor protection committees support annual
renewal of such authorities by shareholder resolution, notwithstanding a company having such provisions in its
articles. Given that the Company proposes to remove other enabling provisions no longer required to be in the 
articles under the Companies Act 2006, the Company would like to simplify its articles by removing these authorities. 
This means that in the future the Company will be relying on the resolutions passed at its AGM to allot shares and
disapply pre-emption rights.
4. Directors’ fees
Guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, the UK’s leading financial services trade association, states
that articles of association should contain a monetary cap on the amount of aggregate fees payable to directors. 
In accordance with this guidance the Company’s existing articles of association contain a cap of £500,000. It is
proposed at the 2010 AGM that the cap on the amount of directors’ fees be increased to £750,000. This is intended
partly to increase the headroom which the Company has in order to give it more flexibility should it be required to
increase the number of directors to the Board.
5. Redeemable shares
Under the Companies Act 1985, if a company wished to issue redeemable shares, it had to include in its articles of
association the terms and manner of redemption. The Companies Act 2006 enables directors to determine such
matters instead provided they are so authorised by the articles. The New Articles contain such an authorisation. 
The Company has no plans to issue redeemable shares but if it did so the directors would need shareholders’
authority to issue new shares in the usual way.
6. Authority to purchase own shares, consolidate and sub-divide shares, and reduce share capital
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required specific enabling provisions in its articles to purchase its own
shares, to consolidate or sub-divide its shares and to reduce its share capital or other undistributable reserves as well
as shareholder authority to undertake the relevant action. The current Articles of Association include these enabling
provisions. Under the Companies Act 2006, a company will only require shareholder authority to do any of these
things and it will no longer be necessary for articles to contain enabling provisions. Accordingly the relevant enabling
provisions have been removed in the New Articles.
7. Use of seals
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required authority in its articles of association to have an official seal for
use abroad. Under the Companies Act 2006, such authority will no longer be required. Accordingly, the relevant
authorisation has been removed in the new Articles.
8. Suspension of registration of share transfers
The current Articles of Association permit the directors to suspend the registration of transfers. Under the Companies
Act 2006 share transfers must be registered as soon as practicable. The power in the current Articles of Association
to suspend the registration of transfers is inconsistent with this requirement. Accordingly, this power has been
removed in the New Articles. 112/113
NOTICE OF ANNUAL 
GENERAL MEETING
9. Voting by proxies on a show of hand
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations have amended the Companies Act 2006 so that it now provides that each
proxy appointed by a member has one vote on a show of hands unless the proxy is appointed by more than one
member in which case the proxy has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been instructed by one or
more members to vote for the resolution and by one or more members to vote against the resolution. The current
Articles of Association have been amended to reflect these changes.
10. Voting by corporate representatives
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations have amended the Companies Act 2006 in order to enable multiple
representatives appointed by the same corporate member to vote in different ways on a show of hands and a poll.
The New Articles contain provisions which reflect these amendments.
11. Chairman’s casting vote
Traded companies should no longer allow the Chairman a casting vote at meetings where there is an equality of votes
on an ordinary resolution.
12. Adjournments for lack of quorum
Under the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations, general meetings adjourned
for lack of quorum must be held at least 10 clear days after the original meeting. The current Articles of Association
have been changed to clarify the fact that this requirement refers to clear days.
13. Voting record date
Under the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations the Company must determine
the right of members to vote at a general meeting by reference to the register not more than 48 hours before the time
for the holding of the meeting, not taking account of days which are not working days. The current Articles of
Association have been amended to reflect this requirement excluding non-working days.
14. Special Business
Under the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations, a company is required to state
the general nature of all business to be dealt with at a meeting. The New Articles remove provisions relating to
Special Business in order to reflect this.
15. General
Generally, the opportunity has been taken to update references, cross-references and language to bring the Articles
of Association in line with the provisions under the Companies Act 2006, including those implemented by the
Shareholders’ Rights Regulations.
RESOLUTION 13
Notice of General Meetings
This resolution is required to reflect the implementation in August 2009 of the Shareholder Rights Directive. The regulation
implementing the Shareholder Rights Directive has increased the notice period for general meetings of the Company to 
21 days. The Company is currently able to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice and would like
to preserve this ability. In order to be able to do so, shareholders must have approved the calling of meetings on 14 days’
notice. Resolution 13 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, when it is intended
that a similar resolution will be proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic voting under
the Shareholder Rights Directive before it can call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice.
RESOLUTION 14
This resolution is to approve the new Wellstream Holdings PLC Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) in order to provide employees
with an opportunity to invest in the Company and align their interests with those of shareholders. The SIP is an all-employee
share plan which is designed to be approved by HM Revenue & Customs. It allows for free shares, partnership shares,
matching shares and dividend shares to be offered to employees. The Board decides which type(s) of share award will
actually be offered to employees.  APPENDIX
WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 
NOTICE OF AGM
INTRODUCTION
The SIP is an all-employee share plan which is designed to be approved by HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”). 
Set out below is a summary of its main features:
OUTLINE
The SIP is intended to be flexible and the Company may offer any combination of the features outlined below to allow eligible
employees to obtain ordinary shares in the Company. Under the SIP , the Company can:
(a) give up to £3,000 worth of free shares a year to an employee (“Free Shares”);
(b) offer an employee the opportunity of buying up to £1,500 of shares a year (“Partnership Shares”) out of pre-tax salary;
(c) give an employee up to two free matching shares for each Partnership Share bought (“Matching Shares”); and
(d) in addition to buying up to £1,500 of Partnership Shares each year, allow employees to purchase more shares using
dividends received on Free Shares, Partnership Shares and Matching Shares (“Dividend Shares”). Employees may
buy up to £1,500 of Dividend Shares annually.
Any award under the SIP is not pensionable, although the salary used to purchase Partnership Shares will be.  
ELIGIBILITY
Each time that the Board (or a duly authorised committee thereof) decides to operate the SIP , all UK resident tax-paying
employees of the Company and its participating subsidiaries must be offered the opportunity to participate. The Board can
require employees to have completed a minimum qualifying period of employment before they can participate, but that
period must not exceed eighteen months. Other employees may be permitted to participate at the Board’s discretion.
FREE SHARES
Up to £3,000 worth of Free Shares can be awarded to each employee in a tax year. Free Shares must be awarded on 
similar terms, so that the number awarded to each employee is determined by standard criteria such as remuneration, 
length of service and number of hours worked. The award of Free Shares can, if the Company so chooses, be subject to 
the satisfaction of a pre-award performance target which measures the objective success of the individual, team, division 
or business.
There is a holding period of between three and five years (the precise duration to be determined by the Board) during which
the employee cannot withdraw the Free Shares from the SIP unless the employee leaves employment.
The Board can, at its discretion, provide that the Free Shares will be forfeit if the employee leaves employment other than in
the circumstances of injury, disability, redundancy, transfer of the employing business or company, on reaching retirement
age or on death. Forfeiture can only take place within three years of the Free Shares being awarded. 
PARTNERSHIP SHARES
The Board may allow an employee to use pre-tax salary to buy Partnership Shares. The maximum limit is the lower of £1,500
or 10 per cent of salary in any tax year. The salary allocated to Partnership Shares can be accumulated for a period up to 
12 months (“Accumulation Period”) or Partnership Shares can be purchased monthly out of deductions from the
employee’s pay. In either case, Partnership Shares must be bought within 30 days of, as appropriate, the end of the
Accumulation Period or the deduction from pay. An employee may stop and start deductions at any time. Once acquired,
Partnership Shares may be withdrawn from the SIP by the employee at any time and will not be capable of forfeiture.
MATCHING SHARES
The Board may offer Matching Shares free to an employee who has purchased Partnership Shares. If awarded, Matching
Shares must be awarded on the same basis to all employees up to a maximum of two Matching Shares for every
Partnership Share purchased. 
There is a holding period of between three and five years during which the employee cannot withdraw the Matching Shares
from the SIP unless the employee leaves employment.
The Board can, at its discretion, provide that the Matching Shares will be forfeit if the employee leaves employment other
than in the circumstances of injury, disability, redundancy, transfer of the employing business or company, on reaching
retirement age or on death or if the associated Partnership Shares are withdrawn by the employee. Forfeiture can only take
place within three years of the Matching Shares being awarded.  INVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS
The Board may allow an employee to reinvest dividends in up to £1,500 of Shares each tax year. Dividend Shares must be
held in the SIP for three years, unless the employee leaves employment. Once acquired, Dividend Shares are not capable 
of forfeiture.
PLAN TRUST
The SIP is operated through a UK resident trust (“SIP Trust”). The SIP Trust purchases or subscribes for shares that are
subsequently awarded to employees. The money to buy shares will be provided either by the Company or, if employees
are allowed to acquire Partnership Shares, by the employees.
LIMITS 
The rules of the SIP provide that, in any period of ten years, not more than 10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary
share capital may be issued under the SIP and under any other employees’ share scheme operated by the Company.
AMENDMENTS
The Board may at any time amend the SIP . However, the prior approval of the Company in general meeting must be
obtained in the case of any amendment to the advantage of participants which is made to the provisions relating to eligibility,
individual or overall limits or the basis for determining an employee’s entitlement or the provisions affecting variations of share
capital, except for any minor amendment to benefit the administration of the SIP , to take account of any change in
legislation, or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or the Company.
In addition, any change to the key features of the SIP (being provisions necessary to meet the requirements of the relevant
tax legislation) requires the prior approval of HMRC.

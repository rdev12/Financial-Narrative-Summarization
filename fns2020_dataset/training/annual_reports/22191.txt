SIX KEY STRENGTHS THAT
UNDERPIN OUR CONSISTENT
GROWTH
Cattles has successfully delivered profitable
growth and maintained stable credit
quality, over many years. We believe 
there are six key factors which have
enabled us to achieve this consistently:
COMMITMENT TO THE 
NON-STANDARD CONSUMER
FINANCE MARKET 
We’re specialists. We are focused on the
non-standard consumer finance market,
and remain totally committed to it.
Because we know it so well, we’re able 
to adapt to its changing dynamics, develop
the right products, invest in appropriate
resources and systems – and manage the
associated risks. 
ROBUST UNDERWRITING 
We’ve evolved our underwriting 
processes over many years to ensure that
our acceptance of credit risk is carefully
controlled. In our lending businesses, 
our underwriting methodologies draw 
on our deep understanding and experience
of non-standard finance markets. We
ensure consistent credit quality in our
direct repayment loans by managing our
underwriting and credit scoring processes
centrally and by rigorously verifying 
the information applicants give us. By
understanding customers’ outgoings and
commitments, we can be more confident 
of their ability to repay their loans and
therefore our ability to lend responsibly.
BEING CLOSE TO OUR CUSTOMERS
We want to know and understand our
customers personally. The accessibility of
local staff in our consumer credit branches
around the country is key to keeping close
to our customers. We see our local branch
presence as a significant strength, and 
have made it a central part of the way we
manage both customer relationships and
risk. This makes it easier for customers to
let us know if their circumstances change,
so that we can provide timely support
– a major factor in managing arrears.
MOTIVATED, WELL TRAINED PEOPLE
We are committed to training and
developing our people and we have
consistently benefited from ongoing
investments in our culture and values
programmes. The skills and experience 
of our employees enables us to manage
risk and customer relationships
successfully, and to provide excellent
service. Our consumer credit businesses
are accredited to the Investors in People
standard and our employee feedback
reflects high levels of job satisfaction 
and pride in the company. 
INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS AND
PROCESSES
Information technology is core to our
business and we continue to make
significant investment in systems and
processes to further improve our customer
relationship management. This helps us
recruit, underwrite and select customers,
by more closely matching their evolving
credit status and needs to our existing
product range. 
RISK.MANAGED.
We have developed our risk management
framework, policies and practices over
time to meet both the demands of our
markets and the requirements of our
regulators. Effective management of risk is
well embedded throughout our businesses.
The care we take has helped us to deliver
consistent performance and ensure stable
credit quality over many years.

Risk.Managed.
Operating in the non-standard
consumer ﬁnance market is not for
the inexperienced. The opportunities
are considerable. But so are the risks,
if you misjudge or mismanage them.
Over many years we’ve been 
building a unique understanding 
of this market. And a thorough,
methodical approach that we 
call ‘Risk.Managed.’ This is not
particularly complex, or high-tech. 
It simply requires unrelenting
awareness and control of risk, in
everything we do. Easy to prescribe,
rather harder to deliver. But we’ve
proved it delivers consistent,
sustainable results. 
It’s helped many thousands of 
people to build or repair their 
credit histories, enabled hundreds 
of companies to grow, and increased
earnings consistently for many years. 
Risk.Managed. For us, it’s a 
way of life.

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
NORMAN BROADHURST
Chairman
PERFORMANCE
It gives me great pleasure, in my ﬁrst year 
as Chairman, to report another strong
performance by the group in 2006. Proﬁt
before tax increased by 14.9% to £132.2
million and earnings per share increased 
by 14.0% to 28.01p. 
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending an increased
ﬁnal dividend of 11.85p per share, payable
on 15 May 2007, compared to 10.65p paid
last year. This, together with the interim
dividend of 5.65p per share, gives a total
dividend for the year of 17.50p, an increase
of 11.5% over the previous year. 
As an alternative to receiving the cash
dividend, shareholders in the United
Kingdom, excluding the Channel Islands,
will again be offered the opportunity to
have their dividends re-invested in the
company’s shares through participation 
in our Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
SHARE PLACING
The group’s strategy continues to be 
focused on controlled growth and careful
management of credit quality in the 
non-standard consumer ﬁnance market. 
The group’s signiﬁcant investment in
bespoke customer selection technology,
together with close customer relationship
management delivered through our national
network of local branches, has enabled
Cattles to deliver double digit proﬁt and
earnings per share growth over many years,
while at the same time maintaining stable
credit quality.
The Board has assessed carefully the group’s
future ﬁnancing requirements in light of
expected continuing strong growth over the
medium-term, and has concluded that the
company should seek to raise additional
equity capital ﬁnance through an underwritten
share placing of 32,978,986 ordinary shares
of the company. The net proceeds will be
used to ﬁnance future organic growth and to
reﬁnance debt portfolios purchased during
the second half of 2006.
The Board expects that the placing will be
earnings enhancing from the current ﬁnancial
year onwards. This statement should not 
be interpreted to mean that future earnings
per share will necessarily be higher than
historical earnings per share. Further details
of the placing, which will be undertaken 
by Citigroup Global Markets U.K. Equity
Limited and HSBC Bank plc, are set 
out in a separate announcement.
ACQUISITIONS
During the year, a number of acquisition
opportunities arose for the group,
particularly for our debt recovery 
division, The Lewis Group.
In July 2006, The Lewis Group purchased
an unsecured debt portfolio of £52.2 million
from a third party credit provider for 
£8.0 million and, in December 2006,
acquired and committed to acquire further
debt portfolios from a UK credit card
provider for a total investment over three
years of around £65 million. 
Following publication on 30 January 2007
of London Scottish Bank plc’s preliminary
results for the year ended 31 October 2006,
and the completion of due diligence, Cattles
announced on 22 February 2007 its
withdrawal from discussions concerning a
possible offer for that company. The Board
of Cattles concluded that it was not in the
best interests of its shareholders for it to
continue those discussions and related legal
and due diligence fees of £1.2 million have
been charged in the year.
REGULATION
This Annual Report and Financial
Statements includes an Operating and
Financial Review on pages 9 to 34 which
meets current best practice guidelines of the
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Reporting
Standard: Operating and Financial Review’. 
The sale and distribution of the group’s
mortgages and insurance products are
regulated by the Financial Services Authority
(FSA). All relevant customer facing
employees of the group’s consumer credit
division, Welcome Financial Services,
undertake prescribed training and
accreditation to ensure that the required
standards of customer care and compliance
are maintained. Cattles fully embraces the
FSA ’s principles of Treating Customers Fairly.
The Competition Commission Final
Remedies paper on its inquiry into the 
home collected credit market was issued in
November 2006. The Commission regards
data sharing and greater comparability and
transparency of the terms of trade of home
collected credit providers to be important 
in providing a more competitive market. 
We support the Commission’s ﬁndings and
its proposed remedies. Implementation of
these will not have a material impact on 
the group’s results. Our continued success depends on the
commitment and energy of our people.
We continue to invest in the training 
and development of our staff.
The Office of Fair Trading has completed 
its Market Study into the sale of Payment
Protection Insurance (PPI) and referred it 
to the Competition Commission in February
2007. The resulting inquiry is required to
report within a two-year statutory period.
The sale of PPI has been regulated by the
FSA since 14 January 2005, and continues
to contribute around 11% of the group’s
annual revenues. 
The Consumer Credit Amendment Bill,
amending the 1974 Consumer Credit Act,
received ﬁnal enactment in April 2006. 
We continue to be engaged with government
and legislators in the debate on better and
less regulation. As a responsible lender,
Cattles fully supports the positive actions
being taken to strengthen existing 
legislation and regulation in the 
consumer ﬁnance market.
PEOPLE
The continued success of the group depends
very much on the commitment and energy
of our people. We continue to invest in the
training and personal development of our
staff so as to build on the group’s strong
performance culture. I am particularly
pleased that our employees’ satisfaction 
and pride in working for the group
continues to rise. On behalf of the Board, 
I thank them all for their support and
important contribution in delivering 
another successful year.
OUTLOOK
I am very pleased with the group’s
performance in 2006. The Board remains
focused on our strategy of delivering
controlled growth while maintaining stable
credit quality in the non-standard consumer
ﬁnance market. I ﬁrmly believe the group
continues to have signiﬁcant opportunities
in its chosen markets. The group has made a
good start to the year and we look forward
to making further progress in 2007.

Annual Report and

a strong set of results in 2006, with 
group proﬁt before tax for the year
increasing by 14.9% to £132.2 million
(2005: £115.1 million). 
This excellent performance continues 
the group’s record of double digit growth 
in both proﬁts and earnings per share, 
while at the same time maintaining stable
credit quality, customers’ arrears and 
bad debts. It also reﬂects the group’s long
standing commitment to, and many years’ 
experience in, the non-standard consumer
ﬁnance market.
Proﬁt before tax for the consumer credit
division has again increased signiﬁcantly
during the year by 15.5% to £136.1 million
(2005: £117.9 million). This success has
been achieved through a combination of
controlled volume and receivables growth
and careful management of credit quality.

DIRECT REPAYMENT AVERAGE 
ADVANCE (£000)
2005
2006
It is particularly pleasing that the division
has generated strong growth in its direct
repayment customer numbers during the
year, which have increased by 51,000 to
409,000 customers at 31 December 2006.
This represents signiﬁcant growth of 14.2%
in direct repayment customer numbers
during 2006, compared with 6.2% in 
the previous year. See Fig 1.
The number of new agreements written
during 2006 increased by 32,000 to
143,000 (2005: 111,000). The division 
also achieved a substantial reduction in 
the number of customers settling their
agreements early during the year, which 
fell by 10,000 to 35,000 customers (2005:
45,000), reducing the direct repayment 
early settlement ratio to 10% (2005: 13%).
Direct repayment loan volumes showed
strong growth in 2006, particularly during
the second half, increasing by 20.2% in the
year overall to £988 million (2005: £822
million). Direct repayment revenue increased
by 9.2% during the year to £506 million
(2005: £463 million). Following strong
growth in volumes and receivables during
2006, and as revenue is spread over the life
of a loan, the division is well placed to meet
its future revenue targets. 
The division’s overall average advance to
new direct repayment customers during 
the year increased by £500 to £3,800. 
Small unsecured personal loans increased to
around £1,900 (2005: £1,500), with secured
loans reducing slightly to around £8,700
(2005: £9,000). See Fig 2.
Hire purchase loans for second-hand cars
increased to around £6,200 (2005: £4,800),
reﬂecting continuing improvement in the
quality of vehicles ﬁnanced, particularly
those introduced by our own Welcome Car
Finance business and certain larger national
car retailers who have become part of 
the division’s distribution network. 
Direct repayment loans and receivables, 
after allowance for loan loss provisions,
increased by £381 million to £1.8 billion
(2005: £1.4 billion), an increase of 26.5%.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in
customers’ average outstanding balances
during the year, which remained at 
around £5,200 at 31 December 2006.
Deep understanding and experience 
of non-standard ﬁnance markets and
management of risk and operational 
control over underwriting and regulated
activities remains a primary focus of the
consumer credit division. The selection and
underwriting of prospective new customers
at the division’s central processing units
(CPUs) in Nottingham and Hull, supported
by continuing investment in people and
systems together with our local branch
network, have again enabled us to 
maintain stable credit quality.
In a period when many lenders announced
that they were experiencing higher loan
losses, the direct repayment loan loss ratio
improved to 7.4% (2005: 8.9%) of closing
net receivables. This continuing success
reﬂects the group’s signiﬁcant investment 
in customer selection processes over several
years and the continuing close customer
relationships maintained by our local 
branch staff.
Once a direct repayment loan has been
advanced by the CPU, most customers 
are contacted by a local Customer Account
Manager from their nearest branch, to begin
establishing a close working relationship.
Maintaining these relationships is a key part
of our arrears management strategy and is
the major role of our branch staff. 
At 31 December 2006, arrears levels were
7.4% (2005: 7.6%) of direct repayment
loans and receivables, slightly below our
long established target range of 8-10%. 
The division consistently operated within
this range until 2004, when the introduction
of improved credit scorecards, together 
with enhancements to our customer
selection technology and arrears
management techniques, brought arrears
below the target range. As previously
reported, we expect arrears to gradually
return to within the division’s target range.
CONSUMER CREDIT DIVISION
STRATEGY
Focus on the proﬁtable expansion of our 
consumer credit activities, underpinned by 
a policy of responsible and compliant lending 
while maintaining stable credit quality.
• Increase customer origination and retention
• Maintain rigorous credit quality
• Enhance customer relationship management
• Maximise efficiency
HIGHLIGHTS
• Proﬁt before tax up 15.5% to £136.1 million
Direct Repayment
• Volumes up 20.2% to £988 million
• Revenue up 9.2% at £506 million
• Customers increased by 51,000 to 409,000
• Loan book up 26.5% to over £1.8 billion
• Arrears stable at 7.4% (2005: 7.6%)
• Loan loss ratio reduced to 7.4% (2005: 8.9%)
• New Phoenix IT customer relationship 
management system launched 10
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006
In this environment, interest rates available
to higher credit quality customers with
equity in their properties have fallen and
commissions payable to brokers for
introducing such business has increased.
Whereas we maintained our strategy of 
not offering large balance, low rate second
mortgage products, which do not meet 
our risk proﬁle. Competitive pressures 
eased in the second half of 2006, as a
consequence, our secured lending volumes,
which at June 2006 were down 19.3% on
2005, ﬁnished the year only 2.1% down 
at £338 million (2005: £345 million). 
See Fig 5.
Progress continues to be made in our
partnership with Alliance & Leicester,
under which we manage applications for
their secured personal loan product, with
the option for Welcome to underwrite
applications that do not meet Alliance &
Leicester’s own lending criteria. Sales so far
have been small as Alliance & Leicester
gains experience in marketing this product
and we reﬁne the sales fulﬁlment processes. 
A number of enhancements are planned
during 2007, to build on current
performance.
Although the division does not offer 
ﬁrst mortgage loan products, Welcome
Mortgages introduces existing customers
requiring such products to third party
lenders, on a commission basis. New
business placed by Welcome Mortgages 
in 2006 amounted to approximately 
£100 million.
Home collected credit
Our disengagement from uneconomic
sectors of this market continued during
2006 and total advances made to home
collected customers fell by 8.5% to £122
million (2005: £133 million). Revenue also
decreased by £12.1 million to £85.2 million
and the home collected loan loss charge
reduced by £7.2 million to £21.9 million. 
At 31 December 2006, home collected 
credit receivables amounted to £114 million
(2005: £123 million), representing 6%
(2005: 8%) of the division’s total
receivables. See Fig 6.
The division had 307,000 (2005: 308,000)
home collected credit customers at 
31 December 2006, which included around
15,000 customers transferred from The
Lewis Group, following the acquisition 
of certain debt portfolios in the year. The
average customer balance at 31 December
2006 was £466 (2005: £521). See Fig 7.
Unsecured personal loans
Many mainstream lenders have tightened
their underwriting criteria during the year as
they continued to experience deteriorating
credit quality. This led to a 9.1% reduction
for the unsecured personal lending market 
in the UK as a whole, as reported by the
Finance & Leasing Association (FLA).
Our extensive experience in the non-
standard ﬁnance sector, together with 
the beneﬁts now being realised from our
investment in our new customer selection
systems, have supported a signiﬁcant
increase in the number of customer
applications being received by the division
from its well established network of 
brokers and introducers. 
This, together with conﬁdence in our
bespoke credit scorecards, which have
remained unchanged throughout the 
year, have enabled the division to increase
substantially its unsecured loan volumes 
by 33.8% during the year to £357 million
(2005: £267 million). See Fig 3.
Hire purchase
Building on our extensive experience and
long-term commitment to the hire purchase
sector, volumes continued to grow strongly
throughout the year, increasing by 39.7% 
to £294 million (2005: £210 million). 
See Fig 4.
This is a strong performance in a UK
market which, according to FLA ﬁgures,
experienced an overall reduction of around
10% during 2006. It reﬂects the continuing
success of Welcome’s hire purchase ﬁeld
sales team, supported by our Hull CPU, in
developing a national distribution network
of external introducers for used car ﬁnance. 
Welcome Car Finance, our car retailer, 
had a successful year and remains the
division’s largest introducer of hire purchase
customers. Operating from 11 sites across
the UK, Welcome Car Finance increased its
sales of used cars by 24.7% during the year
to 8,993 (2005: 7,209). 
Secured loans
Second charge secured lending in the 
UK reached an all-time high during 2006,
rising at an annual rate of 16.9%, as
reported by the FLA. This increase reﬂects
many providers preferring to make secured
loans, after incurring higher bad debts from
unsecured lending.

proﬁt before tax by 76.8% to £4.9 million
(2005: £2.8 million). See Fig 8.
Lewis receivables, comprising purchased
debt portfolios, more than doubled during
the year to £91 million (2005: £44 million).
Debt purchases during 2006 totalled 
£69 million (2005: £32 million), making
The Lewis Group one of the top three
players in the UK purchased debt market.
Improved collections performance during
2006 resulted in a positive revaluation of 
£1.7 million in the division’s purchased 
debt portfolios at 31 December 2006. 
The level of commission based activity
during 2006 remained little changed from
the previous year, generating income of 
£6.6 million (2005: £6.4 million) – of 
which 80% related to third parties and 
the remainder to our own consumer credit
division.
The Lewis Group acquired an unsecured
debt portfolio of £52.2 million in July 2006,
from a third party credit provider, for a
consideration of £8.0 million. A portfolio 
of UK credit card debt receivables was 
also acquired in December 2006, under 
an agreement which provides the division 
with a ‘forward ﬂow’ of smaller tranches 
of debt during the next three years.
The group’s total debt portfolio investment

£65 million.

to the group’s continuing success. 
Demand for the group’s products remains
strong and the beneﬁts from our signiﬁcant
investment in Phoenix are now being
realised. Good growth in direct repayment
customer numbers was generated in 2006
and we continue to receive an increasing
number of customer loan applications from
our well established network of major 
credit brokers and introducers. 
The group has made a strong start to 2007.
The growth momentum of the second 
half of 2006 has continued in 2007, with
record new business volumes being achieved
in the ﬁrst two months of this year. Credit
quality, customers’ arrears and bad debts
remain stable.
I ﬁrmly believe that the group is well

signiﬁcant growth opportunities available 
in the non-standard consumer ﬁnance

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Project Phoenix was successfully
implemented on schedule in June 2006.
These major new information technology
and customer relationship management
systems support and signiﬁcantly enhance
Welcome’s direct repayment customer
selection and underwriting processes,
enabling us to match our customers’
evolving credit status and needs to 
our product range. 
Further IT developments in 2007 will 
enable introducers to link electronically 
into our systems, and to build closer and
more efficient relationships with the
division. This technology is already being
used by several larger brokers to refer
customers’ unsecured loan applications 
to Welcome and it will be extended to 
other introducers in 2007. 
FUNDING
Group net receivables increased during the
year by £432 million to £2.1 billion (2005:
£1.7 billion) and borrowings increased 
in the same period by £398 million to 
£1.8 billion (2005: £1.4 billion).
At 31 December 2006, the group had
available headroom of £336 million 
(2005: £274 million) within its existing
funding facilities, with an average maturity
of four and a half years. 
A fundraising of £500 million was launched
in the bank syndication market in May
2006. Interest proved to be extremely 
strong and the transaction was successfully
completed in July at £800 million. These
new funds replaced existing bank facilities
of £393 million at reduced pricing and
longer maturity and also provided the 
group with additional working capital.
We were delighted to receive increased
support from our existing lenders and also
pleased to welcome several new banks to
this syndicated loan. The group now enjoys
support from over 30 banking relationships.
We have maintained our long established
treasury strategy of limiting exposure to
interest rate volatility through appropriate
ﬁnancial hedging instruments. At the year
end, around 80% of the group’s total
borrowings of £1.8 billion were protected
against future interest rate volatility, for 
an average period of around four and 
a half years.

MARKETS
Cattles operates in three UK markets: 
non-standard consumer ﬁnance, debt
recovery and invoice ﬁnancing. Welcome
Financial Services, which accounts for 
some 95% of our revenues, is a leading 
UK based provider of instalment credit and
other ﬁnancial services to consumers with
non-standard credit proﬁles. The Lewis
Group is a leading debt recovery and
investigation business. Cattles Invoice
Finance provides working capital ﬁnance 
for small and medium sized businesses. 
NON-STANDARD CONSUMER
FINANCE 
Direct repayment
Borrowers with non-standard credit proﬁles
are individuals who may not have access to
mainstream lending – typically due to
perceived shortcomings in their
employment, residency or credit histories.
We provide customers with an opportunity
to build or repair their credit proﬁle. 
Our products consist primarily of unsecured
personal loans, hire purchase loans for cars,
and secured loans. The sums involved are
relatively modest: typical advances are
£1,900 for unsecured loans, £6,200 for car
hire purchase loans, and £8,700 for 
secured loans. 
Repayments are mainly collected monthly
by direct debit, and we have over 400,000
direct repayment customers. Outstanding
loans of this type at the end of 2006 totalled
over £2 billion, before allowance for loan
loss provisions, accounting for over 94% of
Welcome’s loan book.
Our direct repayment customers are
primarily in socio-economic groups C and
D, which make up some 65% of the UK
adult population. See Fig 1. But our market
also includes people in the higher categories
who may have irregular earnings patterns or
need to repair their credit history.
Datamonitor believes the total potential
market for non-standard consumer ﬁnance
is around 9.1 million people and is predicted
to remain stable in the medium-term.

NON-STANDARD POPULATION 
FORECASTS (000’s)
Source: Datamonitor 2006 We see signiﬁcant opportunities for further
growth in the non-standard consumer
ﬁnance market. Datamonitor forecasts that
borrowings in the UK consumer ﬁnance
market will grow at an average of 4.5% a
year until 2010. Our market share has
increased and we expect to gain further
share through our enhanced systems,
training and product development – aided
by mainstream lenders continuing to move
away from this sector to concentrate on
borrowers in the higher socio-economic
groups with stronger credit proﬁles.
We are one of the leading players in the UK
in the non-standard consumer ﬁnance sector
and our principal competition comes from
specialist subsidiaries of major banks. The
ﬁnancial needs of our target market are not
well served by the high street banks, who
ﬁnd it difficult to lend economically to
borrowers with non-standard credit proﬁles.
Our potential market continues to grow as
mainstream banks and their subsidiaries
progressively tighten their lending criteria in
this area, for example by restricting lending
to tenants. 
Tightening economic conditions and rising
interest rates in 2006 resulted in an increase
in arrears, bad debts, personal bankruptcies
and individual voluntary arrangements 
in the UK market. This has added further
impetus to the mainstream lenders’
withdrawal from unsecured products 
and non-standard borrowers. Because our
assessment processes are designed to ensure
that customers’ repayment commitments 
are manageable and that they are not 
over-committed, the industry trend in rising
arrears has been minimal for Welcome. 
Unsecured lending, our main activity, is a
challenging business. New entrants come
into the market from time to time,
particularly during credit boom periods
when the prime lenders soften their lending
criteria to extend into the non-standard end
of the market. But there are signiﬁcant
barriers to maintaining a successful presence
in this market. One is the need to build a
substantial knowledge base: while credit
history data is available from credit
reference agencies, it is our accumulated
knowledge of customer behaviour in this
sector that enables us to identify proﬁtable
lending opportunities and screen loan
applications. This proprietary knowledge 
is difficult to accumulate quickly. 
New entrants also need the expertise and
resources to deal with customers face-to-face
through a well-developed multi-branch
infrastructure. Against the trend in ﬁnancial
services, we have continued to invest in our
branch network in recent years. We see our
local branch presence as a signiﬁcant
strength, and have made it a central part of
the way we manage both customer
relationships and risk. 
Our national network of 236 local
community branches is fundamentally
important to the way we build our customer
relationships. Our branches employ local
people with good communication skills,
who understand local conditions and help
us to engage in the local community. 
Once a direct repayment loan has been
advanced by one of our three central
processing units, most customers are
contacted by a local Customer Account
Manager from their nearest branch to begin
establishing a close working relationship.
Maintaining these relationships is a key part
of our arrears management strategy and is
the major role of our branch staff.
Home collected
The home collected market is in long-term
decline. We still rank second in this market,
but our accounts are reducing in number as
we continue to disengage from customers
that we consider uneconomic to serve. 
Around 6% of our consumer credit
receivables consist of home collected loans
to some 307,000 customers. The typical
advances for these are small, at around
£300, and repayments are collected weekly
by local agents. Our outstanding home
collected loans totalled £114 million at the
end of 2006.
Regulation
Government regularly reviews regulation
and legislation to ensure a robust and fair
lending environment, and regulation has
signiﬁcantly increased in recent years. 
This environment favours responsible, well
managed businesses, and we welcome the
reassurance that it provides to customers
and investors alike. Our own corporate
values require us to be a responsible lender
and we have always seen treating customers
fairly and responsibly as an essential part 
of managing risks.

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006
We are one of the top three players in 
the purchased debt market. We helped to
establish the market in the UK, with a
ground-breaking transaction in early 1998,
and now have an estimated market share of
over 10%. The market is growing strongly –
an estimated £3.8 billion of face value debt
was sold in 2006, with many lenders now
ﬁnding outright sale of debt more attractive
than recovery on commission. This is
helping us to grow as we capitalise on our
strong market position. Our 2006 debt
purchases totalled £69 million, more than
double the £32 million we spent in 2005.
There are substantial barriers to entering the
purchased debt market, not least the need 
to make large upfront capital payments. 
But the strong growth in the marketplace 
in recent years is attracting some new
players. As a result, prices paid for debt 
rose in 2005 – although this rise moderated
somewhat in 2006.
INVOICE FINANCE
Cattles Invoice Finance provides working
capital ﬁnance to small and medium sized
businesses throughout the UK. It has 
a broadly spread portfolio, specialising 
in young or fast growth businesses and
turnarounds. As in Welcome, we manage
risk through rigorous underwriting 
processes and by maintaining exceptionally
close personal contact with clients.
There are around 75 companies operating 
in the UK market and consolidation appears
to be under way. The largest players are the
UK clearing banks, as well as a number 
of big-ticket lenders and overseas banks.
Cattles Invoice Finance is one of a number
of national independents and there are also
a large number of smaller regional players.
There are currently some 3.7 million small
and medium sized enterprises in the UK. 
Of these, about 43,000 are currently 
using invoice ﬁnance – but we believe 
there is a potential market of some 
250,000 businesses.
Our consumer credit businesses are licensed
under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. To
maintain high standards of integrity and
honesty among lenders, all providers of
consumer credit must have a licence of
ﬁtness to trade from the Office of Fair
Trading, which they must renew every ﬁve
years. This legislation has been under review
and its replacement, the Consumer Credit
Act 2006, received ﬁnal enactment in April
2006; but some parts of this will not be in
place until April 2008. 
Our sale of mortgages and general insurance
products are regulated by the Financial
Services Authority (FSA).
We are an active member of various 
trade associations including the 
Consumer Credit Association, the 
Consumer Credit Trade Association 
and the Finance & Leasing Association. 
DEBT RECOVERY
The Lewis Group is a UK leader in debt
recovery and investigation services, serving
both external clients and Welcome. Its
external clients are mainly large issuers 
of credit cards and unsecured loans – 
as well as both central and local 
government departments, insurance
companies, catalogue retailers, utilities,
telecommunications businesses and
educational institutions. We have a
reputation for quality and ethical collection
practices; and we belong to the Credit
Services Association and adhere to its 
code of conduct. This provides comfort to 
blue-chip clients concerned to manage 
risk to their own reputations.
Around two thirds of Lewis’s revenue comes
from portfolios of non-performing debts. 
It purchases these from credit providers, 
at a discount to their face value, and then
recovers outstanding amounts. The balance
of its business comes from recovering 
debts for clients on a commission basis 
and supplying investigation services, 
such as customer care visits for insurance
companies and arrears and pre-litigation
visits for creditors. Lewis operates one 
of the largest self-employed ﬁeld 
collection teams in its sector.
OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
OPERATING REVIEW 
CONTINUED
The Lewis Group is one of the top three
players in the UK purchased debt market, 
a market which is growing strongly. At present only about one in 10 customer
applications to Welcome results in a loan
being advanced. In part this reﬂects our
highly selective, risk managed approach. 
But speed of response is also a factor. Many
customers need an advance quickly, so apply
to several providers and accept the ﬁrst offer
they receive. Without softening our selection
criteria, we have increased the proportion 
of successful applications by making and
communicating decisions faster, and making
ourselves more accessible. 
Our new information technology and
customer relationship management systems,
known as Phoenix and launched in 2006,
have supported greater throughput and
faster turnround of applications. We are 
also establishing new delivery channels,
which will extend the options for acquiring
and servicing our customers. Recent changes
to our telephony systems now support more
efficient distribution of calls, enhancing
customer contact and response rates. 
We are developing additional customer
service teams to visit applicants who 
prefer to meet in their own home.
Fair play is key to the quality of our
customer relationships and to our
reputation. We continue to embed the 
FSA’s Treating Customers Fairly principles
throughout the business by building on 
our existing customer service culture. If
customers experience problems with us, 
we aim to resolve them quickly and learn
from the experience. We encourage feedback
and questions to our customer relations
department, and track customer 
satisfaction by independently surveying 
over 500 randomly selected customers 
each month, by telephone.
The Lewis Group
We are aiming for sustained growth in 
The Lewis Group. As the debt recovery
market continues to shift from traditional
commission based collections to debt
purchase, we plan to maintain and 
grow our share of both. 
This will involve increased investment 
in acquiring debt portfolios. Most single
portfolios coming to market now realise
prices estimated to be in the £0.5 million to
£1.0 million range; but we are well placed
to bid on much larger ones and are likely 
to focus our future efforts on longer-term
forward ﬂow deals. 
OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
Group strategy
As outlined in the Chief Executive’s Review,
our group strategy continues to focus on
proﬁtably expanding our consumer credit
activities, underpinned by a policy of
responsible and compliant lending while
maintaining stable credit quality. We 
are now also looking to expand our debt
recovery and invoice ﬁnancing businesses 
so that they generate an increasing
contribution to group revenue and proﬁts. 
We are developing a core culture shared 
by all parts of the business under the 
banner of Accelerating Growth. We want 
to involve and energise all our people in the
development of the group while enhancing
the quality of customer service. 
Welcome Financial Services
We aim to maintain our established pattern
of sustained proﬁt growth and stable credit
quality based on responsible lending. 
We remain committed to serving local
communities, sustaining close relationships
with our customers through an extensive 
UK network of branches, while managing
risk through central underwriting and
increasingly sophisticated customer 
proﬁling and selection techniques.
We have successfully evolved our consumer
credit division from its historic roots in
home collected credit to a strong focus 
on non-standard direct repayment lending.
Many mainstream lenders have tightened
their underwriting criteria in unsecured
lending, in favour of secured products. We
have beneﬁted from this, without changing
our underwriting and customer selection
criteria or our policy of not making large
unsecured loan advances. We aim to have
the ﬂexibility in our people, products and
processes to make the best of prevailing
market conditions. 
In 2006 we passed two important
milestones in our direct repayment business:
we took the total number of customers past
400,000 and grew the loan book to over 
£2 billion before loan loss provisions.
To maintain growth we will continue 
to develop our processes for customer
acquisition and retention. New technology
enables us to approve loans more efficiently
and is already enhancing customers’
experience of Welcome and making it 
easier for brokers and dealers to 
promote our products.

In July 2006, The Lewis Group purchased
an unsecured debt portfolio of £52.2 million
from a third party credit provider for 
£8.0 million. In December 2006, we also
acquired a large portfolio of UK credit 
card receivables under an agreement which
involves purchasing further smaller tranches
of similar debt each month during the 
next three years. The total investment 
under this one agreement is expected to 
be around £65 million. 
Buying larger portfolios demands even
greater skill in valuing debt. We continue to
increase the size of our valuation team and
are investing in enhanced software to apply
our proprietary debt valuation methodology.
This should help us to maintain rigorous
risk management, protect margins if 
prices rise, and maximise the competitive
advantage that our accumulated debt
valuation data gives us over newer 
market entrants.
The Lewis Group operates from three
offices – Cleckheaton, Glasgow and Belfast
– which provide national coverage for debt
collection, including doorstep collection and
investigations. There are no plans to open
further locations.
Cattles Invoice Finance
We aim to continue developing Cattles
Invoice Finance, primarily through organic
growth from its six existing operating
centres in Glasgow, Manchester, Leeds,
Birmingham, Oxford and Maidstone, 
which are sufficient to achieve broad
coverage of key regional business 
centres in the UK. 
In recent years Cattles Invoice Finance has
built an excellent reputation, supported by
industry awards and positive trade press
coverage, and consistently outperformed the
market. We believe it will continue to gain
market share while retaining its strong risk
management controls and culture.
As the sector has begun to consolidate, 
we will consider acquisitions to increase 
the pace of expansion.  20
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006
As the regulated entity within the group,
Welcome has embraced the FSA’s Treating
Customers Fairly initiative. We apply its
principles in our business dealings, have
made it a formal part of our training 
and are embedding it in our 
remuneration policies.
Leadership, training and development
We are putting increasing weight behind
leadership and management development. 
In 2006 we set up a Management Academy
to help our most promising people to
develop the leadership, management 
and behavioural skills we need to lead 
the business in the future. 
We aim to move people more frequently
between different aspects of the businesses
to develop a management team with
broader experience of the whole group. And
we are also bringing in talent from outside
to increase our exposure to fresh ideas, best
practice, innovation and creativity. A great
advantage of our continuing expansion is
that we can do this while maintaining a
strong programme of internal development
and promotion: in 2006, over 150 of our
people were promoted from one grade to
another, and another 300 were promoted
within their existing grade.
We continue to invest in training at all 
levels, particularly for customer facing
employees, to ensure that our people have
the skills they need to meet regulatory
requirements, deliver our strategies and
develop their careers. In 2005 the sale of
insurance products and mortgages became
FSA regulated. We introduced new training
programmes to enable compliance 
with the FSA’s requirements and with 
further regulatory changes in 2006. 
We see the Investors in People (IiP) standard
as a good third party measure of our
performance. We ﬁrst attained accreditation
in 1997 and obtained the higher level IiP
Proﬁle standard in Welcome Finance in 
2005 and Shopacheck in 2006. Welcome
Car Finance is currently working towards
accreditation and The Lewis Group and
Cattles Invoice Finance will start in 2007.
The Lewis Group was the ﬁrst company 
in the debt collection industry to attain 
the Quality Management accreditation 
ISO 9001, which it still maintains.
We have a clearly articulated equal
opportunities policy and encourage 
diversity wherever appropriate. Our
workforce tends to reﬂect the local
environment and community wherever 
we work, and we provide diversity training
during induction and in our management
development programmes.
Staff retention and motivation
The better we can retain and motivate our
staff, the more efficiently we can operate.
Not least because many of our core skills –
in arrears management, for example – are 
in short supply. We have been working hard
to involve and engage our people with our
business goals, and give them attractive
working conditions and career paths.
We aim to provide appropriate total reward
packages of salary and beneﬁts. To support
staff retention and enable people to share in
our success we have an employee Sharesave
scheme and also award free shares based on
a pre-qualifying period of service. In 2006
we were short-listed for Employee Rewards
& Beneﬁts magazine’s ‘most effective 
overall remuneration strategy’ award.
There are clear indications that this work 
is bearing fruit. In the past year our annual
staff turnover has improved by over a ﬁfth
and the response rate to our annual Speak
Up staff survey has grown to 84%. 
The 2006 survey recorded good
improvement in employees’ perceptions 
of the group’s ﬁnancial strength, culture 
and way of working, professionalism and
internal communication. It also reﬂects the
major progress achieved in recent years 
by the group and its employees in helping
local communities and caring about the
environment. Key ﬁndings were that 87% 
of employees said they believed they 
worked for a good employer, 80% were
proud to work for us, and 94% felt they
make a valuable contribution to the
company’s success.
KEY RESOURCES
The principal resources which support the
successful delivery of the group’s strategies
are as follows: 
PEOPLE
Our people are essential to realising 
our ambitions. We rely on their 
skills, commitment and – above all –
understanding of our markets and individual
customers. We support them by fostering 
a positive and ethical culture, providing
effective leadership, training and
development, and recognising and
rewarding them appropriately. Our research
conﬁrms that our people are increasingly
engaged and committed to the success 
of the business. 
Values and culture
We are respectful of people, both our
employees and our customers. We want 
the way we treat them to differentiate us
positively from competitors and earn us
good standing with those who shape our
regulatory and business environment. 
We believe it is possible to have a culture
that is both performance oriented and
customer sensitive. We seek ways to support
our customers through maintaining an
extensive local presence; we see this as the
best way to ensure strong and sustainable
growth in a range of economic conditions.
In 2006 we launched our Accelerating
Growth programme to embed these values
and principles more deeply across the
business. Initially developed across the
Welcome Financial Services businesses, 
it is being rolled-out across other parts 
of the group in 2007 – reinforcing the
convergence of standards, culture and
behaviours among all the group businesses.
We have appointed Accelerating Growth
Champions in each company to promote
our strategies for customers, people and
proﬁt, and the positive, pioneering and
professional ways in which we aim to
achieve them. Some 4,200 of our 4,900
people are already involved. The programme
draws on extensive consultation from 
across the business: rather than imposing
new values, it aims to refresh and invigorate
the values we already uphold.

PARTNERS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES
AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT
RELATIONSHIPS
A signiﬁcant factor in the consumer 
credit division’s sustained growth is the
relationships we have built with our 
external distribution channels. These are
mainly brokers and car dealerships who
refer their customers to us. One reason 
we centralised our risk management and
underwriting processes was to ensure that
we can give an exceptionally high quality of
service to these introducers. They recognise
our commitment to them and this market,
which provides a sound basis for long-term
relationships and trust. The introduction 
of our new information technology and
customer relationship management systems
in 2006 is enabling us to develop improved
access for them, so that they can obtain
faster responses for their customers.
Progress continues to be made in our
partnership with Alliance & Leicester, 
under which we manage applications 
for their secured personal loan product, 
with the option for Welcome to underwrite
applications that do not meet Alliance &
Leicester’s own lending criteria. Sales 
so far have been small as Alliance &
Leicester gains experience in marketing 
this product and we reﬁne the sales
fulﬁlment processes. A number of
enhancements are planned during 2007, 
to build on the current performance. 
The Lewis Group has a number of large
clients in the public and the private sector.
We sustain our relationships with these 
large blue-chip organisations by delivering
excellent service and taking care to ensure
that our approach does not put their
reputation, or ours, at risk.
Virtually all Cattles Invoices Finance’s
business comes through introducers, 
such as banks and accountancy ﬁrms. 
We are aiming to grow relationships 
with larger institutions as an outsourced 
provider. In 2007 we plan to appoint 
a corporate partnerships director to 
pursue partnership opportunities. 
SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
The completion of project Phoenix 
provides a robust platform for continued
growth in our consumer lending business. 
Its successful development and
implementation on schedule during 
2006 was the result of several years’ 
careful planning and preparation.
This new system supports our customer
selection and underwriting, enabling us 
to match products and rates to customer
proﬁles faster and more accurately. 
As potential customers often apply to
several lenders at once, speed of response 
is a critical competitive advantage. 
In 2007 further information technology
developments will enable introducers to 
link electronically into our systems, which
will make for closer and more efficient
relationships. This technology is already
being used for unsecured lending through
several of our larger brokers and will be
extended to smaller introducers and car
dealers in 2007.
Further reﬁnements in our technology 
will be focused on improving the 
conversion ratio of loan applications 
and customer retention.
In The Lewis Group we have recently
upgraded the information technology
systems that apply our proprietary debt
valuation methodology. We are also
developing a new management information
system that will enable us to manage our
collection strategies better. In 2006 we
launched LIS Online, giving investigation
clients real-time access to our systems 
to refer jobs and download results.
Cattles Invoice Finance went live with 
an industry leading customer relationship
management system in 2006. This will
increase business levels from introducers 
and help us manage the sales process better.
Across the group we are upgrading and
converging our telecommunications as 
part of the process of integrating all 
parts of the business more closely.

Target range
Some of the key risks that could impede our
strategic progress, together with the action
we take to mitigate them, are set out below.
Credit risk
The group takes on exposure to credit risk
in respect of loans and receivables, which 
is the risk that a customer will be unable 
to pay amounts in full when due. Loan loss
provisions are provided for losses that have
been incurred at the balance sheet date.
Signiﬁcant changes in the economy could
result in losses that are different from those
provided for at the balance sheet date.
Management therefore carefully manages 
its exposure to credit risk.
We believe the largest challenge in our
consumer lending business, Welcome
Financial Services, is credit risk. Our
principal protections are the effectiveness of
our bespoke credit scoring and underwriting
process and the way we maintain close
customer relationships through a national
network of local community branches. 
At the time a loan is approved, direct
repayment customers are all in employment,
have bank accounts and are able to repay
their borrowings via a direct debit payment.
Exposure to credit risk is managed in part
with collateral obtained on certain products. 
Our long established target is to maintain
direct repayment arrears at 8-10% of
receivables and we have consistently
operated within or slightly below this 
range for many years. The introduction 
of improved credit scorecards in 
July 2004, together with enhancements 
to our customer selection technology and
arrears management techniques, brought
arrears below the target range and, at 31
December 2006, the level was 7.4% 
(2005: 7.6%). See Fig 1.
Data from our bespoke scorecards
continues to conﬁrm our belief that the 
8-10% target represents an appropriate 
risk appetite for our chosen non-standard
consumer ﬁnance market. As previously
reported, we expect arrears to return
gradually to within this range.
Applications for advances come through 
a variety of channels, including national
brokers and dealers, and we ensure
consistency of credit quality by managing 
all scoring and underwriting centrally. 
We rigorously verify the information
applicants give us and aim to understand
their outgoings and commitments so 
that we can be conﬁdent of our ability 
to lend responsibly and their capacity 
to meet repayments. 
Once customers’ applications are approved
by one of our three central processing 
units we allocate the vast majority of them
to a branch near their home for ongoing
customer relationship management. Our
local branch staff maintain personal contact
with customers from the start. This provides
a vital advantage if customers encounter
difficulties with repayments at any stage 
and gives us a better opportunity to help
them through their problems, perhaps by
agreeing to accept lower payments for a
period of time. 
Understanding and engaging with our
customers is our greatest differentiator – and
the key to controlling arrears. If we can help
customers through a problem successfully,
we can still do business with them. Should 
a customer experience a longer-term adverse
change in their ﬁnancial position, account
management is transferred from the local
branch to a specialist local collection unit
(LCU). The LCU then establishes a revised
repayment schedule more suited to the
customer’s changed circumstances.
The direct repayment loan loss ratio
improved to 7.4% (2005: 8.9%) of 
closing net receivables, demonstrating the 
success of our signiﬁcant investment in
strengthening customer selection processes
over the past three years and the close
customer relationships established by 
our branch staff. See Fig 2.
Home collect customers continue to be
served with small value, short-term advances
(typically £300). Credit risk is managed
through regular analysis of the ability of
borrowers to meet repayments and credit
limits are amended accordingly.
Our corporate services business, Cattles
Invoice Finance, beneﬁts from a well
diversiﬁed portfolio and robust underwriting
criteria. We have excellent systems and
processes, but believe that personal attention
is the key to controlling arrears. We 
have structured the business to provide
exceptionally high levels of client contact
and service, with each client manager
handling only 20-25 client relationships.
The loan loss ratio of the corporate services
division was 1.2% (2005: 0.5%) in 2006, 
a year during which receivables grew
signiﬁcantly to £80.2 million.
Overall, the group’s loan loss charge 
of £174.4 million for 2006 was almost 
£2 million lower than in 2005. The group’s
accounting policy relating to the impairment
of loans and receivables is set out in the
notes to the accounts on page 44.
Our principal risk protection 
is the effectiveness of our 
bespoke credit scoring
We maintain our close 
customer relationships through 
a national network of local
community branches They say you can’t be too careful.
But actually, you can.
We aim to keep our direct
repayment arrears rate steady 
at about 8-10%. That tells us 
we’re taking the amount of 
risk we’re comfortable with.
At the end of 2006 the arrears 
rate was 7.4%. That’s actually 
a little too low and we expect 
it to return gradually to its 
target range.

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 Legal risk 
Cattles identiﬁes and manages legal risk
through the effective use of its internal 
and external legal advisers. The Company
Secretary and Legal Counsel has
responsibilities for providing the support
necessary to identify, manage and 
control legal risk across the group.
Tax risk 
This is the risk of loss or increased charges
associated with changes to, or error in the
interpretation of, taxation rates or law.
Responsibility for control lies with the
Treasury & Risk Director and procedures
are in place to manage this risk, including
taking external advice as necessary.
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme risk
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme risk
manifests if the group has to increase its
level of funding of the ﬁnal salary scheme.
This would occur if the value of the
scheme’s assets was insufficient over time 
to cover the projected pension liabilities.
The assets of the scheme are held in a
separate trustee-administered fund which
has appointed an independent chairman 
to the board of the trustee company.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed 
in accordance with the advice of an
independent qualiﬁed actuary. The scheme
was closed to new applicants in 1998. 
The value of the group’s retirement beneﬁt
obligation reduced by £10.9 million to
£23.8 million at 31 December 2006. 
The IAS 19 funding level (scheme assets 
as a percentage of scheme liabilities)
improved from 57% to 70% during 
2006 as a result of:
• The outperformance of the fund’s assets
against the return assumed at the start 
of the year;
• An increase in corporate bond yields
relative to inﬂation, which reduced the
valuation of pension liabilities;
• Additional contributions of £185,600 per
month being paid by the group towards
the fund deﬁcit; and
• A change in the pension scheme rules
concerning the cash option that members
can take at retirement.
Reputational risk
Our reputation for fair and ethical conduct
is important to us. Any impairment 
could damage our marketing, customer
relationships or dealings with regulators. 
We guard our reputation jealously and 
train customer facing staff to protect it – 
for example through our support of the 
FSA’s Treating Customers Fairly initiative. 
In all our businesses we have well developed
procedures for resolving customer
complaints and queries.
In the debt recovery commission market
there are published league tables of debt
collection performance. The high ranking 
of our subsidiary, The Lewis Group, in these
tables conﬁrms that our collection strategies
are effective. To protect our own reputation
and those of our clients we have a strict
policy of using only ethical collection
methods, and as a member of the Credit
Services Association we adhere to its 
code of conduct. 
Our compliance monitoring processes 
are designed to ensure that our operating
licences are not put at risk and that we sell
all insurance products and broker mortgages
in accordance with FSA regulations. We
continually monitor compliance, reporting
to senior management and the Board. Any
potential improvements to our processes 
are considered and implemented 
where appropriate.
Business continuity risk
Loss of our information technology
infrastructure or key business premises
would adversely impact our operations. 
So we have approved policies for business
continuity management and IT disaster
recovery. We pay particular attention to 
our increasing reliance on computer systems,
utilising the signiﬁcant resources of third
party specialists such as IBM, under formal
disaster recovery arrangements.
Compliance risk 
Compliance or regulatory risks arise 
from a failure or inability to comply with
the laws, regulations or codes applicable
speciﬁcally to the ﬁnancial services industry.
Non-compliance can lead to ﬁnes, public
reprimands and enforced suspension of
operations or, in extreme cases, withdrawal
of authorisation to operate.
The group has a dedicated compliance
function which has implemented controls
and systems to monitor and manage these
risks. These include monitoring regulatory
and legal changes, advising on implications
and setting compliance policies and strategy.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND
TREASURY REVIEW CONTINUED 28
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006
TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT
The group’s signiﬁcant debt ﬁnancing and
customer lending exposes it to a variety
of potential ﬁnancial risks that include the
effects of changes in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates, liquidity and
concentration of funding. The group has
in place a risk management programme
that seeks to limit the adverse effects on
the ﬁnancial performance of the group
by using ﬁnancial instruments, such as
interest rate and cross-currency swaps
to ﬁx interest rates.
The Board of directors has delegated, 
within limits, the policies for setting out the
treasury risk management policies applied
by the group to the Treasury & Risk
Director. These policies are implemented
directly by the treasury team on behalf of
the group. The team has a risk management
policy that sets out speciﬁc guidelines to
manage interest rate, foreign exchange 
and credit risk and the use of ﬁnancial
instruments in relation to these.
Liquidity risk and funding
We fund our businesses through syndicated
and bilateral facilities with major UK and
international banks and through private and
public debt offerings. The current syndicated
and bilateral facilities last for periods of up
to six years. In order to continue to fund the
expected growth in the group’s receivables
these facilities will typically be renewed
and/or increased on their termination.
There is a risk that there will be a lack 
of available funding and that signiﬁcant
volume and value of facilities renewing
within a short timeframe may result in 
a restriction of the level of funds offered 
or a higher cost of funding.
Details of our funding facilities and their
maturity dates are set out in the Maturity 
of facilities table. See Fig 6.
These include:
• Syndicated and bilateral bank facilities
• US private placements
• Bond issues
• Overdraft facilities
The group is careful to avoid building 
a concentration of facilities with a relatively
small group of partners. In order to 
avoid such a concentration the group has
established funding in the bank, public 
bond and US private placement markets.
Bank facilities currently include a syndicate
of over 30 banking partners. It is the group’s
intention that funding with any individual
counterparty would not normally exceed
20% of total group funding. 
Existing and forecast headroom levels 
are reported and reviewed at each Board
meeting. While there is no set minimum level
of headroom, under normal circumstances
the intention would be to maintain no less
than six months’ headroom.
Borrowings
The group continues to use the bank, 
public bond and private placement 
markets as its principal sources of funding. 
Total borrowings increased by £398 million
during the year to £1.8 billion at 
31 December 2006. 
During the year the group successfully raised
the Sterling equivalent of £68 million in the
private placement market bringing the total
funding provided to the group by that
market to £187 million. In line with our
standard policy, we immediately swapped
out all currency risk to avoid exposure to

Bank funding during the year increased 
by £344 million to £1.1 billion at 
31 December 2006. 
In May 2006, we launched a new bank
fundraising to raise £500 million replacing
expiring bank facilities of £393 million and
providing some additional ﬁnance. This 
was well received by the bank market and
we were able to raise £800 million at terms
which were signiﬁcantly better than those
for the expiring facilities. We were delighted
to receive increased support from our
existing lenders and also pleased to welcome
several new banks to this syndicated loan.
Gearing increased over the year, to 5.1 times
(2005: 4.4 times), and remains well within
our covenant of six times. The overall cost
of funds during the year reduced to 6.79%
(2005: 7.14%) See Fig 3.
Cash ﬂow
The group’s net operating cash outﬂow 
rose by £273 million during 2006 to 
£376 million, largely driven by an increase 
in loans and receivables of £432 million 
in the year. See Fig 4.
Headroom
The group maintains a mixture of long-
term and short-term committed facilities
that are designed to ensure that the group
has sufficient available funds for current
operations and planned growth. The group
had bank facilities of £1.4 billion at the 
end of 2006 and headroom of £336 million
(2005: £1.0 billion of facilities and 
£274 million of headroom respectively).
See Fig 5. Currency risk
Certain funding received from banks or
other sources may not be in Sterling. This
creates a potential exposure to the risk of
adverse foreign exchange rate movements.
It is the policy of the group to manage the
risk of exposure to adverse foreign exchange
rate movements by the use of ﬁnancial
hedging instruments. In order to achieve
this, all foreign currency denominated
borrowings are immediately swapped 
into Sterling at the start of the related
facility agreement.
MARK COLLINS
Treasury & Risk Director
15 March 2007
Maturity of facilities
The 2006 bank syndication of £800 million
provides options to extend the ﬁve year 
term on its ﬁrst and second anniversary by 
a further 12 months, and the latest US
private placement funding matures in 2011.
Our overall average maturity of around four
and a half years gives us a strong funding
position, with only £125 million maturing 
in 2007, and £27 million in 2008. See Fig 6.
Interest rate risk
Funding received from banks and other
providers is a mixture of ﬁxed rate and
ﬂoating rate funding. Floating rate
borrowings are exposed to the risk of 
rising interest rates and the group manages
this risk by the use of ﬁnancial hedging
instruments, primarily swaps.
At 31 December 2006, around 80% of the
group’s borrowings were protected against
future interest rate volatility, either through
ﬁxed rate borrowing or by using interest
rate swaps to protect ﬂoating rate
borrowings. As a result, a hypothetical 
1% change in market interest rates would
change our current annual interest cost 
by around only £3.5 million.
Counterparty credit risk
At any point in time, Cattles will have an
exposure to any of its counterparties arising
from treasury activities. Management 
of counterparty credit risk is assisted by
ensuring that derivative counterparties and
other counterparties that hold Cattles’ 
funds on deposit or credit balances on bank
accounts should carry a long-term credit
rating of higher than BBB, or equivalent.

JAMES CORR
Finance Director
INCOME STATEMENT
Group revenue (excluding the effect of IFRS
‘gross-up’) grew by 4.2% in the year to
£700 million (2005: £672 million), with
strong second-half growth of 14.5%
resulting from higher volumes and
receivables growth in our direct 
repayment business. 
Proﬁt before tax rose 14.9% to £132.2
million (2005: £115.1 million). As a result,
earnings per share increased by 14.0% to
28.01p (2005: 24.56p), based on an effective
tax rate of 30.6% (2005: 30.1%). See Fig 1.
In view of the group’s continuing
satisfactory progress, the Board has
recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 11.85p per
share. Together with the interim dividend,
this gives a total dividend for the year of
17.50p per share (2005: 15.70p) – an
increase of 11.5% on 2005. Dividend 
cover remains at around 1.6 times.
REVENUE
See Fig 2.
Our direct repayment business again
performed strongly in 2006, with good
volume growth in unsecured and hire
purchase products and customer growth of
14.2%. Revenue rose 9.2% in the year with
strong second-half growth of 14.3%, driven
principally by increased interest income.
The planned reduction in our home
collected business and the alteration to 
our insurance arrangements in 2005, 
which transferred all insurance risk 
from Progressive Insurance, the group’s
reinsurance company, to Norwich Union,
led to a reduction in revenue in other
consumer credit businesses of 11.1%. 
In our debt recovery business, 
The Lewis Group, the ongoing improvement
in collection performance was ahead of
earlier estimates. Revenue rose by 25.0% 
to £21.2 million (2005: £17.0 million)
largely as a result of the increase in our
purchased debt portfolios, which at 
31 December 2006, amounted to 
£91.0 million (2005: £44.4 million).
Cattles Invoice Finance, our corporate
services division, achieved revenue growth 
of 5.7%.
The group’s accounting policies relating to
revenue recognition are set out in the notes
to the accounts on pages 43 and 44.

SEGMENTAL PROFITS
See Fig 3.
Our consumer credit division, which
represents over 90% of the group’s total
proﬁt before tax and central expenses,
maintained its track record of double digit
proﬁt growth. In 2006 this equated to 
an increase of 15.5% to £136.1 million
(2005: £117.9 million). Ongoing revenue
and receivables growth, stable credit quality
and further improvement in cost efficiencies
all contributed to this improved result. 
In our debt recovery division, excellent
proﬁt growth of 76.8% was due primarily
to an increase in the purchased debt
portfolio (see Loans and receivables 
on page 32). 
The corporate services division’s proﬁt 
was down 26.3% from £4.7 million to 
£3.5 million. As reported previously, this
was as a result of one of the division’s 
six offices being adversely impacted by a
competitor seeking to gain market share, 
at prices we considered to be uneconomic.
The division’s other ﬁve offices continued 
to perform strongly, delivering increased
proﬁts over the previous year.
Central expenses of £12.3 million 
increased by £2.0 million, of which 
£1.2 million related to legal and due
diligence fees concerning a possible offer 
for London Scottish Bank plc. Excluding
these costs, the underlying cost increase 
for the year was well controlled at 7.8%. 
OTHER COST OF SALES
See Fig 4.
Other cost of sales of £274.3 million 
were reduced by just over 5% or 
£15.4 million overall. 
The high quality of underwriting and 
arrears management resulted in a £1.7
million reduction in the loan loss charge,
excluding the effect of IFRS ‘gross-up.’ 
Further growth in sales volumes at 
Welcome Car Finance resulted in an 18.7%
increase in cost of vehicles sold. In 2006 we
expanded the operation and reopened two
sites taking the total to 11. This enabled us
to increase the number of vehicles sold by
24.7% from 7,209 to 8,993.
The planned reduction in our weekly home
collected business led directly to a 5.7%
decrease in commission paid to agents. 
Other cost items were down by £4 million
or 15.5%. This was due mainly to the
cessation of broking related advertising
following the reorganisation of Dial4aloan
into Welcome Mortgages.
ADMIN EXPENSES
See Fig 5.
Tight control of costs remains a high
priority and total admin expenses increased
by only £1.0 million or 0.5%. The cost
income ratio remained broadly consistent 
in the year at 29.7% (2005: 30.1%), 
remaining close to our target level of 30%. 
We continue to look for opportunities 
to improve efficiency while maintaining 
the investment necessary to support 
the infrastructure required for our 
planned growth.
Remuneration costs were 1.6% lower 
in 2006. Although the year-end employee
headcount of 4,449 was 1% higher than 
in 2005, the average headcount during 
the year was 10.9% lower because of
restructuring activities during 2005 in
Shopacheck, Welcome Car Finance 
and Dial4aloan.
The increase in depreciation reﬂects our
investment in new information technology
systems commissioned during 2006,
including project Phoenix.
General overheads (incorporating items 
such as information technology costs, legal
and professional fees, telecommunications,
printing and stationery and postage)
increased from £43.1 million to 
£47.2 million. The main areas of increase
were legal and due diligence fees of 
£1.2 million already referred to above, 
and other information technology 
costs up by £1.6 million.

BALANCE SHEET
See Fig 6
Shareholders’ funds at the year-end stood 
at almost £417 million (2005: £361 million) 
– an increase of 15.5% on the previous 
year. A key reason was the growth in 
our receivables book of £432 million 
to £2.1 billion, while borrowings grew 
by £398 million to £1.8 billion.
A particular strength of our balance sheet 
is its liquidity. The group’s current assets 
of £926 million exceed current liabilities 
by £662 million at the end of 2006.
The increase in goodwill and intangibles 
of £18.2 million after amortisation during
2006 is due entirely to the investments made
in information technology systems during
the year. The investment will be amortised
over a period of seven years. Investment in
information technology for 2007 is expected
to be around £24 million.
Other assets of £135.8 million at 
31 December 2006 were £54.5 million
lower than 2005. The main reason for 
this was the payment of £59.8 million 
to Norwich Union in early 2006, relating 
to the commutation of insurance liabilities,
as reported last year. This was also 
the main reason for the reduction of 
£47.3 million in other creditors of 
£125.8 million (2005: £173.1 million). 
Investment in property, plant and 
equipment during 2006 totalled £4.5 million
(2005: £5.3 million), with 2007 investment
expected to be around £3 million. 
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
See Fig 7.
Loans and receivables increased by 
25.8% over the year from £1.7 billion 
to £2.1 billion. 
The consumer credit division, which
accounts for around 92% of group
receivables, made further good progress
with an increase of 23.7% to £1.9 billion
(2005: £1.6 billion). This was driven by 
a 26.5% increase in the direct repayment
book, reﬂecting a 14% growth in customers
and a modest uplift in the average balance
from £4,900 to £5,200. This increase was
not least as a consequence of the success 
of our new Phoenix systems in matching
appropriate products to individuals’
creditworthiness and ability to repay. 
The home collected book reduced by almost
8% to £114 million as we maintained our
strategy of disengaging from customers 
that we ﬁnd uneconomic to serve.
The debt recovery division more than
doubled its purchased debt book from 
£44 million to £91 million, reﬂecting the
ongoing investment in forward ﬂow debt
from existing contracts and substantial
additional purchases of new debt portfolios. 
Our debt purchases in 2006 totalled £69
million, including two substantial portfolios:
• In July 2006, an unsecured debt 
portfolio of £52.2 million was acquired
from a third party credit provider for 
£8.0 million. 
• In December 2006, a large portfolio 
of UK credit card receivables was also
acquired under an agreement which
involves purchasing further smaller
tranches of similar debt each month
during the next three years. The total
investment under this one agreement 
is expected to be around £65 million.
Our corporate services business grew its
receivables by over 21% from £66 million
to £80 million in the year.
RETURN ON A VERAGE NET
RECEIVABLES
See Fig 8.
Our return on average net receivables in the
consumer credit division improved slightly
in 2006 from 7.1% to 7.2% and remains
within our target range of 7-8%. 
In the corporate services division, the return
on the loan book fell from 7.7% to 4.9%.
As mentioned above, this reﬂects the fact
that one of the division’s six offices was
adversely impacted by a competitor seeking
to gain market share at prices we considered
to be uneconomic.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
A number of KPIs have been used in the Operating and Financial Review. The following
table provides an explanation of the purpose and basis of calculation for these KPIs:
OVERVIEW
The group’s ﬁnancial performance in 2006
was very encouraging, with good progress 
in all key areas. We met or exceeded all 
our major targets, and the strong increases
achieved in volumes, receivables and
revenue in the second-half provides 
a ﬁrm platform for 2007.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
THE ‘RISK.MANAGED.’ WA Y
Corporate Responsibility (CR) issues 
have the potential to affect every part 
of our business. Adopting a robust and
integrated approach to CR makes 
sound business sense.
From a purely pragmatic point 
of view, it’s about managing risk and
opportunity: it gives us a way to make 
sure that non-ﬁnancial issues are recognised
and taken into account in the decisions 
we make and in the way we operate 
our businesses.
Our ‘Risk.Managed.’ approach applies 
to CR as much as it does to any of our
activities. Our continuing growth and
success depends on maintaining the trust,
conﬁdence and support of our customers,
our regulators and the communities in
which we operate.
Our measured, risk based approach to
business has lent itself to the development 
of a clear CR strategy for the group that
links to what our business is all about. 
This is to be a responsible ﬁnancial services
organisation, to be a good people business
and to be environmentally responsible. 
RESPONSIBILITY AND MANAGEMENT
Overall responsibility for CR rests with 
our Treasury & Risk Director. CR activity 
is co-ordinated by our CR Manager and is
overseen by a Steering Group, chaired by
the Company Secretary and comprising
senior managers from across the business.
BEING A RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL
SERVICES ORGANISATION
This year we have taken further action to
deliver our commitment as a responsible
ﬁnancial services organisation, for example,
the development of our ‘Licence to Sell’ and
‘Licence to Collect’ training programmes 
for our customer facing colleagues, which
exceed regulatory expectation. 
To equip potential future customers with 
the knowledge to manage their money
effectively, we have continued to promote
improvements in ﬁnancial education
through our support of Credit Action 
and DebtCred. 
We are also supporting the Park Lane
Financial Services Skills Academy in Leeds.
This is one of the ﬁrst academies to be set
up as part of the National Skills Academy
for Financial Services, launched by the
Government in October 2006.
BEING A GOOD PEOPLE BUSINESS
We have a strong training and development
culture. During 2006 we provided over
5,300 training days and launched our
Management Academy to develop the
management skills of talented individuals 
in the business.
Participation in our annual Speak Up 
survey of colleague engagement increased
signiﬁcantly to 84%. The survey showed
that 80% of our colleagues agree we care
about the community and the environment.
We continue to support Business in the
Community’s Cares programme and 
the hours volunteered by our people
increased by 20% in 2006. Their charitable 
support was also recognised in 2006 by 
a Payroll Giving Gold Award for our 
Cattles 50/50 programme from the 
Charities Aid Foundation.
BEING ENVIRONMENTALL Y
RESPONSIBLE
CO2 emissions from energy used in our
buildings have increased by 5% on a like 
for like basis, but the emissions from our
company car ﬂeet have fallen signiﬁcantly 
by 18% – reﬂecting a decrease in the size 
of the ﬂeet, the use of more efficient cars
and increased driver training.
The amount of paper we use has 
also reduced signiﬁcantly by 15% through
the introduction of new working practices 
and technology.
We were pleased to be recognised for 
our ‘signiﬁcant improvement’ in the 
2006 BITC Yorkshire and Humber 
Environmental Index.
THE YEAR AHEAD
We believe that we are improving our
reputation for CR across all our target
audiences and that we have continued 
to make signiﬁcant progress over the past
year, particularly with the development 
of our CR strategy. 
In 2007, our main focus will be the
integration of our CR strategy into the
operational thinking of each of our businesses.
Further information on our approach to 
CR, our performance in 2006 and our 
plans for 2007 can be found in our separate
Corporate Responsibility Review 2006
published with this Annual Report.

Financial Statements 2006
Statement, the Operating and Financial Review, the Report of the
Directors, the Report of the Board on Corporate Governance,
the Report of the Audit Committee and the unaudited part of the
Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements
and the part of the Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation
of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report of
the Board on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Report of the Board on Directors’
Remuneration to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of its
proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2006 and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
• the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report of the
Board on Directors’ Remuneration to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent
with the ﬁnancial statements.

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND
AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration and the ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International

Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and
the part of the Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group ﬁnancial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in
our opinion, the Report of the Directors is consistent with the
ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the Report of the
Directors includes that speciﬁc information presented in the
Operating and Financial Review that is cross referred from the
Business Review section of the Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Report of the Board on Corporate
Governance reﬂects the company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the Combined Code (2003) speciﬁed for our review by
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form
an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial
statements. The other information comprises only the sections on

Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 • Standard and amendment that are not yet effective and have not been
early adopted
The following standard and amendment to an existing standard
have been published and are mandatory for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007 or later periods, but which
the group and the company have not early adopted:
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, and the
complementary amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of ﬁnancial
statements – Capital disclosures’. This new and this amended
standard introduce new disclosures relating to ﬁnancial
instruments. They do not have any impact on the classiﬁcation
or valuation of ﬁnancial instruments. The new disclosures will
be made in the group’s and the company’s ﬁnancial statements
for the year ending 31 December 2007.
• Interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been early
adopted, which are not expected to have an impact
The following interpretations to existing standards have been
published and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on
or after 1 March 2006 or later periods, but are not expected to
have an impact on the group or the company:
• IFRIC 7 ‘Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29,
Financial reporting in hyperinﬂationary economies’
• IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’
• IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’
• IFRIC 10 ‘Interim ﬁnancial reporting and impairment’
• IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 - Group and treasury share transactions’
• IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’
Consolidation
A business combination is recognised where separate entities
or businesses have been brought together within the group.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to
govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies so as to obtain beneﬁts
from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more
than 50% of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated
from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. All subsidiaries
share the same reporting date, 31 December, as Cattles plc.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for
business combinations made by the group. The cost of a business
combination is measured as the fair value of the assets acquired,
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the
date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the business
combination.
Contingent consideration is included in the cost of a business
combination at the acquisition date only if the consideration is
probable and can be reliably measured, and is discounted using 
an appropriate discount rate. If the future events upon which the
contingent consideration is based do not occur or the estimate
needs to be revised or if contingent consideration, which had not
been initially included, does become probable and can be reliably
measured, the cost of the business combination, and any associated
goodwill, is adjusted accordingly.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cattles plc (the ‘company’) is a public company domiciled in the
UK. Its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The
consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the company for the year ended
31 December 2006 comprise the company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the ‘group’).
Statement of compliance
These consolidated and company ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS and its interpretations issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted
by the EU.
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements are rounded to the nearest million to one
decimal place. They are prepared under the historical cost convention,
as modiﬁed by the revaluation of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the
judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the
revision affects both current and future periods. Judgements made
by management in the application of IFRS that have a signiﬁcant
effect on the ﬁnancial statements and estimates with a signiﬁcant
risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 2
on pages 47 and 48.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied
consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated and
company ﬁnancial statements. The accounting policies have been
applied consistently by group entities.
• Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2006 but which
had no impact
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to
existing standards are mandatory for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2006, but they have had no
impact on the group or the company:
• IAS 21 (Amendment) ‘Net investment in a foreign operation’
• IAS 39 (Amendment) ‘Cash ﬂow hedge accounting of forecast
intra-group transactions’
• IAS 39 (Amendment) ‘The fair value option’
• IAS 39 and IFRS 4 (Amendment) ‘Financial guarantee contracts’
• IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources’
• IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease’
• IFRIC 5 ‘Rights to interests arising from decommissioning,
restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds’
• IFRIC 6 ‘Liabilities arising from participating in a speciﬁc
market – Waste electrical and electronic equipment’

The group has not held any held-to-maturity or available-for-sale
ﬁnancial assets at any point during the period.
Loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced to
borrowers, or at the date of purchase in respect of acquired debt.
These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus direct and
incremental transaction costs. Loans and receivables are carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt
or loss are recognised on the date of trade, the date on which the
group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets at
fair value through proﬁt or loss are initially recognised, and
subsequently carried, at fair value. Gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of these ﬁnancial assets are included in the
income statement in the period in which they arise. The group’s
ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss relate solely to
derivative instruments which cannot be designated as hedges.
Consequently, they are classiﬁed as derivative ﬁnancial instruments
in the balance sheet within assets or liabilities dependent on the
individual instruments’ fair value at the reporting date.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash
ﬂows from the ﬁnancial assets have expired or where the group has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value receivable for the sale of goods
and services, net of value added tax, and is recognised as follows:
• Interest income
Interest income is recognised in the income statement for all
ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. The effective interest method is a method of
calculating the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial asset and allocating
the interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest
rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash
ﬂows through the expected life, or contractual term if shorter, of
the ﬁnancial asset to the net carrying amount of the ﬁnancial
asset. When calculating the EIR, the group estimates cash ﬂows
considering all contractual terms of the ﬁnancial instruments, such
as early settlement options, but does not include an expectation
for future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees charged to
customers, such as acceptance or similar fees, and direct and
incremental transaction costs, such as broker commissions and
certain agents’ remuneration. All income relating to payment
protection insurance is regarded as being part of the group’s
economic return on the loans, hence the commission element is a
constituent part of the EIR and is included within interest income.
In respect of acquired debt, the EIR calculation is based on an
estimate of expected collections from the debt and takes account
of any initial costs, such as court fees.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in the
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at
the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the
fair value of the group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair
value of the net assets acquired, the difference is credited to the
income statement in the period of acquisition.
Inter-company income, expenses, balances and unrealised gains or
losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated on
consolidation.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged
in providing products or services that are subject to risks and
returns that are different from those of other business segments.
For management purposes, the group is organised into three
operating divisions, Consumer Credit, Debt Recovery and
Corporate Services. These divisions are, therefore, the basis on
which the group reports its primary segments.
A geographical segment is a group of assets and operations engaged
in providing products or services within a particular economic
environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different
from those segments operating in other economic environments.
The group’s operations are located only in the UK. Management
considers that all regions of the UK are subject to the same risks
and returns, such that no secondary geographic segments exist.
Financial assets
Management determines the classiﬁcation of the group’s ﬁnancial
assets at initial recognition into one of the following categories and
re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date:
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the group provides money directly to a customer
with no intention of trading the receivable. This classiﬁcation
includes advances made to customers under hire purchase
agreements and acquired debt.
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
This category has two sub-categories: ﬁnancial assets held for
trading; and those designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss
at inception. A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed as at fair value through
proﬁt or loss if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the
short-term or if so designated by management. Derivatives (refer to
the accounting policy entitled ‘Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and
hedging activities’) are also categorised as held for trading unless
they are designated as hedges.
Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets
with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturities that
the group has a positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Were the group to sell a signiﬁcant amount of held-to-maturity
assets the entire category would be tainted and reclassiﬁed as
available-for-sale.
43
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 The group ﬁrst assesses whether objective evidence of impairment
exists individually for loan assets that are individually signiﬁcant,
and either individually or collectively for loan assets that are not
individually signiﬁcant.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has occurred,
the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
cash ﬂows, excluding future credit losses that have not been
incurred, discounted at the loan asset’s original EIR. The carrying
amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a loan loss
provision. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income
statement as a loan loss charge within other cost of sales, except in
the case of acquired debt, where any impairment adjustment is
taken to revenue.
For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, loan
assets are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics.
Those characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash
ﬂows for groups of such assets by being indicative of the debtors’
ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
the assets being evaluated. Future cash ﬂows for a group of loan
assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated
on the basis of the contractual cash ﬂows of the assets and historical
loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to
those in the group. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the
basis of current observable data to reﬂect the effects of current
conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss
experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the
historical period that do not exist currently.
Where interest income continues to be recognised on impaired
loans, which cannot be collected from the customer due to the
interest being ﬁxed at the outset or interest having been suspended
on the customer’s account, referred to as the ‘gross-up adjustment’
to income, a corresponding loan loss charge is made. This is
referred to as the ‘gross-up adjustment’ to the loan loss charge
(refer to the revenue recognition accounting policy entitled
‘Interest income’).
Foreign currency translation
• Functional and presentational currency
The group’s ﬁnancial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling,
which is the company’s functional and presentational currency. All
subsidiaries of the group have Pounds Sterling as their functional
currency.
• Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement as
part of ﬁnance costs in relation to borrowings and as part of
administrative expenses in relation to other monetary assets and
liabilities.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Amounts due from lessees under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase
contracts are recorded as receivables at the amount of the group’s
net investment in the lease. Finance income is allocated to
accounting periods so as to reﬂect a constant periodic rate of
return on the group’s net investment (before tax) outstanding in
respect of the lease.
Interest income continues to be recognised at the EIR once a
ﬁnancial asset or a group of similar ﬁnancial assets has been
written down as a result of an impairment loss, irrespective of
the terms of the loan and whether interest has been suspended
on the customer’s account. This is referred to as the ‘gross-up
adjustment’ to income and is offset by a corresponding ‘gross-up
adjustment’ to the loan loss charge (refer to the accounting policy
entitled ‘Impairment of loans and receivables’).
• Brokerage and other income
The Consumer Credit division offers payment protection and
other insurance products, such as health, life and mechanical
breakdown insurance, to its customers for which a commission is
received from third party fronting insurers.
As set out in the accounting policy entitled ‘Interest income’,
commission received in relation to the sale of payment protection
insurance in included as part of the EIR of the associated loans.
Commission received for the brokering of the sale of other
insurance products, for which the group does not bear any
underlying insurance risk, is recognised and credited to the income
statement when the brokerage service has been provided.
Income from insurance proﬁt share arrangements with the
fronting insurer is recognised on an effective interest method in
respect of payment protection insurance and is recognised in line
with the incidence of risk in respect of other insurance products.
Brokerage commissions charged to third party lenders for the
introduction of new customers are credited to the income
statement when the service has been provided.
Brokerage and other income also includes fees and commissions
charged to customers and third parties for the collection of debts,
fees charged for marketing insurance products and fees charged
for the provision of invoice ﬁnance facilities, which are credited to
the income statement when the service has been provided.
• Sale of goods
Sales of goods, principally cars, are recognised when the group
entity has delivered the product to the customer, the customer has
accepted the product and collectibility of the related receivable is
reasonably assured.
Impairment of loans and receivables
In respect of loans and receivables, including receivables under hire
purchase contracts, the group assesses on an ongoing basis whether
there is objective evidence that a loan asset or a group of loan assets
is impaired. A loan asset or a group of loan assets is impaired and
impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the
initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and the loss event has
an impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of the loan asset or
group of loan assets that can be reliably estimated.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated
using the straight line method to allocate the costs to their residual
values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% pa
Leasehold buildings 2% to 20% pa
Fixtures and office equipment 10% to 20% pa
Computer hardware 20% to 33
1
⁄ 3% pa
Motor vehicles 20% pa
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and
adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its
recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying value is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds
with carrying amounts and are included in the income statement.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are initially recognised
at cost. The company recognises income from the investment only
to the extent that it receives distributions from post-acquisition
accumulated proﬁts. Distributions received in excess of such proﬁts
are regarded as a recovery of investment and recognised as a
reduction in the cost of the investment.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether there
is any indication that the investment may be impaired. If such an
indication exists, the company estimates the investment’s
recoverable amount. The investment is written down to the
recoverable amount if this is lower than its carrying value. The
impairment loss is recognised in the company’s income statement.
Inventories
Inventories comprise vehicles held for resale and are stated at the
lower of actual cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
variable selling expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash ﬂow statement, cash and cash
equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held with banks with
maturity dates of less than 3 months, and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the
balance sheet.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely
than not that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation; and the amount has been reliably measured.
Employee beneﬁts
• Short-term beneﬁts
Wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, social security
contributions, paid annual leave and non-monetary beneﬁts,
including death-in-service premiums, are accrued in the period
in which the associated services are rendered by employees of
the group.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Intangible assets
• Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the excess of the cost
of a business combination over the fair values of the group’s share
of the identiﬁable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised,
but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. For the purpose
of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating
units (CGUs). Each CGU is consistent with the group’s primary
reporting segments. Any impairment is recognised immediately
through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is
included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Up to 31 December 1997 under previous accounting policies,
goodwill arising on acquisitions was recognised as a deduction
from equity. On the subsequent disposal of any business to which
goodwill had been recognised as a deduction from equity, the
goodwill remains within equity and is not transferred to the
income statement.
• Computer software
Acquired software licenses are capitalised as intangible assets and
amortised over their useful lives (3-7 years) on a straight line
basis.
Costs that are directly attributable with the creation of identiﬁable
software, which meet the development asset recognition criteria as
laid out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’, are recognised as internally
generated intangible assets. Direct costs include the employment
costs of internal software developers, consultancy costs and
borrowing costs. Borrowing costs are capitalised until such time
as the internally generated software is substantially ready for its
intended use.
All other software development and maintenance costs are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are
amortised over their estimated useful lives (5-7 years) on a straight
line basis. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed,
and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Cost represents expenditure that is directly
attributable to the purchase of the asset. Certain land and buildings
are held at previous revalued amounts less subsequent accumulated
depreciation as these amounts have been taken as their deemed cost
as at the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2004) in accordance
with the exemption under IFRS 1.
Land and buildings are not subject to regular revaluations.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the items
will ﬂow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably.

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 vesting period and is calculated by reference to the fair value of
the shares or share options granted, excluding the effect of any
non-market vesting conditions.
In arriving at fair values, the Black-Scholes pricing model is used
and various assumptions are made, for example, on expected
forfeiture rates, dividend yields, share price volatility and risk free
rates. The estimate for the number of options that are expected to
become exercisable is revised at each balance sheet date. Any
impact from the revision of original estimates is recognised in the
income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based payment awards made by the company to employees
of subsidiary companies are reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements of
the company as an increase in the investments in subsidiary
undertakings with the corresponding credit being made in equity.
On transition to IFRS, the group elected not to apply IFRS 2 to
share awards granted before 7 November 2002, such that no
expense has been or is being recognised for them in the income
statement. Consequently, on the vesting of these awards, the cost
of the shares is recognised directly in retained earnings.
Leasing – as lessee
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as
ﬁnance leases. Assets held under ﬁnance leases or hire purchase
contracts are capitalised on inception of the agreement at an
amount equal to their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the
minimum lease payments. The interest element of the lease cost is
charged to the income statement, within administrative expenses,
over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under ﬁnance leases or hire
purchase contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the period of
the agreement and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as operating leases. Payments
made under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the
lessor, are charged to the income statement, within administrative
expenses, on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Borrowings
Borrowings include bank borrowings, debenture loans and other
borrowings, overdrafts and obligations under ﬁnance leases and hire
purchase contracts.
Bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings are
recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of
any transaction costs incurred. These borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds, net of
transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the
income statement over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method.
Current tax
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the period as
adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is
calculated using rates of tax that have been enacted by the balance
sheet date.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
• Pension obligations
The group has both a deﬁned beneﬁt and a number of deﬁned
contribution pension plans. The assets of the deﬁned beneﬁt
pension plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets is recognised in the balance sheet as the
retirement beneﬁt obligation. This obligation is recognised in the
company’s balance sheet since this entity is the plan’s sponsoring
employer. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected credit method. The
present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash ﬂows using interest rates
of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation takes account of an allowance for the
cash commutation option that members have at retirement, but
does not include a reserve for death-in-service beneﬁts or
non-investment related expenses.
The fair value of plan assets is based on bid prices at each balance
sheet date.
The total pension charge arising from the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
is included within administrative expenses. Actuarial gains and
losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in
actuarial assumptions are immediately recognised in the statement
of recognised income and expense. Past service costs are recognised
immediately within the income statement, unless the changes to
the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in
service for a speciﬁed period of time (‘the vesting period’). In this
case, past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over
the vesting period.
For deﬁned contribution plans, the group pays contributions into
privately administered pension plans on a contractual basis. The
contributions are recognised as an employee beneﬁt expense as
they fall due.
The group provides no other post-retirement beneﬁts to its
employees or directors.
• Termination beneﬁts
Termination beneﬁts are payable when employment is terminated
before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts
voluntary redundancy in exchange for these beneﬁts. The group
recognises termination beneﬁts when it is demonstrably
committed to either the termination of employment or a voluntary
redundancy offer.
• Share-based payments
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based
payment plans. In respect of share awards granted after
7 November 2002 (and not vested by 1 January 2005), in
accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’, an expense is
recognised in respect of the fair value of employee services
received in exchange for the grant of shares or share options.
A corresponding amount is recorded as an increase in equity
within retained earnings. The expense is spread over any relevant

Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required, at inception,
to document in advance the relationship between the item being
hedged and the hedging instrument. The group is also required to
document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows
that the hedge will be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash ﬂows of the hedged item on an ongoing basis. This
effectiveness testing is re-performed at each reporting date to ensure
that the hedge remains highly effective.
The effectiveness of hedging instruments is assessed using the
‘hypothetical derivative’ method. This involves the comparison of
the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument to a hypothetical
derivative which has critical terms that match the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as highly effective
fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement
within ﬁnance costs, together with the change in the fair value of
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives
designated as cash ﬂow hedging instruments is recognised in equity
within the hedging reserve. The change in the fair value relating to
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement within ﬁnance costs.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income
statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect proﬁt,
i.e. when the forecast interest payment that is hedged takes place.
When a cash ﬂow hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a
cash ﬂow hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,
any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or
loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the
income statement.
If a fair value hedging instrument no longer meets the effectiveness
criteria, the adjustment to the carrying value of a hedged item, for
which the effective interest method is used, is amortised to income
over the period to maturity.
2. KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND
JUDGEMENT
Loan loss provisioning
The group reviews its loans and receivables on an ongoing basis to
assess the level of impairment. Future cash ﬂows are estimated on
the basis of the contractual cash ﬂows of the assets and historical
loss experience. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the basis of
current observable data to reﬂect the effects of current conditions
that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience
is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical
period that do not exist currently. To the extent that the net present
value of estimated future cash ﬂows differs by +/- 1%, the loan loss
provision in the balance sheet would be an estimated £21.1 million
lower or £21.1 million higher.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which
case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when
the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability
is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity.
Shares are recorded at their nominal value with any surplus received
on their issue taken to the share premium account. Incremental
costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Where the company purchases its own shares, being held by the
trustee of the employee beneﬁt trust in respect of the Long-Term
Incentive Plan and Restricted Share Scheme, the consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from
equity on consolidation. Where such shares are subsequently sold or
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
transaction costs, is also included in equity on consolidation. These
transactions are classiﬁed as ‘own shares held’ within other reserves.
The consideration for the purchase of own shares paid by the
company is recognised as a receivable due from the trust within
trade and other receivables.
Dividend distribution
Final dividends payable to the company’s shareholders are recognised
in the group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the dividends
are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends
payable are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured
at fair value. The fair value of derivatives is determined by using a
valuation model and is primarily based on observable market data.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss from the
re-measurement depends on whether the derivative is designated as
a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The group’s policy is to designate on the date that the derivative
contract is committed to. The group designates derivatives as:
• A hedge of the fair value of a liability (‘fair value hedging
instrument’), or
• A hedge of the cost of a highly probable forecast transaction or
commitment (‘cash ﬂow hedging instrument’).

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 stable funding platform and greater certainty and control over
future funding costs. It is not the policy of the group to trade in
such instruments. The level of protection contracted for at any
particular time would not exceed the group’s exposure to actual or
projected borrowings, except in the event of short-term timing
differences. Further details of the derivative instruments held are set
out in note 24 on page 64.
The group maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term
committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the group
has sufficient available funds for current operations and planned
growth. Details of the changes in the group’s funding and headroom
are set out in note 22 on page 62 and note 24 on page 66.
The group is careful to avoid building a concentration of facilities
with a relatively small group of partners. In order to avoid such a
concentration the group has established funding in the bank, public
bond and US private placement markets. Bank facilities currently
include a syndicate of over 30 banking partners.
Credit risk and concentration
The group takes on exposure to credit risk in respect of loans and
receivables, which is the risk that a customer will be unable to pay
amounts in full when due. Loan loss provisions are provided for
losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date. Signiﬁcant
changes in the economy could result in losses that are different from
those provided for at the balance sheet date. Management therefore
carefully manages its exposure to credit risk.
At the time a loan is approved, direct repayment customers are
all in employment, have bank accounts and are able to repay their
borrowings via a direct debit payment. A signiﬁcant investment
in customer screening processes has been made in recent years,
including the transfer of almost all customer selection and
underwriting activities from branches to central processing units.
All applications for direct repayment credit are initially screened
centrally using a score card, which has been developed over many
years in conjunction with a leading credit referencing agency and
ensures consistency of underwriting decisions. Applications which
successfully pass this screening are then subject to a rigorous
pre-lending process, including the veriﬁcation of information
provided by potential customers and an assessment of other
ﬁnancial commitments which the applicant may have, in order to
conﬁrm that the loan is both appropriate and affordable. Exposure
to credit risk is managed in part with collateral obtained on
certain products.
Should a customer experience a longer-term adverse change in their
ﬁnancial position, account management is transferred from the local
branch to a specialist local collection unit (LCU). The LCU then
establishes a revised repayment schedule more suited to the
customer’s changed circumstances.
Home collect customers continue to be served with small value,
short-term advances (typically £300). Credit risk is managed
through regular analysis of the ability of borrowers to meet
repayments and credit limits are amended accordingly.
The risks from a concentration of credit risk are limited due to the
relatively low value of each customer’s debt and to the group’s large
and unrelated customer base.
2. KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND
JUDGEMENT continued
Goodwill impairment reviews
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of
the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has
been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to
estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash
generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate
present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet
date was £39.5 million. Details of the value in use calculation are
provided in note 14 on page 55.
Retirement beneﬁt obligation
The valuation of the retirement beneﬁt obligation is dependent
upon a series of assumptions, the key ones being mortality rates,
investment returns, salary inﬂation, the rate of pension increases
and the extent to which members take up the maximum tax free
commutation on retirement.
Mortality estimates are based on standard mortality tables,
adjusted where appropriate to reﬂect the group’s own experience.
The returns on ﬁxed interest investments are set to market yields
at the valuation date to ensure consistency with the asset valuation.
The returns on UK and overseas equities are set by considering
the long-term expected returns on these asset classes using a
combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking
views of the ﬁnancial markets (as suggested by the yields available)
and the views of investment organisations. The salary inﬂation and
pension increase assumptions reﬂect the long-term expectations for
both earnings and retail price inﬂation. The assumption as to how
many members will take up the maximum tax free commutation
on retirement is based on the scheme’s own experience of
commutation levels.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the retirement
beneﬁt obligation as at 31 December 2006 are set out in note 31 on
page 75.
3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Strategy in using ﬁnancial instruments
The group’s signiﬁcant debt ﬁnancing and customer lending exposes
it to a variety of potential ﬁnancial risks that include the effects of
changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, liquidity
and concentrations of both funding and customer credit. The group
has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the
adverse effects on the ﬁnancial performance of the group by using
other ﬁnancial instruments, such as interest rate and cross-currency
swaps to ﬁx interest rates.
The Board of directors has delegated, within limits, the policies
for setting out the treasury risk management policies applied by
the group to the Treasury & Risk Director. These policies are
implemented directly by the treasury team on behalf of the group.
The team has a risk management policy that sets out speciﬁc
guidelines to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risk
and the use of ﬁnancial instruments in relation to these.
The group’s long-standing treasury strategy of using appropriate
ﬁnancial derivative instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate
movements for borrowings remains in place. At 31 December 2006,
around 80% of the group’s total borrowings were protected against
future interest rate volatility, for an average period of approximately
four and a half years. This strategy has provided the group with a

Foreign currency risk
At 31 December 2006 the group had a US $110 million unsecured
loan note due for redemption at par in two parts in 2008 and 2011,
a further US $75 million unsecured loan note due for redemption at
par in two parts in 2011 and 2013 and a s6 million unsecured loan
note due for redemption at par in 2013. The group has a policy
that all foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately
swapped into Sterling at the commencement of the facility
agreement in order that the group is not exposed to currency rate
ﬂuctuations. The group entered into foreign exchange contracts at
the inception of these borrowings to eliminate this risk.
3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Interest rate risk
The group has minimal risk to revenue from changes in market
interest rates as almost all customer lending is at rates of interest
which are ﬁxed over the term of the contract. The group has a
similar low risk to changes in market interest rates for current
borrowing as around 80–90% of total borrowings are protected
against future interest rate volatility though the use of ﬁxed rate
borrowing (in the case of public bonds, private placement loan
notes, debentures, ﬁnance leases, hire purchase and other loans) 
or ﬂoating rate bank borrowings protected by interest rate swaps.
As a consequence, a hypothetical 1% (100 basis points) change 
in market interest rates at the balance sheet date would change the
group’s annual interest expense by around £3.5 million (2005: 
£2.0 million) with no noticeable impact at all on the group’s
revenue and receivables cash ﬂows.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held (note 29) which are treated, for this purpose, as being cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares.

Goodwill relates entirely to the group’s Consumer Credit division and the impairment review performed as at 31 December 2006
demonstrates signiﬁcant headroom.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations
are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, and expected changes to loan loss rates and direct costs. Management estimates discount
rates using pre-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the Consumer Credit
division. Changes in loan loss rates and direct costs are based on historic experience and expectations of short-term future changes in the
market. The group prepares a cash ﬂow forecast derived from the approved budget for the following year and extrapolates this in line
with historic long-term UK GDP growth. The cash ﬂows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.3%.
The company has no goodwill.

Signiﬁcant terms and conditions
The signiﬁcant terms of the group’s loans and receivables may be summarised as follows:
The Consumer Credit division has approximately 409,000 (2005: 358,000) direct repayment customers. Average advances are typically
£1,900 (2005: £1,500) for small unsecured personal loans, £6,200 (2005: £4,800) for HP loans for the purchase of cars and £8,700
(2005: £9,000) for secured loans. Interest on unsecured and secured loans is added monthly. Interest on hire purchase loans is
pre-computed at the outset with additional interest added monthly should an account become in arrears.
The group continues to disengage from those sectors of the home collected market regarded as being uneconomic. Consequently the
number of home collected customers has slightly reduced to 307,000 (2005: 308,000). Shopacheck continues to offer a home collected
product to customers who require small value short-term advances (typically £300). Interest on these loans is ﬁxed at the outset.
Lewis, the group’s debt recovery specialist continues to purchase default debt portfolios for which it has developed sophisticated pricing
models and processes to assess the economic value of such portfolios. The amount invested in the purchase of such portfolios in the year
was £69.5 million (2005: £32.7 million).
Invoices factored by Cattles Invoice Finance, the group’s invoice ﬁnancing business, are formally assigned to the company and are typically
repaid within 60 days.
Details of the weighted average effective interest rate for the group’s loans and receivables are in note 24.

20. DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary timing differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30% (2005: 30%).
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary timing differences giving rise to deferred tax
assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
All of the deferred tax liabilities are available for offset against deferred tax assets and hence the deferred tax asset at each balance sheet
date is shown net.
The movements in the deferred tax account during the year are shown below:

instruments or share-based payments.
Of the group and the company’s deferred tax balance at 31 December 2006, £14.7 million (2005: £25.2 million) and £10.1 million

24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Details of management’s policies for controlling the risks associated with ﬁnancial instruments, including policies on matters such as
hedging of risk exposures and avoiding undue concentrations of credit risk are given in note 3 on pages 48 and 49.
Interest rate risk
At 31 December 2006, the group held interest rate swaps covering unsecured ﬂoating rate bank borrowings of £707 million
(2005: £412 million), effectively ﬁxing the associated cost of interest at rates between 4.01% and 6.43% (2005: 4.01% and 6.43%). In
addition, the group held a collar covering a further £10 million (2005: caps and collars of £70 million), which is allowed to ﬂoat at a ﬂoor
rate of 4.25% and a cap rate of 4.75% (2005: rates between ﬂoors of 4.25% and 5.00% and caps of 4.75% and 6.25%).
Except for the group’s collar and two of its interest rate swaps, all of the group’s interest rate ﬁnancial instruments are designated as cash
ﬂow hedges. The gains and losses deferred in equity will be recorded in the income statement during the next ﬁve years (being the lives of
the instruments).
Foreign currency risk
All foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately swapped into Sterling at the commencement of the facility agreement and,
hence, the group is not exposed to currency rate ﬂuctuations.
Of the group’s cross-currency swaps, £75.5 million (2005: £75.5 million) are designated as fair value hedges and, as a consequence, the
change in the fair values of these swaps is recorded in the income statement within ﬁnance costs, together with the change in the fair values
of US Dollar denominated tranches of a Private Placing which the swaps have hedged.
The remaining £47.2 million (2005: £nil) of cross-currency swaps are designated as cash ﬂow hedges and were taken out to hedge against
the interest and currency risk associated with US Dollar and Euro denominated tranches of a Private Placing.
The following table shows the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, as well as the notional amount of the associated borrowing:

Obligations under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts (0.1) (0.1) (0.2) (0.2)
Intra-group borrowings (38.1) (38.1) (29.8) (29.8)
The fair value of loans and receivables equates to their carrying value as the carrying value represents the discounted amount of estimated
future cash ﬂows expected to be received. The discount rate used is the original EIR, which is consistent with the rates on new loans being
written.
The fair values of bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings are calculated by discounting expected future cash ﬂows at
appropriate market interest rates prevailing at each balance sheet date and at estimated future exchange rates.
The fair value of obligations under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts equates to their carrying values as the interest rates being
paid on these obligations are substantially the same as those prevailing in the current open market.
The fair values of intra-group loans and receivables and borrowings equates to their carrying values as the interest rates being earned and
charged on these items are based upon prevailing market rates.
The carrying values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and trade and other payables approximate
to fair value due to their relatively short maturity and are not shown in the above table.

discussed above.

*These assets and liabilities bear interest at ﬁxed rates
Interest on ﬂoating rate bank borrowings is based on a ﬁxed margin over ﬂoating rate LIBOR, as pre-determined by each facility agreement.
The weighted average effective interest rates on the group’s cash and bank overdrafts are based on the prevailing UK base rate less 0.1%
and plus 1.0% (2005: less 0.5% and plus 1.0%) respectively.
The weighted average effective interest rates in relation to the company’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are the same of those of the group,
except for loans and receivables which was 6.8% at 31 December 2006 (2005: 7.0%).

The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over an appropriate period, consistent with the assumed option life. The expected
life is the average expected period to exercise from the date of grant. The vesting period represents the contractual period to the earliest
vesting date. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Hedging reserve
From 1 January 2005, the group achieved hedge accounting such that the hedging reserve includes the effective portion of the cumulative
net change in the fair value of cash ﬂow hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. The reserve also
includes the unamortised portion of a hedging reserve which arose, in the absence of hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments:
Recognition & measurement’, on transition to IFRS of £0.7 million at 31 December 2006 (2005: £0.5 million). This element of the
hedging reserve is being amortised through the income statement in a way so as to reﬂect how the item that was being hedge accounted
under UK GAAP has affected proﬁt or loss in the period.
Own shares held reserve
The own shares held reserve comprises the cost of the shares in Cattles plc held by the employee beneﬁt trust to meet obligations under the
Restricted Share Scheme and the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The shares were acquired by the trust in the open market using funds provided
by the company.

to enable these amounts to be considered distributable.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve has arisen over numerous years in relation to past acquisitions. This reserve is considered non-distributable.

The group operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution pension plans.
Deﬁned contribution post-employment beneﬁt plans
The group operates a number of deﬁned contribution personal pension plans for new employees and for existing employees who are not
members of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The expense recognised for the deﬁned contribution plans is £1.2 million (2005: £0.9 million).
Deﬁned beneﬁt post-employment beneﬁt plan
The group operates a funded deﬁned beneﬁt scheme for certain employees, providing beneﬁts based on ﬁnal salary. The assets of the
scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an
independent qualiﬁed actuary using the projected unit method. The scheme was closed to new applicants from 1998.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the retirement beneﬁt obligation were as follows:
2006 2005
% %
Inﬂation rate 3.1 2.9
Discount rate 5.1 4.7
Expected return on assets 7.0 7.0
Rate of increase in pay (i) 4.6 4.4
Rate of increase of pensions in payment (ii) 3.1 2.9
Rate of increase for deferred pensioners (ii) 3.1 2.9
Proportion of members that will take maximum tax free commutation on retirement 75.0 n/a
(i) In addition, allowance is made for scale of age related promotional increases.
(ii) In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) element.
The most signiﬁcant non-ﬁnancial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity, which is based on the standard tables known as PA92,
projected to the year 2004, with an age rating of minus two years applied for non-pensioners and minus one year for pensioners.
The expected return on assets has been derived at the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes
(i.e. equities and bonds). The expected return for each class of asset, as shown below, reﬂects a combination of historical performance
analysis, the forward looking views of the ﬁnancial markets (as suggested by the yields available), and the views of investment
organisations.

which arose from the change in pension legislation effective from 6 April 2006 (A-Day).
The pension expense charge for the year is included in administrative expenses in the income statement.

Members contribute at the rate of either 3% or 5% of pensionable salaries, depending on their membership status. The estimated amount
of employee contributions for 2007 is £0.3 million.
The participating employer companies make normal contributions of 3.4 times members’ contributions such that the estimated amount of
normal employer contributions for 2007 is £1.0 million. In addition, the company has entered into an agreement with the pension scheme
whereby it will make additional shortfall contributions of £2.2 million per annum. Therefore, the estimated total amount of employer
contributions for 2007 is £3.2 million.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Report of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration and the ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements
for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors have prepared
the group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union. The ﬁnancial statements are required by law
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the
company and of the proﬁt or loss of the group for the period.
The directors submit their Annual Report together with the audited
ﬁnancial statements of the company and the group for the year
ended 31 December 2006.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activities of the group are described in the Operating
and Financial Review on pages 16 to 18. A list of principal
operating subsidiary undertakings is set out on page 78.
BUSINESS REVIEW
A review of the group’s businesses and a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties facing the group during the year ended

developments in the businesses of the group, are included in the
Operating and Financial Review on pages 19 to 29.
The Operating and Financial Review has been prepared in
accordance with ‘Reporting statement: Operating and ﬁnancial
review’ as published by the Accounting Standards Board.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS

(2005: £705.2 million) and proﬁt before taxation was
£132.2 million (2005: £115.1 million) as set out in the Income
Statement on page 38. An analysis of revenue and proﬁt before
taxation, by segmental activity, is set out in note 4 on pages 49
and 50. Details of the taxation charge for the year are set out in
note 10 on page 53.
A ﬁnal dividend of 11.85p per share is proposed by the directors
which, if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid on
15 May 2007 to shareholders on the register on 30 March 2007.
The ﬁnal dividend, together with the interim dividend of 5.65p paid
in October 2006, makes a total for the year of 17.50p per share.
Shareholders can again reinvest their cash dividend in shares
through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (‘the plan’). Shareholders
who have not previously completed a mandate and who require
details of the plan should contact the Registrars online at
www.computershare.com/investor/uk or by telephone on
0870 889 4021. New mandates must be received by close of
business on 23 April 2007 to be included in the plan for the ﬁnal
dividend. Further details are set out in Shareholder Information on
page 98.
The trustee of the Cattles Employee Beneﬁt Trust has agreed to
waive the right to receive dividends over and above 0.01p per share
on all shares it holds for the purpose of the Restricted Share Scheme
and the Long-Term Incentive Plan. In respect of the total dividend
for 2006 of 17.50p per share, the trustee has waived dividends of
£0.2 million (2005: £0.2 million) on the shares held during the year
ended 31 December 2006.

auditors and authorising the directors to determine the auditors’
remuneration will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
By order of the Board
ROLAND TODD
Company Secretary
15 March 2007
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state that the ﬁnancial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted
by the European Union; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis,
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue
in business in which case there should be supporting assumptions
or qualiﬁcations as necessary.
The directors conﬁrm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the group and the company and enable them to ensure
that the ﬁnancial statements and the Report of the Board on
Directors’ Remuneration comply with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the group and the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
These ﬁnancial statements will be published on the company’s
website, in addition to the paper version posted to shareholders.
The maintenance and integrity of the Cattles plc website is the
responsibility of the directors. The work carried out by the auditors
does not involve consideration of these matters.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination
of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
So far as each director who held office on 15 March 2007 (the date
of the approval of this report) is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company’s auditors are unaware and he
or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as
a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are
aware of that information.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Details of the group’s ﬁnancial risk management policies are set out
in note 3 on pages 48 and 49.
SHARE CAPITAL
During the year, the issued ordinary share capital of the company

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 THE ROLES OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The division of responsibilities between the non-executive
Chairman of the Board, N N Broadhurst, and the Chief Executive,
S P Mahon, is clearly deﬁned in writing and has been approved by
the Board.
The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of its strategy
and in the achievement of its objectives. The Chairman is
responsible for organising the business of the Board, ensuring its
effectiveness and setting its agenda. The Chairman has no
involvement in the day to day business of the group.
The Chief Executive has direct charge of the group on a day to day
basis and is accountable to the Board for the ﬁnancial and
operational performance of the group.
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
D A Haxby continues to perform the role of Senior Independent
Director. D A Haxby is available to meet shareholders on request
and to ensure that the Board is aware of shareholder concerns not
resolved through the existing mechanisms for investor
communication.
DIRECTORS AND DIRECTORS’ INDEPENDENCE
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, four executive
directors and four independent non-executive directors. The names
of the directors together with their biographical details are set out
on pages 80 and 81. All the directors served throughout the period
under review, except for M A Young who was appointed on
1 February 2006. The Board includes independent non-executive
directors who constructively challenge and help develop proposals
on strategy, and bring strong, independent judgement, knowledge,
and experience to the Board’s deliberations. The independent
directors are of sufficient calibre and number that their views carry
signiﬁcant weight in the Board’s decision making.
Independent professional advice is provided at the company’s
expense, when the directors deem it necessary in order for them to
carry out their responsibilities.
Details of the Chairman’s professional commitments are included in
the Chairman’s biography. The Chairman holds the chairmanship of
one other listed company and one private company and two other
non-executive directorships but the Board is satisﬁed that these do
not interfere with the performance of his duties to the company
which are based around a commitment of approximately 80 days
per annum. The Chairman ceased to be a non-executive director of
Tomkins plc during the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Board considers all its other non-executive directors to be
independent in character and judgement. No independent
non-executive director:
• has been an employee of the group within the last ﬁve years;
• has, or has had within the last three years, a material business
relationship with the group;
• receives remuneration other than a director’s fee;
The Board of Cattles plc aims to maintain the highest standards of
corporate governance in the belief that such standards are essential
to the process of delivering long-term growth in proﬁts and
dividends. Throughout the year ended 31 December 2006, the
company complied with the provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code on Corporate Governance, except that the Chairman of the
Board, N N Broadhurst, became a member of the Remuneration
Committee on 5 December 2006 as permitted by the 2006 FRC
Combined Code on Corporate Governance which applies to the
ﬁnancial year starting on 1 January 2007 but did not apply during
the year ended 31 December 2006.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The company is managed through the Board of directors. The
Board’s main roles are to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the
company within a framework of prudent and effective controls
which enables risk to be assessed and managed, to set the company’s
strategic aims and to ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial and human
resources are in place for the company to meet its objectives and so
increase shareholder value.
Normally, there are seven regular Board meetings a year, together
with a further meeting which is dedicated to considering the group’s
budget for the following year and a day devoted to reviewing the
group’s business strategy, with additional meetings being held as
required. All directors attended each of the seven regular meetings
held during 2006 (except for A J McWalter who did not attend two
meetings due to illness). There are a number of matters speciﬁcally
reserved for Board approval, which include approval of the group’s
overall business strategy, planning and annual budgets, assessment
of internal controls and risk management, senior management
appointments, approval of major contracts and signiﬁcant
acquisitions, investment and capital expenditure decisions and
corporate governance practices, as well as the group’s ﬁnancing and
dividend policies.
At each regularly scheduled Board meeting, there is a full ﬁnancial
and business review and discussion, which includes the comparison
of trading performance to date against the annual budget and any
other ﬁnancial plan which has been previously approved by the
Board for that year. Each Board member receives a comprehensive
Board pack prior to each meeting, which incorporates a formal
agenda, separate reports from the Chief Executive and each of the
executive directors on their speciﬁc areas of responsibility, together
with supporting papers for items to be discussed at the meeting.
Board papers are usually sent out one week before the meeting to
give the directors sufficient time to prepare for a comprehensive
review of the relevant issues at the meeting.
The Board has delegated the following responsibilities to the
executive directors: the development and recommendation of
strategic plans for consideration by the Board that reﬂect the
longer-term objectives and priorities established by the Board;
implementation of the strategies and policies of the group as
determined by the Board; monitoring of the operating and ﬁnancial
results against plans and budgets; monitoring the quality of the
investment process against objectives; prioritising the allocation of
capital, technical and human resources; and developing and
implementing risk management systems.
REPORT OF THE BOARD ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006
84
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 REPORTS OF THE BOARD
Individual written personal objectives in relation to their
management roles are prepared at the beginning of the ﬁnancial
year by each executive director. After agreement with the Chief
Executive, and in the case of the Chief Executive with the Chairman,
these objectives are submitted to the Remuneration Committee for
consideration and approval on behalf of the Board. The Chief
Executive conducts an annual appraisal of the performance of the
other executive directors which includes an assessment of their
individual performance against their personal objectives set at the
beginning of the accounting period and a formal interview. The
same process is conducted by the Chairman in respect of the Chief
Executive. The extent to which executive directors’ personal
objectives have been achieved is determined during this review
process, the results of which are submitted to, and taken into
account by, the Remuneration Committee in ﬁnalising the executive
directors’ bonuses for the year.
RE-ELECTION
Subject to the company’s Articles of Association, the Companies
Acts and satisfactory performance evaluation, non-executive
directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, but may
be invited to serve one or two additional three year terms if the
Nomination Committee believes this to be appropriate. The
re-appointment of directors who have served for more than nine
years is subject to annual review and re-election by the
shareholders.
THE COMPANY SECRETARY
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board
through the Chairman on all governance matters. The directors
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
The company’s Articles of Association and the schedule of matters
reserved to the Board for decision provide that the appointment and
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the full Board.
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
The Board has established three standing Committees, each with
formal terms of reference, being the Audit Committee, the
Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee.
The terms of reference are published on the company’s website.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all three standing
committees.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Details of the Audit Committee and its activities during 2006 are set
out in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 88 and 89.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Details of the Remuneration Committee and its activities during
2006 and the group’s remuneration policy are set out in the Report
of the Board on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 90 to 97.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman, the four
independent non-executive directors (D A Haxby, F Dee,
A J McWalter and M A Young) and the Chief Executive under the
chairmanship of the Chairman of the Board, N N Broadhurst. The
Nomination Committee’s terms of reference include preparing a
description of the role and capabilities required for a new Board
appointment in light of the balance of skills, knowledge and
experience on the Board and the company’s requirements,
• has close family ties with any of the group’s advisers, directors or
senior employees;
• holds cross-directorships or has signiﬁcant links with other
directors through involvement in other companies or bodies;
• represents a signiﬁcant shareholder; or
• has served on the Board for more than nine years.
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
On appointment, the directors take part in an induction programme
when they receive information about the group, the role of the
Board and the matters reserved for its decision, the terms of
reference and membership of the principal Board committees,
together with the powers delegated to those committees, the group’s
corporate governance practices and procedures, and the latest
ﬁnancial information about the group. This is supplemented by
visits to key locations and meetings with key senior executives.
Throughout their period in office the directors are continually
updated on the group’s business, the competitive, legal and
regulatory environment in which it operates and other changes
affecting the group and the ﬁnancial services industry by written
brieﬁngs and Board presentations by senior executives. Directors are
also updated on changes to their legal and other duties and
obligations as directors of a listed company.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The Board has established a formal process led by the Chairman for
the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its principal
committees and the individual directors, with particular attention
being paid to those who are due for re-appointment. The directors
are made aware, on appointment, that their performance will be
subject to an evaluation.
In 2006 the directors completed a questionnaire which was
circulated by the Company Secretary and was designed to gain an
insight into how well the Board and its Committees were meeting
their objectives. The questionnaire included the former Chairman’s
summary of progress made during 2005 against the matters
identiﬁed for attention in the 2004 self-evaluation process and
asked the directors to state whether or not those matters had been
addressed. The Company Secretary then collated the completed
results from the questionnaires and presented the consolidated
results to the Chairman.
The Chairman conducts the annual appraisals of the four executive
directors in relation to their duties as directors of the company and
the four non-executive directors. These appraisals are conducted in
separate meetings between the Chairman and each director, at
which the director’s contribution to Board proceedings is reviewed
and the director’s views on his or her own performance and the
operation of the Board identiﬁed in the self-evaluation questionnaire
are discussed. The Chairman reports to the Board on any issues
requiring Board consideration.
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive directors
meet annually, without the presence of the Chairman, to conduct a
performance evaluation of the Chairman. The Senior Independent
Director subsequently has a meeting with the Chairman on a similar
basis as the Chairman’s meeting with each director.

In addition to regular ﬁnancial reporting, signiﬁcant matters relating
to the trading or development of the group are disseminated to the
market by way of Stock Exchange announcements. The company’s
website, www.cattles.co.uk, includes a section focusing speciﬁcally
on investor relations. All such announcements are accessible on the
website once made within the news room section. In addition,
the materials used in the presentations to analysts of the company’s
Interim and Final Results and the webcasts of these presentations
are accessible on the website after the presentations have been made.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
Financial Reporting
The directors believe that the Annual Report presents a balanced
and understandable assessment of the group’s ﬁnancial position and
prospects. The Chairman’s Statement and the Operating and
Financial Review, which can be found on pages 6 to 34, together
provide a detailed assessment of the group’s affairs. The directors’
responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements are described in the
Report of the Directors on pages 82 and 83. The company’s
ﬁnancial statements are reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to
being submitted to the Board for approval.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the group’s
internal control system, which is designed to safeguard
shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets and embraces all
risks faced by the group, including business, ﬁnancial, operational
and compliance risks. The directors recognise, however, that there
are inherent limitations in any system of internal control and as
such the controls can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The group has complied with the guidance provided by the
Financial Reporting Council in a document entitled ‘Internal
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code
(October 2005)’ (‘Turnbull guidance’), through an ongoing process
to identify and evaluate key areas of risk, both ﬁnancial and
non-ﬁnancial, the group’s perceived tolerance or commercial
appetite towards such risks and the policies and procedures which
should be adopted in order to manage the likely exposure and to
review the operation and effectiveness of the group’s internal
control system. This process, which has been in place throughout
the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report, is
regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Turnbull
guidance.
identifying and nominating candidates for appointment to the
Board for the approval of the Board and reviewing the succession
plans for the Board and senior management.
The Nomination Committee has access to recruitment consultants
to ensure it receives objective and independent advice. During 2006
the Nomination Committee met formally on two occasions and
reviewed the succession plans for the Board and senior management.
All members of the Nomination Committee attended both of the
meetings held in 2006.
M A Young was appointed as an independent non-executive
director on 1 February 2006 upon the recommendation of the
Nomination Committee and with the assistance of recruitment
consultants. N N Broadhurst became Deputy Chairman on
1 January 2006 and non-executive Chairman on 11 May 2006
upon the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which
considered him to be ideally qualiﬁed for the role in view of his
business experience and ﬁve years with the company. When
considering N N Broadhurst’s appointment as Deputy Chairman
and then Chairman, the Committee met with the Senior
Independent Director, D A Haxby, chairing the proceedings and
neither the then Chairman, B Cottingham, nor N N Broadhurst
played any part in the process. In making this recommendation, the
Committee ensured that N N Broadhurst could commit sufficient
time to the role. N N Broadhurst was an independent non-executive
director upon his appointment as Chairman.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board maintains a close relationship with the company’s major
shareholders. The Chief Executive, Finance Director, Treasury &
Risk Director and Chief Operating Officer maintain regular contact
with major institutional shareholders, who are offered a personal
meeting with the Chief Executive and other executive directors at
least twice each year. The Chairman usually attends the
presentations to analysts of the company’s Interim and Final Results
and all major shareholders are offered a personal meeting with the
Chairman and Senior Independent Director, if they so require.
Major shareholders are also given the opportunity to meet new
non-executive directors on their appointment. Major shareholders
are also offered the opportunity to provide non-attributed feedback
to the Board through discussions with the company’s stockbrokers,
HSBC Bank plc and Citigroup Global Markets Limited.
As required by the Combined Code, the Chairman relays to the
Board any issues raised with him by shareholders. This is
supplemented by a report by the Chief Executive of shareholders’
views following the presentations of the Interim and Final Results.
The directors also receive reports from the company’s advisers on
the market’s views of the company both before and after the
announcement of the Interim and Final Results and copies of
analysts’ reports. In October 2005, the Board appointed Makinson
Cowell to carry out an audit of the views of the company’s major
institutional shareholders in order to ascertain their understanding
of, and attitudes to, the company and its standing in the equity
market. Makinson Cowell presented their ﬁndings to the directors
in February 2006.

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 REPORTS OF THE BOARD
• Adoption of a schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved for the
approval of the Board ensuring that it maintains full and effective
control over appropriate ﬁnancial, strategic, organisational and
compliance issues. As described on page 84, the Board has
identiﬁed a number of key areas, which are subject to regular
reporting to the Board.
• The Board also reviews the role of insurance in managing risks
across the group.
GOING CONCERN
Under company law, the directors are required to consider whether
it is appropriate to prepare ﬁnancial statements on the basis that the
company and the group are going concerns. As part of its normal
business practices, the group prepares annual budgets and
longer-term ﬁnancial and business plans. In reviewing this
information, the directors are satisﬁed that the company and the
group have adequate resources to continue in business for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
By order of the Board
ROLAND TODD
Company Secretary
15 March 2007
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the operation and
effectiveness of the internal control system on at least a six monthly
basis and reporting to the Board thereon. Such reviews have been
conducted during the ﬁnancial year. The principal features of the
group’s internal control system can be summarised as follows:
• Primary responsibility of the Board to ensure that the major
business risks facing the group are identiﬁed and that appropriate
policies are developed for the management of those risks. The
Board, however, recognises that the internal control system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives.
• A clearly deﬁned organisational structure with lines of
responsibility and delegation of authority to divisional executive
management supported by established policies and procedures.
• The engagement of a leading ﬁrm of professional advisers for the
provision of a complete range of internal audit services, with a
direct reporting link to the Audit Committee.
• A Risk Management Group, comprising the executive directors
and other key members of senior management including risk
specialists, reviews key group risks together with the effectiveness
of the group’s controls to manage and reduce the impact of these
risks. This review includes the adoption of procedures which are
designed to capture and evaluate any failings or weaknesses in the
internal control system. The Risk Management Group meets twice
yearly and reports to the Audit Committee.
• Delegation of the responsibility for ongoing maintenance of
the system of internal control procedures to the executive
management, with speciﬁcally designated Risk Champions for all
business areas and appropriate working parties. The system
ensures that successive assurances are provided to ascending levels
of management and changes in the risk proﬁles for all business
areas are monitored and reported on a monthly basis. The group
is continuing to develop its risk management framework further
to ensure that risk monitoring and reporting is embedded at all
levels of management and throughout all areas of the group’s
operations.
• Arrangements by which staff of the group may raise concerns in
conﬁdence about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial
reporting or other matters, together with arrangements for the
proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and
for appropriate follow-up action and reporting to the Board.
• Operation of a comprehensive planning and ﬁnancial reporting
system, which covers income, expenditure, cash ﬂows and balance
sheets. Annual budgets and medium-term plans are approved by
the Board and monitored against actual performance on a
monthly basis to identify any signiﬁcant deviation from approved
plans. The annual budget is reviewed and reforecast on a regular
basis.

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 The chairman of the Committee, M A Young, qualiﬁed and
practised as a Chartered Accountant (ACA) and has signiﬁcant,
relevant and up to date ﬁnancial and accounting knowledge and
experience. M A Young is chairman of the audit committee of
Uniq plc and was previously a managing director of Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette and then Credit Suisse First Boston (1997 to
2001) and a director of Natwest Markets Corporate Finance
Limited (1985 to 1997). The other members of the Committee have
a wide range of business experience which is evidenced in their
biographical details on page 81.
MEETINGS
The Committee normally meets three times a year and did so in
2006. All members of the Audit Committee attended each of the
three meetings held in 2006 while they were members of the
Committee, except for A J McWalter who missed one meeting
due to illness. Both the external auditors and internal auditors
and the Finance Director and the Treasury & Risk Director attend
all meetings of the Committee. The Chairman of the Board and the
other executive directors usually attend meetings of the Committee
at the invitation of the Committee chairman. The external auditors
have a conﬁdential discussion with members of the Committee
without the executive directors being present during part of each
meeting.
WORK OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee discharges its duties as follows:
• At its meetings in March and September, the Committee reviews
the company’s preliminary announcement and Annual Report
and Financial Statements and interim announcement respectively.
At each of these meetings the Committee receives a report from
the external auditors setting out any accounting or judgemental
issues which require its attention.
• A report from the internal auditors is reviewed at the meetings in
March, September and December. The Committee considers the
internal auditors’ work plan for the following year at its
December meeting.
• The Committee considers the external auditors’ pre-year end
issues report at its December meeting and their audit plan at its
September meeting.
• At its September and December meetings the Committee reviews
the reports of the Risk Management Group, which comprises the
executive directors and other key members of senior management
including risk specialists and considers the key risks facing the
group and the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls to
manage and reduce the impact of those risks.
INTRODUCTION
This report to shareholders has been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of paragraph C.3.3 of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance and paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 of the Guidance
on Audit Committees produced by Sir Robert Smith. This report
gives details of the work of the Committee in discharging its
responsibilities.
TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Committee’s terms of reference, which can be found on the
company’s website, are reviewed annually by the Committee and
any changes are approved by the Board.
The main duties of the Committee set out in the terms of
reference are:
• monitoring the integrity of the company’s ﬁnancial statements;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls and
risk management systems;
• reviewing the company’s arrangements for employees to raise
concerns, in conﬁdence, about possible wrongdoing in ﬁnancial
reporting and other matters;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s
internal audit function in the context of the company’s overall risk
management system;

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
88
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 REPORTS OF THE BOARD
The external auditors are not permitted to provide internal audit,
risk management, litigation support, remuneration advice and legal
advice services. The provision of other non-audit services is
awarded on a case-by-case basis, depending on which professional
services ﬁrm is considered best suited to perform the work.
These safeguards, which are monitored by the Audit Committee,
are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain
appropriate. The appointment of the external auditors to provide
non-audit services requires Board approval for any assignments
with fees above a set ﬁnancial limit.
The external auditors report to the Audit Committee each year on
the actions they have taken to comply with professional and
regulatory requirements and best practice designed to ensure their
independence, including the rotation of key members of the external
audit team. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have formally conﬁrmed
their independence to the Board, in respect of the period covered by
these ﬁnancial statements.
The disclosure of the non-audit fees paid to the external auditors
during the year is included in note 9 to the ﬁnancial statements, on
page 52.
MARGARET YOUNG
Chairman of the Audit Committee
15 March 2007
• At its March and September meetings the Committee considers
the annual and half-yearly risk and compliance reports produced
by the Treasury & Risk Director in relation to the preceding year
and half-year respectively.
• The Committee reviews the fees paid to the external auditors for
audit and non-audit services at all its meetings and at its March
meeting it assesses the external auditors’ independence and makes
a recommendation to the Board as to the appointment or
re-appointment of the auditors at the Annual General Meeting.
INDEPENDENCE OF AUDITORS
Both the Audit Committee and the external auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have put in place safeguards to avoid
the auditors’ objectivity and independence being compromised.
The group’s policy with regard to services provided by its external
auditors is as follows:
Statutory audit services
The external auditors, who are appointed annually by the
shareholders, undertake this work. The external auditors also
provide services in respect of the provision of a review opinion on
the company’s Interim Report, perform work in their capacity as
reporting accountant in accordance with the Prospectus Rules and
provide regulatory services and formalities relating to other
circulars. The Audit Committee reviews the auditors’ performance
on an ongoing basis.
Tax compliance and tax advisory
Tax compliance involves dealing with the group’s corporation tax
returns and this work is carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP . Tax advisory services include tax planning and structuring
advice for direct and indirect taxes. The group’s policy is for each
individual assignment to be assessed separately and awarded
depending on which professional services ﬁrm is considered best
suited to perform the relevant work.
Other non-audit services
This category includes work relating to due diligence and other
non-regulatory reporting. The group’s normal policy is to appoint
the external auditors to undertake this work because of their
knowledge and experience of the business. However, the Board
reviews their independence and expertise on every assignment. In
2006 this category included work in connection with the possible
offer for London Scottish Bank plc. In 2005 this category included
work relating to the group’s adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards.
89
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 The Chairman does not participate in any discussions relating to his
own remuneration and absents himself from the meeting when his
own remuneration is being considered. The Chief Executive and the
Treasury & Risk Director are consulted by the Committee but do
not participate in any discussions relating to their own
remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate
and retain directors of the high calibre necessary to maintain the
group’s strong growth and proﬁt performance and to reward them
for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement
of the executive directors and the determination of their annual
remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration packages of
executive directors:
• Basic salary and beneﬁts;
• Annual bonus;
• Long-term incentives; and
• Pension and life assurance arrangements.
The company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive directors should be
performance-related. As described below, each of the executive
directors may participate in both an annual bonus scheme and
long-term incentive arrangements.
When determining remuneration levels for the executive directors,
consideration is given to pay levels elsewhere in the group.
Fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by the
Remuneration Committee (excluding the Chairman) in consultation
with the Chief Executive. Fees paid to non-executive directors, other
than the Chairman, are determined by a sub-committee of the
Board comprising the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
and the Finance Director.
BASIC SALARY AND BENEFITS
The basic salaries of the executive directors are determined by the
Remuneration Committee, prior to the beginning of each year,
taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the
individual director and having regard to relevant market
comparisons from independent sources based on objective research
conducted by NBSC.
More particularly, consideration was given to basic salary levels
paid in a group of approaching 60 companies drawn from all
sectors which had similar market capitalisations to that of the
company. Companies with similar market capitalisations that
operated remuneration arrangements which the Committee did not
believe reﬂected typical practice were not considered so as to ensure
that the benchmark data gave a true and accurate picture of market
levels of pay. The Committee’s policy is to pay basic salaries around
the median while (as stated above) taking account of the
responsibilities and performance of each director.
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (‘the Regulations’) and also
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority.
The report describes how the Board has applied the Principles of
Good Governance relating to directors’ remuneration and, in
accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company in
May 2007.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the company’s
members on the ‘auditable part’ of the directors’ remuneration
report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited
information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Three of the independent non-executive directors, D A Haxby as
chairman, F Dee and A J McWalter have been members of the
Committee throughout 2006. N N Broadhurst was a member of
the Committee and an independent non-executive director until
11 May 2006 when he became Chairman of the Board and resigned
from the Committee. He was then re-appointed as a member of the
Committee on 5 December 2006. All members of the Remuneration
Committee attended each of the six meetings held in 2006 while
they were members of the Committee, except for A J McWalter
who missed two meetings due to illness. None of the Committee
members has any personal ﬁnancial interest in the company other
than as a shareholder, nor have they any day to day involvement in
the running of the business or conﬂicts of interests arising from
cross-directorships.
One of the main duties of the Committee is to determine the
remuneration of the executive directors, the Chairman and the
Company Secretary and to monitor the level and structure of
remuneration for speciﬁed senior managers below Board level.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which can be found on the
company’s website, are reviewed annually by the Committee and
any changes are approved by the Board.
The Committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
(NBSC) as its remuneration consultants. NBSC has no other
connection with the company. NBSC advises the Committee directly
on matters within the Committee’s terms of reference on which the
Committee chooses to consult NBSC. NBSC may also advise the
company generally on aspects of executive and employee
remuneration, typically on the implementation and ongoing
operation of executive remuneration schemes. NBSC advises a
sub-committee of the Board from time to time on the remuneration
of the non-executive directors, other than the Chairman.
REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006
90
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 REPORTS OF THE BOARD
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
The LTIP was adopted in May 2005 to replace the Restricted Share
Scheme, which expired in 2004. Participation is at the discretion of
the Committee and participants include the executive directors and
other senior executives who are best placed to inﬂuence the
performance of the group. Following a review of their remuneration
packages, participation in the LTIP was extended during 2006 to
eight senior executives in the management grade immediately below
the executive directors to ensure that every member of the
company’s senior executive team has an additional incentive to
deliver excellent returns to shareholders.
The LTIP has two elements, an award of ‘Performance Shares’
and an award of ‘Matching Shares’ linked to an investment in
Cattles plc shares (together ‘Awards’). Awards will normally vest
following the third anniversary of the date of grant provided that
challenging performance conditions have been satisﬁed and the
participant remains in employment.
In normal circumstances, Awards of Performance Shares may not be
granted to any participant in any ﬁnancial year under the LTIP if it
would cause the aggregate market value of those shares to exceed
100% of the participant’s basic salary. However, to provide the
Committee with a market standard degree of ﬂexibility to operate
the LTIP in the best interests of shareholders and to take account of
particular circumstances as they may arise, in exceptional
circumstances Awards of Performance Shares worth up to 200% of
basic salary may be granted. In 2006, the Committee (after careful
consideration and fully mindful of the interests of shareholders)
decided to exercise the ﬂexibility afforded to it under this provision
and made Awards of Performance Shares to the executive directors
worth 115% of basic salary. The Committee believes that this
approach was entirely appropriate for the following reasons:
• the granting of Awards in 2006 was delayed for eight months due
to the company being in a prohibited period for a substantial
portion of this year. This will lead to a delay in the vesting of
awards in 2010 (should the challenging performance conditions
described below be met);
• on the ultimate date of grant, the Cattles plc share price was
higher than it was on the date on which the grants would (but for
the company being in a prohibited period) have been made earlier
in the year; and
• while the Committee had ﬂexibility to award Performance Shares
up to 200% of basic salary, it did not consider it necessary to do
so (hence the grant value of 115% of basic salary which is not
materially higher than the ‘normal’ limit of 100% of basic salary
and is lower than the maximum award limit in many similar
plans operated by FTSE 250 companies).
Awards of Matching Shares are granted to the extent that participants
acquire Cattles plc shares using their annual bonus (‘Investment
Shares’). Under the company’s annual bonus plan, any annual bonus
in excess of 75% of basic salary payable to an executive director must
be deferred into the company’s shares. These shares are treated as
Investment Shares which will qualify for the grant of Matching
Shares. Participants are also allowed to invest their cash bonus (but
no other funds) on a voluntary basis into Cattles plc shares and treat
those shares as Investment Shares. The maximum aggregate pre-tax
Following the Committee’s review in late 2006 applying this policy,
the Board agreed the following changes to the annual salaries of the
executive directors with effect from 1 January 2007:
1 January 2007 1 January 2006
£’000 £’000
S P Mahon 550 525
M W G Collins 305 290
J J Corr 305 290
I S Cummine 370 350
In making these recommendations to the Board, the Committee also
took account of the continued outstanding performance of the
group, a main driver of which has been the exceptional performance
and commitment of the company’s executive directors.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain
beneﬁts in kind, being a car, fuel provision, private medical
insurance and permanent health insurance.
ANNUAL BONUS
The targets which trigger annual cash bonuses are set by the
Remuneration Committee. In 2006 these targets comprised the
following three measures of performance: (i) the group’s actual
earnings per share (EPS) growth; (ii) funds utilisation efficiency as
measured against budget; and (iii) the achievement of each director’s
personal objectives. The maximum potential bonus payment to
executive directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006
was restricted to 100% of basic salary, with a maximum of 75%
being payable in respect of EPS growth, 15% in respect of funds
utilisation efficiency and 10% in respect of the achievement of
personal objectives. Any bonus earned over 75% of 2007 basic
salary must be deferred into shares which will not be received by
the executive directors for a further three years. Such deferred
shares count for the purposes of the ‘Matching Shares’ element of
the Long-Term Incentive Plan described more fully below, but are
not subject to further performance conditions.
The Committee has retained this structure for the 2007 executive
directors’ annual cash bonuses.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by
executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link
between their personal interests and those of shareholders, and
provides the opportunity for longer-term motivation and retention.
The company’s policy is that the executive directors are required to
build up and retain a shareholding in the company, primarily from
their long-term incentive arrangements, equivalent to their annual
salary. The Committee reviewed the company’s long-term incentive
arrangements during 2006 in respect of their operation, grant levels,
performance criteria and vesting schedules to ensure they remain
appropriate to the company’s current circumstances and prospects.
Following this review, the Committee exercised its discretion and
made changes to the operation of the Long-Term Incentive Plan as
described below.
91
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 Should the Committee believe that circumstances make it
appropriate to set higher real EPS growth targets (in absolute terms)
for future Awards than those applied to Awards made in 2006, it
will apply such higher targets.
As described, in order to provide a comparative element to the
performance conditions, the performance conditions will be
adjusted by reference to the company’s EPS performance over the
performance period relative to an ‘average’ EPS growth of
companies comprised in the FTSE 250 (the ‘Index’), calculated by
dividing the Index by the price/earnings ratio of the Index.
If the company’s EPS growth over the performance period is lower
than the average EPS growth of the Index, the level of vesting of
Awards will reduce by 1% for every 4% (subject to a maximum
reduction of 25%) that the company’s EPS growth is lower than the
Index ‘average’. To the extent that the company’s EPS growth is
higher, the level of vesting of Awards will increase by 1% for every
4% up to (but not exceeding) the maximum level of vesting.
After a review during 2006 the Committee continues to consider
that the use of EPS in the LTIP is appropriate as it encourages the
company’s senior management team to deliver sustained exceptional
EPS growth (and, therefore, returns to shareholders), with EPS
being a widely used statistic.
The LTIP operates in conjunction with an employee beneﬁt trust
(‘Trust’), the trustee of which is Cattles Trustee Limited, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Cattles plc. The directors of the trustee
company are three of the members of the Remuneration
Committee, all of whom are independent non-executive directors of
the parent company, and none of whom is a beneﬁciary under the
Trust or LTIP . On the grant or before the vesting of Awards, the
Trust purchases sufficient shares in the market to satisfy such
awards, hence there is no issue of new shares. On the vesting of
Awards, the Trust transfers the appropriate number of shares to the
participants. The Trust will at no time hold more than 5% of the
issued share capital of Cattles plc. The LTIP is funded by loans from
the company to the Trust, which then acquires Cattles plc shares for
the purpose of the LTIP .
RESTRICTED SHARE SCHEME
This scheme was established in 1994 and expired in 2004. The
participants included the executive directors and some other key
senior executives. In relation to the awards made contingently under
the scheme, each participant was notionally awarded shares up to
one times basic annual salary each year.
The number of long-term incentive shares which a participant
ultimately receives will depend upon continued employment and
performance conditions.
More particularly, EPS must grow by a minimum pre-determined
amount, set by the Remuneration Committee at the time of the
award, over a three year performance period before participants
will become entitled to any shares. The three year target earnings
growth for the award made in January 2004, which will vest on
6 April 2007, is 45% in excess of the increase in RPI to the extent
that it exceeds 5%.
value of bonus invested on both a compulsory and voluntary basis
per annum is 37.5% of the individual’s salary. Matching Shares can
be awarded up to a maximum award ratio of 2:1 (free Matching
Shares to Investment Shares), on a gross basis. If a participant sells his
Investment Shares at any time during the three year performance
period, this will reduce (on a pro-rata basis) the number of Matching
Shares that may be transferable to him on vesting. In 2006 all the
executive directors bought the maximum number of permitted
Investment Shares and the Committee made Awards of Matching
Shares on a 2:1 ratio.
The vesting of Awards will depend on the company’s performance
over a single ﬁxed three year performance period (i.e. with no
‘re-testing’ facility) which commences with the ﬁnancial year in
which the Awards are granted. Awards will (subject to the ‘adjuster’
referred to below) vest by reference to the company’s EPS growth in
excess of the Retail Price Index (RPI) over the three year
performance period, comparing the company’s EPS in the ﬁnancial
year prior to grant with its EPS in the third year following grant.
For these purposes, EPS is calculated on the same basis as stated in
the company’s Annual Report and Financial Statements, subject to
the Committee using its discretion to take account of any material
short-term effect arising from an acquisition or any exceptional item
of proﬁt or loss in a particular year, or to take account of changes
in accounting standards.
Subject to the adjuster referred to below, the performance
conditions relating to Awards made in 2005 are:
EPS growth of the company over the Percentage of Award
3 year performance period that vests
Less than RPI +20% 0%
RPI +20% 30%
RPI +35% or more 100%
Between RPI +20% and Between 30% and 100%
RPI +35% on a straight line basis
Subject to the adjuster referred to below, the performance
conditions relating to Awards made in 2006 are:
EPS growth of the company over the Percentage of Award

When setting the performance conditions for Awards made in 2006,
the Committee took account of a number of factors, including
(i) the company’s projected EPS growth over the relevant
performance period and (ii) the potential operation of the adjuster
referred to below which can reduce the level of vesting if the
company’s real EPS growth is lower than that of other companies.
Consequently, the Committee believes that these performance
conditions are, in light of the company’s current circumstances and
future prospects, no less challenging than the conditions applied to
Awards made in 2005.
REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
92
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 REPORTS OF THE BOARD
Executive directors and senior executives have not participated 
in these Executive Share Option Schemes since being invited to
participate in the LTIP and Restricted Share Scheme referred to
above. Consequently, no executive director has options outstanding
or unexercised under any of the Executive Share Option Schemes.
The Committee’s current policy will continue to be that the
executive directors and senior managers who participate in the LTIP
will not be granted options under the 2005 Scheme, save where
exceptional circumstances exist (such as senior recruitment) which
result in the Committee considering it appropriate to grant both
options under the 2005 Scheme and the LTIP , in which case the
performance conditions that are applied to options will take full
account of market and best practice. As at 31 December 2006 no
options had been granted under the 2005 Scheme.
As at 31 December 2006 options to subscribe for 115,800 and
76,000 ordinary shares remained exercisable under the 1994
Scheme and the 1996 Scheme respectively.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The Committee was mindful of the effect of the transition to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the
EPS-based performance conditions used in the LTIP , the Restricted
Share Scheme and the Executive Share Option Schemes. At the
request of the Committee, the company’s auditors have reviewed the
conversion of the EPS growth targets from UK GAAP to IFRS.
In addition, the Committee will (where it feels it appropriate to do so)
seek third party veriﬁcation of the extent to which the performance
conditions applying to share-based incentives are satisﬁed.
PENSION AND LIFE ASSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS
S P Mahon, J J Corr and I S Cummine have individual personal
pension plans into which the company contributed 25% of basic
salary in the case of S P Mahon and 20% of basic salary in the
cases of J J Corr and I S Cummine up to 31 December 2006.
M W G Collins is a member of the Cattles Staff Pension Fund and
is subject to the cap in the rules of the Fund which is based on the
former statutory pension cap. He therefore receives payments
representing 20% of the difference between his basic salary and
that cap for contribution to additional pension schemes. No other
payments to directors are pensionable.
Cattles Staff Pension Fund is a funded, HMRC approved, ﬁnal
salary occupational pension scheme with a contribution rate of 5%
of pensionable salary from the employee. Its main features, which
apply to all members on the same terms, are:
(i) pension is payable at normal pension age of 65 at 1/60th of
ﬁnal pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service up
to a maximum of 40/60ths
(ii) death-in-service life assurance cover is provided at four times
pensionable salary
(iii)pension is payable in the event of early retirement due to ill
health and to spouse on death of member.
The directors are provided with death-in-service life assurance cover
of four times basic salary.
The provisional award of shares is established by comparing the
actual earnings growth achieved by the company against the
pre-determined target set for the relevant period. The maximum
award will be made where the target has been met or exceeded. If
the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than the target,
then the provisional award will be reduced on a straight line basis,
such that where the earnings growth is less than 66.67% of the
target, no provisional award will be made.
When the provisional award has been calculated, the earnings
growth achieved by the company is then compared with the average
earnings growth achieved by the constituent companies included in
the FTSE All Share Index and the Speciality and Other Financials
Index. If the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than
that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, the
provisional award is reduced by 1% for every 4% by which the
earnings growth of the company falls below that of the constituent
companies in either index. The provisional award may be reduced
by a maximum of 25% as a result of this comparison.
Equally, if the earnings growth achieved by the company exceeds
that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, then the
provisional award is increased by 1% for every 4% by which the
earnings growth of the company exceeds that of either index,
subject to the original notional award not being exceeded.
The Restricted Share Scheme operated in conjunction with the Trust
in the same way as the LTIP .
SHARESAVE SCHEME
This scheme was approved in 2003 and enables all employees,
including executive directors, with more than 18 months’ service at
the date of invitation, to enter into a SAYE savings plan. At the end
of ﬁve years, participants can exercise an option to acquire shares in
the company at a ﬁxed price determined at the start of the savings
contract in accordance with the scheme rules. The exercise of options
under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions, in
accordance with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) rules.
The timing of invitations under this scheme is determined by the
Board acting upon the recommendation of the Committee.
As at 31 December 2006 options to subscribe for 1,181,933
ordinary shares remained exercisable under the Sharesave Scheme.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN
The Share Incentive Plan was introduced in 2003. It is open to all
eligible UK employees, including executive directors, and is an
HMRC approved all employee share plan.
Each year a sum of money is set aside as determined by the Board
acting upon the recommendation of the Committee. The amounts
attributable to eligible employees are determined by a formula
linked to their salaries. The maximum award to any one employee
during a year is £3,000.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
The Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 (the 1994
Scheme), an Inland Revenue approved scheme and the Cattles
Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 (the 1996 Scheme) have both
now expired. Shareholder approval was obtained in 2005 for the
establishment of the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 2005
(the 2005 Scheme) to replace the 1994 Scheme and the 1996 Scheme.
The maximum award level under the 2005 Scheme is 100% of salary.

N N Broadhurst, received a fee of £132,230 which was determined
by the Committee on the same basis as applied to the determination
of the basic salaries of the executive directors and consisted of a fee
of £75,000 per annum for his services as Deputy Chairman from
1 January to 11 May 2006 and a fee of £165,000 per annum for his

non-executive directors (calculated by reference to practice adopted
in the market generally and taking account of the time commitment
and the responsibilities of the non-executive directors) was £42,000,

utilisation efficiency measure and partial achievement of the EPS
growth measure and personal objectives. The bonuses earned in
excess of 75% of 2007 basic salary have been deferred into shares
and will not be received by the directors for a further three years.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDER
RETURN
Five Years to 31 December 2006
In the opinion of the Committee the FTSE 250 index is the most
appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of
Cattles plc should be measured because it is an index containing
similar sized companies to Cattles plc and the company has a
limited number of direct comparator companies.
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in Cattles plc
on 31 December 2001 compared with the value of £100 invested in
the FTSE 250 index. The result is that the FTSE 250 index has
outperformed Cattles plc, on that basis, over the following ﬁve years:
SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the company’s policy that executive directors’ service contracts
should be rolling contracts requiring a notice period of one year
to be given by the company and six months to be given by each
director. Each of the executive directors entered into service
contracts, including these terms, on the date of their appointment to
the Board. In order to reﬂect changes in other terms agreed since the
original service contracts were entered into and to incorporate
changes in employment legislation, the executive directors entered
into new service contracts on 5 March 2003. The company has the
right to terminate a director’s employment by paying to the director
the remuneration which he would have been entitled to receive from
the company in respect of the relevant period of notice. If a director
ceases to be employed, for any reason, by the company before the
end of the ﬁnancial year, any bonus payment will be at the sole
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. It is the Committee’s
policy that, when determining the amount of any compensation
paid to a departing director, the Committee will take into account
the director’s obligation to mitigate his loss, to the extent it is
possible to do so under the terms of the relevant contract. An
executive director may not become a director of another company
without the prior written consent of the Board. No executive
director is a non-executive director of any other company.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three
years, although either the company or the director may terminate
the appointment by giving six months’ written notice. They are
subject to re-election at an Annual General Meeting at least every
three years in common with all directors. They do not have service
contracts and may not participate in any bonus scheme, share
scheme, pension scheme, car scheme or healthcare scheme operated
by the company. The dates of their current letters of appointment
are: D A Haxby 22 June 1999; N N Broadhurst 23 March 2001;

REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
94
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 REPORTS OF THE BOARD
In accordance with the LTIP Rules the notional award made in
2006 was delayed until 23 November 2006 because the company
was in a prohibited period until that date. The ﬁgures for the
executive directors’ notional awards comprise both their
Performance and Matching Awards.
The performance criteria attaching to the RSS are set out in the
third to sixth paragraphs of the ‘Restricted Share Scheme’ section of
this report on pages 92 and 93. The performance criteria attaching
to the LTIP are set out in the sixth to thirteenth paragraphs of the
‘LTIP’ section of this report on page 92.
As at 1 January 2006 the employee beneﬁt trust owned 1,432,953
shares. On 22 November 2006 the employee beneﬁt trust
transferred 430,930 shares on the vesting of awards under the RSS.
As at 31 December 2006 the employee beneﬁt trust owned
1,002,023 shares.
In respect of those shares notionally awarded on 1 January 2003
under the RSS, the EPS growth achieved by the company during the
three years ended 31 December 2005 exceeded the pre-determined
target and the average EPS growth achieved by the constituent
companies in the Speciality and Other Financials Index but was less
than the average EPS growth achieved by the constituent companies
in the FTSE All Share Index and as a result 95% of the shares
notionally awarded on 1 January 2003 vested in the executive
directors and other executives on 22 November 2006. Vesting had
been due to occur on 6 April 2006 but was delayed in accordance
with the RSS Rules because the company was in a prohibited period
under the Model Code and instead occurred on 22 November 2006
immediately after the end of the prohibited period.
In respect of those shares notionally awarded on 1 January 2004,
the EPS growth achieved by the group during the three years ended
31 December 2006 fell marginally short of the pre-determined
target and was less than the average EPS growth achieved by the
constituent companies of the FTSE All Share Index and the
Speciality and Other Financials Index and as a result 74% of the
shares notionally awarded on 1 January 2004 will vest in the
executive directors and other executives on 10 April 2007.

The transfer value of the additional accrued beneﬁts earned in
the year less director’s contribution is the transfer value of the
additional accrued beneﬁts in respect of qualifying services earned
in the year after deducting the director’s personal contribution to
the scheme during the year.
The increase in the transfer value less director’s contribution is the
increase in the transfer value of the accrued beneﬁts in respect of

APPROVAL
This report was approved by the Board on 15 March 2007 and
signed on its behalf by:
DAVID HAXBY
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
15 March 2007
The accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of M W G
Collins is the amount that would be paid each year to the director
in the form of a pension on retirement at age 65 in the event of
him having left service at the end of the year. The accrued pension
entitlement includes, where relevant, entitlements earned as an
employee, prior to becoming a director, as well as those earned for
qualifying services after becoming a director. The increase in the
accrued pension entitlement is the difference between the accrued
beneﬁt at the year end and that at the previous year end. Transfer
values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in
accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the additional accrued beneﬁts and of the
accrued pension entitlement in respect of qualifying services
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to
transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’s
liability in respect of the director’s pension beneﬁts that he earned in
respect of qualifying services. They do not represent sums payable
to the director and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to
annual remuneration.

Using the BACS system, shareholders may choose to have dividends
paid electronically into their bank or building society account. This
process ensures that the amount of the dividend is passed directly
into their account, as cleared funds, on the date the payment is due.
Conﬁrmation of these details will be contained in a dividend tax
voucher which is posted to shareholders’ registered addresses at the
time of payment. This voucher should be kept for future reference.

Corporate services division
Cattles Invoice Finance provides
working capital finance to small

BUSINESSES
Cattles is a financial services
group specialising in providing
consumer credit to non-standard
customers in the UK. The group
also provides working capital
finance for small and medium
sized businesses and debt
recovery services to external
clients and our own consumer
credit division.
In the consumer finance market,
non-standard refers to customers
who may currently not 
have access to mainstream
facilities – typically due to
perceived shortcomings in 
their employment, residency 
or credit histories. We provide
our customers with an
opportunity to build or 
repair their credit profile.
Clearly, these are markets in
which effective risk management
is paramount.

SIX KEY STRENGTHS THAT
UNDERPIN OUR CONSISTENT
GROWTH
Cattles has successfully delivered profitable
growth and maintained stable credit
quality, over many years. We believe 
there are six key factors which have
enabled us to achieve this consistently:
COMMITMENT TO THE 
NON-STANDARD CONSUMER
FINANCE MARKET 
We’re specialists. We are focused on the
non-standard consumer finance market,
and remain totally committed to it.
Because we know it so well, we’re able 
to adapt to its changing dynamics, develop
the right products, invest in appropriate
resources and systems – and manage the
associated risks. 
ROBUST UNDERWRITING 
We’ve evolved our underwriting 
processes over many years to ensure that
our acceptance of credit risk is carefully
controlled. In our lending businesses, 
our underwriting methodologies draw 
on our deep understanding and experience
of non-standard finance markets. We
ensure consistent credit quality in our
direct repayment loans by managing our
underwriting and credit scoring processes
centrally and by rigorously verifying 
the information applicants give us. By
understanding customers’ outgoings and
commitments, we can be more confident 
of their ability to repay their loans and
therefore our ability to lend responsibly.
BEING CLOSE TO OUR CUSTOMERS
We want to know and understand our
customers personally. The accessibility of
local staff in our consumer credit branches
around the country is key to keeping close
to our customers. We see our local branch
presence as a significant strength, and 
have made it a central part of the way we
manage both customer relationships and
risk. This makes it easier for customers to
let us know if their circumstances change,
so that we can provide timely support
– a major factor in managing arrears.
MOTIVATED, WELL TRAINED PEOPLE
We are committed to training and
developing our people and we have
consistently benefited from ongoing
investments in our culture and values
programmes. The skills and experience 
of our employees enables us to manage
risk and customer relationships
successfully, and to provide excellent
service. Our consumer credit businesses
are accredited to the Investors in People
standard and our employee feedback
reflects high levels of job satisfaction 
and pride in the company. 
INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS AND
PROCESSES
Information technology is core to our
business and we continue to make
significant investment in systems and
processes to further improve our customer
relationship management. This helps us
recruit, underwrite and select customers,
by more closely matching their evolving
credit status and needs to our existing
product range. 
RISK.MANAGED.
We have developed our risk management
framework, policies and practices over
time to meet both the demands of our
markets and the requirements of our
regulators. Effective management of risk is
well embedded throughout our businesses.
The care we take has helped us to deliver
consistent performance and ensure stable
credit quality over many years.

37 Notice of Annual General Meeting
70504 pre  17/3/07  06:49  Page 1 I am delighted to be making my annual report to
shareholders following a year in which the work carried
out in the previous year, setting the objectives of our
strategic plans for growth and expansion, came to fruition.
Our team has produced a fine performance for the year.
The Group has seen a 21% growth in turnover from
continuing operations which when added to the part
year turnover from acquisitions brought the year on year
increase to 76.8%. Profit before taxation has increased 
by 80.9% and diluted adjusted earnings per share have
increased by 65.7%. These are excellent results in difficult
market conditions and when viewed with our track record
clearly demonstrate that the business model and strategy
that is in place continues to be a successful one. 
Dividends
It is proposed to pay a maiden final dividend in respect
of the current year ending 31 December 2006 of 0.5p per
share which, subject to shareholder approval, will be paid
on 11 May 2007 to all shareholders on the register on 
13 April 2007. We intend to review the dividend policy at
the half year stage.
Acquisitions
Two acquisitions were completed in the first half of the
year and one shortly after on 9 July 2006. Full details of 
the acquisitions were announced to the Stock Exchange 
on the relevant dates and further details are included in
the Chief Executive’s Review.
These three acquisitions approximately double CBG’s
general insurance activities, demonstrating our
commitment to consolidation in the North West. The
current level of gross premiums handled would have
positioned the enlarged business within the top 30 UK
insurance brokers.

In addition to our central hub in Manchester, CBG 
now operates out of Liverpool, Burnley, Poulton-le-Fylde
and Blackpool. 
A number of other potential acquisitions are currently
being considered by the Group.

70504 pre  17/3/07  06:49  Page 2 Board of Directors
A number of changes to the structure of the Board were
announced in August. These changes reflected the
recognition by the Board that the Group was rapidly
expanding and that the dynamics, skill sets, expertise 
and experience required of the Executive Directors, 
were focused to ensure that the Group is managed in an
efficient manner as it enters a new stage of development.
Robin Slinger’s appointment as Chief Executive brings 
a wealth of corporate and communications skills with 
his background in corporate banking. Robin was a 
Non-executive Director since October 2004 and is fully
familiar with all aspects of the Group and is well equipped
to lead us through further expansion of the Group. 
Stephen Jackson resigned as a Director on 30 January 2007
for family ill-health reasons. Stephen will continue to be
employed on a part time basis in the Company’s Financial
Services division, CBG Financial Services Limited. The Board
wishes Stephen well and would like to express its thanks
to him for his contribution during the development of 
CBG in recent times.  
Following Robin Slinger’s move from his Non-executive
position and Lord Pendry’s resignation on 7 July 2006, the
Board will appoint a third Non-executive Director when 
a suitable candidate is identified. 
Strategy
The Group’s strategy remains to grow the Group rapidly
through a combination of selective regional acquisitions
and also organic growth from existing operations,
principally through cross-selling across the Group’s trading
divisions. Operating margins will continue to be improved
through the further development of long term
relationships with our suppliers and such a relationship
was recently concluded with an arrangement over three
years with Allianz Cornhill. 
The Group is currently investing in updating its
Information Technology systems. Fundamental to the
Group is the recruitment and retention of quality staff,
trained to use the latest technology into which new
acquisitions can be quickly and effectively integrated. 
The Enterprise Management Incentive share option
scheme is to be opened to all eligible employees, linked 
to the overall performance of the Group.
Prospects
Although the insurance market is set to remain in a
relatively unchanged state for the immediate future,
through 2007 and into 2008, CBG is well equipped to
create value from its existing operations. This has been
demonstrated again throughout the course of last year.
The Directors are confident that the Group will continue
to develop and grow in an effective and controlled 
manner, delivering value to its shareholders.

70504 pre  17/3/07  06:49  Page 3 I am delighted to be making my first statement as 
Chief Executive since my appointment in August last year.
My role as a Non-executive Director in the period prior to
that gave me an invaluable insight into the Group, but it
is only when working closely on a daily basis with our
people that I have fully appreciated their dedication,
flexibility and passion to deliver our client proposition. 
Trading
2006 has seen a step change in our business as the early
stages of our strategic plans and objectives have been
delivered. In a year that has seen continuation of the 
soft market conditions of the previous year, each of our
chosen business areas has contributed another strong
performance.
The Group showed an 89% rise in profit before tax,
goodwill amortisation and share option charges and a 66%
rise in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Also pleasing
was the underlying organic growth in turnover which was
in excess of 15%. This performance once again underlines
the Group’s objective of growth, both organically and by
acquisitions, and is a credit to all of our staff.
The acquisitions described below have expanded the
Insurance Broking, Healthcare and Premium Finance
operations in particular. The Group’s Financial Services
division, CBG Financial Services (formerly CBG Carpenter
Rees Jackson), has performed very well since its acquisition
in July 2004 and is currently operating at a level of activity
around 70% higher than prior to acquisition. The final
earnout payment was paid in full to the vendors of 
CBG Financial Services Limited (formerly Carpenter Rees
Jackson Limited) on 16 August 2006. 
It is particularly pleasing that as an organisation we have
been able to achieve impressive organic growth, in what
continues to be demanding market conditions, as well as
execute the purchase and integration of three acquisitions
during the period. Our headcount has increased by over
130%, with our staff remaining our greatest asset who are
to be congratulated on their ability to embrace change as
integration has occurred.
Acquisitions
On 22 February 2006, the Company acquired Swinburne
James Limited, a provider of general insurance broking
services, and Swinburne James FS Limited, a provider of
financial services, through the acquisition of Everfirst
Services Limited, the holding company. Swinburne James
was based in Manchester, Liverpool and Burnley with 
a wide spread of clients throughout the North West. 
The total maximum consideration payable to the vendor
was £1,192,000. 
On 1 March 2006, the Company completed the acquisition
of Spencer, Lavery Associates Limited (“SLA”), a specialist
broker of healthcare insurance and also a provider of
general insurance broking services and financial services.
The total maximum consideration payable to the vendors
was £620,000 plus the value of net assets at completion 
of £83,000. The acquisition of SLA provided a critical mass
for our healthcare operation, CBG Healthcare.
The integration of these two acquisitions into our Barton
Hall offices in Manchester was achieved within days of
their completion and we quickly obtained benefits from
the enlarged Group and the additional services provided 
to our clients. 
On 9 July 2006, the Company acquired E T Knagg & Co.
Limited, a provider of general insurance broking services
based in Poulton-le-Fylde and with an office in Blackpool,
servicing a wide spread of clients on the Fylde coast and
throughout the North West. E T Knagg continues to

Chief Executive’s Review
“
We continue to seek growth through
considered acquisition, and the Group is
well equipped to create value from our
existing operations. 
”
70504 pre  17/3/07  06:49  Page 4 operate from its existing premises, further enhancing both
our geographical and client profiles in line with our plans
and expectations, but has otherwise been fully integrated
into CBG. David Mackie, one of the vendors and Managing
Director of E T Knagg, joined the Board of CBG Insurance
Brokers on completion. The total maximum consideration
payable to the vendors was £1,471,000. 
Across the Group, Insurance Broking, Financial Services,
Healthcare and Premium Finance are all benefiting from
the rapid integration and cross-selling activities emanating
from these acquisitions, whilst our Finance team has
quickly responded ensuring efficiencies are maximised 
and reporting systems for the Group are maintained to 
a high standard. 
Our acquisition appetite remains unaltered and remains
key to our growth strategy as a consolidator in the
industry. We are highly selective in the opportunities
available to us, as key to our decision process is the
strategic fit of the personnel into our operations. To
facilitate this objective the Group now has a dedicated
team to carry forward our acquisition programme, and
more importantly deliver the successful integration of
businesses into our Group.
Operations 
The acquisitions have been very important for the Group
for they have not only added critical mass to established
areas of the operation, but also enabled us to move
forward in the less mature area of healthcare. 
Our stated intent of producing a truly broad based 
client proposition is now in place, enabling focus and
specialisation in each trading sector with robust and
effective management to develop the synergies and sales
opportunities across the Group.
There are two core operating divisions, as follows: 
› CBG Insurance Brokers
This business is a provider of general insurance broking
services, augmented by our development of a more
broadly based client advisory proposition. The integration
of business risk management with the design and
implementation of insurance programmes allows 
CBG Insurance Brokers to offer a far more bespoke 
solution to its corporate clients.
The commercial general insurance continues to operate 
in a soft market, nonetheless the independent broker 
still represents the principal distribution channel into the
small to medium sized business market (SME’s). Insurers,
banks and building societies are looking to make 
inroads however and are likely to succeed at the lower, 
transactional end of this market. CBG’s strategy is focused
on increased mid-market business and developing efficient
processes to handle, at least cost, this transactional buyer
where technology will be a leading edge tool. CBG will
remain mindful of its advisory role, continuing to use the
service they provide for the client as the differentiator
from the direct channel.
CBG Insurance Brokers will continue to develop its position
as insurance advisors to the larger corporate businesses,
where our broad in-house resources bring proven benefits
and solutions to what can often be very complex requirements. 
Our Broking arm will continue to leverage its general
proposition by providing bespoke asset protection to the
high net worth individuals within its corporate clients and
the clients of the other CBG trading divisions.
We have dedicated resources in place to ensure we have
the right insurer and technology partners in place to
ensure our client proposition is first class, and is consistent
within our business. The 3 year deal with Allianz Cornhill,
as referred to in the Chairman’s Statement, is illustrative 
of our desire to form mutually beneficial long term
relationships with our chosen partners.  
› CBG Financial Services
CBG Financial Services offers a distinct service to its
corporate clients in areas such as key person, pension
consultancy and employee benefits with separate 
services to its private clients through effective wealth
management strategies. 
This year will see the development and delivery of 
an innovative flexible benefits proposition, using a 
market leading, comprehensive web-based benefits
communication solution that will enable employees 
to manage their own benefits within parameters defined 
by their employer. “ A” day, 6 April 2006, provided the

legislation starts to settle down.
IT developments are in hand which will deliver
opportunities to further enhance our investment advice 
to clients as well as taking the lead in driving through the
implementation of sophisticated work flow management
leading to a near paperless office environment.
The acquisition of Spencer, Lavery & Associates Limited on
1 March 2006 led to the development of a distinct
Healthcare offering from CBG. Utilising current knowledge
and experience, different healthcare options specifically
tailored to the client are proposed.
The UK healthcare market is buoyant. Fuelled by factors
such as an increasingly health conscious population, an
ailing National Health Service and an absence culture in
the workplace, more and more employers are looking to
the healthcare market to deliver ways of safeguarding
their business and driving down costs. Standard Life
Healthcare research has revealed that one in two people
think that everyone should have made provision for all 
the Healthcare they need by the age of 30. New innovative
products are being developed by private medical insurers,
which are often a long way away from the traditional
model of healthcare and CBG is determined to be at the
vanguard of these developments by offering an integrated
healthcare programme for its client base delivering
positive and cost effective benefits across their business.
›  Supporting and additional activities:
We are also able to provide premium finance facilities 
as well as having a joint arrangement catering for the
requirements of sports professionals.
•  Exius 
The acquisition of Exius in March 2005 added a premium
finance capability to the Group’s offering. Exius provides
insurance premium finance to a significant percentage 
of CBG Insurance Brokers client base. It has provided our
clients with an in-house flexible facility that has proved 
to be popular as it enables them to spread premium
payments, typically over a 10-month cycle. This business
will continue to grow as our client base expands and our
turnover increases.
•  CBG Sports
On 13 July 2006, the Company announced the
establishment of CBG Sports Limited through a joint
arrangement with Kingsbridge Asset Management
Limited, a subsidiary of Formation Group plc. CBG Sports
will sell its general insurance services to the client base 
of Kingsbridge. Kingsbridge currently advises over 600 UK
based footballers, managers and coaching staff from 
the 92 professional football clubs. In addition to its
football clients, Kingsbridge also advises clients from 
other sports such as Rugby, Cricket, Golf and Racing.
Kingsbridge is an appointed representative of CBG 
Financial Services Limited.
We are excited by the early progress this business has
achieved, and the quality of client relationships already
established.
›  Sales and Marketing
The effective management of the prospect client database
is fundamental to the success of our organic growth
strategy and the integration of new opportunities brought
about by acquisition. The sales and marketing function
enables the maximisation of cross selling activity and
efficient use of client contact. It also allows CBG to 
achieve these key objectives and ensures that our client
proposition differentiates CBG from the competition.
Marketing literature and the integrated web site are
utilised by our sales and marketing team as we deliver
effective PR and brand awareness in the market place.

CBG Group plc
Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
“
We are well structured and 
equipped to deliver increased value for
shareholders commensurate with an
expanding and successful Group. 
”
70504 pre  19/3/07  15:56  Page 6 ›  Finance & IT
A strong finance and IT function of the highest calibre
ensures our Group is run efficiently and profitably, and has
been further strengthened during 2006 to keep pace with
the growth of our business. Robust controls remain in
place, with focused monthly management information
produced in a timely manner allowing effective
performance management. Our centralised function 
also allows CBG to evaluate and manage its corporate
governance obligations effectively.
›  Compliance
Compliance is a significant obligation across the core areas
of the Group through the single regulatory body of the
Financial Services Authority (FSA). Accordingly, we ensure
uniformity across all areas of the business by applying in
depth knowledge of the regulatory obligations. CBG’s
commitments as an accredited Investor in People and the
requirements of the FSA link well in terms of Training 
and Competency.
Employees
The continuing growth of our business relies upon
attracting and retaining motivated and highly skilled
employees, with individual and Group success requiring
individuals to continue to develop themselves,
complimented by our own commitment to training. Our
Investors in People Accreditation (IIP) means a lot to us,
and we were delighted to see the review of our business
during 2006 once again confirming our status. 
The success of the Group is ultimately dependent on the
skill and dedication of its staff and I would like to thank 
all of our employees for their contribution and efforts
during the year. Their continued hard work is very much
recognised and valued by the Board.
Whilst Executive and Senior personnel have to date
qualified for our Enterprise Management Incentive
Scheme, it is our intention to recognise the contribution 
all members of our Group make to our business by
allowing eligible employees to participate in 2007. 
Financing
The Group’s day to day financing requirements are
satisfied by a £2,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility provided
by the Bank of Scotland. In addition, the Group has a long
term loan, also provided by the Bank of Scotland, which
amounted to £1,500,000 at 31 December 2006. 
The loans provided by the Group’s Premium Financier,
Exius, to the clients of CBG Insurance Brokers, are financed
from the above bank facilities and at the year end totalled
£3,540,000. The Company has entered into the banking
facilities and in turn, when required, provides funding to 
Exius, which at 31 December 2006 amounted to
£1,659,000. Exius has security over the insurance
premiums financed by clients and is generally always 
in a position to recoup any defaulted loans through the
cancellation of the underlying insurance policies.
The Group’s core trading activities, Insurance Broking 
and Financial Services, are cash generative. This cash
generation together with existing borrowing facilities
provides the resources for the Company to pursue its
acquisition strategy. 
International Accounting Standards
As an AIM listed company we will adopt IAS for our
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2007.
Current trading
The year has started well, and whilst insurance premiums
remain soft and are forecast to continue through the year,
trading is in line with our expectations.
With the Group’s extensive services portfolio, we are able
to provide a comprehensive offering to a broad range of
clients that will ensure growth organically and through
strategic acquisition. We are particularly well equipped
and focused to exploit cross-selling opportunities across
our trading areas. 
We have objectives for 2007 which will further enhance
the performance of our business, and with strong
foundations in place we are well structured and equipped
to deliver increased value for shareholders commensurate
with an expanding and successful Group.

Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss of the Group for the
year then ended. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently; make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; state whether
applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements; and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Report on remuneration

than twice a year.
The Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company which are terminable on 6 months notice by either
party. The Non-executive Directors have an appointment letter with the Company, terminable on 3 months notice by
either party. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board.
Full details of Directors’ remuneration and share options are given in note 5 to the financial statements.
Executive Director packages comprise a basic salary and other benefits. The Committee has regard to rates of pay 
for similar positions in comparable companies as well as internal factors such as performance. The objective of the
Company’s remuneration policy is to ensure that members of the executive management are provided with appropriate
incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual
contributions to the success of the Company.
The Executive Directors are eligible for share options under the Company’s share option scheme. The exercise of options
granted prior to 2006 under the share option scheme is not dependent on performance criteria. The options granted
during 2006 are dependent on the achievement of certain earnings per share criteria.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board and must comprise a minimum of two members, including the 
Non-executive Directors. During the period D Worsley, L A Turnbull and R Slinger, prior to his appointment as Chief
Executive served on the Audit Committee. The Committee meets not less than twice a year.
The Audit Committee may examine any matters relating to the financial affairs of the Group. This includes reviews of 
the annual accounts and announcements, internal control procedures, accounting policies, compliance with accounting
standards, the appointment of external auditors and other such related functions as the Board may require.

Annual General Meeting
The Notice of the AGM of CBG Group plc to be held on 25 April 2007 and the resolutions to be proposed at the Meeting
are set out on pages 35 and 36 of this document. The following special business will be considered at the Meeting.
Resolution 6 increases the authorised share capital to £800,000. Resolution 7 seeks to renew the Directors’ authority
under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal amount of
£146,567, which represents one third of the issued ordinary share capital as at 5 March 2007. The Directors are currently
empowered, pursuant to an ordinary resolution of the Company dated 10 May 2006, to allot unissued share capital up to
an aggregate nominal amount of £122,808. Resolution 8 grants the Directors the power to allot shares for cash without
first offering those shares pro-rata to existing shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount of £43,970, representing
10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 5 March 2007.  The Directors are currently empowered,
pursuant to a special resolution of the Company dated 10 May 2006, to allot shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal
amount of £18,421. Resolution 9 grants the Company the power to make market purchases of its own shares under
Section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 up to 1,099,255 ordinary shares representing 10% of the Company’s issued
ordinary share capital as at 5 March 2007.
The Directors consider that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders that they should have the
flexibility conferred by the above authorities to make small issues of shares, or purchase shares, for cash as suitable
opportunities arise. These authorities will expire at the earlier of 25 July 2008 and the conclusion of the AGM to be 
held in 2008.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006
70504 pre  14/3/07  23:38  Page 11 Application of the principles of good governance
The Group is committed to applying the highest principles of corporate governance commensurate with its size.
The Board
The Group is managed by a Board, consisting of a Non-executive Chairman, five Executive Directors and one 
Non-executive Director, who retain responsibility for the formulation of corporate strategy, approval of acquisitions,
divestments, capital expenditure and treasury policy. Given the size of the Company, the appointment of new Directors 
is a matter reserved for the Board as a whole rather than a separate Nomination Committee.
The Board meets regularly and has a schedule of matters specifically referred to it for decision. All Directors have access 
to advice from the Company Secretary and training is available for Directors as necessary.
The Board considers the Non-executive Directors to be independent.
Internal control
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control to provide
them with reasonable assurance regarding effective and efficient operations, internal financial control and compliance
with laws and regulations. The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risks of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. However, there are inherent limitations in
any system of internal control and accordingly even the most effective system can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance. The Board has reviewed the operation and effectiveness of the system of internal control in operation
during the year.
Individual companies are managed with a clearly defined responsibility for the operation of the businesses to meet
standards required by both the Group and appropriate regulatory authorities. In addition, annual plans and longer-term
overviews of objectives are prepared by each business management team and reviewed at minuted meetings attended 
by at least one Executive Director.
Individual business management is also responsible for assessing and minimising all business risks, supported by 
Group personnel able to provide specific assistance in matters relating to regulatory compliance, health and safety, and
quality systems.
Monthly accounts, including comparison with planned performance, together with key ratio analysis and working capital
information, are prepared in accordance with Group accounting policies and principles. They are reviewed by the Board 
to monitor overall performance and facilitate appropriate management intervention.
The Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to implement the guidance “Internal Control:
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code”. The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function but
has concluded the size and complexity of the Group does not justify the expense at present. The need for an internal
audit function will continue to be reviewed periodically.
Relations with shareholders
The Board attaches great importance to maintaining good relationships with shareholders. The Board regards the Annual
General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate directly with investors, who are encouraged to participate.

Corporate Governance
70504 pre  14/3/07  23:38  Page 12 Compliance
In the opinion of the Directors, the Company has complied with the provisions of Section 1 of the combined code during
the year with the following exceptions:
● There are less than three Non-executive Directors on the Board (A3.2)
● There is no separate Nomination Committee (A4.1)
● The Non-executive Directors are not appointed for a specific term (A7.2) but are subject to retirement by rotation 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. Their re-election is therefore periodically approved by the
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The Company has complied fully with the requirements of provision C1.2 of the Code (review of effectiveness of internal
control system) from the date of its flotation on the Alternative Investment Market.
Going concern
The Directors’ report, in connection with paragraph D1.3 of the Combined Code, that after making enquiries, they have a
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Officers and Professional Advisers
70504 pre  14/3/07  23:38  Page 14 We have audited the financial statements of CBG Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2006 on pages 16 to 20
which have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out on pages 21 and 22.
This report is made solely to the Company’s shareholders, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s shareholders those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s shareholders as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on pages 9 and 10.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report and Chairman’s
Statement is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Group has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. This other information comprises only the Directors’ Report and the Chairman’s Statement. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
● the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Group’s and the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of the
Group’s profit for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
and
● the information given in the Directors’ Report and the Chairman’s Statement is consistent with the financial
statements.

Group Cash Flow Statement (continued)
Year ended 31 December 2006
70504 pre  14/3/07  23:38  Page 20 1. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with applicable
accounting standards.
Change in accounting policy 
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, the Group has adopted the following Financial Reporting
Standard:
FRS 20 Share-Based Payment (IFRS 2)
The adoption of FRS 20 Share-Based Payment (IFRS 2) requires the recognition of equity-settled share-based
payments at fair value at the date of the grant and the recognition of liabilities for cash-settled share-based
payments at the current fair value at each balance sheet date. Prior to the adoption of FRS 20, the Group did not
recognise the financial effect of share-based payments until such payments were settled.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the Standard has been applied retrospectively to all grants 
of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
For year ended 31 December 2005, the change in accounting policy has resulted in a net decrease in the profit for the
year of £8,000. The related credit is reflected in the profit and loss reserve and therefore the net effect on the balance
sheets at 1 January 2005 is £nil. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all Group
undertakings. These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies. Acquisitions are
accounted for under the acquisition method and goodwill on consolidation is capitalised and written off in
accordance with the Goodwill accounting policy. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included 
in the Group profit and loss account after or up to the date that control passes respectively. As a consolidated 
Group profit and loss account is published, a separate profit and loss account for the parent company is omitted
from the Group financial statements by virtue of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover
The turnover shown in the Group profit and loss account represents commissions received on insurance policies 
taken out by clients, with income being recognised on policy inception and from commissions received from
independent financial services taken out by clients. Commissions are recognised in the accounts when, in the
opinion of the Directors, the likelihood of receipt is determined with a reasonable amount of certainty. Amounts
recognised in the accounts in advance of invoicing are recorded in debtors as accrued income.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is to be written off in equal annual instalments 
over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful life is deemed to be 20 years.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 25% reducing balance and 10%-33% straight line.
Notes to the Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2006
21
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
70504 notes  14/3/07  23:42  Page 21 Finance lease agreements
Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset
and is depreciated in accordance with the above depreciation policies. Future instalments under such leases, net of
finance charges, are included with creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which 
is charged to the Group profit and loss account on a straight line basis, and the capital element which reduces the
outstanding obligation for future instalments.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with 
the lessor are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, 
or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exception:
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not
that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can 
be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in
which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Pension costs
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes for certain employees. The assets of the
schemes are held separately from those of the Group. The annual contributions payable are charged to the Group
profit and loss account.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less amounts written off.
Share-based payments policy
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including Directors). Equity-settled
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, together
with a corresponding increase in equity, based upon the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been 
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and
behavioural considerations.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the
terms had not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction 
as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled transaction is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of the cancellation, 
and any expense not yet recognised for the transaction is recognised immediately. However, if a new transaction is
substituted for the cancelled transaction, and designated as a replacement transaction on the date that it is granted,
the cancelled and new transactions are treated as if they were a modification of the original transaction, as
described in the previous paragraph.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006
70504 notes  14/3/07  23:42  Page 25 9. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2006 is based on the profit attributable
to ordinary shareholders of £607,000 (2005: £344,000) divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
of 9,601,200 (2005: 8,349,288). 
The adjusted earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, after adding back
goodwill amortisation, share option charges and reflecting an ongoing tax charge, as follows:
2006 2005
£000 Pence £000 Pence 
Profit retained for the year 607 6.32 344 4.12
Goodwill amortisation 265 2.76 124 1.48
Share option charge 25 0.26 80.10
Adjustment to reflect an ongoing tax charge of 30% (51) (0.53) (28) (0.33)
Adjusted earnings per share 846 8.81 448 5.37
Diluted adjusted earnings per share 846 7.79 448 4.70
At 31 December 2006, there were 481,000 (2005: 295,500) share options in issue of which 190,997 (2005: 22,543)
were dilutive potential ordinary shares on average during the year. There were also 436,484 (2005: 1,493,970) shares
to be issued in respect of deferred consideration for acquisitions made during or prior to the current year of which
1,062,763 (2005: 1,166,697) were dilutive potential ordinary shares on average during the year. At 31 December
2006, there were therefore a total of 1,253,760 (2005: 1,189,240) dilutive potential ordinary shares on average during
the year.

70504 notes  14/3/07  23:42  Page 31 18. Treasury operations and financial instruments
The Group’s treasury activities are designed to provide suitable, flexible funding arrangements to satisfy the Group’s
requirements. The Group uses financial instruments comprising borrowings, cash liquid resources and items such 
as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main risks arising from Group financial
instruments are interest rate and liquidity risks. The Board reviews policies for managing these risks.
There is no material difference between the fair values and book values of the Group’s financial instruments.
The Group operates a treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency
risks associated with the Group’s activities.
The Group’s principal financial instruments include bank overdrafts and loans, the main purpose of which is to raise
finance for the Group’s operations. In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as
trade debtors and trade creditors arising directly from operations. In accordance with the Group’s treasury policy,
derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements in order to maximise interest income and minimise
interest expense, whilst ensuring the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of 
the business.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate borrowings and cash flow interest rate risk on bank
overdrafts and loans. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group has little exposure arising from trading with overseas companies. The Group policy permits but does 
not demand that these exposures may be hedged in order to fix the cost in sterling. 
Credit risk
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies
which must fulfil credit rating criteria approved by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. Trade debtors are
reviewed on a regular basis and provision is made for doubtful debts when necessary.
19. Commitments under operating leases
At 31 December 2006 the Group had annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as set out below.

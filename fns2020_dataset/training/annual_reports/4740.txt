Chairman’s statement
Section 1 | Overview
Dear Shareholders,
In the 2006 Annual Report, I wrote that 2007 would be a year
of further transition for the Company. This has proved to be
the case: the management team has made terrific progress in
positioning the Company for sustainable growth and, of course,
in increasing Shareholder value.
For the Board, the most pleasing aspect has been the steady
increase in gross margin throughout 2007, from just under 20%
in the first quarter of the year to just over 40% in the fourth
quarter. While there is still much to do, the Board is much more
confident that the business is on the right course. As a result, it
not only thanks the management team for its efforts but, in a
drive to maintain the current momentum in the business, is also
looking at ways to align the team members’ rewards more closely
to the interests of Shareholders. A proposal to this effect will be
made at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and will, I hope,
receive the support of our Shareholders. More information will
be included in the Notice of Meeting, which will be published
on our Website in due course.
As we report in the Corporate Governance section of this report,
we have created a new Nominations and Remuneration
Committee. We formerly dealt with these matters separately, but
the Board considered that there were many issues that were
common to both, and quality and efficiency of reporting would
be improved by bringing the disciplines together. By regularly
questioning the composition and processes of the Board and its
committees, we ensure they provide apposite guidance and
support to the management team, as well as effective Corporate
Governance for the Company.
Indeed, in relation to the composition of the Board and its
committees, the Non-executive Directors – Peter Tan, Russ Shaw
and Chris Burke – who joined Dialog recently have become
increasingly active participants in Board meetings, and each also is
a member of one of our committees. This is very pleasing to me
and is, I know, much appreciated by our Chief Executive Officer,
Dr Jalal Bagherli, and his team.
As you will read in Jalal’s review that follows, the Board sees 2008
as a year of opportunity for Dialog to demonstrate sustainable
growth and attain profitability. His confidence in the Company’s
ability to achieve this, of course subject to the wider uncertainties
in the world economy, is very encouraging.

Trading in Dialog shares
Dialog shares are traded in Germany on the XETRA and Frankfurt
regulated official markets and on all other German regional
exchanges on the open market.
The Company has made a strategic commitment to creating
a lower-cost platform in order to take full advantage of key
growth opportunities. In line with this commitment, the decision
was taken in the fourth quarter of 2006 to terminate the
Company’s American Depositary Receipt programme (“ADRs”)
and de-list from the Nasdaq National Market in the USA.
ADRs in Dialog Semiconductor were de-listed from Nasdaq at
the close of business on 28 December 2006. In accordance with
SEC regulations governing deregistration from a US exchange,
the Company filed notice of its intention to deregister with the
SEC (Form 15) on 31 January 2007. The deregistration
became effective 90 days later. In June 2007, new SEC rules on
deregistration gave the Company the opportunity to terminate
its SEC registration permanently by filing Form 15F with the SEC.
The original Form 15 filing only granted the Company the right
to suspend its SEC reporting obligation temporarily for any years
in which it had fewer than 300 US Shareholders. In July 2007,
Dialog filed a Form 15F making the deregistration permanent.
Dividend policy
Dialog Semiconductor participates in industries that are
considered to be global growth engines and provides its
services and products to the major players in these industries.
Dialog’s Board of Directors is committed to re-investing all
profits into laying the framework for future growth and continues
to believe that – in line with the strategic changes underway –
this policy is in the best interests of all its Shareholders.
Investor relations
Dialog Semiconductor understands the importance of clear
communication with investors and analysts, particularly during
a period of strategic change. During 2007, the management
team continued its efforts to ensure that the market was kept
up to date with the important and exciting changes underway
at the Company.
Dialog Semiconductor’s shares are followed by a number of
analysts representing major banks and research institutions in
Europe. During 2007, we held our annual analyst conference
and, in addition, kept in regular contact with our investors
and analysts.

Chief Executive’s review
Section 2 | Business review
In last year’s Annual Report, I indicated my belief in Dialog’s
potential and ability to pursue a number of higher-growth
opportunities in the mobile phone, consumer electronics and
automotive systems markets. During 2007 we made considerable
progress in this endeavour, and established relationships
with a number of world-class customers. Clearly this is still a
“work in progress”, but the early results can be seen in increased
revenue and improved gross margins over the four quarters
of 2007.
We also maintained our focus on tackling the key challenges
that I indicated last year, and that are facing Dialog in the
years ahead:
 improving our cost platform;
 diversifying our revenue;
 focusing our products and sales on higher-growth markets; and
 strengthening our management and skill base.
We made significant progress in the year in addressing
each of these challenges.
Improving our cost platform
We completed the transition of our final-test operations from
Germany to off-shore subcontractors in Asia. We now have a truly
scalable business platform to build further growth without having
incurred major capital expenditure for manufacturing equipment.
The transition was carried out with the utmost care and without
disrupting our excellent product delivery record to our customers.
We implemented our decision to de-list from Nasdaq in
January 2007 and that has already helped to simplify our
financial reporting process and reduce our administrative costs.
Diversifying our revenue
In 2007, we developed a completely new market area for the
Company when we began volume production of highly-
integrated power management devices for one of the world’s
leading consumer electronics companies. We made steady gains
of new customer designs in Asia, Europe and North America,
and started shipping our highly-integrated audio and power
management devices for third-generation 3G/HSDPA mobile
phones and smart multimedia phones. This business had a
significant, and increasing, impact on our revenue in the
second half of the year.
We also continue to focus on innovative differentiated,
“always-on” display drivers, targeted at the emerging thin,
low-power displays for mobile, and personal handheld
applications, using technologies such as e-paper, MEMS and
OLED. From the second half of 2008, this range of new
products in established, and emerging, sectors will provide the
Company with new opportunities for revenue generation in
growth markets for a number of years.
Focusing our products and sales on higher-growth markets
During the year we focused our research and development (R&D)
effort on producing world-class technology in the shape of an
increasingly broad base of products, from which to generate
future solutions for customers and returns for our Shareholders.
We made a further investment in advanced low-power audio
technology when we set up a new design centre in Scotland.
Our portfolio of automotive and industrial products, which covers
highly-integrated smart motor controllers and electronic lamp
ballast products, continued to produce dependable revenue in
2007 while we completed the development of a number of new
products, ready to launch in 2008.
We had notable success in applying our System-on-Chip
(“SoC”) technology for smart motor controllers for new
end-applications – such as seatbelt control and cooling fan
equipment – with new tier1 automotive customers. In addition,
we are pursuing the integration of advanced 32-bit
microprocessors on chips that require sophisticated signal
processing for intelligent car batteries.
In addition, we are developing an increasing family of
highly-integrated power management and audio companion
IC products for a number of our partners’ popular Application
and Baseband processors. Our products address market
sub-segments, such as smart phones, PND and other
handheld multimedia devices.
During 2007, Dialog’s board and
executive team worked diligently
to position the Company for future
proﬁtable growth. While there is
still room for improvement, I am
pleased to report that we have
made signiﬁcant progress. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 13
“How can we help

conscious world?”
“Y ou know, Dialog has 20 years’ experience
in automotive and industrial IC development.
Our design teams bring an international

with our combined high voltage and high
performance CMOS technology we can give
our customers true system integration
and save power. ” 14 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Chief Executive’s review
Section 2 | Business review
Strengthening our management and skill base
The Non-executive Directors who joined our Board brought
valuable new perspectives from mobile phone operators,
world-class manufacturing and Silicon Valley culture.
These, together with the additional members of the executive
team, who have brought further semiconductor industry
management expertise since early 2006, have made a
significant contribution to the Company’s knowledge base
and, through that, to its strategy.
We continued to attract significant industry talent and expertise
in 2007, particularly in our Design, Application engineering,
Product Marketing, Sales, and Global Manufacturing teams,
and our new design centre in Scotland has already attracted
a highly-qualified team of international R&D engineers.
The restructuring of our manufacturing has, inevitably, resulted
in a degree of turnover in our staff, but it has enabled us to
augment and upgrade our technical and marketing skills
without increasing our total headcount. Most importantly,
this will increase our ability to deliver our mid-term strategy.
A year of recovery
The year was – as we forecast – one of recovery and improving
financial performance. During the first half, we gradually began
to recover from the unforeseen insolvency of our major wireless
customer – BenQ Mobile GmbH – in Q3 2006, while maintaining
a tight control over expenditure and cash management.
Also as we forecast, in the second half of the year, we began
to see a resurgence in revenue from our Wireless products.
This was fuelled by the shipment of our new 3G phones and
portable consumer multimedia products. By the end of the
year, our focus on higher-growth opportunities was already
manifesting itself in quarterly improvements in revenue
and gross margin: we ended Q4 2007 with a normalised
quarterly gross margin approaching 40%.
Gross margin for the full year reached 33.4% – a significant
improvement over 2006 (18.6%) and 2005 (28.3%). This is a
clear indication that our strategy of selecting opportunities in
higher-growth higher-margin segments, while exiting lower-
margin commoditised LCD products, is proving to be a success.
The future
Going forward, we will continue our efforts to fine-tune our
strategy to ensure that the Company is well positioned to deliver
sustainable growth, in revenue and profits, for the benefit of all
our Shareholders.
In 2008 we will focus on developing and accelerating the
implementation of our strategy. We will:
 continue building our our portfolio of Application Specific
Standard Products for power management, audio, display and
automotive applications. These will enable us to broaden our
customer base by using specialist distributors channels;
 enhance our competitive advantage in power management,
advanced audio, and high voltage mixed-signal SoC through
focused R&D;
 increase our sales, marketing and technical support to clients,
worldwide, with particular focus on expansion in the North
America and Asia markets;
 optimise our operating platform by migrating to an advanced
Information Management Systems to enable further scalable
growth; and
 position and communicate Dialog’s brand, strategy and
unique values coherently to the broader markets as well
as to investors.
2007 was a year of recovery, execution and a return to a growth
path, and I am grateful to all Dialog’s employees, who showed
great professionalism and dedication throughout a very
challenging year.
At the heart of our strategy, we continue to be committed to
creating sustainable Shareholder value, and we view sustainable
profitable growth as our prime objective. Subject to wider
economic uncertainties, your Board sees the current year as one
of opportunity for Dialog to demonstrate that sustainable growth,
and attain profitability.
I have every confidence in our future.
Dr Jalal Bagherli
Chief Executive Officer Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 15
Our products and solutions meet
the needs of Original Equipment
Manufacturers (“OEMs”).
We design, develop and deliver
mixed signal components and
system-level solutions in areas
such as power management,
audio CODECs, and System-on-
Chip (“SoC”) integration.
Our solutions
Our solutions address two major markets: mobile handset
and portable electronic devices, and automotive and
industrial electronics.
The continuing decrease in size – and increase in capabilities –
of electronic devices, is a major driver in the development of our
solutions. High-speed data, video and high-quality audio on
mobile telephones and other handheld products, make huge
demands on battery energy management, as well as on the
technology which controls the quality of images and displays.
Our skill in developing highly-integrated silicon solutions
enables our customers to design products which deliver excellent
performance as well as market-leading talk and standby times.
In the automotive market customers use our products in the
comfort and safety systems, as well as in the management and
control of the electronic systems they design for cars; and in the
industrial market customers use our products in highly-integrated
smart-power management systems, such as intelligent electronic
ballasts for fluorescent lighting.
Design, development and production
We are justifiably recognised for the quality and feature-rich
functionality of our mixed signal standard Integrated Circuit
(“IC”) and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”)
solutions. We nevertheless continually work to increase our
digital and analog design expertise, and to develop our
software. During 2007, we invested US$31 million in research
and development.
Our ability to develop mixed signal ASIC and Application Specific
Standard Product (“ASSP”) designs rapidly, enables us to respond
to customers’ needs for new solutions that increase performance
while, at the same time, reducing cost. Our strategy of modifying
and re-using a wide set of specialised analog building blocks
speeds up the design process; in addition, our use of industry-
standard design tools increases the level of automation and
the quality of verification in our products. Our commitment to
continuously deepening our expertise has resulted in increased
levels of integration and product innovation in all business
sectors. We continue to focus our research and development
on state-of-the-art technology to meet the demands of
next-generation products.
Our products
Broadly speaking, we produce two ranges of products which
are both built around similar technology “building blocks” .
For high-volume customers, we engineer and fine-tune system
solutions to their precise specifications; for those market
segments which consist of lower-volume customers, we provide
a range of flexible standard products designed to cover a
broader set of requirements. This approach gives a diverse set
of customers access to the highly-integrated power management,
audio and display technologies developed by Dialog.
Now that the majority of semiconductor manufacturers are
“fabless” (they outsource the fabrication, or manufacture,
of their chips to silicon foundries) the electronics industry is
becoming more specialised. For example, our system platform
partners often enter into agreements with us to design exclusive
custom chips to form part of their systems and, in turn, license
their system platform to a number of manufacturers of end-user
equipment. Those OEM manufacturers complete the circle by
buying the chips from us.
Power management and audio ICs. Effective power
management – in which the design of chips used in hundreds
of millions of mobile phones and other portable devices has
given us a great deal of experience – is increasingly one of the
fundamentals of system design.
Solutions, products and key customers
Section 2 | Business review 16 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Solutions, products and key customers
Section 2 | Business review
We have developed more than 50 different power management
designs for the world’s leading mobile phone manufacturers.
These designs offer unprecedented integration with multiple
power management functions on the chip, including
programmable high-performance LDOs (low drop-out voltage
regulators), high-efficiency DC-DC voltage converters, intelligent
battery charging circuits, LED drivers, sensor ADCs, USB
interfaces, and sophisticated audio capabilities.
By capitalising on our experience in integrating high and low
voltage circuits on CMOS – the most widely-used semiconductor
technology – and combining it with our experience in developing
and integrating high-performance CODECs and other analog
functions, we are able to offer a selection of unique power
management and audio solutions. The integration of more than
30 different functions on a single chip delivers significant space,
power and cost savings to our customers.
Display drivers and related-system ICs. LCD displays have
a significant effect on battery life: when they are left on
permanently they can consume as much as 70% of a device’s
power. To address this market opportunity, we focus on
developing innovative drivers for “always-on” display
technologies, such as e-paper, MEMS and OLED-based
technologies. In May 2007 we launched a number of new
standard products supporting E-Ink Corporation’s electronic
paper displays for the production of consumer devices in 2008.
We recently completed the development of our new
SmartXtend™ technology, which uses a number of innovative
design techniques, including a unique multi-line addressing
scheme, accurate dynamic current matching, and state-of-the-art
power management. This will form the basis of a new family of
display drivers which we will develop for passive matrix OLEDs.
Automotive and industrial system ICs. The ICs we supply to
many leading car manufacturers capitalise on our expertise and
knowledge of technology, ranging from power management
systems and mixed signal design, to high-voltage circuits and
embedded microprocessors on a single chip in a standard
CMOS process. We provide technology for windscreen wipers,
electric windows and motorised seat belts, and our partnership
with leading manufacturers has resulted in chips which can be
connected direct to a car battery without external protection
circuits. In addition, we are pursuing the Systems-on-Chip
integration of advanced 32-bit microprocessors for products
that require sophisticated signal processing for automotive
sensing applications.
Our single-chip solutions for industrial systems integrate
microprocessors with high-voltage, low-power circuits which
allow dimming and power factor correction used for fluorescent
and high intensity lamps.
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”). Our ASICs
form the basis for highly-integrated control chips for smart power
electronic systems, in applications such as computer and mobile
communications systems. They are ideal for situations in which
chips have to be highly integrated and also have the ability to
control high voltages intelligently using digital circuits on the
same chip.
We work in partnership with the silicon foundries which
manufacture our ASIC solutions, to ensure that our customers
have access to the latest CMOS processes, as well as to the
foundries’ capacity. This, combined with our own in-house
engineering capability, ensures that our customers are able
to meet their cost and time-to-market objectives. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 17
Manufacture, assembly and testing
Wafer manufacture. We outsource our wafer production to
selected foundries, principally in Singapore and Taiwan, which
provide high-quality products and have the ability to meet tight
deadlines. Our choice of CMOS, rather than bipolar, technology
enables more transistors to be integrated on a single chip –
a necessary requirement for our target markets – and the end
products are less power hungry.
Assembly and testing. The final assembly of our chips is
outsourced to a number of sub-contractors. Our test
programmes, based on our own and individual customers’
specifications, are developed by our test engineers in parallel
with the design process. In 2007, we concluded our
transformation into a truly “fabless” company when we
completed the transfer of our test, final test and “tape and reel”
manufacturing activity to sub-contractors in the Far East.
We have also created a specialist off-shore support centre in
Taiwan. We have our own manufacturing and technical engineers
close to foundries, and assembly and test sub-contractors in Asia.
By being “on the spot” to resolve any potential engineering
issues quickly, they can forestall potential delays in production.
Quality and environment control
We have an uncompromising approach to quality assurance in
every area of our operations: the participation of each of our
employees, results in a highly-structured quality environment that
wins the approval of all our major customers. The objective of
our quality management system is to provide customers with the
assurance that our products and services not only fulfil their
contractual requirements, but will also meet their future needs.
We have a “zero-fails” target.
We are committed to minimising our impact on the environment
by developing and promoting environmentally-compatible
products, and operate in accordance with the international quality
standard, ISO 14001. We promote awareness and knowledge of
environmental issues throughout the organisation to ensure that
they become a natural part of the decision-making process.
We demand the same standards from our suppliers and form
partnerships with those who are accredited to the same
international quality standards.
For more detailed information on specific products, please see
our Website, www.dialog-semiconductor.com.
Our principal customers
Our principal customers are recognised wireless communications,
consumer electronics, and automotive equipment manufacturers.
These include customers for both our standard products introduced
over recent years and for application specific (ASIC) products.
The rapidly-evolving technology in all our target market sectors
means that a partnership approach with our customers is essential
– whether for standard products or for custom solutions. As a
result, our customers look to Dialog as an outside source of
expertise, while the close working relationship provides us with
an opportunity continually to develop and fine-tune market
leading technological expertise with recognised industry leaders.
We strive to form long-term relationships with all our major
customers. In 2007, major revenue contributions came from
customers such as Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication, Sharp,
Motorola, Apple, Bosch, ContiTemic, Tridonic, Siemens, Adtran
and Qualcomm.

Segmental reporting
Wireless communications. Revenues in this segment were
US$51.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2007
(2006: US$57.9 million) comprising 59.4% (2006: 61.7%) of
our total revenues. The 11% decrease in revenue was a result
of anticipated lower sales as certain products were phased out
following the planned transition from 2G to 3G, and successor
products began to contribute to revenue only in the second
half of 2007. When comparing the second half of 2007 with
that of 2006, the Company increased revenues by 186% to
US$44.0 million in 2007 (2006: US$15.5 million), as a direct
result of successfully introducing new consumer entertainment
products and 3G cell phones.
The operating loss decreased in 2007 by 58.4% to US$13.0
million (2006: US$31.1 million). This was achieved through
increased revenue in the second half of 2007, coupled with a
richer product mix and higher margins derived from new products
introduced during the period. In the second half of 2007 we
achieved an operating profit of US$1.1 million (2006: operating
loss of US$25.7 million).
Automotive/industrial applications. Revenues decreased
slightly to US$35.3 million (2006: US$36.0 million), or 40.6%
(2006: 38.3%) of total revenues for the year ended 31 December
2007. In this sector, as a result of the investments we made to
fuel our anticipated growth, we made an operating loss of
US$1.6 million (2006: US$0.9 million).
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2007 were
US$86.8 million (2006: US$93.9 million). Excluding those
revenues generated in 2006 from discontinued products
(low-margin commodity STN liquid crystal displays were no
longer marketed in 2007), baseline revenues increased by 11%.
This more than compensated for the revenue lost in 2006 as a
result of the insolvency of BenQ Mobile GmbH. In the second half
of 2007, revenues of US$59.3 million (2006: US$33.5 million)
represented an increase of 77%.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of
materials, outsourced production
and assembly, related personnel
costs, and applicable overhead
and depreciation of test and
other equipment.
2006
81.4
2007
66.6
Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 19
For the year ended 31 December 2007, cost of sales decreased
by 24.4% to US$57.8 million (2006: US$76.4 million), 66.6% of
total earnings (2006: 81.4% of total earnings). This demonstrated
the gains made possible by our ongoing efforts to improve the
Company’s product mix and the efficiency of the restructuring
measures undertaken over the past 18 months.
Sales and marketing expenses
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, travel
expenses, sales commission, and advertising and other marketing
costs. In 2007, sales and marketing expenses, at US$7.3 million
(2006: US$7.2 million) or 8.4% (2006: 7.6%) were at the same
level as in 2006. It might be expected that a decrease in sales
commission, resulting from lower revenue, would have resulted
in a decrease in overall costs, but we invested in creating value
by increasing staff in strategic marketing functions.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
personnel and support costs for our finance, human resources
and other management departments. General and administrative
expenses decreased to US$7.9 million in 2007 (2006:
US$17.6 million). The amount in 2006 included costs incurred
as a write-down of accounts receivable of US$2.6 million, and
inventory and materials at suppliers of US$5.8 million, dedicated
to BenQ Mobile GmbH, a former customer, which became
insolvent in the third quarter of 2006. Excluding these one-off
charges, general and administrative expenses would have totalled
US$9.2 million in 2006. As a percentage of total revenues,
general and administrative expenses (excluding the one-off
effects) decreased to 9.2% in 2007 (2006: 9.8%). When
comparing the second half of 2007 with the first half, general
and administrative expenses increased by 5%, while revenues
increased by more than 115%.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist principally of design
and engineering-related costs associated with the development
of new Application Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”) and
Application Specific Standard Products (“ASSPs”). Research and
development expenses increased to US$31.1 million in 2007
(2006: US$27.5 million). The Company continues to invest in
audio, emerging display technologies and automotive intelligent
sensors to position itself for further growth and diversification.
As a result of working from a lower revenue base, research and
development expenses as a percentage of total revenues
increased to 35.8% (2006: 29.3%) over these periods.
Section 2 | Business review
Cost of sales as % of revenue Other operating income
Other operating income includes an unexpected settlement of
US$0.9 million, received in November 2007, against a receivable
which had been written down in 2006 as a result of the
insolvency of BenQ Mobile GmbH.
Restructuring and related impairment charges
Restructuring and related impairment charges in 2007 are mainly
comprised of US$0.4 million of employee termination costs,
impairment charges, other losses and gains relating to assets that
became redundant of US$0.3 as well as other costs, especially for
transportation, of US$0.4 million, resulting from the transfer of
the Company’s Wafer Test, Final Test and Tape & Reel operations,
from Nabern, Germany, to dedicated outsourced assembly and
test organisations in Asia. As a result of the transfer, the
Company reduced its workforce by 33 employees in the third
quarter of 2006 and a further six employees in the fourth quarter
of 2007.
In 2006 restructuring and related impairment charges mainly
comprised US$1.6 million employee termination costs and
US$4.1 million of asset impairment charges.
For further information see note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements (page 52).
Operating loss
We reported an operating loss
of US$17.3 million for 2007
(2006: US$41.0 million).
The improvement primarily
resulted from higher gross
profits recognised in the year
and lower restructuring charges,
as described above. In addition,
2006 included the write-down of BenQ Mobile GmbH
receivables, inventory and materials at suppliers.
Write-down of investment
In the third quarter, we recorded a one-off charge of
US$2.7 million. This related to a write-down in the value of
our investment in Digital Imaging Systems (a former division
of the Company which became a spin-off woth venture capital
funding in February 2006), as a result of the reduced visibility
of revenue break-even in this business and an increase in long-
term funding requirements. Of the amount written down,
US$1.6 million relates to payments made before 31 December
2006 and US$1.1 million relates to further payments the
Company was committed to in 2007.

Section 2 | Business review
Interest income, net
Interest and similar income, net, from the Company’s investments
(primarily short-term deposits and securities) was US$1.0 million
for the year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: US$1.2 million).
The reduction was primarily as a result of the decrease in liquidity.
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses, net
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from amounts
ultimately realised on the settlement of foreign currency
transactions, and from the period-end remeasurement of foreign
currency-denominated receivables, payables and cash into US
dollars (2006: into euros). Foreign currency gains, net, were
US$0.5 million for 2007 (2006: losses of US$2.1 million).
As described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
on 1 January 2007, the Company changed its functional currency
from the euro to the US dollar. For this reason, although the
dollar lost in value against the euro in both periods, we show a
foreign currency gain in 2007 and a foreign currency loss in 2006.
Income tax benefit (expense)
Income tax expense was US$136,000 in 2007 (2006: benefit of
US$158,000). The tax benefit recorded in 2006 principally relates
to a refund of a corporation tax credit in Germany which we
were able to recognise after a change in tax legislation during
that year.
Loss from discontinued operations
There were no losses from discontinued operations. Losses from
discontinued operations in 2006 of US$2.3 million were incurred
through the disposal of our Imaging division in February 2006,
as well as legal and transaction fees related to the transaction.
For further information see note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements (page 51).
Net loss
For the reasons described above,
we reported a net loss of
US$19.0 million in 2007
(2006: US$44.0). Loss per share
(basic) was US$0.42 in 2007
(2006: US$0.99).

Cash flows
Cash used for operating activities was US$10.2 million for the

Net loss (US$million) Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 21
The cash outflow in 2007 relates primarily to the financing
of working capital, principally trade accounts receivable and
inventory in the second half of 2007. The cash inflow in 2006
mainly resulted from the collection of trade accounts receivable
and lower inventory balances.
Cash used for investing activities was US$6.1 million for the year
ended 31 December 2007 (2006: US$6.6 million). Cash used for
investing activities during 2007 principally consisted of the
purchase of tooling (masks), laboratory equipment, probe cards,
load boards and, to a lesser extent, test equipment, for a total
of US$4.1 million (2006: US$3.7 million); a further payment
of US$1.0 million for our committed investment in Digital
Imaging Systems; US$1.1 million (2006: US$1.3 million) for the
purchase of software and licences; and payment related to
capitalised development costs of US$0.7 million (2006: US$nil).
This cash outflow was partially offset by cash in-flows of
US$1.1 million from the sale of excess assets resulting from our
restructuring activities. For further information see note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements (page 52).
Liquidity
At 31 December 2007 we had cash and cash equivalents of
US$15.9 million (2006: US$32.0 million) and marketable
securities of US$19.9 million (2006: US$19.4 million).
The working capital (defined as current assets minus current
liabilities) was US$36.1 million (2006: US$54.4 million). As at
31 December 2007 we had no long-term debt.
A reduction in customer demand for our products, caused by
unfavourable industry conditions or an inability to develop new
products in response to technological changes, could materially
reduce the amount of cash generated from operations.
If necessary, we have short-term credit facilities of US$9.4 million
(€6.4 million) available that bear interest at a rate of EURIBOR
+0.75% per annum. At 31 December 2007 we had no amounts
outstanding under this facility. As a result of entering into a
factoring agreement, as stated in note 25 to the consolidated
financial statements (page 72), which provides the Company
with up to €10.0 million (or US$ equivalent) of readily-available
cash, the Company decided to reduce the credit line from its
lead bank from previously €12.5 million to €6.4 million
(US$9.4 million). Accordingly, we believe the funding available
from these and other sources will be sufficient to satisfy our
working capital requirements in the near- to medium-term
if required.

Financial review
Section 2 | Business review
The balance sheet total was US$71.2 million at 31 December
2007 (2006: US$83.1 million). Cash and cash equivalents and
securities (held as available for sale and held to maturity)
decreased by 30.2% to US$35.8 million (2006: US$51.4 million).
This was mainly the result of an operating cash outflow to finance
increasing working capital needs, particularly in the second half of
2007 as described above.
Non-current assets held for sale were reduced to zero by
31 December 2007 as a result of assets being sold, written down
or reclassified to property plan and equipment. For further
information see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements
(page 52).
Total non-current assets, as at 31 December 2007, increased to
US$17.6 million (2006: US$16.3 million) or 24.7% (2006: 19.6%)
of the balance sheet total. The increase mainly results from capital
expenditure and investments in 2007 of US$7.0 million and the
acquisition of new securities, classified as “held to-maturity”,
of US$4.0 million. It was partly offset by the depreciation and
amortisation of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets of US$6.4 million, the write-down of the investment in
Digital Imaging Systems of US$2.6 million (see above), disposals
of assets with a net book value of US$0.6 million and the asset
write-down related to the restructuring of US$0.3 million.
Current liabilities in 2007 were US$5.1 million above the previous
year’s level. They relate primarily to higher trade accounts payable
in the course of our increased business volume in the second half
of 2007.
We had no non-current liabilities at 31 December 2007.
Shareholders’ equity decreased to US$53.7 million at
31 December 2007 (2006: US$70.7 million) as a result of
the net loss which occurred during the year. The equity ratio,
while decreasing from 85% to 75%, remains healthy, however.
Off-balance sheet arrangements and other commitments
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements involving variable
interest entities. We lease all our office facilities, office equipment
and vehicles under operating leases. In addition we have
contracted consulting services related to CAD (computer aided
design) until 29 December 2009. Future minimum payments
under these agreements, which have initial or remaining terms
in excess of one year at 31 December 2007, are as follows:

We have no long-term debt, capital lease obligations,
unconditional purchase obligations or any other long-term
obligations that would have a material impact on our liquidity
or financial condition. We have supply agreements with
various suppliers.
Dividends
We did not pay dividends in the years ended 31 December 2007
and 2006 and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable
future. Dialog’s Board of Directors is committed to re-investing all
profits into creating a framework for future growth and continues
to believe that – in line with the strategic changes underway –
this policy is in the best interest of Dialog’s Shareholders.
Jean-Michel Richard
CFO, Vice President Finance Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 23
The market
The market in which we compete is intensely competitive and
highly cyclical, and is characterised by continuous development
and technological improvement. Our future success depends on
our ability to anticipate and respond to new market trends, to
implement new designs rapidly to meet customers’ needs, and to
keep abreast of the technological changes. As a result, we invest
in research and development to enable us to create innovative
designs and products on a cost-effective, timely basis.
Revenue and profitability
While we have not been profitable for the past seven financial
years, and cannot guarantee that we will become so, we
constantly seek to improve profitability by launching new
products and acquiring new customers. Since we continue to
rely on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial
proportion of our revenue, the loss of one or more of these
customers would be likely to have a material affect. Our goal is
to spread this risk by acquiring more customers. In the past year,
we have made considerable progress in this objective.
We are attempting to reduce the risk of our revenues, profitability
and growth being affected by a slow-down in the wireless
communications market by winning customers in other sectors.
Third-party costs
During 2007, we outsourced our manufacturing and testing
to lower-cost environments, where there is excellent capacity,
to overcome the potential problem of an inability to access
manufacturing capacity which would result in increased costs
and, therefore, decreased revenue.
Intellectual property
We make strenuous efforts to protect our intellectual property
from being copied or used by others.
Interest rate risk
The Company earns interest from bank deposits, uses money
market deposits and invests in non-current interest-bearing
held-to-maturity investments. It has also invested in highly-liquid
“investment-grade” rated debt-based funds – classified as
held-to-maturity – which are contracted to mature in 2010 and
which incorporate a floating interest rate linked to market rates.
It is our policy to manage our interest income using a mix of fixed
and variable interest rate debts. To achieve this, we invest in
highly-liquid funds which have a matching investment strategy.
Funds not needed for financing operations in the near future are
invested in floating interest rate securities. Only short-term
deposits bear fixed interest rates.
Currency risk
The Company’s functional – and presentational – currency is
the US dollar, and the majority of its revenue and expenses are
in that currency.
There are, however, foreign exchange risks associated with
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities in other
currencies, primarily the euro and the pound sterling.
Transaction currency exposures arise from sales or purchases
in currencies other than the US dollar. We use forward currency
contracts to eliminate our exposure associated with the payment
of salaries and wages in other currencies. We maximise the
effectiveness of our hedge derivatives by matching the terms and
conditions of the hedge to those of the underlying obligation.
(See Note 25 on page 73 for further information.)
Other price risks
IFRS 7 requires us to disclose how hypothetical changes in risk
variables, such as stock exchange prices, would affect the price
of financial instruments.
As part of our cash management, we invest in available-for-sale
securities with defined maturities and repayments of 100% of
their nominal amounts. Fluctuations could occur during their
maturity, however, and have an impact on the Company’s profit
or loss. (See Note 25 on page 74 for further information.)
Credit risk
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities
and certain of its financing activities. We ensure that our
exposure to bad debt is minimised by constantly monitoring all
customers who trade on credit terms, and receivable balances.
In August 2007, we entered into a factoring agreement with a
reputable German financial institution for a total of €10 million
to finance our growth. Since the financial institution assumes all
risks associated with the collection of receivables from selected
customers, the agreement significantly reduces our risks
associated with their collection.
We, in turn, have pledged US$6.5 million of our securities
to the financial institution concerned. These will be drawn
on only if an action of ours partially or completely invalidates
the claim on a receivable that had been financed through the
factoring programme.
Our exposure to credit risks arising from other financial assets,
such as cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity financial investments, would arise from the
default of a counterparty and is limited to the carrying amount
of the particular instruments.
Liquidity risk
We monitor our liquidity on a quarterly basis with the objective
of avoiding interest on short-term bank liabilities or overdrafts.
Our policy is to structure the maturity of our current financial
assets in the Group to meet 100% of the respective maturities
and liabilities.
Risks and their management
Section 2 | Business review 24 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Corporate social responsibility
Section 2 | Business review
Corporate social responsibility
Dialog is committed to the adoption of the Electronics Industry
Code of Conduct (EICC) standard as the model for ensuring that
working conditions for internal and external suppliers are safe and
that all workers are treated with respect and dignity. In addition,
the company complies with the ISO 14001 environmental standard
– and expects its suppliers to do the same – in order to ensure
that all manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.
Management systems
Dialog’s management system complies with the EICC code.
It is certified to the TS16949 international standard as a formal
implementation of the code and is committed to implementing
and facilitating continuous improvements, and to mitigating
operations-related risks. To enable us to comply with all applicable
laws, regulations and customer requirements, as required by
the code, we also ensure that all our major supply-chain partners
are accredited to the same standard. To ensure that we constantly
improve our management systems, we regularly review and audit
internal and supply-chain management systems.
The environment and environmental protection
Our commitment to the environment is evidenced by our ISO14001
certification. Since we firmly believe that sustainable development
can be secured only if we safeguard our valuable resources, we
deal only with suppliers which have similar environmental goals
and are also accredited to the ISO14001 standard.
Within our supply chain, we continually emphasise that
environmental issues should be an instinctive part of any
decision-making process, and that suppliers should use
environmentally-friendly technology to:
 reduce and eliminate emissions of ozone-depleting,
and other, chemicals;
 manage, reduce and dispose of hazardous substances safely;
 monitor and control waste water and solid waste emissions;
 reduce and eliminate all types of waste, including water
and energy;
 reduce waste by maximising product yields; and
 ensure all environmental permits are obtained,
maintained and kept current.
Health and safety
Dialog considers a safe and healthy working environment to be
essential in the maintenance of employees’ morale and in the
production of high-quality and innovative products. As a result,
we require our major suppliers also to be committed to ensuring
the creation of healthy and safe working conditions. We expect
them to provide evidence of suitable controls, safe working
procedures, preventative maintenance and general protective
measures in their working environments.
When hazards cannot be adequately controlled by these means
alone, suitable protective clothing or equipment is supplied, and
evacuation procedures and facilities are in place at Dialog’s and
suppliers’ premises.
Connecting with employees
Dialog aims to attract and retain the best people by ensuring
that all employees receive comprehensive on-the-job formal
training, coaching and mentoring. Clear and regular
communication is achieved through regular company-wide
information sessions, led by the CEO, and every effort is made to
keep employees fully aware of Company matters that affect them.
We encourage employee feedback at all levels for new ideas
to improve business efficiency and performance. We support
initiatives and fund raising in the local communities in which we
work. In 2007, for example, we made a contribution to a cancer
hospice charity.
Ethics
Dialog believes that continued success in the semiconductor
market can be achieved only by adopting continuously high
standards of ethical behaviour when dealing with customers,
suppliers and workers. It is particularly important to protect
Intellectual Property (“IP”), which is the key to ensuring the
development of innovative solutions to complex problems.
Any transfer of technology or know-how is always done in a
manner that protects IP rights; effective protection also means
that products can be discussed openly with our business partners.
The disclosure of information which is related to business activities,
structure, our financial situation and performance is always carried
out in accordance with applicable regulations and prevailing
industry practices. We expect the highest standards of integrity
from all Dialog stakeholders; any malpractice is strictly prohibited
and may result in immediate termination and legal action.
Neither we nor our suppliers offer or accept inducements or
any other means of obtaining undue or improper advantage.
We have a “whistleblower” policy in place to protect employees’
confidentiality and encourage our suppliers to do the same.
Human rights
Dialog’s suppliers must demonstrate a commitment to upholding
workers’ human rights and to treating them with dignity and
respect. Standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Social Accountability International and the Ethical Trading
Initiative have been used as a basis for these requirements.
All labour must be given voluntarily and workers must be free to
leave their employment on reasonable notice. Child labour must
not be used at any stage of manufacturing. Working hours must
not exceed the maximum set by local laws, and wages must
comply with all applicable laws.
Suppliers must ensure that workers are not threatened or
subjected to inhumane or harsh treatment, harassment or any
form of unlawful discrimination. Communication and direct
engagement between workers and management is encouraged,
even in those countries where there is no meaningful
legal protection. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 25

Directors’ report
The Directors of Dialog Semiconductor Plc (“Dialog” or “the Company”) present their Annual Report and audited financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007. These accounts have been prepared for UK reporting purposes; separate accounts which comply
with the rules governing the Company’s Germany listing are available on the Company’s Website, www.dialog-semiconductor.com.
Principal activities and review of the business
Dialog Semiconductor develops and supplies a range of innovative integrated circuit (IC) solutions for wireless, automotive and
industrial electronic systems. The Company’s background and strengths are in designing low-power mixed signal circuits for sensing,
processing and conversion, high-quality audio, and expert handling of high voltages on CMOS technology. It operates a “fabless”
business model, under which it designs ICs, outsources the production of silicon wafers, packaging, and testing, then delivers final
chips to its customers, which are designers and manufacturers of mobile handsets and portable electronic products, and industrial and
automotive suppliers.
The Company’s corporate headquarters are located near Stuttgart, Germany. It has product development facilities in Kirchheim,
Heidelberg and Munich in Germany; Graz in Austria; Swindon and Edinburgh in the UK; and Tokyo in Japan.
More information about the business is set out in the Chairman’s statement, on page 6, and in the Business review, on pages 10 to 24.
Future developments
The Group’s stated objective is to be the leading global supplier of lowest-power, highest-quality mixed signal components and system
level solutions to the wireless and automotive markets.
Research and development (R&D)
The Group believes that its future competitive position will depend on its ability to respond to the rapidly-changing needs of its
customers by developing new designs in a timely and cost-effective manner. To this end, the Company’s management is committed
to investing in researching and developing new products and customising existing products.
To date, R&D projects have been in response to key customers’ requests to assist in the development of new products, and for the
development of application-specific standard products (ASSPs). The Company does not expect any material change to this approach
in the foreseeable future.
Going concern
After reviewing the 2008 budget and longer-term plans, the directors are satisfied that, at the time of approving the financial
statements, it is appropriate to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Company.
Dividends
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2007: nil). They are committed to re-investing all profits into the business
and believe that this policy is in the best interests of its Shareholders.
Purchase of own shares
The Company operates an Employee Share Option Trust which purchases shares in the Company for the benefit of employees under
the Company’s share option scheme. Since the Company has control of the assets and liabilities of the Trust, they are included
in the Company and Group balance sheets. At 31 December 2007, the Trust held 1,046,387 shares, which represented 2.3% of the
total called-up share capital, at a nominal value of £104,639.
Share capital
Details of the share capital are set out in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
Substantial shareholdings

in accordance with their aptitudes and abilities.
Statement on disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the directors’ report are listed on page 26. Having made
enquiries of fellow directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of the directors affirms that:
 to the best of their knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the preparation of their report of which the

 they have taken all reasonable steps to be aware of relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors
are aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The notice convening the Annual General Meeting will be published separately and posted on the Company’s website.
The meeting will be held at Tower Bridge House, St Katherine’s Way, London E1W 1AA on 30 April 2008 at 9am.

Corporate Governance
Governance standards
Dialog Semiconductor Plc is committed to implementing high levels of governance. Accordingly, Dialog Semiconductor (as a foreign
company listed on the German stock exchange) has established and published its own Corporate Governance Principles corresponding
in substance to the provision of the “German Declaration on Corporate Governance”.
Dialog’s Corporate Governance principles are published on its Website (www.dialog-semiconductor.com). The Website also contains
a full version of the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This details Dialog’s expectations regarding the ethical standards
that each Director, officer and employee should follow while acting on the Company’s behalf.
Corporate Governance information relating to the past financial year is set out below.
Shareholders and the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The AGM, at which the annual financial statements and audit reports are presented, is the main forum for Shareholders to
exercise their voting rights. Directors appointed by the Board during any given year are subject to Shareholder approval at the AGM.
In addition, one-third of the Directors must resign each year and may put themselves forward for re-election. Changes to the
constitution of the Company are decided by Shareholders’ resolution. Similarly, the AGM is the forum at which Shareholders can
authorise the Directors to issue new shares.
Dialog does not have any shares in issue which have multiple voting rights, preferential voting rights or maximum voting rights.
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for determining Dialog’s business strategy and ensuring that an executive is appointed to implement it.
It is also responsible for overseeing the financial aspects of the business.
The Board, which met five times during the year, currently consists of eight Non-executive Directors and one executive Director.
The compensation provided to each Director is detailed in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 32 and 33. The executive
Director’s remuneration is performance related and is connected to a set of goals and Dialog’s profitability.
Audit Committee, and Nomination and Remuneration Committee
During the year, Dialog’s Audit Committee comprised the following Directors: Aidan Hughes (Chairman), Michael Glover, Peter Weber
and Peter Tan. The Committee is responsible for monitoring financial statements and reviewing the performance of the external
Auditors. It also assesses the efficiency of the audit process and (among other things) considers compliance with accounting standards.
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary and representatives of the external Auditors usually attend
Audit Committee meetings.
During the year, the Audit, and Nomination and Remuneration Committees met frequently to analyse issues under their jurisdiction,
usually on the day before each Board meeting.
The roles of the Compensation Committee, and of the Governance and Nomination Committee have been changed since the year
end. The Board reviewed the Committees’ responsibilities and concluded that, because their work often overlapped, the existence
of two Committees did not represent the most efficient format for Dialog. The following changes have resulted:
 the Compensation Committee, and the Governance and Nomination Committee have been merged to form the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee. The members of the new Committee are Russ Shaw (Chairman), Michael Glover and Chris Burke. With
the exception of Corporate Governance, the new Nomination and Remuneration Committee takes over the responsibilities of the
previous Committees. These include determining, subject to Board approval, the salaries and incentives of Dialog’s senior executives
and deciding on the size and composition of the Board; and
 Corporate Governance is now monitored at Board level – a reflection of the importance it is given by the Board.
Section 3 | Management and governance 30 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Corporate Governance
Section 3 | Management and governance
Transparency
Under UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules, significant Shareholders are required to notify Dialog of a shareholding of 3% or more.
Dialog must then notify BaFin and the Stock Exchange. Under s.15a of the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz)
transactions in the Company’s shares carried out by members of the Board of Directors and their family members are reported and
published without delay.
The Company operates a Code of Dealing in its shares which is designed to prevent insider trading and the abuse of price sensitive
information.
The Board appreciates the value of keeping Shareholders informed of Dialog’s performance throughout the year. As a result it publishes
quarterly financial reports, together with key information on the AGM, on its Website.
Business conduct and ethics
Dialog seeks to comply with all laws and regulations that have an impact on its business. In addition, the Company expects its
employees and Directors to act with honesty, integrity and fairness in the conduct of its business. Dialog’s Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics is published on the Company’s Website.
Dialog is committed to taking account of interests outside the Company, including those of employees, business partners, the
environment and the local communities on which it has an impact. The Board values, and has developed, a culture of corporate social
responsibility that takes the above factors into consideration.
Audit and auditors
The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Dialog’s Auditors, Ernst and Young (“E&Y”). E&Y were appointed in
October 2006 following a tender process.
The remuneration given to the Auditors over the past two financial years is detailed in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements
on page 80.
The Company’s audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006, and the reports from the Directors and Auditors
thereon, were presented to, and approved by, the Shareholders at the AGM of the Company held on 10 May 2007. E&Y, the
Company’s independent Auditor, was reappointed until the following AGM.
Declaration of conformity with regard to the German Corporate Governance Code
Dialog Semiconductor Plc has established and published its own Corporate Governance principles corresponding in substance
to the provisions of the German “Corporate Governance Code” as amended on 14 June 2007 thereby adopting in substance the
recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code.
This declaration is available on the Internet at: www.dialog-semiconductor.com.

Policy on Directors’ remuneration
The Board is responsible for setting the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration; the Compensation Committee agrees the
remuneration for each executive Director.
The primary objectives of the Company’s policy on executive Directors’ remuneration are first, that it should be structured so as to
attract and retain executives of a high calibre, with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company successfully and,
second, to reward them in a way which encourages the creation of value for the Company’s Shareholders.
The performance measurement of each executive Director and the determination of his annual remuneration package are undertaken
by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee comprises Non-
executive Directors and its role is, to apply the Board’s policy on remuneration. The current members of the committee are
Russ Shaw (Chairman), Michael Glover and Chris Burke.
The Company has one executive Director, Dr Jalal Bagherli, who was appointed on 12 September 2005. The executive Director’s
remuneration consists of three components:
1. Salary – reflects the executive’s experience, responsibilities and market value;
2. Bonus – as part of his remuneration Dr Bagherli received a supplementary bonus, which was payable quarterly until 31 September
2007 and relates to benefits associated with an early exit from his previous employment contract. Further bonuses are based
on objectives set by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee relative to the performance of the Group, as an incentive to
Dr Bagherli to achieve relevant and demanding targets, such as revenue growth, operating profit, design wins; and
3. Share options – details are set out in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements (page 65).
Compensation of Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors, who are not associated with any of our principal Shareholders, are paid quarterly for their roles as Directors.

Share options granted to the Non-executive Directors
Each Non-executive Director is entitled to an initial grant of 50,000 options vesting monthly in 48 equal tranches. As soon as possible
after the AGM, Non-executive Directors will receive a further 20,000 options vesting over 12 months. Options may be exercised at
the market price prevailing at the date of grant. The Non-executive Directors are not subject to performance criteria related to
remuneration, including Board membership fees, attendance fees and stock option grants. The stock options granted to Non-executive

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the IFRS Report and Accounts 2006 and the Group and parent company financial
statements in accordance with the applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under the law
the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and have elected to
prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
The Group and parent company financial statements are required by law and IFRS as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial
position of the Group and the parent company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to
such financial statements that references in the relevant part of the Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are
references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration
report that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s
Website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislations in
other jurisdictions.
To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the consolidated financial statements give
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Group, and the Group management report
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description
of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the Group.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Responsibility statement Independent Auditors’ report
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
Independent auditors’ report to the members of the Board of Directors of Dialog Semiconductor Plc:
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Dialog Semiconductor Plc for
the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Group income statement, the Group and parent company balance sheets, the
Group company cash flow statement, the Group and parent company statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 33.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in
the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. This report is made solely to the Company‘s members,
as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European
Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the Group financial information, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Director’s report
includes that specific information presented in the operating and financial review that is cross referred from the business review section
of the Directors’ report. In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions are not disclosed. We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the unaudited part of the Directors’
remuneration report, the Chairman’s statement, the operating and financial review and the Corporate Governance statement.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of
the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its loss for the year then ended;
 the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007;
 the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
 the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
1. General
Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS and its
interpretation adopted by the EU. Based on these standards, management has applied the accounting policies as set out below.
After completing the transfer of the Wafer Test, Final Test and Tape & Reel operations from the largest company within the Group in Kirchheim/Teck,
Germany, to subcontractors in the Far East, all the manufacturing costs of the producing companies within the Group became US dollar denominated.
The transfer of these activities was also considered a trigger for changing the functional currency of the largest company within the Group from euros
to US dollars. With all significant companies within the Group having the US dollar as their functional currency, the Group changed its presentation
currency from euros to US dollars effective from 1 January 2007.
The financial statements are now presented in US dollars (“US$”) except when otherwise stated. All prior period numbers, including amounts presented
in the balance sheet, the income statement, the cash flow statement, the statement of changes in Shareholders’ equity and all notes were translated at
the year-end exchange rate as of 31 December 2006 (1€ = US$1.3181). The resulting translated amounts for non-monetary items are treated at their
historical cost.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments classified as available-for-sale and derivative financial
instruments are stated at their fair value.
A summary of significant accounting policies is provided in note 2.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors
on 28 February 2008.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation and investments in affiliated companies
The consolidated financial statements include Dialog Semiconductor Plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year:
Name Registered office Participation
Dialog Semiconductor GmbH Kirchheim/Teck, Germany 100%
Dialog Semiconductor (UK) Limited Swindon, UK 100%
Dialog Semiconductor, Inc. Wilmington, Delaware, USA 100%
Dialog Semiconductor KK Tokyo, Japan 100%
Dialog Semiconductor GmbH, Taiwan Branch Taipei, Taiwan 100%
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which Dialog Semiconductor Plc obtains control, and continues to be
consolidated until the date such control ceases.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances, income and expenses, and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions are fully eliminated.
Foreign exchange
The functional currency for the Company’s operations is generally the currency in which it primarily generates and expends cash. Each entity in the
Group determines its own functional currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of companies whose functional currency is other than the
US dollar are included in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities into the reporting currency (US$) at the exchange rates applicable
at the end of the reporting year.
Equity accounts are measured at historical rates. The statements of income and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates during the year.
Translation gains or losses are accumulated as a separate component of Shareholders’ equity. 42 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Transactions in a foreign currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences
are taken to profit and loss with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign
entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment at which time they are recognised in profit or loss. Tax charges and
credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at
fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are disclosed separately in the income statement, at each reporting period. Regarding the change in the functional currency please see note
1. Key exchange rates against US dollars used in preparing the consolidated financial statements were:

Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument in another. Financial
assets include, in particular, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other originated loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments
and derivative and non-derivative financial assets held for trading, as well as investments available for sale. Financial liabilities generally substantiate
claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset. In particular, this includes trade payables, liabilities to banks and derivative financial liabilities.
In general, financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the entity
currently has a right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis.
Investments and other financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as being at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments
or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are first recognised, they are measured at fair value, plus, in case of
investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets on first recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation
at each financial year end.
All regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date, which is the date that the Group receives the asset. Regular
purchases or sales are classified as purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by
regulation or convention of the market place.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less and are subject to an insignificant risk
of changes in value.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified as loans and
receivables, held-to-maturity investments or as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. These financial assets are generally measured at
fair value.
After initial measurement available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses, net of the related tax effect,
on available-for-sale financial assets are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of other reserves until realised, or the investment
is determined as being impaired. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 43
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
At each reporting date, the carrying amounts of available-for-sale assets are assessed to determine whether there is objective, significant evidence of
impairment as outlined in IAS 39.59. Any impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are charged to earnings. The Group does not use
allowance accounts in order to record the impairment in the balance sheet but credits the impairment loss directly against the book value of the financial
assets. If this impairment relates to losses previously recognised in equity then the impairment loss is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses in respect of equity instruments or investment funds that are classified as available for sale and are not recognised in profit
or loss. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through profit or loss if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices
at the close of business on the balance sheet date. For investments in which there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation
techniques, including recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the
same; discounted cash flow analysis; or other valuation models. If the fair value of unquoted equity instruments cannot be measured with sufficient
reliability, these instruments are measured at cost (less any impairment losses, if applicable).
Financial assets held-to-maturity
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has
the positive intention and ability to do so. After initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. The effective interest method takes into account any premium or discount on acquisition and includes transaction costs and fees
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the investments are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The carrying amount of financial assets held-to-maturity are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective, material evidence of
impairment as outlined in IAS 39.59. Any impairment losses caused by the fair value being lower than the carrying amount are recognised in profit or
loss. The Group does not use allowance accounts in order to record the impairment in the balance sheet but credits the impairment loss directly against
the book value of the financial assets. If in a subsequent period the fair value increases and this increase can be related objectively to events occurring
after the impairment was recognised, the impairment loss is reversed to income in the appropriate amount. The fair value which is required for
impairment testing corresponds to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market, such as trade
account receivables. Loans and receivables are recorded at fair value. As of 31 December 2007 as well as 31 December 2006, loans and receivables
comprise mostly trade accounts receivables from customers. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less any allowance for impairment, if necessary.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired. Interest effects on the
application of the effective interest method are also recognised in profit or loss.
The Company continuously reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts. Management considers the collectability of a trade account receivable to be
impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the sales terms, based on current information
and events regarding the customers’ ability to meet their obligations. The amount of the impairment loss on loans and receivables is measured as the
difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest
rate of the financial asset. The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent reporting period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can objectively be related to an event occurring
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed and recognised in profit or loss.
When a trade receivable is considered to be impaired, any credit losses are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts through a charge to bad
debt expense. Account balances are set off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is
considered remote. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written-off are recorded when received. Reversals of impairment losses are recognised
in profit and loss. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
Receivables from work in process for customer specific development projects according to IAS 11 are recorded in the balance sheet line “trade account
receivables and other receivables” and are disclosed in the notes respectively. 44 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007

For the year ended 31 December 2007
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset is de-recognised when:
 the right to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
 the Company retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a
third party under a “pass through agreement”; or
 the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the
asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and
rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement in it.
Inventories
Inventories include assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods), in the process of production (work in process) or in the form
of materials to be consumed in the production process (raw materials). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost, which
includes direct materials, labour and overhead, plus indirect overhead, is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs to make the sale.
Non-current assets held for sale
Assets that meet the criteria of IFRS 5 are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather
than through continuing use. The assets are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The assets have been accounted for at the
lower of the carrying amount and the estimated fair value, less costs to sell.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. These include the cost of replacing
part of the plant and equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Equipment Useful life
Test equipment Three to eight years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or lease term
Office and other equipment 18 months to 13 years
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Intangible assets
Purchased intangible assets with definite useful lives primarily consist of licences, software and patents, and are recorded at acquisition cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
three to five years. For a particular software licence a useful life of ten years was estimated. Amortisation expenses are allocated to the cost of goods
sold, selling expenses, research and development expenses, or general administration expenses. The Company has no intangible assets with an
indefinite useful life.
Self-developed intangible assets are recorded on a cost basis. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated usefulness of 18-24 months.
Please also refer to the research and development costs section.
Impairment of non-monetary assets
In accordance with IAS 36, at each reporting date an assessment is made as to whether there is an indication that a non-monetary asset, such as
property, plant and equipment or purchased intangibles, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, an estimate is made of the asset’s recoverable
amount: the higher of an asset’s fair value, less cost to sell and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount,
the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. In determining the fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 45
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
For assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist
or may have decreased. If such indication exists, an estimation of the recoverable amount is made. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the
case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount, however, cannot exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit
or loss unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. As of 31 December 2007 and 2006
no non-monetary assets have been accounted for using a fair value model.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities primarily include trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, derivative financial liabilities and other liabilities.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised costs
After initial recognition at fair value, less directly attributable transaction costs, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at
fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading and, therefore, accounted
for at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Gains and losses on liabilities held for trading are
recognised in profit or loss.
During the financial years 2007 and 2006 the Company did not classify any financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward contracts, mainly for the purposes of hedging currency risks that arise from its
operating activities. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value on each subsequent reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and
as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly
to profit or loss.
The fair value of quoted derivatives is equal to their positive or negative market value. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated
by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Group assesses whether embedded derivatives are required to be separated from host contracts when the Group first becomes party to the
contract. Reassessment occurs only if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modify the cash flows that would otherwise
be required.
If the requirements for hedge accounting set out in IAS 39 are met, the Company designates and documents the hedge relationship from the date
a derivative contract is entered into, either as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.
The Company did not enter into fair value hedges in 2007 and 2006.
In a cash flow hedge, the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast
transaction, or a firm commitment (in case of currency risks) is hedged. To hedge a currency risk of an unrecognised firm commitment, the Company
makes use of the option to recognise this as a cash flow hedge rather than a fair value hedge. The documentation of the hedge relationship includes
identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the
hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are
expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows, and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually
have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 46 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
For cash flow hedges, fair value changes of the effective portion of the hedging instrument are recognised in other reserves, net of applicable taxes,
while any ineffective portion of the fair value changes are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income
statement when the hedged transaction affects the income statement, such as when the forecast or committed expenses occur. If the forecast transaction
or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the derivative instrument does not, or no longer, qualifies for hedge accounting because the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are not, or are no
longer, met the derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading. Amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts
previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or the firm commitment occurs.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date of whether the
fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
For arrangements entered into before 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2005 in accordance with the transitional
requirements of IFRIC 4.
Where the Group is lessee, finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item,
are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in profit and loss. As of 31 December 2007 and 2006 the Group had no finance lease
arrangements. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Where the Group is lessor and the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset to the lessee, the lease is
classified as an operating lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and
recognised over the leased term on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are
earned. As of 31 December 2007 and 2006 the Group had no lease arrangements as lessor.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty. The following specific
recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is derived from the sale of products, application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) and application specific standard
product (“ASSP”) to end customers. These products are manufactured and tested in accordance with customers’ technical specifications prior to
delivery. Revenue is recognised when title passes, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the fee is fixed or
determinable, and collection of the related receivable is probable. Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes and customer discounts, if any.
The Company has insurance for product claims and also records a provision for warranty costs as a charge in cost of sales, based on historical trends of
warranty costs incurred as a percentage of sales, which management has determined to be a reasonable estimate of the probable costs to be incurred
for warranty claims in a period. Customer returns are permitted only for quality-related reasons within the applicable warranty period and any potential
warranty claims are subject to the Company’s determination that it is at fault for damages. Such claims must usually be submitted within a short period
of the date of sale.
Research and development
Revenue from customer-specific research and development contracts involving the development of new customer-specific technology is recognised on
the percentage of completion basis when the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably. A contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably when
total contract revenue can equally be estimated, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the Company, and the
stage of contract completion can be measured reliably. When the Company is not able to meet those conditions, the policy is to recognise revenues only
to costs incurred to date, to the extent that such costs are expected to be recovered. Completion is measured by reference to costs incurred to date as
a percentage of estimated total project costs. The percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs,
as well as the dependable measurement of the progress made towards completing the particular project. Losses on projects in progress are recognised
in the period they become likely and can be estimated. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 47
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of the costs of outsourcing production, assembly and test, personnel costs and applicable overheads and depreciation of equipment.
Provisions for estimated product warranties are recorded in cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognised.
Sales and marketing expenses
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, travel expenses, sales commissions, bad debt expenses and costs associated with advertising
and other marketing activities.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs for finance, human resources, information systems and other
management departments which are not attributable to development, production or sales functions. In 2006, the impairment of accounts receivable
and inventories related to the insolvency of BenQ Mobile GmbH (“BenQ”) was also recorded in general and administrative expenses.
Research and development costs
Costs identified as research costs are expensed as incurred, whereas development costs are capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised if the
Company can demonstrate the following:
 the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
 its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
 its ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
 how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the Company can demonstrate the existence of
a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;
 the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and use or sell the intangible asset; and
 its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Interest income/expense
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues. Interest income includes interest income from investments in securities, cash and cash equivalents.
Income and expense resulting from the allocation of premiums and discounts is also included. Interest expense is expensed as incurred.
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses
The foreign currency exchange gains and losses mainly result from foreign currency cash transactions and period end revaluation of foreign currency
denominated cash into US dollars (2006: into euros). It is the Company’s view that these gains and losses are driven by the financing activities of the
Company and are therefore shown in the financial result.
Other financial income/expense
Other financial income/expense includes all remaining miscellaneous income and expense from financial transactions which are not included in interest
income/expense.
Employee benefits – defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution and state-funded pension plans are recognised in the income statement as expense as incurred.
Income taxes
Current income taxes for current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for using the liability method and are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective tax bases, as well as on the
carry-forward of unused tax losses that can be utilised. 48 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date expected to
apply to taxable income in the years, in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates
on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent, that it has become
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists, to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities
and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Share-based payments
The Company has established an equity-settled share option scheme under which employees and Directors may be granted stock options to acquire
shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as a compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant
date and spread over the service period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting
period has expired and the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a
period represents the movement in cumulative expense in the period.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which
the options were granted. Expectations of early exercise are accounted for within the average life of the options. The Company applies IFRS 2 to all
options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not been vested as of 1 January 2005.
Employee share trust
The Company has established an employee share trust. The share trust is separately administrated and is funded by the Company, which consolidates
the assets, liabilities, income and expenses in its own accounts. The shares held by the trust are recorded at cost and are shown under “Employee stock
purchase plan shares” in the statement of changes in Shareholders’ equity.
Loss per share
Loss per share has been computed using the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares for each year. Because the Company reported
a net loss in each of the two periods presented, only basic per share amounts have been presented for those periods. Had the Company reported net
income in 2007 and 2006, the weighted average number of shares outstanding would have been as follows:
2007 2006
Basic number of shares 44,938 44,549
Effect of dilutive options outstanding 2,015 1,512
Dilutive number of shares 46,953 46,061
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 49
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Subject to such estimates and judgements is the following:
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. In case of such an indicator,
an impairment test is made. This requires the determination of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell respectively of the assets. Estimating
the value in use requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the asset and also to choose a suitable discount rate
in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of such assets including assets held for sale at 31 December 2007 was
US$12,895,000 (2006: US$17,009,000). Further information regarding impairment charges is provided in notes 4 and 12.
Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets and investments
The Group classifies certain assets as available-for-sale and recognises movements in the fair value in equity. When the fair value declines, management
makes assumptions about the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses on investments amounting to US$2,662,000 have been charged to profit and loss in 2007 (2006: US$nil). The carrying amount of
these unquoted equity instruments at 31 December 2007 was US$nil (2006: US$1,620,000). Please see note 15.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses
can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the
likely timing of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies. At year end 2007 and 2006, no deferred tax assets were recognised.
The unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2007 were US$58,675,000 (2006: US$63,090,000). Further information regarding the
assessment of future taxable income is disclosed in note 6.
Share-based employee compensation awards
Share-based payment transactions are measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value of share-based
payments is determined using the Black-Scholes model, which involves making assumptions about interest rates, volatilities, market conditions and
fluctuation. Due to the nature of these assumptions, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In 2007, the expense related to stock
options was US$905,000 (2006: US$1,157,000).
Customer-specific research and development
For the determination of revenue and costs for customer specific research and development contracts, management judgement is required. It is,
therefore, necessary to determine the stage of completion based on the progress made towards completing the particular project, as well as the contract
revenue and the contract costs. At 31 December 2007 no receivables from constructions contracts were outstanding (2006: US$nil).
Self-developed intangible assets
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy mentioned above. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s
judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone
according to an established project management model. In determining the probable future economic benefits of the self-developed intangible asset,
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets, discount rates to be applied and the expected period
of benefits. At 31 December 2007, the best estimate of the carrying amount of capitalised development costs was US$597,000 (2006: US$nil).
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:
The Company has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures
In August 2005, the IASB issued IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” . IFRS 7 introduces new requirements to improve the information on financial
instruments that is given in entities’ financial statements, and changes or amends certain disclosure requirements. It replaces IAS 30 “Disclosures in
the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions” and some of the requirements in IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation” . IFRS 7 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. As a result of the first-time adoption of IFRS 7, additional
disclosure within the notes to the consolidated financial statements has been prepared. 50 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
In August 2005, the IASB issued a complementary amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures” . The amendment
to IAS 1 adds requirements for all entities to disclose the entity’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital and is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. As a result of the first-time adoption of this amendment to IAS 1, additional disclosure within the notes
to the consolidated financial statements has been prepared.
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach Under IAS 29
IFRIC 7 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006 and provides guidance on how to apply the requirements of IAS 29 in a
reporting period in which an entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the economy of its functional currency, when that economy was not
hyperinflationary in the prior period, and the entity therefore restates its financial statements in accordance with IAS 29. The interpretation had no
impact on the financial position or performance of the Company as none of its Group companies is located in an economy with hyperinflation.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2
This interpretation is effective for the annual period beginning on or after 1 May 2006, and requires IFRS 2 to be applied to any arrangements in which
the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods received, in particular where equity instruments are issued for consideration which
appears to be less than fair value. As equity instruments are issued only to employees in accordance with the employee share scheme, the interpretation
had no impact on the financial position or performance of the Company.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
IFRIC 9 is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 June 2006, and establishes that the date to assess the existence of an embedded derivative
is the date on which an entity first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change that significantly modifies the cash flow.
The adoption of this interpretation did not have any effect on the financial statements of the Company.
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment
IFRIC Interpretation 10 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006. The interpretation addresses the apparent conflict
between the requirements of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and those in other standards on the recognition and reversal in financial statements
of impairment losses on goodwill and certain financial assets. The adoption of this interpretation did not have any effect on the financial statements
of the Company.
Recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments
The amended IFRS 2 was issued in January 2008 and is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amendment deals with
two matters. It clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a share-based payment are
not vesting conditions. It also specifies that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment.
The amended standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Company does not expect material changes in its accounting due to this amended IFRS.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised) and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amended)
The revised IFRS 3 and the amended IAS 27 were issued in January 2008 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The changes made to the existing standards are comprehensive and mainly address the accounting for acquisition costs, contingent considerations,
goodwill and non-controlling interests, step acquisitions, partial disposal of an investment while a controlling interest is retained or control is lost,
and acquisition of additional shares after control is obtained. The revised and amended standards have not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IFRS 8 Operating Segments which replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting was issued in November 2006 and is effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2009. The IFRS requires an entity to adopt the “management approach” to reporting on the financial performance of its operating
segments. Generally, the information to be reported would be what management uses internally for evaluating segmental performance and deciding
how to allocate resources to operating segments. The Company does not expect that the operating segments would significantly differ from the
business segments identified under IAS 14 Segment Reporting. Additional disclosures about each of these segments are expected. The Company has
not yet, however, finally assessed the impact of the adoption of IFRS 8 on its segmental reporting. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 51
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Revised
The revised IAS 1 was issued in September 2007 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The changes made are to require
information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and to introduce a statement of comprehensive income.
The revised standard gives preparers of financial statements the option of presenting items of income and expense and components of other
comprehensive income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate statements. The Company has not
yet finally assessed the impact of the adoption of the revised IAS 1 on its financial statements presentation. The revised standard has not yet been
endorsed by the EU.
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs
The revised IAS 23 Borrowing Costs was issued in March 2007 and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The revised standard
removes the option of immediately recognising borrowing costs, that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or
sale, as an expense. Following this revised standard, the Company will change its currently adopted policy of immediately expensing borrowing costs.
The revised standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
In addition, the following interpretations have been issued:
Interpretation Title Effective date
IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements 1 January 2008
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 1 January 2008
Only IFRIC 11 has, so far, been endorsed by the EU.
The above-listed interpretations did not, and will not, have an effect on the financial statements as they do not currently apply to the Company.
We do not intend to make early application and interpretation of the above, not yet effective standards.
Reclassification
In order to fulfil the requirements of IFRS 7, particularly the separation of financial instruments into classes, some financial assets and liabilities have
been reclassified. Prior year numbers have been adjusted accordingly.
3. Discontinued operations
On 14 February 2006 the Company concluded the disposal of its Imaging Division. The business of this division included the development, design,
manufacture, assembly, marketing and delivering of image sensor semiconductors and camera modules. Dialog transferred the assets of the Division to
a newly-created entity, Dialog Imaging Systems GmbH (“DIS”), subsequently renamed Digital Imaging Systems GmbH. For further information regarding
DIS, please see note 15.
The losses from discontinued operations of US$2,267,000 in 2006 solely comprise of operating losses incurred before control was legally transferred on
14 February 2006 and include transaction and legal costs. In the statements of cash flows, the relating cash flow of US$2,267,000 is classified as cash
used for operations. In February 2007 DIS officially changed its company name to Digital Imaging Systems. 52 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007

4. Restructuring and related impairment charges
In the third quarter of 2006 the Company decided to transfer its “Wafer Test”, “Final Test” and “Tape & Reel” operations from Kirchheim/Teck,
Germany to dedicated outsourced assembly and test organisations in Asia. This transfer was completed in the second quarter of 2007 and, as a result,
in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company announced a further reduction of its workforce in Germany.
The 2006 restructuring and related impairment charges in connection with the transfer of the test operation mainly comprise employee termination
costs (US$1,568,000) and impairment charges (US$4,105,000). The 2007 restructuring charges mainly comprise further employee termination costs
(net of US$421,000), impairment charges and other losses (US$687,000) in relation to obsolete assets resulting from the transfer and gains from the
sale of excess assets (US$355,000).
By 31 December 2007, any assets previously classified as “held for sale” were either sold, disposed of or returned to production when new information
was received that these assets could be used. Therefore, at 31 December 2007, non-current assets classified as “held for sale” amount to zero.
When assets were returned to production, the Company ceased to classify the asset as “held for sale”. Assets were valued at the lower of:
a) their carrying amount before the asset (or disposal group) was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation or revaluations
that would have been recognised had the asset (or disposal group) not been classified as held for sale; and
b) their recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.
The following table shows the composition of the restructuring reserve, restructuring expenses and gains and related cash flows.

The deferred tax expenses in 2007 and 2006 relate to items that are charged or credited to equity.
Although Dialog is a UK company, its principal operations are located in Germany and its operating subsidiaries are all owned by its German subsidiary.
Accordingly, the following information is based on German corporate tax law. The Company’s statutory tax rate for its German subsidiary is 25%.
When including the impact of the solidarity surcharge of 5.5%, the federal corporate tax rate amounts to 26.375%. A reconciliation of income taxes
determined using the German corporate tax rate of 26.375% plus the after federal tax benefit rate for trade taxes of 11.225%, for a combined
statutory rate of 37.6%, is as follows:

Actual income (expense) for income taxes (136) 158
On 14 August 2007 in Germany the Company tax reform 2008 (Unternehmensteuerreform 2008) was enacted. Among other things, this new
legislation reduces the Company’s statutory tax rate for its German subsidiary from 25% to 15%, effective 1 January 2008. When including the impact
of the solidarity surcharge of 5.5%, the federal corporate tax rate amounts to 15.825%. Including the federal tax benefit rate for trade taxes of
9.387%, the combined statutory tax rate of the Company will be 25.212%. In the UK, the statutory tax rate was reduced from 30% to 28%. The
Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities have to be reduced to reflect the impact of the decreased tax rates. The effect on the net deferred
tax asset carried forward from 2006 is US$14,116,000. 56 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007

In assessing whether the deferred tax assets can be used, management considers the likelihood that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be
realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods, in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
benefits that could be realised from available tax planning strategies and other positive and negative factors in making this assessment. Considering
the weight given to cumulative losses incurred in Germany over the seven-year period ended 31 December 2007, as well as the inherent uncertainties
in projecting future taxable income, pursuant to IAS 12, management concluded that tax losses may not ultimately be realised. Consequently, the
Company did not recognise deferred tax assets of US$58,675,000 as of 31 December 2007 (US$63,090,000 as of 31 December 2006).
The tax loss carry-forwards in the US will expire between 2008 and 2021; other tax loss carry-forwards have no expiration date.
Included in unrecognised deferred tax assets is an amount of US$1,443,000 (2006: US$1,514,000) (the increase results from foreign currency
adjustments) in relation to tax credits in the UK. This asset may be recovered against future taxable profits derived from certain overseas dividends
for the company concerned. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 57
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
6. Income taxes continued
The amount shown under “assets for current tax” in the balance sheet includes a corporation tax refund claim of the Company’s German subsidiary.
The total amount the Company is entitled to receive amounts to US$610,000 to be paid out in ten equal amounts during 2008 to 2017. The amount
shown under “assets for current tax” represents the discounted part of the claim that is due after 2008. The amount that will be paid in 2008 is shown
under “other current assets”.
7. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank (2007: US$15,187,000; 2006: US$15,507,000) and short-term deposits (2007: US$736,000;
2006: US$16,525,000). Short-term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash
requirements of the Company. Cash and cash equivalents earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates. The fair value of the cash and cash
equivalents approximates its book value. As prescribed in note 25, in 2007 the Company entered into a selective factoring agreement. Included in
cash at bank is an amount of U$8,913,000 (2006: nil) held at the factoring bank which represents the cash value of selected receivables sold to the
factoring bank. This amount is non-interest bearing until the related receivables have been entirely settled. The factoring bank charges interest on
amounts drawn from the account.
8. Available-for-sale financial assets
The Company has invested in highly liquid “investment grade” rated debt, equity and currency-based funds, classified as available for sale. The principal
of these securities is guaranteed to be 100% of the acquisition costs at maturity. The aggregate costs, fair values and unrealised gains (losses) per
security class are shown in the table below.

In 2007, net realised losses of US$333,000 from the sale of available-for-sale securities that had been previously recognised directly in equity were
recycled into profit and loss.
Reclassifications
The Company reclassified available-for-sale financial assets amounting to US$4 million into held-to-maturity financial assets. The reclassification was
made as a result of a change in the Company’s intention which is now to hold those securities to maturity.
Contracted maturities of financial instruments
The majority of the above available-for-sale financial instruments is contracted to mature within one year or less and/or incorporate a floating interest
rate that is reset as market rates change. One security with a carrying amount of US$2,776,000, contracted to mature in June 2010, was sold in
February 2008.
Pledging
In connection with the agreement as prescribed in note 25, the Company has pledged US$6.5 million worth of its securities to the factoring bank.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-60-day terms.
As described in note 25, in 2007 the Company entered into a selective factoring agreement. The amount shown as receivables from the factoring
agreement represents a 15% retainer kept by the factoring bank against sold receivables. The retainer is released only once the receivable is fully paid
by the customer, at the latest, 120 days after the receivable becomes due or if the insurance event occurs. The amounts are non-interest bearing and
are generally on 30-60-day terms.
The recorded trade accounts receivable for which an impairment has been recognised, was US$1,624,000 and US$2,814,000 at 31 December 2007
and 2006, respectively. The related allowance for doubtful accounts was US$1,624,000 and US$2,556,000 at 31 December 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The decrease of the allowance for doubtful accounts mainly results from a recovery of accounts receivable of US$903,000 related to
BenQ Mobile GmbH, which were written off in 2006.
The allowance for doubtful accounts developed as follows:
2007 2006
US$000 US$000

their payment obligations.
Receivables from construction contracts
As at 31 December 2007 and 2006, all incurred external costs for customer related research and development projects had been charged to the
customers in accordance with agreed milestones. Consequently, as at 31 December 2007 and 2006, the Company had no receivables from
construction contracts. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 59

Embedded derivatives represent the book value of the Company’s investment in a currency index-linked derivative instrument which has been separated
from its host contract. For further details regarding the risk associated to this investment please see note 25.
The hedging instruments include the fair value of derivative financial instruments used for cash flow hedges. The Company is exposed to currency risks
in the course of its operating activities. These risks are reduced by the use of forward currency exchange contracts.
The Company has clear guidelines as to the use of those derivatives, and compliance is constantly monitored. For further information on the Company’s
hedging policy please see note 25. 60 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2007
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
14. Held-to-maturity securities
In the third quarter 2007, financial instruments at an amount of US$4.0 million previously classified as available for sale had been reclassified to
held-to-maturity. The reclassification was made as a result of a change in the Company’s intention which is now to hold those securities to maturity.
The investments in held-to-maturity securities comprise securities which mature on 12 August 2010. The securities are interest bearing with a variable
interest rate, not less that 0.7%. Repayment on maturity will amount to 100% of the nominal value.
15. Investments
Investments comprise the Company’s 9.5% interest in DIS, which is classified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
DIS is a private entity that is not listed on a public stock exchange. As the fair value cannot be reliably determined the investment in DIS is therefore
accounted for at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment charges.
As prescribed in note 3, in connection with the Company‘s disposition of its imaging division, the Company created a new entity (“DIS”). A total
of US$29,320,000 was invested in DIS by private equity investors, the management team of DIS, and the Company. Of this the Company invested
US$2,662,000 which was paid in two tranches of US$1,620,000 and US$1,042,000 in 2006 and 2007 respectively.
In the third quarter of 2007, based on current business and cash flow projections, the Company recognised an impairment of US$2,662,000 for the
investment in DIS. This impairment is disclosed separately in the income statement under impairment of investments.
The impairment test requires management to make estimates about the expected future cash flows of the unquoted equity instruments which are
discounted at adequate interest rates. Management has determined that the potential effect of using reasonably possible alternatives as inputs to the
valuation model would not result in materially different amounts.
For further information regarding the Company’s investment in DIS please see note 3.

17. Provisions
The Company issues various types of contractual product warranties under which it guarantees the performance of products delivered for a certain
period or term. The estimated provision is based on historical warranty data. Regarding the provision for restructuring please see note 4. The Company

19. Shareholders’ equity and other reserves
Ordinary shares
At 31 December 2007 and 2006, Dialog had authorised 104,311,860 Ordinary shares with a par value of £0.10 per share, of which 46,068,930 shares
were issued and outstanding. The Company’s stock is all issued in the form of bearer shares, and all shares are fully paid.
On 24 September 2004, the Company completed an offering of 2,000,000 previously unissued Ordinary shares at £0.10 per share to its employee
share option trust (“Trust”), to make such shares available for the exercise of stock option rights that had previously been granted to employees.
At 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 the Trust continued to hold 1,046,387 and 1,178,957 shares respectively. These shares are legally issued
and outstanding, but are not considered issued and outstanding for accounting purposes and accordingly have been reported under “employee stock
purchase plan shares” as a reduction of Shareholders’ equity.
Share premium
The account comprises additional paid-in capital in connection with the issue of shares.
Accumulated deficit
The accumulated deficit comprises losses and non-distributed earnings of consolidated Group companies. Because of the accumulated deficit,
the Company cannot pay a dividend and does not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
Nature and purpose of other reserves
Currency translation reserve
The currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not the US$ .
Derivative financial instruments reserve
The reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective cash flow hedge.
Available-for-sale securities reserve
This reserve records fair value changes on available-for-sale investments.
Accumulated other comprehensive income
The related tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2006 are
as follows:

20. Pension scheme
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The pension cost charge for the year represents contributions payable by the Group to the
funds and amounted to US$958,000 (2006: US$805,000). At 31 December 2007, contributions amounting to US$80,000 (2006: US$152,000) were
payable to the funds and are included in creditors.
21. Share-based payments
a) Stock option plan
On 7 August 1998, the Company adopted a stock option plan (the “Plan”) under which employees and Executive Directors may be granted from time
to time, at the discretion of the Board, stock options to acquire up to 3,840,990 shares of the Company’s authorised but unissued Ordinary shares.
On 16 May 2002 the Shareholders of the Company approved a resolution increasing the maximum amount of stock options which may be granted by
the Company at any time, to 15% of the Company’s issued share capital on a diluted basis. At 31 December 2007, 8,129,811 shares could be issued.
Except in relation to the Chief Executive Officer, stock options granted to employees are granted with an exercise price not less than the quoted
price at the date of grant, and vest during the service period of the employee without any further vesting conditions. Stock options granted before
31 October 2006 have terms of ten years and vest over periods of one to five years from the grant date. On 19 June 2006 the Company adopted a
revised stock option plan under which stock options now have a seven-year life and vest monthly over a period of one to 48 months. The new stock
options may not be exercised until they have been held for one calendar year from the grant date. The new rules were implemented on grants made
on or after 31 October 2006.
The fair value of all grants in the two-year period ended 31 December 2007 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expectations
of early exercise are considered in the determination of the expected life of the options. The Company does not have adequate historical development
of the share price, particularly as a result of material unusual effects in the stock market in recent years. Furthermore, implicit volatility cannot be
determined since none of the Company’s options are actively traded. The Company has therefore based its calculation of expected volatility on an
average of its own volatility and the historical development of other companies in its business segment.
The following assumptions were used for stock option grants for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2006:
2007 2006
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
Expected volatility 33% – 54% 21% – 49%
Risk-free interest rate 4.0% 4.1%
Expected life (in years) 2.0 – 6.0 2.0 – 6.0
Weighted average share price (US$) 3.58 1.85
Weighted average exercise price (in US$) 2.22 1.67

b) ESOP Trust
The Company established an employee share option trust (the “Trust”). The Trust purchases shares in the Company for the benefit of employees under
the Company’s share option scheme. At 31 December 2007 the Trust held 1,046,387 shares.
c) Non-executive Directors’ stock option plan
At the 2006 Annual General Meeting, Shareholders approved a stock option plan for Non-executive Directors. Each Non-executive Director is entitled to
an initial grant of 50,000 options vesting over four years and each year thereafter. As soon as possible after each Annual Shareholder Meeting a further
20,000 options vesting over 12 months are granted. Options are exercisable at the market price prevailing at the date of grant. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 67

The fair values of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets are determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at
the close of business on the balance sheet date. Market values have therefore, been used to determine the fair value of listed available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity financial assets. The fair value of derivatives has been determined with reference to available market information. For the valuation
of unlisted equity instruments see note 15. The carrying amounts of the loans and receivables and financial liabilities approximate their fair values due
to short-term maturities. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 69

25. Financial risk management objectives and policies
Vulnerability due to certain significant risk concentrations
The Company’s future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company’s future operating results
and cause actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not limited to, the highly cyclical nature of both the semiconductor and
wireless communications industries, dependence on certain customers and the ability to obtain adequate supply of sub-micron wafers.
The Company's products are generally utilised in the cellular communications and automotive industries. The Company generates a substantial portion
of its revenue from the wireless communications market, which accounted for 59% and 62% of its total revenue for the years ended 31 December
2007 and 2006, respectively.
The Company’s revenue base is diversified by geographic region and by individual customer. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates influence the
Company’s results of operations. The Company’s sales, purchases of raw materials and manufacturing services are primarily denominated in US$.
The Company also has foreign currency exchange risks with respect to its net investments in foreign subsidiaries in Japan, Taiwan and the United
Kingdom. Fluctuations in these currencies could have a significant impact on the Company’s reported results from operations.
The Company depends on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues, and the loss of one or more of these
customers may result in a significant decline in future revenue. During 2007 four customers individually accounted for more than 10% of the
Company's revenues. Total revenues from these four customers were US$65,620,000 or 76%. Net receivables from these four customers were
US$562,000 at 31 December 2007. During 2006 four customers individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues. Total revenues
from these four customers were US$64,004,000 or 68%. Net receivables from these four customers were US$2,829,000 at 31 December 2006. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition.
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits and securities. The main
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operations. The Company has other financial instruments which mainly
comprise trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
During the year 2007 the Company also entered into derivative transactions (forward currency contracts). The purpose is to manage the currency risks
arising from the Company’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout 2007 and 2006, the Company’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
Exposure to currency, interest rate and credit risk arises in the normal course of the Company’s business. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below:
Interest risk
The Company earns interest from bank deposits and uses money market deposits with highly rated financial institutions. Furthermore the Company
invests in non-current interest bearing held-to-maturity investments. During the year, the Company has held cash on deposit with a range of maturities
from one week to one month. This can vary in view of changes in the underlying currency’s interest rates and the Company’s cash requirements.
The Company has invested in liquid “investment grade” rated debt-based funds classified as available for sale. These funds are highly liquid and are
contracted to mature within three years or less and/or incorporate a floating interest rate that is reset as market rates change.
The Company has invested in liquid “investment grade” rated debt-based funds classified as held-to-maturity. These funds are contracted to mature
in 2010 and incorporate a floating interest rate that is reset as market rates change.
The Company has no long-term debt and no amounts outstanding under short-term credit facilities as at 31 December 2007 (2006: US$nil).
The Company’s policy is to manage its interest income using a mix of fixed and variable interest rate debts. In order to achieve this policy, the Company
invests in highly liquid funds having a matching investment strategy. Once the operating business has been financed, short-term excess funds are
invested in floating interest rate securities. Only short-term deposits bear fixed interest rates. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 73

Currency risk
The main functional currency within the Group and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements is the US$. For the change in
the functional currency resulting from the transfer from some production activities to subcontractors please see note 1. Accordingly, foreign exchange
risks arise from transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities, the functional currency of which is not the US$ . The currencies giving rise to these
exposure risks are primarily the euro and pound sterling. The majority of the Company’s revenue and material expenses are denominated in US$ .
The majority of other operating expenses are denominated in euros and pounds sterling. The Company has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposure arises from the sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. In 2007 nearly all the
Company’s sales were denominated in US$. The Company uses forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposure of recurring expected
payments, such as salaries, wages and office rents non-US$ denominated. The forward currency contracts must be the same currency as the hedged
item. It is the Company’s policy not to enter into forward contracts until a firm commitment is in place.
It is the Company’s policy to maximise hedge effectiveness by negotiating the terms of hedge derivatives to match the terms of the hedged item.
The Company did not use foreign exchange instruments in prior years to hedge its currency risk. In prior years the Company ensured that the net
exposure was kept to an acceptable level by selling or buying foreign currencies (primarily US$ and pounds sterling) spot when required.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant,
of the Company’s profit before tax (resulting from changes in the fair value of monetary assets, excluding securities, and liabilities) and the Company’s
equity (resulting from changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts).

Other price risks
IFRS 7 also requires disclosures on how hypothetical changes in risk variables affect the price of financial instruments. Important risk variables are stock
exchange prices.
As part of its cash management the Company invests in available-for-sale securities. Price fluctuations would have an impact on the equity of the
Company. The following table summarises the impact of hypothetical changes of the market price of the respective securities based on the inherent
historic volatility of the specific securities:

Not included in this risk analysis is an investment made in 2007 into a structured US dollar note linked to a Currency Harvest Index. This investment
which includes an embedded derivative was sold in February 2008. The carrying amount of the investment at 31 December 2007 (including the host
contract, the embedded derivative and accrued interest) amounted to US$3,023,000. The net cash proceeds from the sale were US$3,047,000.
For further information regarding this investment please see below, “Embedded derivatives”.
All securities held at 31 December 2006, which were subject to the 2006 analysis above, were sold in 2007.
Credit risk
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and certain financing activities. The Company trades only with recognised,
creditworthy third parties. It is the Company’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis, with the result that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 9. Regarding the risk concentration please see above,“vulnerability due to certain
significant considerations”.
In order to finance its growth, in August 2007 the Company entered into a factoring agreement with a reputable German financial institution.
The maximum amount of cash that can be received under this agreement is €10 million (or US$ equivalent). The agreement, which comprises
receivables from selective customers, significantly reduces the underlying credit risk because the financial institution assumes all credit risks associated
with the collection of the receivables financed under the programme.
As part of the factoring agreements, the Company has pledged US$6.5 million of securities to the financial institution. The institution would draw
down on these only if a commercial action by Dialog were to invalidate – partly or completely – the claim on a receivable financed through the factoring
programme. The pledge can be released after 1 October 2008, providing the Company returns to profitability.
The Company’s exposure to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale
and held-to-maturity financial investments would arise from default by a counterparty. The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying amount of
the instruments. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 75
Section 4 | Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes
25. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Liquidity risk
The Company uses quarterly cash flow forecasts to monitor its liquidity risk. It takes financial investments and financial assets (e.g. trade accounts
receivables and other financial assets) into consideration, as well as projected cash flows from operations. The Company’s objective is to minimise
interest expense by avoiding the use of short-term bank liabilities or bank overdrafts within the Group.
At 31 December 2007, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of US$15,923,000 (2006: US$32,032,000) and marketable securities of
US$15,921,000 (2006: US$19,351,000). Furthermore as of 31 December 2007, the Company held held-to-maturity investments, disclosed as
non-current, in the amount of US$4,000,000 (2006: US$nil). Even though these investments are non-current, they are liquid.
The Company’s policy is to structure its maturities of current financial assets within the Group to meet 100% of the respective maturities of the
liabilities. As of 31 December 2007, and 31 December 2006, all liabilities are current and due within one year.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2007, based on contractual undiscounted payments:

At 31 December 2007, the Company had unused short-term credit lines of US$9,418,000. There were no amounts outstanding under these credit lines
at 31 December 2007.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and
strategies for growth.
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust its
capital structure, the Company may generally issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ending
31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006.
The Company monitors capital using an equity ratio (total equity divided by total assets). The equity ratio as of 31 December 2007 was 75.4%
(2006: 84.9%). Capital includes net Shareholders’ equity. The Company’s policy is to finance business development and growth with equity rather than
long-term liabilities. It is, therefore, also its policy to keep a strong equity ratio. This policy will be reconsidered as soon as sustainable profits are earned
in order to achieve leverage. 76 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007

Hedging activities
At 31 December 2007, the Company held several forward exchange contracts designated as hedges of firm commitments and forecast transactions
in euros and pounds sterling. The forward exchange contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of contractual cash flows, principally
resulting from wages and salaries, and rental payments with the aim of eliminating the currency risk by transforming these cash flows from euros or
pounds sterling into US dollars. The fair values which equal the book values are as follows:

Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities
US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000
Forward exchange contracts
Fair values 336 – ––
The critical terms of the forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the hedged cash flows.
The cash flow hedges of the expected future cash flows in each month from January 2008 to May 2008 were assessed to be highly effective and,
at 31 December 2007, a net unrealised gain of US$89,000 was included in equity in respect of these cash flows. During the financial year 2007
an amount of US$313,0000 (2006: US$nil) was recognised in equity and an amount of US$224,000 (2006: US$nil) was removed from equity and
recognised in profit and loss. The months of occurrence of the cash flows are the same as the month when the income statement is affected.
The following tables show the contractual maturities of the payments, i.e., when the hedged item will be recognised in profit or loss:

Embedded derivatives
In 2007, the Group acquired a structured US$ note linked to a Currency Harvest Index. This 100% capital repayment-guaranteed structured note
was issued by Deutsche Bank AG. This note was separated into an available-for-sale financial instrument with a fair value of US$2,711,000 and
an embedded derivative with a fair value of US$247,000 at 31 December 2007, which is recognised under other financial assets. In February 2008
the Company decided to sell this structured US$ note. The net cash proceeds from this transaction were US$3,047,000. Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report 2007 77

Cash flow The primary purpose of a statement of cash ﬂow is to provide
relevant information about the cash receipts and cash payments of an
enterprise during a period. It helps to assess the enterprise’s ability to
generate positive future net cash ﬂows. A statement of cash ﬂows shall
explain the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period by
classifying cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem
from operating, investing, or ﬁnancing activities.
Cash flow from operating activities includes all transactions and
other events that are not deﬁned as investing or ﬁnancing activities
in paragraphs. Operating activities generally involve producing and
delivering goods and providing services. Cash ﬂows from operating
activities are generally the cash effects of transactions and other events
that enter into the determination of net income.
Comprehensive Income The purpose of reporting comprehensive
income is to report a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise
that result from recognised transactions and other economic events of
the period other than transactions with owners such as capital increases
or dividends. An example of items effecting comprehensive income is
foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the process of
translating an entity's ﬁnancial statements in a foreign currency into the
reporting currency.
Corporate governance is the system by which business corporations are
directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure speciﬁes the
distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in
the corporation, such as the Board, managers, shareholders and other
stakeholders, and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions
on corporate affairs. By doing this, it also provides the structure through
which the company’s objectives are set, and the means of attaining those
objectives and monitoring performance.
Deferred taxes Deferred tax assets or liabilities are temporary differences
between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in
the ﬁnancial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts
in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is
recovered or settled, respectively.
Derivative financial instruments A ﬁnancial instrument that derives
its value from the price or expected price of an underlying asset
(e.g. a security, currency or bond).
Dividends are payments made by a company to its Shareholders.
When a company earns a proﬁt, that money can be put to two uses:
it can either be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings),
or it can be paid to the shareholders of the company as a dividend.
EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) is the rate at which euro

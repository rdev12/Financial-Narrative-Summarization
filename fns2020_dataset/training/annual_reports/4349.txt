Dairy Crest has delivered a solid
performance in the year ended March
2005 despite the competitive retail
environment with reported adjusted profit
before taxation of £84.2 million on
turnover of £1.35 billion and adjusted
earnings per share of 49.3 pence. 
The Group’s strategy continues to be
to focus on the development of profitable
branded and added value dairy products
and to invest in low cost operations to
maintain competitive advantage. Our
Foods business has made good
progress benefiting from an encouraging
performance across our portfolio of
brands. The year has seen
unprecedented changes to the supply 
of fresh milk to the major UK food
retailers resulting in a significant impact
on the future profitability of our Dairies
business. We have taken actions to
strengthen the strategic position of our
Dairies business which leave us well
placed to improve its future performance
albeit from a lower base.
The UK dairy industry must continue
to take account of the potential impact of
the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
reforms that are currently being
implemented. We are active through
Dairy UK and other industry bodies in
promoting the long-term future of the UK
dairy industry. We have also
strengthened our working relationship
with Dairy Crest Direct, our direct milk
supply association, which supplies over
two thirds of our milk volumes, as we
believe that this is beneficial both to the
Group and our milk producers in
planning for the future. 
The Board is recommending an
increase in the final dividend of 7% to
14.3 pence per share. This together with
the interim dividend of 5.9 pence makes
a total dividend for the year of 
20.2 pence per share, an increase of
7%. The Board remains committed to a
progressive dividend policy. 
Board changes
As already announced, Paul Lewis will
retire as a non-executive director at the
Annual General Meeting in July after
almost 9 years service, having previously
served for 3 years as a non-executive
director of Dairy Crest Limited. I should
like to thank Paul for his valuable counsel
during his years on the Board,
particularly since the Group’s flotation in
1996. I am pleased to welcome David
Richardson, previously Finance Director
of Whitbread PLC, who joined the Dairy
Crest Board as a non-executive director
in December 2004. I am sure that the
Board will benefit from his extensive
experience in finance and in consumer
facing industries.

Overview
Dairy Crest has traded well in the year
and continues to be strongly cash
generative. We have increased
investment in our branded and added
value businesses, which have again
made encouraging progress. It has been
a particularly challenging year in fresh
milk with unprecedented changes in
supply arrangements by major food
retailers. Whilst these changes will
adversely impact the Group in 2005/06
we have taken actions to strengthen the
Dairies business for the future. 
Financial results
Group turnover (including our share of
joint ventures’ turnover) was £1.35 billion
(2004 – £1.36 billion). Group operating
profit, before operating exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation, decreased to
£100.6 million (2004 – £104.8 million)
after absorbing increased pension costs
of approximately £4.3 million. Adjusted
profit before tax was down slightly at
£84.2 million (2004 – £85.1 million). After
taking account of £13.1 million of goodwill
amortisation and £4.4 million (2004 –
£27.3 million) of net exceptional charges,
profit before tax was up 46% at £66.7
million (2004 – £45.6 million). Adjusted
earnings per share decreased to 49.3
pence per share (2004 – 50.0 pence).
Group net debt as at 31 March 
2005 was £52.2 million lower at 
£227.5 million (2004 – £279.7 million)
reflecting the Group’s strong operational
cash generation.
Investing in brand development
We continue to focus on innovation with
a number of new product development
initiatives being launched. The key area
of recent activity has been our entry into
the growing market for ‘functional’
products within the dairy category. We
have just launched ‘St. Ivel advance’, a
branded fresh milk enriched with
Omega-3. A number of studies have
shown that Omega-3 may have learning
and concentration benefits for some
children as well as being good for the
heart. This functional product gives us a
position in the growing branded fresh
milk market and is expected to appeal,
in particular, to parents with young
children. Elsewhere we have continued
to extend the range of Cathedral City
with new formats focused on
convenience such as Cathedral City
Grated. We have also extended our
‘Health’ offering in spreads with the
launch of Gold Lowest, the lowest fat
branded spread in the UK market.
Yoplait Dairy Crest has also launched  a
yogurt under the Petits Filous brand
aimed at extending the brand’s usage by
older children. 
The Group puts strong emphasis on
a continuous programme of cost
reduction which not only ensures that we
remain competitive in the market place,
but also supports increasing levels of
marketing spend. Over the last three
years this marketing investment has
strengthened the position of our key
brands. Increasingly, marketing spend

in our branded and added value

“Our results have been achieved
through the skills and efforts 
of all our people, in whom we 
will continue to invest”
has moved from promotional activity to
media investment with our brands
Clover, Utterly Butterly, St Ivel Gold and
Cathedral City as well as the Yoplait
brands all being advertised on television
during the year. Cathedral City, our
market leading branded cheddar, has
had a particularly strong year with value
growth well over 20%. The brand is now
worth approximately £90 million at retail
value. The acquisition of 100%
ownership of the Country Life brand
during the year represents a significant
opportunity for us to accelerate the
development of this brand, particularly in
the fast growing spreadable butter
category. We will be supporting Country
Life with a significant television
advertising campaign in late summer. 
Retail milk strategic developments
In a challenging market we have taken
action to strengthen the Dairies
business. In May 2005 we announced
the acquisitions of both Midlands Co-op
Dairies and Starcross Foods Limited.
Midlands Co-op Dairies is the largest
regional dairy operator in the UK. It
processes approximately 200 million
litres of milk per annum at its dairy in
Birmingham and distributes milk, via 16
distribution centres to a range of retail,
wholesale and doorstep customers
across the Midlands. Starcross is a
modern dairy in Foston, Derbyshire,
opened in May 2002 with current
capacity to process up to 100 million
litres of milk per annum. Starcross will
significantly extend our existing
geographical footprint across England
and Wales to cover most of the major
northern conurbations. These two
acquisitions will strengthen our
competitive position, improve the
profitability of the Dairies business and
better align our operations to our major
customers’ requirements.
The last 12 months have seen an
unprecedented period of change in fresh
milk supply arrangements by major food
retailers. By October 2005 Dairy Crest will
be supplying approximately 50% of fresh
milk volumes to both Sainsbury’s and
Morrisons. In addition, we have retained
our sole supply positions with Waitrose
and Marks & Spencer. However, as
previously announced, we have lost our
fresh milk supply positions to both Tesco
and ASDA. Overall, taking into account
these changes and the volume gained
through the Midlands Co-op Dairies
acquisition, we expect to increase fresh
milk volumes in our Dairies business.
New organisational structure
A new organisational structure was put
in place from 1 November 2004. The
previous five business units were
consolidated into two operating
divisions: Foods, comprising spreads
and cheese, headed by Peter Thornton,
who also retains responsibility for Yoplait
Dairy Crest, and Dairies, comprising
liquid products, household and
ingredients and headed by Mark Allen.
The restructuring streamlined the roles
and responsibilities of the senior
management team, reduced duplication
between the business units and our
overhead costs. This cost saving has
helped to offset the higher energy and
packaging costs that have been
experienced across the industry. 
People
Our people have responded particularly
well to the challenges of the last 12
months. Our results have been achieved
through the skills and efforts of all our
people, in whom we continue to invest.
During the year we have significantly
increased our investment in sales and
marketing training in particular. We
continue to make progress in improving
our communication and engagement
with our workforce. 
Outlook
We have continued to invest in the 
long-term development of our brands
and we have made sound strategic
moves to strengthen our Dairies
business for the future. Trading at the
start of the new financial year is in line
with our expectations.

Spreads 
The spreads business, the Group’s
biggest profit centre, has continued to
make good progress with increased
profitability during the year. The butter
and spreads market grew by 3% in value
to approximately £845 million but
declined by 1% in volume. The growth in
value reflects the impact of price
increases achieved across the market
last summer and the general trend
towards higher value products such as
spreadable butter. As expected volumes
were impacted by the retailer moves
towards ‘Every Day Low Pricing’ which
has reduced the opportunity for
promotional activity. 
Against this market background, our
spreads business has made progress
due to a successful portfolio approach
towards managing the brands and the
increased marketing expenditure
primarily directed at additional
investment in media. Our market-leading
dairy spreads brands Clover and Utterly
Butterly were supported by television
advertising campaigns. Whilst the dairy
spreads category showed slight decline
in both volume and value both Clover
and Utterly Butterly delivered sales value
growth of 2% and 1% respectively
despite a small decline in volumes. 
In September 2004 we acquired
100% ownership of the Country Life
brand through the acquisition of the 44%
minority interests in the English Butter
Marketing Company for a consideration
of £4.6 million. Country Life packet
butter and spreadable have performed
strongly achieving sales value growth of
26% and 27% respectively. Whilst
Country Life has a strong and growing
market share in packet butter, it is
relatively small in spreadable. This is a
real opportunity for growth with the
spreadable butter segment up by 10% in
value in the year. We will be supporting
the Country Life brand this summer with
a major new marketing campaign.
Our health spread St. Ivel Gold has
continued to make progress following its
relaunch in the autumn of 2003 and we
are seeing continued good underlying
‘off promotion’ growth. In January we
launched Gold Lowest, the lowest fat
branded spread on the market and so
far performance has been encouraging.
Operational review This operational review reflects the reporting divisions of Consumer Foods and Food Services
in line with the segmental reporting analysis of these results
Consumer Foods The Consumer Foods division comprises the spreads, cheese and liquid
products businesses, including our share of the Yoplait Dairy Crest joint venture. Turnover
increased to £887.3 million (2004 – £880.3 million). Operating profit, before operating
exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, was flat at £72.0 million (2004 - £72.2 million)
with operating margin down from 8.2% to 8.1% reflecting the competitive environment and
cost inflation in retail milk.

As mums know, unlike any other dairy spread, Clover is traditionally
churned using fresh buttermilk, which is why the families who buy Clover
tell us that it’s the best tasting dairy spread on the fridge shelves. Clover is
the UK’s favourite dairy spread and enjoyed in over 5 million homes
throughout the country.

Operational review – Consumer foods
Cheese
The UK cheese market grew by 1% in
volume and 4% in value during the year
and is now worth over £1.8 billion. The
mature and extra mature cheddar
segment was the strongest performing of
the market, growing by 5% in both
volume and value. Having risen in the
second half of 2003/04 market prices
remained stable throughout the year
reflecting the lower levels of industry
cheese stocks. Up to the end of March
2005, on a seasonally adjusted basis,
we saw 29 successive months of decline
in industry stocks. Dairy Crest
significantly reduced its own cheese
stocks during the year by approximately
11% or £18 million.
Cathedral City had another year of
strong growth, with both volume and
value up by over 20%, reinforcing its
position as the UK’s leading branded
cheddar. The brand is now worth
approximately £90 million at retail prices.
We have again increased the level of
marketing and promotional support
behind the brand with new television
advertising. In addition we have
extended the range with the launches of
Cathedral City in grated form, a second
version of Dip & Go! and a new ‘Lunch
Pack’ format.
The Davidstow sub-brand also
performed well with sales value growth
of 8%. The new creamery at Davidstow
was successfully commissioned last
summer. The cheddar now being
manufactured at Davidstow has met all
of our high quality and taste criteria. The
investment has increased capacity from
33,000 tonnes to 55,000 tonnes per
annum and this will support future
growth of Cathedral City.
The retailer own brand cheese
market remained extremely competitive.
However, we were pleased to win a
major agreement to supply ASDA with all
of its own label cheddar and other British
cheeses. These arrangements
commence in June 2005 and cover an
annual volume of around 30,000 tonnes
which will be made for ASDA at our
creamery in Aspatria. The new
arrangements will underpin the long-term
future of this creamery and of our
supplying dairy farmers in Cumbria.
We were also pleased recently to win
a significant new agreement to supply
the majority of own label cheddar to
Morrisons which will increase our
annualised volume by approximately
8,000 tonnes. This volume will be
supplied principally from the
Haverfordwest creamery.
As a result of these business wins we
will increase our cheese stocks.
We are continuing to discuss cost
related cheese price increases with our
customers. However we remain cautious
over market prices in the medium-term
in the context of the continued reduction
in intervention prices under the European
Union CAP reform.

Fresh dairy products
The chilled yogurts and desserts market
has again been a strong area of growth
in the dairy sector with volumes up by
8% and value up by over 10%. The
market is now worth nearly £1.7 billion
per annum.
Our Yoplait Dairy Crest joint venture
has continued to make good progress.
The Yoplait Dairy Crest brands are now
worth approximately £170 million at retail
value and have delivered double-digit
sales growth. All the key brands have
performed well with Petits Filous up 14%,
Frubes up 11%, Wildlife up 21%, YOP 
up 35% and Weight Watchers up 14%
by value during the year. Yoplait Dairy
Crest has continued to grow market
share in a very competitive market.
Yoplait Dairy Crest has recently
extended its market leading Petits Filous
brand with a smooth fruity yogurt. This is
aimed at widening the brand’s usage
amongst older children thereby reinforcing
Yoplait’s number one position in the
important children’s sector. The launch is
being supported by a new television
campaign during May and June 2005.
During the year the performance of
the brands continued to be somewhat
offset by the difficulties in retailer own
brand yogurts and desserts where
markets remained challenging.
Consequently, Yoplait Dairy Crest
decided to focus its future development
on branded products and, as previously
announced, both the Enfield and Yeovil
sites are expected to close by the end 
of June 2005. These actions will 
improve Yoplait Dairy Crest’s profitability
in 2005/06.

Operational review – Consumer foods
Liquid products
The retail milk market continued to grow
during the year with volumes up by
almost 2%. The retail milk market is now
worth over £2 billion per annum. Whilst
our overall fresh milk volumes to major
retailers were up 5% year on year,
profitability in our liquid products business
was impacted by the competitive retail
environment and higher fuel and plastics
costs, particularly in the second half.
During the financial year major food
retailers reviewed their milk supply
arrangements. We were pleased to
increase our share of Sainsbury’s volume
to approximately 50% and to maintain our
sole supply positions with Waitrose and
Marks & Spencer. We will increase our
share of Morrisons fresh milk supply from
approximately 30% to approximately 50%
from October 2005. However we lost our
supply positions with both ASDA and
Tesco with effect from November 2004
and April 2005 respectively.
We recently announced the
acquisitions of both Starcross Foods
Limited for £16.9 million and Midlands
Co-op Dairies for £20 million. Starcross is
an advanced modern facility, capable of
processing up to 100 million litres of milk
per annum. This will significantly extend
our geographical footprint across England
and Wales to cover most of the major
northern conurbations. Midlands Co-op
Dairies processes approximately 200
million litres of milk per annum and
distributes fresh milk to a range of retail,
wholesale and doorstep customers
across the Midlands region. This business
will be consolidated into Dairy Crest’s
existing dairy operations and it is
anticipated that the Midlands Co-op
Birmingham dairy will be closed in due
course. Milk processing will be transferred
to Dairy Crest’s existing dairies including
the Starcross site. The acquisitions of
thirst
Midlands Co-op Dairies and Starcross
Foods and the recent business wins are
expected to have a broadly neutral effect
on earnings in the financial year 2005/06
and benefit group profitability by
approximately £4 million per annum
thereafter. These acquisitions better align
our business to customers’ requirements
and have strengthened Dairy Crest’s
competitive position.
The business achieved price increases
on fresh milk sales in March and April
2005. A significant element of this price
increase was used to increase the price
we pay to our milk suppliers, whose costs
have increased during the year. On
average, taking into account customer
specific milk pools, Dairy Crest had
increased its prices for its liquid milk by
0.75 pence per litre by April 2005.
We continue to work towards adding
value to fresh milk in a number of ways.
The organic milk business made good
progress, benefiting from a strong market
and the continued improvement in
managing the demand and supply
balance. Retailer own label organic milk
sales value grew by 38% and the 
Rachel’s organic milk brand (under licence
from Horizon Organic Dairies) sales value
grew by 22%.
Frijj, our flavoured fresh milk drink, has
maintained its position as the leading
brand in the flavoured fresh milk sector
with sales up 1% by value. We have
improved our added value mix of potted
cream business even though overall
volumes are slightly down. Our potted
cream business will benefit in the current
financial year from the completion of the
investment in a new speciality cream
facility at our Chard site. In May 2005 
we launched ‘St. Ivel advance’, a new
branded fresh milk enriched with
Omega-3.

The Food Services division comprises Dairy Crest’s household and ingredients operations.
Turnover decreased by 4% to £461.5 million (2004 - £481.5 million), reflecting the
downsizing of our commodity ingredients business in 2003/04. Operating profit, before
operating exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, decreased by 12% to £28.6 million
(2004 - £32.6 million), reflecting the ongoing decline in our household business, partially
offset by a good performance from our ingredients operations. The Food Services margin

our customers’ doors.
Household
The household business has performed
well with an overall increase in volumes
following business gains with
wholesalers and smaller retailers. As a
result, together with a doorstep price
increase of one penny per pint from
October 2004, overall turnover for the
household business was slightly up. Our
increased canvassing activity and ‘first
class service’ initiatives have helped
reduce the underlying annual decline rate
in doorstep, which is now at around 8%.   
An area of focus during the year has
been on non-milk products such as
juice, organic fruit and vegetables. Non-
milk product sales on the doorstep grew
by over 8% year on year despite the
underlying decline in doorstep
customers. We again had a successful
Christmas which is a key trading period
for non-milk products.
We have continued the successful
programme of infill acquisitions. We
expect that doorstep operations will
benefit from the acquisition of Midlands
Co-op Dairies which has a sizeable
doorstep business with 16 distribution
depots across the Midlands region. 
This will provide an extended network
increasing the opportunity for future 
infill acquisitions.
Ingredients
Ingredients markets have remained
relatively strong for most of the year
leading to a good performance. The
impact of the initial implementation of CAP
reform was delayed until the last quarter of
the year. We expect CAP reform to have
greater influence in 2005/06 through
reduced commodity prices. A further
reduction in intervention prices of 7% on
butter and 5% on skimmed milk powder
will take place in July 2005.

Milk purchasing Dairy Crest is one of the UK’s largest
purchasers of milk, buying approximately 2.2 billion litres
of milk each year. A consistent source of high quality,
farm assured British milk is critical to our business
success and Dairy Crest recognises the vital role that
dairy farmers play in the milk supply chain.

Mitchell from Waitrose with John
Pennington at Treore Farm, Cornwall.
We buy milk from 1,400 British dairy
farmers who supply us directly, as well as
from First Milk, one of UK’s leading milk
co-operatives. We would like farmers to
feel proud that the milk they supply to us
is used to make our brands and products
and our aim is to be the industry’s milk
purchaser of choice.
The dairy industry continues to face a
number of challenges, including reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy which
began in July 2004. We believe that
working in partnership with our farmers
will help to deliver a sustainable, 
long-term future for the industry, built on
driving efficiencies through the supply
chain and growing the proportion of
added value dairy products in the UK.
We have established added value,
segregated milk pools in recent years
which are a good example of what can
be achieved when farmers and
processors work together towards
common goals.
Good relationships with our farmers
are important if we are to achieve these
objectives. A dedicated team of Direct
Supply Managers, supported by a farmer
helpdesk, works closely with farmers on
an individual basis, assisting with
operational and milk quality issues and
ensuring that the requirements of the
industry farm assurance scheme are met.
May 2004 saw the launch of Dairy
Crest Direct (DCD), the farmer
organisation representing the great
majority of our direct suppliers, which we
have encouraged and supported. DCD
has a voice at all levels within the
company and has already made
significant progress in achieving its
objective to represent and inform direct
suppliers, as well as strengthening
relationships with both the company and
our customers. We will continue to work
with DCD and our other milk suppliers to
make sure that the needs of both farmers
and Dairy Crest are reflected in our
decisions.
We also believe that Dairy Crest has a
role to perform in improving trust within
the dairy industry and we are committed
to regular, transparent communication
with farmers, customers, industry bodies
and government. We also play an active
part in Dairy UK, the body which brings
together all elements of the dairy industry
for the first time.
4561_DC_pp 14-15_lores  13/6/05  10:06 AM  Page 15 16 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2005
Dairy Crest’s Chief Executive has overall
responsibility for performance for
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR),
which is monitored by regular reporting
to the Board. The Company has
established a CSR steering group which
brings together senior managers with
specific CSR responsibilities to review
our activities and assess the needs of
our stakeholders. 
In the last financial year we joined
Business in the Community (BITC).
Membership of BITC is proving
enormously valuable and has provided us
with a robust CSR framework, which we
are using as a benchmark for evaluating
Dairy Crest’s current activities. This is an
ongoing exercise but this year for the first
time we are using BITC’s framework to
report on our policy and practice.
Environment
We recognise that food production
potentially has numerous impacts on the
environment and attach great
importance to protecting the
environments local to our sites. For the
first time since 1998, we have been
prosecuted for a breach of environmental
legislation, after an incident which
occurred at Davidstow in February 2004,
during the construction of our new
creamery. Steps have been taken 
to prevent a repeat of this relatively 
minor incident.
All our manufacturing sites continue
to maintain accreditation to ISO 14001
and our national distribution centre at
Nuneaton has achieved this standard 
in the last year. Our sites are
independently audited by Lloyds Register
Quality Assurance.
Our sites set targets annually to
improve environmental performance and
this year we have reduced effluent
discharged, per litre of milk processed,
by 13%. All milk processing sites are set
to be issued with Integrated Pollution
Prevention and Control (IPPC) permits in
the coming year.
Marketplace
Food and its relationship with health is
an issue which increasingly concerns
consumers and we are committed to
producing food and drink to the highest
standards of safety, quality and hygiene
in line with our Good Manufacturing
Practice. Each manufacturing site is
audited annually by a third party against
the British Retail Consortium Technical
Standard. This year all sites have once
again achieved accreditation at the
higher level.
We have a short supply chain,
enabling close relationships with the
1,400 British dairy farmers who supply
us directly, as well as supplying dairy co-
operatives. The Dairy Crest Assurance
Scheme ensures the delivery of top
quality milk, produced to high standards
of food safety, animal welfare and
protection of the environment. Dairy
Crest provides a subsidised support
package, through the independent White
Gold Service, to enable direct supplying
farmers to maintain Farm Assurance
standards with the minimum of
disruption and cost.
At Dairy Crest we recognise the
important relationship between a
balanced diet, lifestyle and health. We
fully support the Department of Health’s
Food & Health Action Plan goals of
reducing salt, fat and added sugar in
products where appropriate, without
compromising on food safety, nutrition,
quality or taste. We are also committed
to providing full nutritional information on
all of our product labels, which will
include fat, sugar and salt per portion as
a percentage of the recommended daily
allowance (RDA), where space allows.
We have updated our ethical trading
policy in the last year to maintain good
working practices in social and ethical
matters, meeting the requirements of the
UK Ethical Trading Initiative. All of our
manufacturing sites have been audited
successfully by Bureau Veritas. We have
also recently published policies relating
to food and health, food safety, farmers,
customers and our suppliers.
Workplace
The success of our business is
underpinned by the 7,000 people who
work for Dairy Crest and our joint
A responsible company Dairy Crest recognises that our actions and decisions have an
impact on the staff we employ, the local communities where we operate, our suppliers, our
customers and the environment. We take our responsibilities to our stakeholders seriously.

venture, Yoplait Dairy Crest, across 23
manufacturing and administration sites
and 100 household depots. We focus on
creating an environment where our
people are safe, valued and motivated to
improve performance continuously.
Health and safety remains a key focus
for the Company. Our accident incidence
rate continues the trend of recent years,
falling by 12% since last year, and is 18%
below the dairy industry average. We
have achieved this result through rigorous
training and working with third parties
such as the Health and Safety Executive.
We continue to augment the Group’s
health and safety audit programme with a
programme of external accreditation by
the British Safety Council. This year all of
our sites have achieved 4* or 5*, the
highest ratings.
In the last year the Company has
continued to place particular importance
on improving employee relations 
through a constructive partnership with
our staff and their representatives.
Training programmes are focussed on
developing our people to ensure they
have the knowledge and skills for now
and the future.
Our commitment to our people also
includes seeking Investors in People
accreditation for all our manufacturing
sites and household depots, the majority
of which have achieved this standard.

In the last two years our staff have raised an
impressive £465,000 through a variety of
fundraising activities for Leukaemia
Research.
Community
The majority of our sites are in rural
settings or small towns, where Dairy
Crest is often one of the largest local
employers. We recognise that the
Company has a valuable role to play in
the life of the local community. We intend
to work with the BITC on a regional level
during the next year to support the
relationships already in place and to
encourage new relationships within the
wider community. 
Several of our sites are involved with
schools in their local areas, giving talks on
food and dairy technology, science and
manufacturing. We also take in students
as part of their work experience and give
donations in kind to local causes.
Our household business plays an
important role at the heart of the local
community. We deliver over 350 million
bottles of milk from 100 depots in
southern England and Wales to one
million customers every year, as well as a
range of other products including staples
such as bread, eggs, fruit and
vegetables and juices.
Our thanks go to our sites and
depots which have supported Dairy
Crest’s corporate charity, Leukaemia
Research, and raised a total of £465,000
in the last two years through a variety of
fundraising activities. We will continue to
support the UK’s leading blood cancer
charity for a third year.

Financial review
Turnover
Group turnover, including our share of
joint ventures’ turnover, reduced by 1%
to £1,349 million principally reflecting the
full year impact of the closure of our
ingredients facility at Chard in July 2003.
Operating profit
In this review, except where otherwise
referred to, operating profit is stated
before exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation. Operating profit reduced by
4% to £100.6 million after absorbing an
increase in pension costs of £4.3 million.
After operating exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation, operating profit
increased by 20% to £82.1 million. 
Consumer Foods operating profit,
including our share of joint ventures’
profit, was flat at £72.0 million reflecting
a good performance by spreads and
Yoplait Dairy Crest offset by margin
pressure in liquid products. Consumer
Foods margin decreased by 0.1% to
8.1%. Food Services operating profit
decreased by 12% to £28.6 million
reflecting the on-going decline in the
household business partially offset by a
strong performance from the ingredients
operation. The Food Services margin
decreased by 0.6% to 6.2%.
Exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation
Operating exceptional costs of £5.4
million have been charged against
operating profit, of which £4.3 million
represents our share of Yoplait Dairy
Crest’s closure costs of its factories at
Enfield and Yeovil. In addition, operating
exceptional costs of £1.1 million have
been incurred in the commissioning of
our Davidstow creamery which is now
completed.
Goodwill amortisation amounts to
£13.1 million (2004 – £12.2 million) of
which £7.1 million relates to the acquisition
of the St Ivel Spreads business. 
We have also recognised
non-operating exceptional profits of
£1.0 million representing profits on
disposal of closed dairy sites and receipt
of contingent consideration relating to
the sale of the juice business.
Interest
The Group’s interest charge has
decreased by 17% to £16.4 million. 
This decrease reflects the impact of
lower debt levels and the benefit from
reduced margins and fees following the
refinancing of our facilities in June 2004.
The interest charge includes £0.1 million
(2004 – £0.4 million) in respect of our
share of Yoplait Dairy Crest’s interest
charge and is stated after capitalising
interest of £0.1 million (2004 –
£2.4 million) on our capital investment
at Davidstow. Interest cover calculated
before operating exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation was 6.1 times
(2004 – 5.3 times).
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate on profits
excluding exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation was 27.1% (2004 – 27.0%).
This reflects a benefit of 0.8% (2004 –
2.9%) from adjustments to tax liabilities
in respect of prior years. The tax credit
on the operating exceptional items of
£5.4 million was £1.6 million, a rate
of 29.6% and the tax charge on the
non-operating exceptional items of
£1.0 million was £0.3 million. Overall,
excluding goodwill amortisation, the
Group’s effective tax rate was 26.9%
(2004 – 22.0%).
Earnings per share
The Group’s adjusted earnings per share
reduced by 1% to 49.3 pence per share.
Basic earnings per share, which includes
the impact of exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation, increased by
36% to 38.2 pence per share.
The weighted average number of
shares increased by approximately 
0.8 million to 123.4 million, following the
exercise of sharesave and long-term
incentive share plan options.
Dividends
The proposed final dividend of
14.3 pence per share, together with the
interim dividend of 5.9 pence per share,
gives a total dividend of 20.2 pence per
share for the full year. This represents an
increase of 7% on the dividend declared
for 2003/04. The final dividend will be

paid on 9 August 2005 to shareholders
on the register on 8 July 2005.
Dividend cover, calculated as profit
for the year after minority interests,
excluding exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation, divided by dividends payable,
was 2.4 times (2004 – 2.6 times).
Pensions 
During the year, the actuary completed
the triennial valuation of the Dairy Crest
Group Pension Fund as at 31 March
2004. This indicated that there was a
surplus of £30 million of the funds’
assets over the value of the members
accrued benefits. This compared with
a deficit under Financial Reporting
Standard No. 17 on Retirement Benefits
(FRS 17) of £95.2 million at this date. The
difference between the two assessments
arises because the actuarial basis under
Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice No. 24 – Accounting for
Pension Costs (SSAP 24) uses the
weighted average return on investments
to discount the liabilities whereas FRS 17
uses the AA Corporate Bond yield. At
31 March 2004, the respective discount
rates were 7.2% and 5.6% for SSAP 24
and FRS 17. The Group increased its
contributions from 4% to 7.9% of
pensionable salaries with effect from
April 2004 and it has increased its
contributions by a further 3.5% to
11.4% from April 2005.
We continue to apply the transitional
arrangements of FRS 17 and will move
directly to the International Accounting
Standard (IAS) equivalent for the financial
year ending 31 March 2006.
The actuary has estimated that on an
FRS 17 basis the gross deficit in the fund
at 31 March 2005 was £104.4 million
compared with a deficit of £95.2 million
at 31 March 2004. The movement largely
reflects a gain of £20.4 million as a result
of the actual return on investments being
above the expected return offset by an
increase in the present value of liabilities
of £20.3 million, principally due to an
increase in the market expectation of
future inflation of 0.1% per annum and
a reduction of 0.1% in the yield on AA
corporate bonds and a difference of
£8 million between the FRS 17 current 
service cost and employers’ pension
contributions paid into the fund. At
31 March 2005 the fund was invested
in equities (76%) and Index Linked
Gilts (24%).
Cash flow
The cash inflow from operating activities
was £143.0 million (2004 – £136.6 million).
This included a working capital inflow
of £20.6 million (2004 – £10.2 million).
Stocks decreased by £16.8 million
principally reflecting reductions in
maturing cheese stocks.
Depreciation amounted to
£34.4 million (2004 – £36.0 million)
and goodwill amortisation amounted to
£13.1 million (2004 – £12.2 million).
Interest payments amounted to
£17.7 million including fees relating to
the refinancing of facilities in June 2004.
The Group currently borrows at a margin
of 47.5 – 75 basis points over the
relevant interbank rate.
Tax payments were £12.6 million
(2004 – £8.7 million) reflecting lower
exceptional costs and the continued
benefit of capital allowances on capital
expenditure on major projects.
Capital expenditure, net of grants of
£1.6 million, was £37.7 million with
significant amounts being invested at
Chard, Somerset on our new cream
facility and at Davidstow, Cornwall and
Hartington, Derbyshire. The Group’s
cash flow benefited by £8.2 million
resulting from the disposal of fixed
assets. In addition, the Group undertook
a sale and leaseback of £18.7 million of
processing equipment at Davidstow.
Net borrowings
Net debt decreased by £52.2 million to
£227.5 million at the end of the year
which reflects profits, improved working
capital and reduced capital expenditure.
At 31 March 2005, gearing was 83%
(2004 – 113%).
Shareholders’ funds
Shareholders’ funds at 31 March 2005
were £262.5 million including goodwill
of £97.3 million, £16.9 million of which
related to the Unigate dairy and cheese
acquisition and £53.8 million to the 
St Ivel Spreads acquisition. The Group’s
balance sheet is strong with stocks of
£172.7 million and tangible fixed assets
of £322.7 million.
Treasury policies
The Group operates a centralised
treasury function which controls cash
management and borrowings and the
Group’s financial risks. The main treasury
risks faced by the Group are liquidity,
interest rates and foreign currency. The
Group uses derivatives only to manage
its foreign currency and interest rate risks
arising from underlying business activities.
Transactions of a speculative nature are
prohibited. The Group’s treasury activities
are governed by policies approved and
monitored by the Board. These policies
are summarised below.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to ensure that
forecast net borrowings plus a reasonable
operating headroom are covered by
committed facilities which mature at least
12 months after the year end.
At 31 March 2005 the Group’s total
credit facilities amounted to £470 million.
The facility consists of a five year term
loan of £80 million repayable in four
semi-annual instalments from December
2008 to June 2010, a £270 million five
year multi-currency revolving credit
facility repayable at maturity in June
2010 and a five year term loan facility
of £120 million repayable in four semi-
annual instalments from March 2006
to September 2007. 
Short-term funding requirements are
met through uncommitted overdraft and
short-term facilities amounting to over
£20 million.
All borrowings are through banks
with strong long-term credit ratings.
Funds temporarily surplus to business
requirements are invested overnight
through deposit accounts with
commercial banks with a credit rating
of AA or better. The Group currently has
no requirement to place deposits for a
longer period, accordingly counterparty
risk is considered to be low.
0197_DC_AR_2005_p18_21  31/5/05  9:27 am  Page 19 Foreign currency risk
Translation exposures arise on the
earnings and net assets of our overseas
subsidiary, Wexford Creamery Limited.
Our policy is to hedge the net asset
exposure through borrowings in the
relevant foreign currency. At present, our
only translation exposure is in euros.
The majority of the Group’s
transactions are carried out in sterling
and so transaction exposures are limited.
The Group trades skimmed milk
products and bulk butter mainly to
customers in Europe and Central and
South America. The Group also exports
its own skimmed milk products, bulk
butter, Stilton and other branded
products. The Group’s policy requires
foreign currency sales and purchases to
be hedged by foreign exchange
contracts once the transaction is
committed so that the margin on the
transaction can be fixed. In addition a
substantial part of Yoplait Dairy Crest’s
purchases are denominated in euros.
Currency exposures on other
transactions, such as capital expenditure
denominated in a foreign currency, are
hedged following approval of the project
using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to reduce the
exposure of the business to changes in
interest rates. The Group borrows at
floating rates of interest and uses interest
rate swaps or forward rate agreements
to limit the exposure to movements in
sterling LIBOR, although interest rate
caps may also be used. The policy is to
fix or cap the interest cost on between 
one third and three quarters of floating
rate borrowings, although a higher
percentage may be fixed within a
12 month horizon. £170 million, 75% of
net debt, was fixed at 31 March 2005
for remaining terms of up to five years.
International Financial Reporting
Standards
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) have come into force
for listed companies in all member
countries of the European Union from
January 2005. Thus Dairy Crest will be
required to prepare its accounts in
accordance with IFRS for the year
ending 31 March 2006.
The Company has completed its
initial assessment of the adjustments
required to restate the accounts from
UK GAAP to IFRS for the year ended
31 March 2005. This assessment has
been based on all IFRS and interpretations
issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and its
committees. These are subject to ongoing
amendment by the IASB and industry
interpretation. They are unaudited and
are subject to possible change.
Dairy Crest estimates that under
IFRS, the Group’s net assets at
31 March 2005 will be reduced by
around £51 million. The largest
adjustment relates to the change in
accounting for pensions under IFRS
where the net deficit in the Dairy Crest
Group Pension Fund of £73.1 million
(after deferred taxation of £31.3 million)
is included as a liability in the balance
sheet. In addition the pension prepayment
of £3.7 million (net of deferred taxation) 
has to be reversed. Offsetting this the
accrual for the final dividend of £17.7
million is reversed and reflected as a
liability when declared in 2005/06 and
goodwill amortisation of £10.6 million
(after deferred taxation of £2.5 million) is
also reversed. It is also estimated that,
under IFRS, the profit before tax
excluding exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation for the year ended
31 March 2005, will reduce by around
£9 million. This principally relates to
increased charges for pensions of
around £7 million and for share based
payments of around £2 million. The
introduction of IFRS will have no impact
on the reported cash flows of the Group.
A detailed presentation on the impact of
restating the accounts from UK GAAP
to IFRS is available on the Dairy Crest
website www.dairycrest.co.uk
Going concern
The financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis as
the directors are satisfied that the Group
has adequate financial resources to
continue its operations for the foreseeable
future. In making this statement, the
directors have reviewed the Group’s
budget and available facilities and have
made such other enquiries as they
considered appropriate.

0197_DC_AR_2005_p18_21  2/6/05  10:27 am  Page 21 Corporate governance
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of
corporate governance. This report sets out how the Company
complies with the principles contained in Section 1 of the
Combined Code on corporate governance published by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 and now set out in the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. In early 2004 a
Corporate Governance Working Group was established,
comprising the Chairman, Chief Executive and the Company
Secretary and the Board has progressively adopted and
implemented the recommendations of this group. The Board
considers that, throughout the financial year under review,
the Company has complied with the provisions set out in
Section 1 of the Combined Code with two exceptions. Firstly the
non-executive directors did not meet during the year without the
Chairman present. However such a meeting was held on
19 May 2005 during the course of which the senior non-executive
director reported on the Chairman’s performance appraisal.
Such meetings will now be held annually. Secondly no meetings
were held between shareholders and the Chairman and the
senior independent non-executive director during the year.
The Board considers that arrangements are in place to ensure
a balanced understanding of the issues and concerns of major
shareholders. These arrangements include regular feedback
from the Chief Executive and the Finance Director on their
meetings with major shareholders, together with periodic reports
to the Board on the views of major shareholders from the
Company’s broker. 
We describe below the way in which the Company complies
with the detailed provisions of the Combined Code. 
The Board 
Currently the Board consists of the non-executive Chairman,
four executive directors and five non-executive directors.
The table opposite identifies the number of Board and
Committee meetings held during the past year and the
attendance of each director. 
The Board has responsibility for the overall management and
performance of the Group with the key objective of delivering
shareholder value. The Board reserves a formal schedule of
matters for its approval which includes strategy and
management, financial structure and capital, reporting and
controls, Board appointments and committees, executive
remuneration, dividend policy and corporate governance
compliance. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board,
the Board objectives, the terms of reference of the Board
Committees, a summary of the service contracts of the
executive directors and of the terms of appointment of the non-
executive directors together with the respective responsibilities
of the Chairman and Chief Executive are available on the
Company’s website, www.dairycrest.co.uk. The biographies
of the directors are set out on page 21.
Senior executives below Board level attend certain Board
meetings and make presentations to the Board on strategic,
financial, operational and compliance matters. Directors are
given Board papers in advance of each meeting. Where
directors have concerns about the running of the Company, 
or a proposed action that cannot be resolved, their concerns
are recorded in the Board minutes.
Below the Board level there are limits of authority allowing the
executive committee (comprising the four executive directors)
and senior management to make financial commitments. In
addition there are clear policies and procedures over the key
risk areas where management has been given delegated
responsibility, including financial reporting, treasury, purchasing,
milk procurement, food safety and environmental matters.
All directors have access to advice from the Company Secretary
or independent professional advice at the expense of the
Company. During the year training sessions, led by Clifford
Chance and by a consultant from the Institute of Directors, were
provided on directors’ legal responsibilities and on Board
effectiveness to ensure that directors are regularly updated
and refresh their knowledge and awareness of corporate
responsibilities. The Company maintains appropriate insurance
cover for the directors and officers. The Company’s insurance
cover also includes insurance of employers’ liability and public
and product liability risks.
The Board has three Board Committees and details of directors’
attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings are set
out below:

All directors have attended all meetings of the Board and of
Committees of the Board of which they were members at the
relevant time unless prevented from doing so by prior
commitments. All directors attended the annual general meeting
in July 2004. 
The Audit Committee: Until 17 March 2005 the Committee
comprised three non-executive directors, Mr D J Dugdale,
Mr G E Grimstone and Mr P S Lewis (Chairman). Mr D H
Richardson joined the Committee on 17 March 2005 and
Mr H Mann on 19 May 2005. The Chairman, the Chief
Executive, the Finance Director, the head of internal audit, senior
finance management and representatives of the external
auditors are in attendance at meetings of the Committee. The
Committee holds private meetings without management present
with both the external and internal auditors.
22 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2005
0197_DC_AR_2005_p22_39  2/6/05  10:18 am  Page 22 The Committee is responsible for exercising the full powers and
authority of the Board in reviewing a wide range of accounting
and financial reporting matters. Since the last Annual Report the
Committee has met to consider amongst other matters:
• The Company’s interim and annual financial statements and
formal announcements on financial performance before
submission to the Board for approval; 
• The Group’s risk register and the adequacy of the Group’s
accounting systems and internal controls; 
• Review of the Group internal audit process and the 2005/06
internal audit plan;
• The provision of audit and non-audit services provided by
the external auditors, their audit fees for 2004/05 and a
report from the external auditors confirming their
independence and objectivity; 
• An evaluation of the effectiveness of the external auditors; 
• Recommendation of re-appointment of the external auditors;
• Developments in accounting standards in particular the
Group’s preparation for the adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards; 
• The adoption of the Group’s whistle blowing procedures and
application of these procedures; and 
• The Group’s compliance with the Combined Code. 
Where the external auditors have provided non-audit services
the Finance Director has obtained prior authorisation from the
chairman of the Committee to instruct Ernst & Young to carry
out this work.
The Committee members bring considerable financial and
accounting experience to the achievement of the Committee’s
objectives. Collectively members have significant past business
experience in industry and finance. Mr D H Richardson, who
was Finance Director of Whitbread PLC until April 2005, will
assume the Chairmanship of the Committee following the
retirement of Mr P S Lewis in July 2005.
The Nomination Committee: During the year the Committee
comprised two non-executive directors Mr D J Dugdale
(Chairman) and Mr P S Lewis and the non-executive Chairman.
Other directors and advisors attend meetings by invitation only.
Mr G E Grimstone, Mr H Mann and Mr D H Richardson joined
the Committee on 19 May 2005. The Committee is responsible
for succession planning at Board level, overseeing the selection
of directors and making recommendations to the Board on
subsequent appointments. The appointment of Mr D H
Richardson was initiated by the non-executive Chairman and
the Chief Executive who briefed executive search consultants to
locate a non-executive director with a strong financial
background. The Company interviewed a number of candidates
identified by the consultants and from other sources. The
Committee met in December 2004 to receive a report on the
progress of the recruitment exercise and subsequently
recommended the appointment of Mr D H Richardson.
The Committee also discussed Board succession arrangements
in December 2004 and has subsequently recommended to
the Board that Mr G E Grimstone should be proposed for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). 
Mr G E Grimstone has completed two terms of three years but
his business background and his governance knowledge gained
from other board appointments are considered to be of
considerable on-going benefit to the Company. The Committee
approves any non-executive directorships taken by executive
directors. The Board believes that directors can gain valuable
experience and knowledge from becoming a non-executive
director of another listed company that will ultimately benefit
the Company. MrJWD Hall, the Group’s Chief Executive, was
appointed as a non-executive director of Mitchells & Butlers plc
in July 2004. His fees for this position have been passed to
the Company. No other executive director holds a non-
executive directorship.
The Remuneration Committee: The membership of the
Committee during the year is set out on page 26. The
Committee is responsible for determining, within remuneration
principles agreed with the Board, the salaries, bonuses and
pension rights of the executive directors. Remuneration is
designed to be set at a level appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances having regard to market information provided by
external consultants. The Board itself determines the
remuneration of non-executive directors also having regard to
market information provided by external consultants.
An explanation of how the Company has applied the principles
of the Combined Code with respect to remuneration is outlined
in the Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration on
pages 26 to 32.
Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman,
Mr S M D Oliver, and the Chief Executive, Mr J W D Hall. The
respective responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive
have been agreed by the Board and, as previously advised, are
available on the Company’s website.
Board balance and independence
The Board considers all of the non-executive directors including
the Chairman to be independent under the guidelines set out in
the Combined Code. The non-executive directors and the
Chairman are free from any material business relationship with
the Company and have not held executive positions within the
Group. None of the non-executive directors nor the Chairman
have served as a director of the Company for more than nine
years. Mr P S Lewis joined the Board in 1996, having previously
served for three years as a director of Dairy Crest Limited, and
is therefore in his ninth year of service with the Company.
Mr P S Lewis will retire by rotation at the AGM and is not
seeking re-election. Currently there are five non-executive
directors and the non-executive Chairman, out of a total
Board of ten. The directors are of the opinion that an
appropriate balance between executive and independent 
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2005 23
0197_DC_AR_2005_p22_39  31/5/05  9:33 am  Page 23 non-executive directors exists. Mr P S Lewis will be succeeded
by Mr G E Grimstone as the senior non-executive director. Any
shareholder who has a concern about the affairs of the
Company should contact, in the first instance, the Chairman,
the Chief Executive or the senior non-executive director.
Performance evaluation
The Board conducts an annual evaluation of individual directors,
its own performance and that of its Committees. The evaluation
process is designed to improve the effectiveness of the Board.
Individual director performance is reviewed as follows:
• The Chairman is appraised by the senior non-executive
director with input from other directors. The procedures for
determining the Chairman’s remuneration are outlined in the
Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration on page 27.
• The Chief Executive appraises the performance of the other
executive directors and monitors and reviews the
remuneration structure for senior managers.
• The performance of the Chief Executive and of directors,
in relation to their Board responsibilities, is appraised by
the Chairman. 
Appraisals were performed for all the directors during the year
for their performance in 2004/05 and the Chairman reported to
the Board on the outcome of the appraisals in relation to the
Board’s overall effectiveness at its meeting on 19 May 2005.
Following receipt of this report, the Board has assessed its
overall performance and that of its Committees and has
determined training requirements for the current year.
Re-election
The Company’s articles require that one third of Board members
retire by rotation at each AGM. In addition, directors appointed
to the Board after the previous AGM have to seek election at
the next AGM. At the AGM to be held on 14 July 2005 Mr G E
Grimstone, Mr J W D Hall and Mr P S Lewis will retire by
rotation. The Nomination Committee has recommended that
Mr G E Grimstone is proposed for re-election as a non-
executive director. The Board supports this recommendation
and is satisfied that Mr G E Grimstone’s performance continues
to be effective and that he demonstrates appropriate
commitment to the role, including time for Board and
Committee meetings and any other duties. 
The Board also supports the proposed re-election to the Board
of Mr J W D Hall, the Company’s Chief Executive. As previously
stated, Mr P S Lewis is not seeking re-election.
Mr D H Richardson joined the Board on 9 December 2004 and,
having been appointed during the year, will retire at the AGM
and offers himself for election. 
Accountability and audit
The directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. It is therefore appropriate to continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of
internal control to safeguard the shareholders’ investment and
the Company’s assets. As required by the Combined Code, the
Board has established an ongoing process, in accordance with
the guidance of the Turnbull committee on internal control, to
identify, evaluate and manage significant risks faced by the
Group. This process, which includes the consideration of a
schedule identifying and evaluating the Group’s significant risks
and related financial, operational and compliance controls has
been in place for the year under review and up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report. The Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control (including
that of its joint venture Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited) which is
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to
achieve the Group’s strategic objectives and to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The main elements of the process applied in reviewing the
effectiveness of the systems of internal control include:
• Board – the Board exercises its responsibilities through
organisational structure with clearly defined levels of
responsibility and rules relating to delegated authorities. The
Board meets regularly throughout the year and receives oral
and written presentations to maintain control over strategic,
financial, operational and compliance matters. The executive
committee is responsible for embedding risk management
and controls in the Group. The executive director of each
division, in conjunction with senior management, operates
and maintains controls appropriate to its own activities and
conforms to Group policies and procedures. 
• Financial reporting – there is an annual budget presented
and approved by the Board which includes consideration
of the major business risks, an assessment of the likelihood
of crystalisation and actions in place to mitigate these risks.
Each business is required to report monthly to the Board
on financial performance. The monthly financial information
includes trading results, balance sheet and cash flow
information by business unit with comparison against prior
year and budget. Each business periodically reassesses its
forecast for the financial year. Annually a strategic plan is
also presented to the Board, which reviews financial
projections for the following three years and includes
consideration of current and likely future strategic,
operational and market environment matters. 
24 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2005
Corporate governance continued
0197_DC_AR_2005_p22_39  2/6/05  10:28 am  Page 24 • Business unit reviews – on a quarterly basis, each business
unit is required to complete a self-assessment controls
questionnaire that requires the approval of business unit
management. In addition, the Audit Committee and the
executive committee receive copies of all Group internal
audit reports which detail audit issues noted and corrective
action plans. They also receive reports from the external
auditors on the conclusions of their interim review and
final audit.
Relationships with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on its
communication and relationship with its institutional and private
shareholders. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director hold
meetings with key institutional shareholders to discuss strategy,
financial performance and investment activities immediately after
the full year and interim results announcement. Slide
presentations made to institutional shareholders are also
available on the Company’s website. Feedback from meetings
with shareholders was provided to the Board to ensure that the
non-executive directors have a balanced understanding of the
issues and concerns of major shareholders. In addition the
Board received periodic reports from the Company’s broker
on investor relations and the views of shareholders.
The principal method of communication with private
shareholders is through the Annual and Interim reports, the
AGM and through the Company’s website. A business review is
presented by the Chairman at the AGM to facilitate shareholder
understanding of the Group’s activities. All executive directors,
the Chairman and the chairmen of Board Committees attend
the AGM and are available to answer shareholders’ questions.
The Notice of the AGM is posted to shareholders with the
annual accounts at least 20 working days before the date of the
AGM. Resolutions are proposed for each substantial separate
issue and details of the proxy votes for each resolution passed
are announced after the result of each show of hands is known
and are then posted on the Company’s website following the
conclusion of the meeting.
Directors’ indemnities
An amendment to the Companies Act 1985 (the ‘Act’) came
into force on 6 April 2005 under which companies may
indemnify their directors and officers against liabilities (including
against legal costs) to a greater extent than was previously
possible. This amendment has been introduced by the
Government following its consultation process in respect of
director and auditor liability. The amendment addresses
concerns raised in that process that exposure to liabilities
arising from legal action brought against directors by third
parties and the cost of lengthy court proceedings were 
affecting the recruitment and behaviour of directors. The Board
wishes to continue to attract good quality directors and
therefore believes it is in the interests of the Company to take
advantage of this amendment. Accordingly resolution 10 at the
AGM proposes the adoption of a new article 147 of the
Company’s articles of association to give the directors and the
officers the benefit of the new indemnity provisions to the extent
permitted by the Act.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2005 25
0197_DC_AR_2005_p22_39  2/6/05  10:28 am  Page 25 • Long-Term Incentive Share Plan 
A Long-Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’) was introduced 
on 28 June 1996 which is designed to encourage continuing
improvement in the Group’s performance over the longer term.
An LTISP award is payable in shares, rather than cash, to
emphasise the alignment of interest between the participants
and the Company’s shareholders. The LTISP has a three year
performance cycle and pre-determined performance conditions
which must be met before awards under the LTISP can be
exercised. Awards under the LTISP are granted annually.
For awards from 2002 onwards, 50% of the total award is
measured on the growth in the Company’s adjusted earnings,
excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, per
share compared with the increase in the retail prices index (RPI)
over the three year performance period and 50% is measured
on total shareholder return (TSR) performance.
The TSR of Dairy Crest Group plc is measured against that of
14 comparator companies in the foods sector, the FTSE 250
Index (excluding investment companies) and the FTSE Food
Producers and Processors Index.
The targets will be as follows:
LTISP Award TSR Element EPS Element
Proportion Proportion
of total Growth in of total
LTISP excess of LTISP
award RPI over 3 award
Performance Achieved vesting years vesting
Upper quartile 50% 24% 50%
Median 20% 9% 20%
Between median and 
upper quartile Pro rata Pro rata Pro rata
between between between
20% and 50% 9% and 24% 20% and 50%
The value of shares awarded under the LTISP in any financial
year is subject to limits determined by the Remuneration
Committee from time to time. The current annual limit for awards
is 100% of base salary and the maximum awards during the
year were in line with this limit.
The current list of comparators is: 
Arla Foods Premier Foods
Associated British Foods Richmond Foods
Cadbury Schweppes Robert Wiseman Dairies
Devro Tate & Lyle
Glanbia Unilever
Greencore Uniq
Kerry FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment companies)
Northern Foods FTSE Food Producers & Processors Index
The constituents of the comparator group remained the same
for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 2005 except that in
July 2003 the FTSE Food Producers and Processors Index
replaced HP Bulmer and in February 2005 Premier Foods
replaced Big Food Group both following the delisting of these
companies. From 1 April 2005 Richmond Foods replaced Geest
in view of the expected delisting of that company. 
Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration
26 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2004
The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee of 
non-executive directors of the Company. During the year the
Committee consisted of Mr G E Grimstone (Chairman),
Mr H Mann, Mr P S Lewis and Mr S M D Oliver. Mr S M D Oliver
ceased to be a member of the Committee on 19 May 2005 but
will be invited to attend future meetings. Mr D J Dugdale and
Mr D H Richardson were appointed to the Committee on
19 May 2005. Members of the Remuneration Committee have
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships
and they are not involved in the day-to-day running of the
Company. The Remuneration Committee determines, within
remuneration principles agreed with the Board, the total
remuneration package of each executive director. It has
appointed Monks Partnership to provide advice on levels of
remuneration and Aon Consulting on pensions issues. Monks
Partnership is part of PwC who have also provided advice on
valuations of share based payments under International
Financial Reporting Standards and to the Yoplait Dairy Crest
joint venture. With the exception of this advice neither Monks
Partnership nor PwC provide any other consulting services.
The Chief Executive attends all meetings and provides advice
on matters other than those concerning himself.
Total remuneration
The total remuneration package, which is reviewed annually, 
is structured to attract, retain and motivate executive directors.
The total remuneration of executive directors consists of base
salary, bonus, pension benefits, selected benefits in kind and
share incentive and option arrangements. The Board intends to
introduce a guideline to encourage executive directors to build
up a personal shareholding in the Company’s shares.
• Base salary
Salary levels for executive directors are reviewed annually based
on an independent assessment of market practice. They are set
to reflect the pay levels of executives with similar responsibilities
in companies of comparable size and complexity.
• Bonus
As stated in last year’s report the maximum annual bonus
opportunity for all executive directors has been increased to
100% of annual salary from 2005/06. In 2004/05 the maximum
bonus opportunity was capped at 80% of annual salary.
Payment of the bonus is subject to the achievement of
demanding short-term financial targets agreed by the
Remuneration Committee. To ensure that an appropriate
balance is maintained between long-term and short-term
reward, from 2005/06 any bonus earned over 50% of annual
salary will be paid in the Company’s shares and deferred for a
three year period.
0197_DC_AR_2005_p22_39  31/5/05  9:39 am  Page 26 • Executive Share Option Scheme
The Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) was
established on 30 July 1996. Part A is approved by the Inland
Revenue and Part B is an unapproved scheme. Options are
granted to participants at prices determined by the
Remuneration Committee which may not be less than the
market price of the shares as derived from the London Stock
Exchange Daily Official List at the time of grant.
Up until 21 July 2002 the options could not be exercised unless
the Company’s adjusted earnings per share had increased over
a three year period by RPI plus 6%.
After that date the EPS performance condition was made more
demanding and ESOS options granted after 21 July 2002 will
now only vest:
(a) if after three years EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 9%,
(b) if condition (a) is not achieved, if after four years EPS growth
exceeds RPI growth by 12%,
(c) if condition (b) is not achieved, if after five years EPS growth
exceeds RPI growth by 15%.
Directors of the Company who are granted awards under the
LTISP are not granted additional share options under the ESOS
except in the case of promotion. Currently Mr P Thornton is the
only participant in ESOS subject to the original performance
criteria and Mr J W D Hall is the only participant in ESOS
subject to the new performance criteria. The LTISP and ESOS
were both established at flotation in July 1996 and permit
awards to be made thereunder for periods of 10 years from
their establishment. The Remuneration Committee will be
undertaking a review of market practise with regard to executive
share schemes with a view to recommending appropriate
replacements for the current arrangements in 2006.
• Sharesave Scheme 
The Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme was first established on 
30 July 1996 and there have been five grant phases since that
date. It is open to all eligible employees and full time directors.
Employees enter into an approved savings contract over a three
or five year term to make monthly contributions up to an overall
maximum of £250 per month. At the end of the term employees
have the right to buy ordinary shares in the Company at a price
fixed at the time of the option grant. The price at which the
options may be offered may not be less than 80% of the market
price at the time of option grant.
• Pension benefits
All executive directors are members of the Dairy Crest Group
Pension Fund which provides for a pension based upon an
executive’s final basic salary. No bonuses are pensionable.
Benefits are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap and
the following supplementary arrangements are in effect. 
Mr J W D Hall is party to a funded unapproved retirement benefit
scheme (‘FURB’). Under this defined contribution scheme an
amount of 42.7% of his salary is contributed by the Group to his
FURB. He is responsible for paying income tax and national
insurance contributions on the amounts paid to the FURB. 
Mr M Allen, Mr A S N Murray and Mr P Thornton receive a salary
supplement of 20% of base salary above the earnings cap which
is included in basic salary in the emoluments table on page 28. 
Changes in pension legislation will come into force on
6 April 2006. The Company and the trustee of the Dairy Crest
Group Pension Fund have agreed to retain a notional earnings
cap from this date. This will prevent the up-rating in accrued
and future benefits of executive directors who are subject to
the earnings cap. However it is intended to allow pension fund
members, including the executive directors, the flexibility
afforded under the new tax regime applicable from April 2006
and to amend the Fund rules to remove previous restrictions
from superseded tax regimes.
• Beneﬁts in kind 
These include the taxable value of company car benefits, life
assurance cover, company contributions to medical insurance
plans and relocation costs and allowances.
• Service contracts 
In accordance with best practice as set out in the Combined
Code, all executive directors have a notice period not exceeding
one year. All such directors’ service contracts provide explicitly
for termination payments in the event of termination by the
Company other than on grounds of incapacity or in
circumstances justifying summary termination. Payments on
termination are calculated, depending on the age of the director,
at 70–90% of the value of annual salary, benefits, pension and
bonus for the notice period. A summary of the service contracts
of the executive directors is available on the Company’s
website.
Details of the directors offering themselves for election and 
re-election at the forthcoming AGM are set out in the Directors’
report on page 33.
Remuneration of the Chairman and 
non-executive directors
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board
following a recommendation by the Chief Executive and the
chairman of the Remuneration Committee in consultation with
Monks Partnership. Other non-executive directors receive a
basic fee of £30,000 for their services plus a sum of between
£2,500 and £5,000 for the chairmanship of a Board Committee.
Their remuneration is determined by the Board, also in
consultation with Monks Partnership. The total fees for non-
executive directors remain within the limit set in the articles of
association. There are no pre-determined special provisions for
non-executive directors with regard to compensation in the
event of loss of office.

0197_DC_AR_2005_p22_39  2/6/05  10:29 am  Page 32 Directors’ report
The directors of Dairy Crest Group plc present their ninth annual
report and the audited financial statements for the year ended
31 March 2005. 
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Group is the manufacture and
trading of milk and dairy products.
Review of operations
The Group’s operations and future developments are dealt with
in the Chief Executive’s review, Operational review and Financial
review on pages 4 to 20.
Results and dividends
The consolidated profit and loss account is on page 35. The
profit for the year, after taxation, amounted to £47.7 million
(2004 – £35.2 million). The directors recommend a final dividend
of 14.3 pence per share which, together with the interim
dividend of 5.9 pence per share paid on 31 January 2005,
makes a total dividend for the year of 20.2 pence per share.
If approved, the dividend will be paid on 9 August 2005 to
shareholders on the register on 8 July 2005.
Fixed assets
Following the introduction of FRS 15 – Tangible Fixed Assets,
the Company followed the transitional provisions to retain the
existing book value of land and buildings. The directors have
obtained an informal valuation of the Group’s land and buildings
and believe that the current market value in existing use of these
properties slightly exceeds their book value.
Directors
A list of the directors at the end of the year together with a brief
biography is set out on page 21.
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association Mr G
E Grimstone and Mr J W D Hall retire by rotation and being
eligible seek re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting.
Mr P S Lewis also retires by rotation but will not seek re-
election.
Mr D H Richardson was appointed as a non-executive director
on 9 December 2004. As he was appointed during the year he
will retire at this year’s Annual General Meeting in accordance
with the articles of association and will seek election.
Details of the directors’ remuneration, service contracts (letters
of appointment in the case of the non-executive directors),
interests in shares, share options and long-term incentive share
plan awards are given in the Report of the Board on directors’
remuneration on pages 26 to 32.
Share capital
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company,
together with details of the shares issued during the year, are
shown in note 20 on page 48. On 23 May 2005, Aviva plc had
a material interest of 5.44% in the Company. No other person
has notified an interest in the ordinary shares of the Company
required to be disclosed to the Company in accordance with
Sections 198 to 202 of the Companies Act 1985.
Employee involvement
The importance of good communication is recognised by the
Company. There are also well-established consultation and
negotiating arrangements with recognised trade unions.
Employment of disabled persons
The Company considers applicants for posts compatible
with their disability. Staff who become disabled are retained
wherever practicable.
Charitable and political donations
Charitable donations amounted to £0.1 million (2004 –
£0.1 million) in the year. Small contributions, mainly of product,
were also made to local charities. No donations were made to
any political party.
Supplier payment policy
Payment dates are established according to the agreed date of
delivery of goods or provision of services and the receipt of a
correct invoice. The Group agrees the length of payment terms
with each of its suppliers as part of the overall purchasing
agreement. It is the Group’s policy to abide by these agreed
terms of payment. The number of days’ purchases in the Group’s
creditors at 31 March 2005 was 24 days (2004 – 24 days).
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue
as auditors of the Company. A resolution to reappoint Ernst &
Young LLP as the Company’s auditors will be put to the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Chartered
Accountants’ Hall, Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ on
Thursday 14 July 2005 at 11.00 am. Details of the resolutions
to be proposed, including items of special business, are given
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting and Explanatory Notes
which appear on pages 58 to 60.
The directors believe that the resolutions are in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole
and unanimously recommend that shareholders should vote
in favour of all resolutions.
By order of the Board

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
for the financial statements
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to
prepare financial statements for each financial year which give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and
of the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit
or loss of the Group for the financial year.
The directors consider that, in preparing the financial statements
on pages 35 to 54, the Company has used the going concern
concept and appropriate accounting policies, consistently
applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements
and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they
consider to be applicable have been followed.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Group
keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy the financial position of the Group and which enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
In adopting a going concern basis in the financial statements
the directors, after making enquiries, have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future.

38 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2005
1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable
accounting standards. The Group has adopted Urgent Issues
Task Force Abstract 38 – Accounting for ESOP trusts which
required the net book value of shares held by the Dairy Crest
Employees’ Share Ownership Plan (‘ESOP’) Trust to be
deducted from Shareholders’ Funds instead of being shown as
Fixed Assets-Investments. The comparative balance sheet and
reserves at 31 March 2004 have been restated to reflect
this adjustment. There is no impact on results for the current
or prior year.
2 Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of
Dairy Crest Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings drawn
up to 31 March each year and include the appropriate share
of the results and net assets of its joint ventures. Subsidiary
undertakings and joint ventures acquired during the year are
consolidated from the date of acquisition.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries
are translated into sterling at year end exchange rates. The
results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at
average rates of exchange for the year. Exchange differences
arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign
subsidiaries at year end exchange rates, less exchange
differences on borrowings which finance or provide a hedge
against those undertakings, are taken to reserves and are
reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
3 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 April 1998, comprising
the difference between the cost of shares or businesses
acquired and the fair value of the identifiable net assets at the
date of acquisition, is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset
and amortised through the profit and loss account over the
estimated useful life of the asset, not exceeding 20 years. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 April 2002 will normally
be amortised over 10 years. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 1998 has been
charged against the merger reserve and has not been reinstated
following the implementation of FRS 10. Goodwill is reviewed for
impairment at the end of the first full year following acquisition
and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary or business is disposed of, any goodwill arising
on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that
has not been amortised through the profit and loss account
is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale.
4 Turnover
Turnover represents the amount invoiced, net of VAT, for goods
and services supplied to customers.
5 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Interest
is capitalised on major capital projects during the period of
construction based on the Group’s average cost of borrowings.
6 Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of tangible fixed
assets, excluding freehold land, over their estimated useful lives
in equal annual instalments over the following periods:
Freehold buildings – 25 years
Leasehold land and buildings – 25 years or, if shorter, the
period of the lease
Plant and equipment – 4 to 20 years
Vehicles – 4 to 10 years
7 Government and other grants
Regional development and other grants received for the
purchase of fixed assets are included in creditors and
subsequently released to profit over the useful life of the
asset by equal instalments.
8 Leased assets
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in the
balance sheet at cost less depreciation. The net present value
of future lease rentals is included as a liability on the balance
sheet. The interest element of lease rentals is charged to the
profit and loss account in the year.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit
and loss account on the straight line basis.
9 Investments
Joint ventures are those in which the Group holds a long-term
interest and shares control under a contractual arrangement.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The Group’s share of joint ventures’ profits is included in the
consolidated profit and loss account and its share of their
attributable net assets is included in the Group balance sheet.
10 Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost (including attributable
production overheads) and net realisable value. Consumable
stores are valued at cost, net of provisions where appropriate.
0197_DC_AR_2005_p22_39  2/6/05  10:30 am  Page 38 11 Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised using the incremental liability
approach in respect of all timing differences that have originated
but have not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent to which
they are recoverable.
12 Pensions
The Group continues to use SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for
Pension Costs’ to account for pension costs and provides
the required disclosures under the transitional rules of FRS 17
‘Retirement Benefits’.
Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis in order
to spread the costs of providing retirement benefits evenly over
the service lives of the employees concerned. Any excess or
deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial
value of liabilities is allocated over the average remaining service
lives of current employees on an even percentage of payroll.
13 Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is written off
as incurred.
14 Foreign currencies
Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as
hedges when they relate to a foreign currency asset or liability
that is probable and which involves the same currency as the
hedged item. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the balance sheet date, or the forward rate where
hedged. Exchange rate differences are charged to the profit
and loss account.
15 Derivative instruments
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce
exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group also
uses interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposures. The
Group considers that its derivative instruments qualify for hedge
accounting when certain criteria are met as set out below:
Forward foreign currency contracts
The criteria for forward foreign currency contracts are that the
instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability
that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified,
it must involve the same currency as the hedged item and it
must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements
on the Group’s operations.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the
hedged item. As a result, gains and losses are offset against
the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial
assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to hedge
a committed or probable future transaction, are deferred until
the transaction occurs.
Interest rate swaps
The Group’s criteria for interest rate swaps are that the
instrument must be related to an asset or a liability and it
must change the character of the interest rate by converting
a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials are recognised by accruing the net interest
payable. Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or
shown in the Group’s balance sheet at the year end.

includes the closure of certain depots, acquisition of small infill dairy businesses and rationalisation of the ongoing household
operations. These rationalisation activities represent a fundamental part of the ongoing ordinary activities of the household
operations. Fees payable to Ernst & Young LLP for non-audit services mainly related to tax advice and project management
assistance on the Davidstow project and amount to £0.2 million (2004 – £0.2 million).

Operating exceptional items
Operating exceptional items in 2005 principally relate to the final commissioning of the creamery at Davidstow. Yoplait Dairy Crest
has announced the closure of its Enfield and Yeovil factories. Dairy Crest’s share of Yoplait Dairy Crest’s estimated closure costs
amounts to £4.3 million, representing redundancy costs of £2.2 million, write-downs in fixed assets and consumables of £1.2 million
and other rationalisation costs of £0.9 million.
During 2004 the investment and commissioning of the creamery at Davidstow resulted in exceptional costs of £3.6 million. These
costs principally related to fixed asset write-downs of £2.3 million, stock write-offs of £0.3 million and duplicate operating costs of
£1.0 million resulting from the operation of two facilities during the commissioning period.
In July 2003 Dairy Crest closed its butter and powder manufacturing facility at Chard which resulted in closure costs of £16.7 million.
These exceptional costs relate to fixed asset write-downs of £13.9 million, engineering stock write-offs of £0.4 million and
redundancy and other costs of £2.4 million.
The remaining balance in 2004 of £0.5 million relates to the integration of St Ivel Spreads.
Non-operating exceptional items
Profit on disposal of properties includes profits of £0.6 million on the disposal of the closed dairy sites net of the write-down of other
closed sites to their recoverable value. The share of joint venture’s profit on disposal of property relates to additional proceeds
received on a previously disposed site.

Earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2005 have been calculated on the basis of the profit for the year of  £47.2 million
(2004 – £34.4 million) and the weighted average number of shares in issue, totalling 123,424,537 (2004 – 122,624,171). 
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) and the Dairy Crest Qualifying Employee Share
Ownership Trust (‘QUEST’) are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings
per share in accordance with FRS 14.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the directors’ opinion reflects the underlying performance of the
business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share have been calculated as follows:

At 31 March 2005 the Dairy Crest Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) held 535,791 shares (2004 – 1,261,122 shares)
in the Company at a cost of £1.6 million (2004 – £3.8 million). The ESOP was established in August 1996 to purchase shares in the
Company in order to hedge certain future obligations of the Group including shares awarded under the LTISP and the ESOS. During
the year the Trustee of the ESOP issued 725,331 shares following exercises of LTISP options. The market value of the shares held by
the ESOP which are listed on the London Stock Exchange was £2.5 million at 31 March 2005 (2004 – £5.0 million).
Shares issued to the QUEST, which have not been issued to parties outside the Group, have been deducted from the profit and loss
account. Exercises of these shares are credited to the profit and loss account. The fair value of the options issued under the Dairy Crest
Sharesave Scheme in March 2002 was £2.0 million and the fair value of the options issued under LTISP in July 2002 was £0.6 million.

At 31 March 2005 the QUEST held no shares (2004 – 412,501 shares). All shares, including 850,389 shares subscribed for during 
the year, were transferred to employees and ex-employees exercising options under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme. The QUEST
was terminated in April 2005 and all future obligations to issue shares under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme will be satisfied by 
the issue of new shares by Dairy Crest Group plc.

28 Pensions
At 31 March 2005 permanent staff of Dairy Crest Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings were eligible for membership of the
Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund (‘the Dairy Crest Fund’).
The Dairy Crest Fund, which is of the defined benefits type, is funded by contributions from employees and the Group. The Group
has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
An actuarial assessment of the Dairy Crest Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2004 by the Fund’s actuary using the projected unit
method. The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the assessment were that, over the long term, the annual rate of return on
the investments of 7.2% would be 2.6% higher than the increase in pensionable pay and 4.3% higher than the annual increase in
present and future pensions in payment.
At the date of the assessment, the market value of the Dairy Crest Fund assets amounted to £451.9 million. The actuarial value of
the assets was sufficient to cover 107% of the value of the members’ accrued benefits representing an actuarial surplus of £30.0
million. The surplus is amortised over the service lives of Fund members (on average 11.2 years) as an even percentage of payroll
resulting in a credit to the profit and loss account of £2.7 million. The next actuarial valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2007.
The pension debtor at 31 March 2005 was £5.2 million (2004 – £5.3 million).
The Group has charged £0.2 million (2004 – £0.2 million) in respect of unfunded pensions for a director whose benefits are
restricted by Inland Revenue limits. Group contributions paid to the Dairy Crest Fund amounted to £7.0 million (2004 – £4.7 million).
FRS 17 was issued in November 2000. However, it is not mandatory until the financial year ending 31 March 2006. The Company
is required to adopt International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’) for the year ending 31 March 2006 and plans to move directly to the
equivalent standard under IAS. Under FRS 17 certain disclosures are required as to the potential impact on the balance sheet, profit
and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses as if this standard was adopted.
The calculation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 and updated
by Aon Consulting to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2004
and 31 March 2005. This update does not represent a formal valuation. Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the
respective balance sheet dates.

An explanation of the Group’s objectives and policies relating to financial instruments is set out in the Financial review on pages 19 to 20.
Financial instruments other than derivatives comprise cash, overdrafts and bank loans. Short–term debtors and creditors are excluded. 
The Group finances its operations through issued share capital, retained profit and bank loans. At 31 March 2005 the Group has available
facilities of £470 million, £350 million of which expires by June 2010 and £120 million which is fully utilised and expires by September 2007.
All bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
The Group has no financial assets, other than short-term debtors and cash at bank and in hand. Cash at bank and in hand is
predominantly denominated in sterling and earns interest at floating rates based on LIBOR.
Financial liabilities
After taking into account the interest rate contracts entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities was:

0197_DC_AR_2005_p40_54  2/6/05  10:31 am  Page 54 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Dairy Crest Group plc
We have audited the Group’s financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2005 which comprise the Consolidated profit
and loss account, Statement of Group total recognised gains
and losses, Balance sheets, Consolidated cash flow statement,
Accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 31. These
financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Report of the Board on directors’
remuneration that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and accounting standards as set out in the Statement of
directors’ responsibilities in relation to the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
part of the Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration to
be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Report of the Board on directors’
remuneration to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with
the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
FRC Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises the Directors’
report, unaudited part of the Report of the Board on directors’
remuneration, Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review,
Operational review, Financial review, Corporate governance
statement and Statement of the directors’ responsibilities. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and
the part of the Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the part of the
Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at 31 March
2005 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the financial statements and the part of the Report of the
Board on directors’ remuneration to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is also entitled
to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of
him/her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2. You may use the form of proxy enclosed with this Notice to appoint a
proxy to attend the meeting on your behalf. To be effective, the form of
proxy and any authority under which it is executed (or a certified copy of
such authority) must reach the offices of the Company’s registrar, Lloyds
TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West Sussex BN99 6LA not
less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. Completion
and return of the form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from
attending and voting in person at the meeting.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the
CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting
and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the
CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored
members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting
service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST
service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy
Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with
CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the information required for
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message,
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to an
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the
issuer’s agent (Lloyds TSB Registrars – ID 7RA01) by the time stated
above for the receipt of forms of proxy. For this purpose, the time of
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST
in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or
voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to
the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a
CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a
voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure
that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertified Securities
Regulations 2001.
3. In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those shareholders
appearing in the register of members as at 6.00pm on Tuesday 12 July
2005 (‘the specified time’) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the
meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at
that time. Changes to the register of members after the specified time
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend
or vote at the meeting.
4. Individuals will be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting only if their
own name appears on the share register or, where the shares are held in
a different trading or registration name, on production of written evidence
of their authority to act as that shareholder’s representative. A partnership
the name of which is entered in the register of members may, by any two
persons purporting to be partners in the partnership, authorise a person
to act as its representative at the meeting. A company or other institution
may by prior written authorisation confirm the appointment of a corporate
representative to attend the meeting on its behalf. Such a representative
shall be entitled to exercise the same rights as an individual member in
respect of the shares to which the authorisation relates. Any company or
partnership appointing a representative to attend the meeting is
requested to notify the Company’s registrar of such appointment in
writing not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. 
5. Only individual shareholders whose names appear on the register,
their proxies or representatives duly authorised in the above manner will
be permitted to attend and vote at the meeting.
6. The register of the interests of the directors’ and their families in the
ordinary shares of the Company and copies of the directors’ service
contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection by the
members at the registered office on any business day during normal
business hours until the date of the AGM and will also be available for
inspection at the AGM for at least 15 minutes before it commences.
Resolution 1
The directors of the Company have a duty to present to shareholders in
general meeting the annual accounts, together with the directors’ report
and the report of the auditors. The auditors’ report can be found on
page 55.
Resolution 2
As required by the Act, the Board has presented its Report of the Board
on directors’ remuneration to shareholders in the Annual Report, which
may be found on pages 26 to 32. This report gives details of the
directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2005 and sets out
the Company’s overall policy on directors’ remuneration.
As also required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,
the Company’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , have audited the relevant
parts of the Report of the Board on directors remuneration and their report
may be found on page 55.
The Board considers that appropriate executive remuneration plays
a vital part in helping to achieve the Company’s overall objectives.
In compliance with the Act, shareholders are invited to approve the
Report of the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Resolution 3
The directors recommend that a final dividend of 14.3 pence per share
be paid on 9 August 2005 to shareholders on the register on 8 July
2005. Payment of the final dividend will bring the total dividend for the
year ended 31 March 2005 to 20.2 pence per share.
Resolutions 4 and 5
The articles of association specify that up to one third of the directors
(other than the director covered by Resolution 6) must retire by rotation at
the Annual General Meeting. This year Mr G E Grimstone, Mr J W D Hall
and Mr P S Lewis retire by rotation. Mr G E Grimstone and Mr J W D Hall
are eligible for and seek re-election. Details of their biographies can be
found on page 21. Mr P S Lewis is not seeking re-election and will retire
from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.

60 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2005
Resolution 6
The articles of association also require that any director appointed by the
Board since the last Annual General Meeting must offer himself for election.
Mr D H Richardson has been appointed by the Board during the year and
being eligible offers himself for election by the shareholders. Details of his
biography can be found on page 21.
Resolution 7
This is a standard resolution proposing the reappointment of Ernst &
Young LLP as the Company’s auditors.
Resolution 8
At the Annual General Meeting held on 15 July 2004, shareholders
passed a resolution giving the directors authority, in accordance with
article 4(B) of the Company’s articles of association, to allot relevant
securities, within the meaning of Section 80 of the Act, in the amount of
£10,344,000. The Company proposes to renew this authority and the
section 80 amount referred to in Resolution 8 allows the directors to
allot relevant securities up to a nominal value of £10,415,000,
representing approximately 33% of the issued ordinary shares of the
Company as at 24 May 2005. The directors have no present intention of
exercising this authority other than to satisfy the exercise of options.
Resolution 9
The authority for the Company to make market purchases of its issued
share capital, granted last year, will expire at the close of the Annual
General Meeting. This resolution seeks renewal of that authority, again
limited to a maximum number of shares which amounts to approximately
10% of the Company’s current issued share capital. The authority has
not been used to date and would only be exercised if the directors
believed that a repurchase of shares would result in an increase in
earnings per share and would be in the best interests of shareholders as
a whole. Any shares repurchased under this authority may be held by the
Company as treasury shares.
Resolution 10
Article 147 of the articles of association currently allows the Company
to indemnify the directors and the company secretary against liability
incurred in defending civil or criminal proceedings in which judgement is
given in their favour or they are acquitted, and against the costs of
successfully applying for relief under the Act. Section 19 of the
Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004
(the ‘2004 Act’) amended the Act as of 6 April 2005 to permit
companies to indemnify officers (other than auditors) in respect of
liabilities (including legal costs) incurred by them in proceedings brought
against them by third parties.
This form of indemnity was previously prohibited under section 310 of
the Act. Amongst other things, the indemnity cannot cover: liability
incurred by a director to the Company or any associated company; fines
imposed in criminal proceedings and penalties imposed by regulatory
authorities; costs incurred in criminal proceedings where the director is
convicted; costs incurred in defending civil proceedings brought by the
Company or an associated company where judgement is given against
the director; or costs incurred in proceedings for relief where the court
refuses to grant relief. 
Companies are also permitted under the 2004 Act to provide their
directors with funds to cover the costs incurred by them in defending
legal proceedings brought against them. Previously, companies had only
been able to fund their directors’ defence costs once final judgment in
their favour had been reached. Directors are increasingly being added
as defendants in legal actions against companies, and litigation is often
very lengthy and expensive; the risk of directors being placed under
significant personal financial strain is increasing. The Board therefore 
believes that the provision of appropriate indemnities and the funding
of directors’ defence costs as they are incurred, as permitted by the
new legislation, is both reasonable protection for the directors and an
important means of ensuring that the Company continues to attract
and retain the highest calibre of directors.
The Board therefore proposes that the articles of association be
amended by adopting a new article 147 in place of the existing article
147. The new article 147 reflects the new provisions permitted under
the 2004 Act and deletes provisions reflecting the old statutory
provisions which are no longer relevant.
To ensure that the Board is able to exercise the discretionary power
to fund defence costs, the new article 147 provides that each of the
directors may vote and be counted in the quorum at any meeting
considering a proposal which falls within the provisions of the new
article 147(D), unless the director concerned is to receive a privilege
or benefit not generally available to, or awarded to, any other director.
(Individual directors of the Company would still be liable to repay their
defence costs, to the extent funded by the Company, if their defence
is unsuccessful.) The Company’s auditors are excluded from the
indemnity provisions of new article 147. 
Further information about this resolution is provided under ‘Directors’
indemnities’ on page 25.
Resolution 11
At the Annual General Meeting held on 15 July 2004 shareholders
passed a resolution giving the directors authority to disapply the
pre-emption requirements for allotments of equity securities for cash up
to £1,551,645. The Company proposes to renew this authority up to a
nominal value limit of £1,562,275 (being approximately 5% of the issued
share capital of the Company as at 24 May 2005). The authority has not
been used so far and the Board has no present intention of allotting any
shares in these restricted circumstances.
The directors believe that the resolutions are in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and
unanimously recommend that shareholders should vote in favour
of all resolutions.

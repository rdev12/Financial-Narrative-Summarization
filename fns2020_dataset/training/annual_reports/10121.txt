Chairman’s statement
Results
For the year ended 31st December 2006 Metalrax Group PLC
achieved a 16% increase in revenue at £120.2 million (2005:
£104.0 million).
Profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, was £6.5 million
(2005: £6.8 million), ahead of expectations and reflecting a
materially improved second half performance. Profit before tax
(including exceptional items) was £6.1 million, the same as in the
previous year.
Bank overdrafts and loans at 31 December 2006 stood at 
£9.9 million (31 December 2005: £2.7 million cash in hand). This
is expected to fall this year subject to the timing of property
disposals and from the expected improvement in profitability.
A year of transformation
The three operating divisions have been firmly established and are
reported as follows for the first time: Automotive, Engineering
Support Services and Housewares. We have relocated and
integrated Kenham Tools and Pressings to Bacol Industries and
Commercial Bearings to Metalrax (Bordesley Green). We have
added to the group through the acquisitions of Makespace
Mezzanine Floors, the Belsize Engineering Company and
Advanced Handling (including the Romanian facility). Welland
Engineering Supplies also moved to new premises at the end of
the year.
Whilst the profit for the year (excluding exceptional items) as a
whole is similar to 2005 it is important to note that after a very
poor first half in 2006 when profits fell, we have seen a much
improved second half of the year with reported profits of 
£4.7 million, well in excess of last year’s £3.2 million.
This illustrates the start of the planned recovery of the group and
supports our optimism for the future.
Further transformation in 2007
The major reorganisation of the group, which commenced with
the 2004 strategic review, will be complete by the end of 2007,
but there is still much work to be done.
The development of our Romanian facility is a key opportunity.
Surplus equipment from the UK has now arrived in Romania and
a £1 million refurbishment is nearing completion.
Production on the back of new orders is about to commence and
we expect further orders to flow. I hope to report at the Annual
General Meeting a highly successful opening that is due to take
place in early May.
Romania will also undertake about half of the business from the
Prescott Powell operation, the balance being reallocated within
the Automotive Division. This will release a further freehold
property in the UK for disposal.
As reported in the Trading Update issued in January, we carried
out a review of the George Wilkinson bakeware business in
conjunction with KPMG, as it continued to under perform relative
to its peak a few years ago. The business will be downsized onto
one half of its existing site and turned into a smaller more
profitable business through both cost reduction and the
elimination of unprofitable contracts.
Having merged the management of Cooper Coated Coil and
Fabricote, it is now time to reduce down from two coating lines
to one. This will require capital investment of some £1.6 million
and will deliver a reduction in costs, operating from a single site
with one of the most efficient lines in the world and with no
reduction in capacity. The environmental impact will be
significantly improved. Again a freehold property will be released
for sale.

Dividend
As indicated in our January Trading Update, the board is
recommending the payment of an unchanged final dividend of
3.75 pence per ordinary share to be made on 25th May 2007 to
shareholders on the register on 27th April 2007, subject to formal
approval at the Annual General Meeting on Wednesday, 
23rd May 2007. This, together with the interim dividend of 1.65
pence per share, makes an unchanged total dividend for the year
of 5.4 pence per ordinary share. 
The dividend policy reflects the board’s continued confidence in
the longer term outlook for the group and the level of cash that is
being realised from property disposals arising from the
reorganisation process. 
Board changes
As previously reported the board structure has undergone a
number of changes in the year. On 14th March 2006 four board
members relinquished their positions in order to form the nucleus
of the newly created operational board. Andy Pearson joined the
board as a non-executive director on 1st January 2006 and Bill
Kelly was appointed Group Finance Director on 14th March 2006.
After twelve years on the board, Reg Fort will be retiring after the
2007 Annual General Meeting in May. On behalf of board
colleagues past and present we thank him for his wise counsel
and wish him well in his retirement from the group.
Our People
2006 has been a year of significant change for the group, to
which I welcome our new joiners. On behalf of the board I wish
to thank all of our people for their valued hard work and
commitment to the group. They have again proved themselves to
be our greatest asset.
Pensions
I am pleased to report that as a result of initiatives instigated by
the board, there has been a substantial reduction in the net
deficit in the main Metalrax Scheme, from £5.8 million to 
£3.2 million.
Outlook and current trading
Metalrax remains on a robust financial footing. The group has
been faced by many challenges in recent years both internally and
externally generated, and as our peers will attest, common to all
involved in the global metal manufacturing market.
The signs are that the reorganisation work is beginning to bear
fruit and there are reasons to be optimistic about the future. The
cash being generated from property disposals now and in the
future strengthens the group financially during times of change
and also allows us to realise our growth aspirations by continuing
to consider selective acquisitions
We have had a satisfactory start to the current financial year in
line with our expectations for the year as a whole.

Chief Executive’s Review
The many changes that the group has embarked on are outlined
in the Chairman’s Statement.
Details of divisional operational performances for 2006 are as
follows:
Divisional structure
The three divisions — Automotive, Engineering Support Services
and Housewares — have been firmly established and recognised
in their markets. As part of the process each division has adopted
a new identity — the “MRX” prefix and logo — which is building
brand strength as it is rolled out further to our marketplace.
The Operational Board has been established with the Chief
Executives from each division, the Group Financial Controller
together with the two group executive directors. The operational
focus of this forum is another positive and significant change for
the Group.
MRX Automotive
Divisional revenue (including intra-group) increased by 15% to
£42.5 million. However, operating profits (before exceptional
items) fell to £2.2 million from £2.6 million as an initial
consequence of the acquisitions of the Romanian operation and
the Belsize Engineering business.
MRX Automotive is fortunate to participate in several niche
market sectors and, as a consequence, is not immediately
vulnerable to the pressures from major customers to manufacture
from a low cost economy in order to drive costs down. 
However, in March 2006 the Group made a significant strategic
step by acquiring a major facility in Romania. The twenty acre site
offers enormous potential for the future. A £1 million
refurbishment of part of the site is coming to completion and
following the transfer of surplus presses from the UK, production
is about to commence. Orders, never destined for the UK, have
already been won and customer reactions to date have fuelled
our optimism.
The Romanian acquisition included an existing business which in
the period produced a small loss. However, this was outweighed
by the fact that the acquisition was not greenfield, came with an
established English-speaking management team and an
experienced workforce.
Belsize Engineering was bought out of Administration in February
2006 to be merged into the division’s existing fine blanking
operation. However, purchasing the business out of
Administration has been more problematic than was envisaged at
the time.
The phased Belsize move was completed at the end of January
2007, and the freehold site that it occupied has been disposed of
in 2007. Full integration of the business is not expected to be
complete until the end of the second quarter. We now have one
of the largest fine blanking operations in Europe, one that is
potentially highly profitable for the future, in contrast to the
losses and significant exceptional costs incurred in 2006.

The relocation and merger of our two presswork businesses was
successfully completed in the second half of the year. The savings
resulting from moving to one site are already beginning to show
through and the vacated freehold property is on the market. The
combined enlarged business will also take up the new logo and is
now trading as “MRX Automotive”. Prospects for 2007 are good.
Of the remaining businesses in the division, both Toolspec and
Weston Body Hardware produced another year of consistent
profit generation.
At the interim stage we highlighted an unsatisfactory
performance from our diecasting operation. Whilst the rest of the
year fared much the same the prospects for 2007 do appear, at
present, a little brighter. However, in the longer term it remains
vulnerable to an inconsistent level of demand and movements in
the price of its prime raw material, zinc.
MRX Engineering Support Services
Divisional revenue (including intra-group) increased by 37% to
£54.2 million. However, operating profits (before exceptional
items) fell to £3.5 million from £3.8 million.
Metalrax (Bordesley Green), one of the founding businesses of the
group and a major profit contributor in recent years, suffered a
significant shortfall in profit in 2006. An overall reduction in
demand in the sector as a whole was exacerbated by three major
retail customers reducing their activity levels for varying corporate
reasons. The sector has been cyclical historically but there are
signs that 2007 should see a level of improvement.
The Commercial Bearings operation, which occupied part of the
Kenham site, was relocated into available space at Metalrax
(Bordesley Green) and had a satisfactory year.
Our coil coating businesses merged management teams during
the year in preparation for the consolidation of the businesses
onto just one coating line during 2007 as set out in the
Chairman’s Statement. Difficult market conditions resulted in a
drop in profits.
The acquisitions of Stackright Building Systems at the end of 2005
and Makespace Mezzanine Floors in February 2006 have bedded
in well. The relatively small Makespace had a record year,
exceeding expectations. Stackright is a business with great
potential. Profits were ahead of expectations and Stackright’s
presence in its market together with the strength of its
management team bode very well for the future.
The acquisition of Advance Handling, a manufacturer of materials
handling equipment, was most notable for it bringing the
Romanian facility into the group. It endured a difficult year due to
over dependence on a small number of customers. However,
work on product development has aroused interest from potential
new customers making the outlook for 2007 encouraging.

Both of our businesses involved in the construction/contracting
area endured difficult years. Premier Stairways, which had enjoyed
an excellent first full year in 2005, suffered from a combination of
factors. Despite an order book at record levels, problems getting
on to major sites were made worse by a series of troublesome
small contracts at the same time as the factory had reached
capacity. There has been a better start to the new year with
significant order levels and access to sites for major contracts now
being given.
Down & Francis, the steel fabricator, is involved in contracts of a
longer term nature. During 2006 a number of contracts which
commenced in 2005 incurred cost and time over runs absorbing
additional working capital. Management changes have been
made and whilst small, the profit contribution represents a
significant turnaround from the previous year’s losses.
Six of the businesses in the division have adopted the new MRX
brand and are sharing a new customer relationship management
(CRM) system to maximise the potential for cross-selling each
other’s products.
The “MRX Support Services” brand and CRM will offer architects
or project managers on particular construction projects a “one
stop shop” for cabins, structural steelwork, mezzanine floors,
staircases, atriums as well as storage. The initiative shows all the
signs of contributing to growth in 2007.
MRX Housewares
Divisional revenue (including intra-group) was 15% down at
£27.6 million with operating profits (before exceptional items) of
£1.3 million compared to £0.3 million the previous year. 2005
included the discontinued businesses of MRX Plastic Moulders and
Anotrim.
The division is dominated by the bakeware business of George
Wilkinson (Burnley) now known as GW International (“GW”). A
number of years ago GW contributed as much as 25% to
significantly higher Group profits overall. However, by 2005 the
business felt the full effect of cheap imports, particularly from
China, and the combined effect of supermarkets driving prices
down whilst at the same time raw material (steel) prices were
increasing. Although 2006’s performance was no worse than
2005, the Board, in conjunction with KPMG, instigated a profit
enhancement review to determine whether previous levels of
profitability were capable of being achieved again.
The Board has now initiated a plan to downsize GW into a
smaller more profitable business. It will vacate one half of the site
it currently occupies, significantly reduce costs including a
reduction of one-third of the workforce and eliminate low margin
contracts. Initial signs are encouraging.
Our catering supply business enjoyed a better year but operates in
a market again under attack from cheap imports. We have
determined to exit the small home accessories business and GS
Smart will be gradually run down during 2007 following the loss
of a major customer. This will release warehouse/factory space for
better use within the group.
Summary
2006 has been a year of transformation that has presented
challenges to our management teams throughout the group that
they have dealt with admirably. The group now has a secure
foundation on which to build for the future with a clear direction
for its growth.
The reorganisation will continue this year. We aim to transform
GW International into a stronger global player in the housewares
marketplace; further consolidation of our automotive operations
will contribute to expansion in Romania; and selected businesses
in our Engineering Support Services operation will become the
forerunners of the new public face of the group.
There will be significant developments ahead to accompany this
new image as we look forward to a future with many
opportunities for organic growth and selective, strategic
acquisitions.

Financial Review
Results summary
The results have been prepared under International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). 
Revenues for the year ended 31st December 2006 at £120.2
million were 15.6% higher than in the previous year, reflecting
contributions from the acquisitions in the year. At the time of the
interim report it was envisaged that the results for the year would
be broadly in line with 2005. This has been confirmed with profit
before taxation at £6.094 million compared to £6.067 million in
the previous year. Profits before exceptional items at £6.5 million
are slightly ahead of expectations. Further details of divisional
operational performances are set out in the Chief Executive’s
review.
Exceptional items
During the year the group incurred three major types of
exceptional items.
Reorganisation costs, including redundancies of £2,286,000, were
incurred principally from the protracted integration of the Belsize
acquisition into Bacol Fine Blanking, and to a lesser extent the
transfer of Kenham into Bacol Industries and Microwise into GW
International. Other redundancies which are not related to major
reorganisations have been charged in arriving at operating profits.
The acquisition of Advanced Handling in the UK brought with it
the Romanian operation. The revaluation of the Romanian
freehold site (20 acres) resulted in an overall excess of assets over
the amount paid of £852,000. Under IFRS this discount on
acquisition is taken directly to the income statement.
The sale of surplus properties produced a profit on sale of
£1,026,000.
As the group continues its transformation in 2007, exceptional
items will continue to be a feature of the reported results.
Further reorganisation costs will be incurred on completing the
Belsize integration, the downsizing of the GW International
bakeware business, the transfer of Prescott Powell to MRX
Automotive and Romania and finally the consolidation of the two
coil coating businesses, Cooper Coated Coil and Fabricote, onto
one site.
Following all of the reorganisations the group will now have up to
five freehold properties to dispose of including one held in current
assets. Two property disposals have been completed to date in
2007 raising £1 million in cash. The remaining properties will be
disposed of over the course of the next two financial years
depending on exactly when they are vacated.
Tax
The effective tax rate of 24.6% is lower than the standard rate of
30% due to property profits being relieved by capital losses and
indexation and the discount on acquisition incurring a deferred
tax charge at the Romanian rate of 16%.
Earnings per share (“EPS”) and dividends
Basic EPS were 3.83p per share compared to 3.68p in the
previous year, benefiting from a lower tax charge. The Directors
recommend that the final dividend be maintained at 3.75p per
share making an unchanged dividend for the year of 5.4p per
share. The required resolution to approve it will be put to the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Cash flow/capital investment
Bank overdrafts and loans at 31st December 2006 stood at 
£9.9 million compared to net funds of £2.7 million for the
previous year. The principal reasons for the movement into
borrowing was the continued investment in routine capital
expenditure for the group of some £3.2 million together with
£6.7 million spent on acquiring new businesses and a temporary
working capital outflow of approximately £3 million.
The group now has total unsecured banking facilities of 
£31 million.
Debt is expected to fall this year, subject to the timing of the
disposal of surplus properties and improved profitability.

Acquisitions
During the year the group made three acquisitions:
 13th January 2006 Makespace Mezzanine Floors Ltd.
 10th February 2006 the trade and assets of The Belsize
Engineering Company from the Administrator.
 16th March 2006 Advanced Handling Ltd (including its
Romanian subsidiary).
With deferred consideration and debt acquired, overall spending
on acquisitions was £6.7 million in the year.
Foreign exchange
The group currently transacts in both dollars and euros at a
modest level, and being principally based in the UK is less
exposed to currency fluctuations than many of its UK peers in the
engineering sector. Exposure to currency movements is managed
through limited amounts of forward buying.
During the year there were no material currency gains or losses.
Pensions
The group’s gross IAS 19 pension deficit has shown a significant
reduction at £3.2 million (2005: £5.8 million).
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new members over
seven years ago. Following an increase in member contribution
rates from 8% to 12% on 1st July 2006 the group introduced a
new defined contribution scheme as an alterative option for
members, resulting in a reduction in active membership. The
group is continuing to monitor the implications for future
contribution rates and has agreed to increase the company
contribution from 1st January 2007 from 25.9% to 30.0%, albeit
on a much reduced pensionable payroll.
During the year the group paid £929,000 in contributions
compared to a current service cost of £555,000. 
Net assets
The group’s net assets are shown in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2006 at £54 million.
A review of the value of the group’s freehold properties has
indicated that their market value is in excess of their book value
by approximately £11 million, potentially increasing net assets to
approximately £65 million, representing net assets per share of 
54 pence.
Restatement
As set out in the Interim Statement, the income statement for the
year ended 31st December 2005 has been restated. Having
reconsidered the amounts included within (loss)/profit from
discontinued operations it was concluded that these were not in
accordance with IFRS 5: “Non-current assets held for resale and
discontinued operations” as they are not considered to be
“separate major lines of business or geographical areas” and
were not “subsidiaries acquired and held for sale”.
Auditors
During the year Deloitte & Touche LLP were appointed as auditors
in place of Bentley Jennison. On behalf of the board I would like
to thank Bentley Jennison and its predecessor firms, for their
many years as auditors and for their assistance during that period.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
accounts.

Corporate and Social Responsibility
The board believes that the long-term future of the company is
best served by acknowledging the interests of all stakeholders,
our customers, members of staff, shareholders and the wider
community. The group is committed to its corporate social
responsibility activities and will continue to report on them. The
group continues to implement a range of policies which it is
intended will be posted on the group’s website.
 Ethics
The group insists that its business activities are conducted in
accordance with high standards. The ethics policy statement
provides a framework for achievement of those standards.
 Employees
Our employees are vital to the success of our business. 
All companies within the group carry out induction training to
address all general employment and policy issues. The degree
of detail varies from company to company to reflect the
nature of the individual company activities. For some
companies these are presented in the form of employment
handbooks. The group has published a code of conduct for
labour practices.
The group believes in equal opportunities and non-
discrimination.
We aim to treat people fairly. We welcome job applications
from all sections of the community and encourage our
employees to improve themselves. Existing employees are
considered for senior positions before those positions are
advertised externally.
The group complies with its obligations under the Disability
Discrimination Act. Whenever suitable vacancies arise and
appropriate qualified applicants are available, disabled people
are readily employed and provided with appropriate training
and support. In the event of a member of staff becoming
disabled, every effort is made to continue their employment,
with relevant retraining as necessary. All planning and
property modifications give consideration to disabled
personnel as appropriate. Working environments will be
adapted as required to accommodate disabled personnel.
The group recognises the crucial role training plays in
developing the knowledge and skills of employees. Training
policies and procedures are generally incorporated within
individual group company quality management systems and
many companies form strong links with local colleges and
training providers.
 Communication
Divisional group meetings are held regularly to share
information and to seek out mutual opportunities. The group
issues a newsletter at regular intervals to keep all employees
informed of developments and sales opportunities. Works
councils are currently being set up to disseminate information
to all levels. 
 Customers
Customer satisfaction is the key to business success. Quality
of product, delivery and service is paramount. The group
recognises the importance of formal quality management
systems and has a rolling programme for all companies to
achieve ISO 9001 or enhanced standards such as ISO/TS16949
for the automotive sector. 
 Suppliers
All group companies observe strict guidelines when sourcing
raw material or products. Suppliers of imported materials are
subject to additional controls regarding environmental and
employment aspects of the business. Where required the
group employs independent third party bodies to monitor
their activities.
 Environment
The group has a policy of respect for the environment. It
recognises the importance of the ISO 14001 environmental
management system and has several group companies
registered to the standard. Timber products are purchased
from protected renewable sources via the FSC scheme
wherever possible. The use of packaging materials is
monitored on an annual basis and overall use is being
reduced year on year due to the amount of recycling being
undertaken.
Certain manufacturing processes incorporate abatement
technology to ensure that emissions to atmosphere comply
with limits set by local authorities.
 Health and Safety
The group has recently published a revised Health and Safety
Policy Manual, which outlines the minimum standards
expected of all group companies. Similarly, a Vehicle Users
Handbook is supplied to all personnel using company vehicles. 
Further details of all of the above can be found on the
website.

Report of the Directors
The Directors present the audited accounts of the group for the
year ended 31st December 2006.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the group are split into three business
segments as follows:
 Automotive — precision manufacturing activities providing
supplies worldwide to automotive, telecommunications, off-
road vehicles, enclosure hardware and brewery bar display
markets.
 Engineering Support Services — provides surface coated
metals, architectural, primary and secondary steelwork,
mezzanine flooring and storage equipment and also
distribution of tools, fasteners and janitorial products.
 Housewares — produces and markets bakeware, together
with associated ranges of kitchen tools to both retail and
commercial markets in the UK and internationally.
During the year the group has expanded through a series of
acquisitions.
 On 13th January 2006 the entire issued share capital of
Makespace Mezzanine Floors Limited, a company
manufacturing lightweight mezzanine floors, for a cash
consideration (including costs) of £552,000.
 On 10th February 2006 the trade and assets of The Belsize
Engineering Company Limited, a fine blanking business, were
acquired from the Administrator for a cash consideration of
£2,124,000 (including costs).
 On 16th March 2006 the entire issued share capital of
Advanced Quality Solutions Limited was acquired together
with its principal subsidiaries Advanced Handling Limited, a
manufacturer of materials handling equipment, and Hidrosib
SA, based in Romania. The acquisition cost including costs
and deferred consideration amounted to £2,363,000.
With effect from 1st January 2006 the group reorganised its
internal structure so that the trade and assets of all trading
subsidiaries were hived up into one of three new divisional
holding companies, each one of which representing one of the
three business segments set out above, and reported on within
this annual report.
Business review
The company is required to set out in this report an enhanced
business review of the group for the year ended 31st December
2006 includes future developments. Information that fulfils this
requirement is set out in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 2
and 3, the review of the Chief Executive on pages 4 to 8, the
Financial Review on pages 10 and 11, and Corporate and Social
Responsibility on page 12, together with the further information
set out below.
 Key performance indicators
Key performance indicators used by the Group in monitoring
its performance are set out below:
2006 2005
Operating margin
Automotive 5.2% 7.2%
Engineering Support Services 6.4% 9.6%
Housewares 4.8% 0.1%
Return on net operating assets
Automotive 8.7% 12.7%
Engineering Support Services 13.5% 19.7%
Housewares 6.6% 1.4%
 Environment
The group is committed to a policy of complying with
environmental legislation, associated regulations,
authorisations or approved codes of practice. The group
recognises the importance of sustainable development, and
will embrace the following guiding principles:
 Take account of the views of all stakeholders.
 Embrace continual improvement methodology.
 Prevent unauthorised discharges to the environment and
will aim to minimise the polluting effects of their
commercial activities.
 Comply with conditions established by the enforcing
agencies.
 Develop an environmental management system that is
acceptable to the stakeholders. This may require customer
or third party approvals to a recognised scheme such as
EMAS or ISO14001.
13240METALRAX.qxd:Metalrax AR05  11/4/07  10:54  Page 16 Annual Report 2006 Metalrax Group PLC 17
13240 02/04/2007 Proof 9
 Source raw materials from responsible sources and apply
verification schemes such as FSC.
 Provide resources to achieve environmental goals.
 Minimise the use of raw materials and conserve energy.
 Reduce waste wherever possible.
 Co-operate with customers and suppliers to promote
environmental awareness at all levels within the supply
chain.
 Review performance and communicate findings to
stakeholders.
 Risk factors
Two of the group’s principal risk factors are the competitive
markets in which it operates and the price and availability of
its raw materials, in particular metal.
 Competitive markets
The group operates in highly competitive markets. It
needs to respond effectively to the demands of its
customers and the activities of its competitors. In doing
this the group needs to maintain a competitive cost base
as price competition, particularly from China and the Far
East, is a significant feature for the Automotive and
Housewares divisions. In a move to mitigate some of these
risks and to prepare for future growth, in 2006 the group
acquired a large manufacturing facility in a low cost
territory (Romania) initially to serve the automotive sector.
 Raw material prices
The group’s principal raw material is steel which is
purchased in numerous forms, sizes and quantities by
virtually all of its businesses. Market conditions may force
steel prices higher. Whether or not such input price
increases can be recovered could adversely impact on the
group’s results at any point in time.
Directors
The names of the present Directors are shown on pages 14 and
15. They all held office throughout the year except for A. P .
Pearson who was appointed Non-Executive Director on 
1st January 2006, and W. D. Kelly, who was appointed Group
Finance Director on 14th March 2006. Directors’ shareholdings
are disclosed in the directors remuneration report.
At the Annual General Meeting the Directors retiring by rotation
will be J. R. A. Crabtree, who has no service agreement, and 
R. E. Arbuthnot, who has a service agreement with a twelve
month notice period.
J. G. L. Edwards, G. H. Gresham, D. J. Farrimond and 
R. H. Brook-Carter relinquished their main board Directorships on
14th March 2006 in order to take their seats on the then newly
created operational board.

Report of the Directors continued
Fixed assets
The Directors are of the opinion that the market value of the
group’s freehold properties at 31st December 2006 was in excess
of their book value by approximately £11 million.
Payment of creditors
While not following any recognised code or standard, the group
policy on payment of all creditors is to abide by the terms of
payment agreed with relevant suppliers. At 31st December 2006
the trade creditors represented 65 days (2005: 61 days) in relation
to the average amounts invoiced by suppliers.
Charitable donations
Donations to charitable organisations consisted of £4,050 for
local charities, £2,100 for people with disabilities, £600 for
children, £500 for the elderly and £150 for animals.
Directors’ Statement as to disclosure of information to
auditors
The Directors who were members of the board at the time of
approving the Report of the Directors are listed on page 14.
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the company’s
auditors, each of these Directors confirms that:
 to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is
no information relevant to the preparation of their report of
which the company’s auditors are unaware, and
 each Director has taken all the steps a Director might
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of the
relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
The above is in accordance with the provisions of S.234 ZA of the
Companies Act 1985.
Auditors
During the year Deloitte & Touche LLP were appointed auditors in
place of Bentley Jennison.
Deloitte & Touche LLP are willing to continue in office as auditors
and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will be asked to approve as Special Business
(Resolutions 7 and 8) a new Executive Share Option Plan for
Directors and senior management, together with a Save as You
Earn Plan for all employees. Further details are set out in the
Chairman’s letter which accompanies this Annual Report.
The Directors feel it appropriate to reintroduce both plans, the
previous ones having lapsed, and to update them reflecting
current tax law and the latest guidelines for share incentive plans
published by the ABI on 7th December 2004.
The authority to allot unissued Ordinary shares was approved at
the Annual General Meeting held in 2005 and will expire on 
22nd May 2010. The Directors will be seeking approval (as
Resolution 9) for the annual renewal of the Directors’ authority to
allot shares for cash.
Shareholders will also be asked to approve as Special Business at
the Annual General Meeting a resolution authorising the Directors
to make market purchases of the company’s shares (Resolution
10). This has become routine business at the Annual General
Meeting of many public companies.
Whilst the Directors have no current intention to purchase any
Ordinary shares of the company, they consider it desirable to
obtain authorisation from the shareholders which would enable
them to act swiftly to make purchases if earnings per share would
thereby be increased and if they considered such action to be in
the best interests of the shareholders generally. The maximum
price which may be paid for each share is an amount equal to
105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an
Ordinary share of the company derived from the Stock Exchange
Daily Official List for each of the five business days immediately
preceding the day on which the Ordinary share is purchased. The
minimum price will be 5p. The power will be limited to
purchasing 11,989,730 shares being 10% of the total Ordinary
shares in issue at the date hereof and will expire at the next
Annual General Meeting of the company or, if earlier, fifteen
months after the resolution is passed.
Resolutions 7 and 8 are ordinary resolutions and resolutions 9 and
10 are special resolutions.
On behalf of the board

Corporate Governance
The company is committed to the principles of corporate
governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance that was issued in 2003 by the Financial Reporting
Council (‘the Code’) for which the board is accountable to
shareholders.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout the year ended 31st December 2006, the company
has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in
section 1 of the Code except for the balance of the board
between executive and non-executive Directors at the beginning
of the year. This was rectified with effect from 14th March 2006.
Application of the principles
The board has applied the principles in a manner which it
considers appropriate to the particular circumstances of Metalrax
Group PLC. The structure of the group is not complicated and the
activities are focused on manufacturing and product marketing.
Direction of the group emanates from a relatively compact head
office and the emphasis is on day-to-day contact between
executive Directors as well as formal board meetings. The non-
executive Directors, who are of independent mind, are appointed
to provide a balance at board meetings and to contribute their
knowledge and experience. The Group Finance Director, who is
also the company secretary, is responsible for providing all board
members with relevant monthly financial information. 
Composition of the board
The board currently includes four independent non-executive
Directors, being J. R. A. Crabtree who is also the Chairman of the
Nomination Committee, R. Fort who is the senior independent
non-executive Director and was Chairman of the Audit Committee,
and J. K. Adcock who is the Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee together with A. P . Pearson who was appointed on 
1st January 2006 and became Chairman of the Audit Committee
after the 2006 AGM. R. Fort will retire after the Annual General
Meeting in 2007 when JK Adcock will assume the role of 
senior independent non executive director. There are now just 
two executive Directors, R. E. Arbuthnot and W. D. Kelly who 
was appointed Group Finance Director and company secretary on 
14th March 2006. 
J. G. L. Edwards, G. H. Gresham, D. J. Farrimond and R. H. 
Brook-Carter relinquished their main board Directorships on 
14th March 2006 in order to take their seats on the newly created
operational board.
The Chairman, J. R. A. Crabtree, has primary responsibility for
running the board and devotes such time to his role as is necessary
to properly discharge his duties. He remains independent as he has
no executive duties. The chief executive, R. E. Arbuthnot, has
executive responsibility for delivering the group’s strategy and
achieving operational and financial goals. 
R. Fort has served on the board for twelve years. The Board
considered that R. Fort remained independent through his
knowledge of the group and contribution to board meeting
debate. He will retire from the board after the 2007 Annual
General Meeting. His place as Chairman of the Audit Committee
was taken by A. P . Pearson.
Operation of the board
The board meets at least five times per annum and convenes
additional meetings to consider matters that are time critical.
During 2006 the board met six times when all serving board
members were present except R Fort who attended five. Additional
meetings are held annually to consider and review strategy and
opportunities arising.
The board operates to oversee the group’s activities and as a
whole decides upon dividend policy, acquisition and disposal
strategy and authorises major capital expenditure and other
matters that affect the group as a whole.
The executive Directors review the day-to-day activities of the
subsidiaries, manage group finances, perform negotiations
regarding acquisitions and disposals, recruit Directors of
subsidiaries, and allocate resources to manage the risk
environment.
The non-executive Directors are responsible for, but not restricted
by, the duties as described in the terms of reference of the three
committees, namely the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration
Committee and the Audit Committee. Details of the terms of
reference for the committees can be found on the group website.
As required by the Code, the board conducts annual evaluation of
its own performance. The results of the process were analysed and
evaluated by the Chairman. The conclusion drawn from the process
was that the board had performed effectively. The board employed
a similar process to review the performance of each individual
committee. The board reached the conclusion that each board
committee had performed effectively. During the year the Chairman
met with the non-executive Directors without the executive
Directors being present.
The newly created operational board oversees the day-to-day
activities of the businesses and internal risk management is
delegated to the management teams. Management decisions
include the purchase of authorised capital expenditure, negotiating
contracts for sales and purchases, recruiting and controlling
employees as necessary to operate their respective companies. The
operational board meets at least four times a year.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by the board from the non-
executive Directors of the group. The Audit Committee’s terms of
reference include all matters indicated by the Combined Code. The
terms of reference are considered annually by the Audit Committee
and are then referred to the Board for approval.
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
 monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the
group and any formal announcements relating to the group’s
financial performance and reviewing significant financial
reporting judgements contained therein;
 reviewing the group’s internal financial controls and, unless
expressly addressed by the board itself, the group’s internal
control and risk management systems;
 making recommendations to the board, for a resolution to be
put to the shareholders for their approval in general meeting,
in relation to the appointment of the external auditors and
the approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement
of the external auditors;
 reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’
independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the
audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK
professional and regulatory requirements; and
 developing and implementing a policy on the engagement of
the external auditors to supply non-audit services, taking into
account relevant guidance regarding the provision of non-
audit services by the external audit firm.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the
board, identifying any matters in respect of which it considers
that action or improvement is needed, and make
recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
From 2003 until the 2006 AGM the Audit Committee has
comprised R. Fort, who chaired the committee, J. K. Adcock and
A. P . Pearson who joined the committee on his appointment on
1st January 2006 and became Chairman after the 2006 AGM.
Meetings are held at least two times a year. All members
attended the two meetings held in 2006. Other Directors may be
invited to attend and the Group Finance Director attended all
meetings held in 2006. The auditors attended two meetings
during 2006 and are also authorised to speak directly to any
board member whenever they wish.
During the year the committee instigated a process to appoint
new auditors. As a consequence Deloitte & Touche LLP were
appointed in place of Bentley Jennison.
Remuneration Committee
Since 2003 the Remuneration Committee has been made up of 
J. K. Adcock, who chairs the committee, R. Fort and J. R. A. Crabtree.
The committee meets whenever necessary and met as a whole two
times in 2006. The prime function of the committee is to establish
and review the terms and conditions for the executive Directors.
The Directors’ remuneration report on pages 21 and 24 shows how
the principles regarding Directors’ remuneration have been applied.
A. P . Pearson joined the Committee on his appointment.
Nomination Committee
The principal task of the committee is to ensure that the skills,
experience and age of the board is appropriate to the group’s
activities to ensure its future success.
J. R. A. Crabtree chaired the committee which then comprised R. E.
Arbuthnot, R. Fort, J. K. Adcock and A. P . Pearson throughout the year.
The Nomination Committee met in 2006 in respect of 
the appointment of W. D. Kelly and the consideration of board
succession. All members attended both meetings in 2006.
Internal control
The Directors have overall responsibility for the group’s system of
internal controls and at least annually review the effectiveness of all
controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and
risk management systems. The board confirms that the procedures
which accord with the Guidance for Directors in the Combined Code
have been in place for 2006 and up to the date of approval by the
board of the Directors’ report and accounts. They recognise that any
system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss. 
The operating businesses run as autonomous units, each with
responsibility for its own internal financial control. The group’s head
office, which provides the subsidiaries with back-up expertise
whenever needed, regularly monitors their activities. The directors
reviewed this function during the year and were satisfied that the
function largely fulfills the role of internal auditors. The group has a
comprehensive system of financial planning and reporting which
produces inter alia detailed monthly accounts for every business.
Major capital expenditure is subject to approval by the board. The
group’s treasury operations are conducted on a conservative basis
with a view to eliminating risk so far as possible. 
The group does not have a separate internal audit function. Each of
the businesses in the group receives regular visits from Group Finance
personnel, some visits may be monthly. A detailed review by the
Group Finance department of monthly accounts for each business is
regarded as sufficient to provide the board with reliable information.
The Board is satisfied there is no need to have a formal internal audit.
The Directors are mindful to keep this situation under regular review.

 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and
financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the
accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open
to them to safeguard the assets of the company and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditors’ independence
The non-audit work undertaken in the year by the group’ s previous
auditors, Bentley Jennison, involved the preparation of tax
computations for group companies controlled by a tax and advisory
partner, from information provided by the group. A connected
company of Bentley Jennison continues to provide administration
services to the group’s defined benefit pension scheme.
The group’s current auditors Deloitte & Touche LLP carried out a review
of the group’s interim statement and commenced corporation tax
compliance work.

“Whistleblowing”
Internal procedures are established to report grievances or
suspected inappropriate behaviour that may cause detriment to
other individuals or organisations. If it is not possible to deal with
the matter locally because of the nature of the behaviour, any
employee may email in confidence to the Group Chief Executive
at whistleblow@metalraxgroup.co.uk stating the nature and
location of the incident and this will be followed up appropriately.
The company will treat dishonest or spurious actions and
accusations seriously; this may result in disciplinary action in
accordance with company rules and disciplinary procedures. Any
employee raising any issue that proves to be genuine need have
no fear of any reprisals and the company will use its reasonable
endeavours to ensure this.
This statement appears on the group’s website.
Shareholder relations
Both Chairman and Chief Executive meet regularly with
institutional shareholders mainly in the periods following the
announcement of interim and final results but also at other times,
and the results of those meetings are communicated to the
Directors.
Communication with private and other shareholders is made both
formally and informally at the annual general meeting which is
usually attended by the full board.
Directors’ responsibilities for financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS regulation which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the
result for that period. International Accounting Standard 1
requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial
year the company’s financial position, financial performance and
cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects
of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with
the definition and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income
and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standard’s
Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements’. In preparing those financial statements
the Directors are also required to:

Directors’ Remuneration Report
13240 02/04/2007 Proof 9 13240 02/04/2007 Proof 9
The directors’ remuneration report covers all the Directors, both executive and non-executive. A resolution to approve the report will be
proposed at the company’s Annual General Meeting to be held on 23rd May 2007.
Remuneration Committee
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee (the committee) is to determine policy for the remuneration and terms of engagement of
the executive and non-executive Directors and senior executives of the company.
The committee comprises the non-executive Directors of the company. The members of the committee during the year were:
J. K. Adcock (Chairman)
J. R. A. Crabtree
R. Fort
A. P . Pearson
The committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the company. They have no conflicts of
interest arising from other responsibilities outside the company and are not involved in the day-to-day running of the company. They do
not participate in any bonus, share option or pension arrangements.
The committee operates under terms of reference available for inspection at the registered office or the company’s website. The terms
of reference and constitution of the committee comply with the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The committee met twice during the period under review and there was full attendance on both occasions.
Remuneration policy
Metalrax Group PLC (the group) operates in a highly competitive global environment. It is essential to recruit, retain, motivate and
reward executives with the capability of devising and delivering group strategy that will deliver a satisfactory financial performance for
all our stakeholders and shareholders over time.
The committee’s objective therefore is to provide levels of remuneration that are consistent with this objective. In doing so, it sets salary
levels which are appropriate for individual responsibilities having regard for the marketplace and sector generally and seeks to provide
incentives to achieve strategic and operational goals and growth in shareholder value.
To further strengthen the group’s ability to attract high calibre individuals at all levels across the group and to seek to engage all its
employees towards achieving growth in shareholder value, the company, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General
Meeting, aims to give opportunities and encouragement to all employees to build a shareholding in the company, through the 2007
Executive Share Option Scheme and 2007 Save As Your Earn Scheme.
Remuneration of executive Directors
The remuneration of executive Directors consists of the following elements:
(i) Salary
Salary is determined at the beginning of each year and when a Director has a change of responsibility. The committee takes
account of each Director’s performance in the light of its knowledge of rates of salary for similar responsibilities in other companies
and of pay levels elsewhere in the group.
(ii) Benefits in kind
These principally comprise benefits relating to the use of a vehicle, life assurance, membership of the group’s healthcare insurance
scheme and accident insurance. These benefits are not pensionable.
(iii) Annual bonus
Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme consisting of two parts. In the first part, bonuses are payable relative to
the achievement of agreed objectives which are typically strategic and operational. Bonuses of up to 10% of base salary are
payable relative to the individual’s degree of achievement. In the second part, bonuses are payable for increases in the group’s full
year pre-tax profit. To trigger a payment, group pre-tax profit must exceed that for the year ended 31st December 2004 and
thereafter exceed any subsequent higher year end figure. Bonuses are payable at 10% of base salary for each 1% increase in pre-
tax profit, half in cash and half for the purchase of shares in the company which will be held in trust for the executive for 10 years,
or until retirement if earlier. There were no awards under this second part in 2006.

13240 02/04/2007 Proof 9
(iv) Long term incentive plan (LTIP)*
The 2006 LTIP was approved at the Annual General meeting held on 23rd May 2006. Executive Directors and members of the
Operations Board may be granted options over the company’s ordinary shares for nil cost. The number of shares options granted
will be based on the annual salary of the executive and the increase in the group’s pre-tax profits. For each 1% increase in the
group’s pre-tax profits, the executive will receive an option over shares worth 10% of his annual salary. To ensure the executive’s
interests and those of our shareholders are aligned, an award is only made if group profit before tax exceeds that for 
31st December 2004 and subsequently the best group profit before tax in excess of 2004.
The Performance Targets to be achieved in order to exercise the options are assessed by comparing increases in earnings per share
of the group and the increases in the retail price index during a period of three consecutive financial years immediately following
and including the date the option is granted. For the target to be achieved and for the option to vest the increase in earnings per
share must be equal to or greater than the increase in RPI plus 6%.
No options have been granted under this scheme.
2007 Executive Share Option Plan*
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23rd May 2007, the 2007 Executive Share Option Plan will enable
the committee to also grant options, if it thinks fit, to any employee throughout the group (including executive Directors) to purchase
shares in the company at market value on the award date, subject to the achievement of Performance Targets. The Performance Targets
will require the increases in earnings per share of the group to exceed the increases in the retail price index during a period of three
consecutive financial years immediately following and including the date the option is granted. For the options to vest, the increase in
earnings per share must be equal to or greater than the increase in RPI plus 2% per annum.
2007 Sharesave Plan
The 2007 Sharesave Plan will, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 23rd May 2007, be open to all
employees (including executive Directors) who have completed six months’ continuous service. Under this plan the company can, if it
thinks fit, grant options at a price twenty per cent below the market price. Exercise of options under the Sharesave Plan are not subject
to any performance condition.

Annual General Meeting. They are not allowed to participate in share option schemes and are not eligible to join any of the group’s

Directors’ pension arrangements*
The executive section of the pension scheme, which since 2004 has applied only to the chief executive, provides inter alia a pension at
age 62 of two-thirds of final pensionable salary subject to completion of sufficient years of service. The pension entitlement for the other
Executive Directors who served during the year, with the exception of W. D. Kelly, is a pension at age 65 based upon 1/60th of
pensionable salary for each year’s service in the pension scheme. In accordance with group policy, pensionable salary does not include
any bonuses. If a member of the scheme dies while still in service the scheme provides life assurance cover of up to 4 times pensionable
salary and a widow’s pension.

We have audited the group and parent company financial statements
(the “financial statements”) of Metalrax Group PLC for the year ended
31st December 2006 which comprise the Consolidated income
statement, Consolidated statement of recognised income and expenses,
Consolidated balance sheet, Parent company balance sheet, Cash flow
statements and the related notes 1 to 32. These financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We
have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report
that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members, as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a
true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the Report of the Directors
is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the
Report of the Directors includes that specific information presented in the
Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, Financial review and
Corporate and Social responsibility statement that is cross-referred from the
Business Review section of the Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as
described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. 
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the group’s affairs as at 31st December 2006 and of its
profit for the year then ended;
 the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of
the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31st December 2006; 
 the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
 the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent
with the financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in the Accounting Policies statement to the group financial
statements, the group in addition to complying with its legal obligation
to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also
complied with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board.
In our opinion the group financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31st
December 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended.

Accounting policies
Year ended 31st December 2006
Metalrax Group PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The consolidated
financial statements of the company for the year ended 31st December 2006 comprise the company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “group”). The consolidated and parent company financial statements were authorised for
issuance on 4th April 2007.
The address of the registered office is given on page 13. The nature of the group’s operations and its principal activities are set out
in the Chief Executive’s Review on page 4, Report of the Directors on page 16, and note 2 on page 38.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in the accounting policies below.
Statement of compliance
Both the group and parent company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations adopted for use by the EU (“IFRS”). On publishing the
parent company financial statements here together with the group financial statements, the company is taking advantage of
the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that
form part of the approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and assets
classified as held for sale are held in fair value. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial
statements.
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power, directly or indirectly, to
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date
that control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments
issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current (or disposal groups) that are classified as
held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are
recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in
profit or loss.

Annual Report 2006 Metalrax Group PLC 34
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Sales of
goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Construction contracts
The Group undertakes long term contracts for construction projects as a sub-contractor. Where the outcome of a
construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of
the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for
work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the
stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have
been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably contract revenue is recognised to the extent of
contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in
which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is
recognised as an expense immediately.
Depreciation
Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment is charged to income statement so as to write off the cost or valuation of the
assets over the estimated useful lives after taking account of estimated residual values. Land is not depreciated.
The principal rates and methods of depreciation used are as follows:
 Freehold buildings, long leasehold property improvements and ground rents: 2% per annum on cost.
 Short leasehold property improvement: over the period of the lease
 Plant, fixtures and fittings and office equipment: 10–20% per annum on cost.
 Motor vehicles: 25% per annum on cost.
Leases
Leases in which the group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
These assets are included in the balance sheet and are depreciated accordingly. The capital element of the corresponding
financing commitments is included in the balance sheet.
Lease payments in respect of finance leases are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease.
Financing income and costs
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, and gains and losses on financial instruments that are recognised
in the Income Statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues.
Interest payable on borrowings includes a charge in respect of attributable transaction costs, which are recognised in the
income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. The interest expense component of
finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the implicit interest rate method.
Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable
income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Annual Report 2006 Metalrax Group PLC 35
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the
extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted on the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised.
Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged in providing products or services (business segment)
or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to
risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The group primarily analyses its activities based on class of business. Its operational activities are undertaken within UK and
accordingly the group’s operating activities are derived from only one geographical segment.
Impairments
The carrying amounts of all the group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is
recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement unless the asset is recorded at a revalued amount in which case it
is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate proportion of directly attributable
overheads.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as
separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of acquisitions since April 2004,
goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the group’s share of the net
identifiable assets acquired. In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost,
which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP .
At each balance sheet date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate any
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit
(CGU) to which the asset belongs. Any goodwill with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs
during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes
in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the
next three years and extrapolates cash flows to perpetuity excluding any growth.

Annual Report 2006 Metalrax Group PLC 36
Accounting policies continued
If the recoverable amount of goodwill is estimated to be less that its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses (see note 10).
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date that they are available for use. The group has identified intangible assets in respect of its
customer base. The values of these contracts are recognised as part of the net identifiable assets acquired, and are
amortised over the unexpired period of the contract, which is up to five years.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where appropriate,
overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge
its exposure to foreign currency arising from financing activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not
hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes; however, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Subsequent to each accounting period end, the instruments are
revalued to current fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount less impairment losses.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence
that the asset is impaired.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances with less than
three months maturity from the date of acquisition.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. Finance
charges are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Employee benefits
Pension Schemes
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the group’s
obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the
period in which they occur. They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income
and expense.
13240METALRAX.qxd:Metalrax AR05  11/4/07  10:54  Page 36 13240 02/04/2007 Proof 9
Annual Report 2006 Metalrax Group PLC 37
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on
a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset
resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in
future contributions to the scheme.
Share-based payment transactions
The group introduced a new bonus scheme and long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) for certain executives in 2006. To date no
awards have been made under these schemes. All previous share based schemes have now lapsed.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Significant judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, management have concluded that the two areas of significant
judgement and estimation uncertainty that has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements
are that of goodwill impairment and the recoverability of long term contracts.
Impairment of Goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the company to estimate the future cash flows expected
to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value. The carrying amount of
goodwill at the balance sheet date was £11,356,000. No impairment loss was recognised during 2006.
Long Term Contracts
The carrying value of both work in progress and amounts recoverable in contracts is carefully considered through an exercise
of estimating the final position on completion of those contracts. This includes making a judgement as to the success of any
claims, including those which may be subject to a legal process for recovery.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the
results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of
the company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statement of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the group’s foreign operations
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the
average exchange rates for the period.

As a consequence of the reorganisation of a number of businesses within the Group, costs have been incurred through
redundancies and relocation. The release of properties arising from the reorganisations has resulted in profits on disposal.
A discount on acquisition arose principally due to the revaluation of the freehold property within the Romania operation.

Proposed dividends
The Directors recommend that a final dividend of 3.75p per share be paid in accordance with a resolution to be proposed at 
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 May 2007. The final dividend amounts to £4,496,000 (2005: £4,496,000),
and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
9 Restatement
The income statement for the year ended 31 December 2005 has been restated. Having reconsidered the amounts included
within (loss)/profit from discontinued operations it was concluded that these were not in accordance with IFRS 5: “Non-
current assets held for resale and discontinued operations”as they are not considered to be “separate major lines of business
or geographical areas” and were not “subsidiaries acquired and held for sale”. The effect of the restatement, which does
not impact on net profit, is outlined below:

Goodwill impairment
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:
2006 2005
£’000 £’000
Automotive 141 —
Engineering Support Services 6,378 6,221
Housewares 4,837 4,837
11,356 11,058
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be
impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in
use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs
during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes
in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the
next three years and extrapolates cash flows to perpetuity excluding any growth.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprise beneficial contracts identified on acquisition of a subsidiary.

18 Borrowings (continued)
The other principal features of the group’s borrowings are as follows:
(i) The loan notes formed part of the consideration for the purchase of Stackright Building Systems Limited in 2005 and
only become payable if Stackright Building Systems Limited achieves its profit targets for the years ending 31st December
2006, 2007 and 2008.
(ii) Bank overdrafts accrue interest at 1% over base rates, are repayable on demand and are covered by cross-guarantees
within the group.
(iii) The group established a £15 million committed five year revolving multi-currency loan facility on 20th April 2006 which
carries interest at 0.6 per cent above LIBOR, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met. This loan is
covered by cross-guarantees within the group.
At 31st December 2006 the group had utilised £5 million of this facility which was taken out on 24th November 2006
for six months.
(iv) At 31st December 2006 and 2005 borrowings were in sterling except for £1,237,000 of bank overdrafts at

19 Pensions
Defined contribution plans
The group contributes to a number of defined contribution pension plans and the total cost charged to income for the year
was £257,000 (2005: £133,000) representing the contributions due to the plans for the year.
Defined benefit plans
The group operates defined benefit plans in the UK for qualifying employees, although these are closed to new entrants,
which provide benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the
group, being invested with insurance providers. The contributions are determined by independent qualified actuaries
employed by the insurance providers on the basis of triennial valuations using attained age funding method. The major
assumptions used by the actuary were:

25 Financial instruments
The following disclosures exclude short term debtors and creditors.
(a) Financial assets
Substantially all were sterling deposits, consisting of £nil (2005: £2,314,000) on interest-bearing accounts and £nil (2005:
£399,000) on which no interest was being received at the year end.
(b) Financial liabilities
All the group’s financial liabilities are disclosed in note 18 on page 46.
(c) Currency exposure
The group holds foreign currency in currency denominated accounts for normal trading purposes and enters into 
forward currency contracts in order to minimise the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Subsequent to each
accounting period end, the instruments are revalued to current fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement is
recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The Group did not have any open positions at 31st December 2006.
(d) Borrowing facilities
At 31st December 2006 the group had at its disposal bank overdraft and loan, unsecured, facilities amounting to £31 million.
(e) Credit risk
The group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there
is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the
cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties
and customers.

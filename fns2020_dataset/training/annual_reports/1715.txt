in vitro diagnostic products which 
have substantial global market 
potential by meeting current and

2001 Overview
2002 revenues were £47.0 million compared
to £42.8 million in the previous year, an
increase of 9.7%. Gross profit margins
increased to 54.4% from 51.0% in 2001,
generating £25.6 million. Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) and before research and
development (R&D) were £10.7 million,
compared to £9.0 million in 2001. Overall
R&D spend was up by £3.2 million, from £6.7
million to £9.9 million, an increase of 48.6%
over the previous year. After taking account
of amortisation of intangibles arising from
acquisitions and of interest received, the loss
before tax in the second half of the year was
£2.0 million, with the full year showing a loss
of £2.2 million (2001: loss of £0.4 million). This
loss is in line with our expectations and is a
result of our forecast increased R&D spend.
The increase in R&D expenditure reflects our
stated objective to achieve significant
penetration in the growing point-of-care
(PoC) market with our new COLIBRI platform.
Cash flow remains strong and our net funds
at the year end were £14.7 million compared
to £9.5 million at the end of 2001.
Our strategic goals are to identify and patent
novel markers in key areas of medical need,
to demonstrate their clinical utility,
particularly in primary healthcare and
disease management, and to offer test
formats suitable for our partners with global
instrument platforms and ultimately for our
own PoC portfolio. We anticipate that the
growing demand for near patient testing will
create significant opportunity in the PoC
sector, which is currently not dominated by
any of the major multinational IVD 
companies. Our existing PoC platform
(NycoCard) does not offer sufficient flexibility
for menu extension, particularly for our own
unique markers and is not formatted for
mass acceptance in the US market. The new
COLIBRI platform, due for launch in 2004, will
be suitable for use in the USA and will 
have the capability to run a wide variety 
of different tests, using both chemical and
immunoassay technology. This new system,
together with our already strong position 
in the PoC testing market and our unique
patent protected markers, will give us the
opportunity to become a major supplier of
products to this high growth segment. It 
will also afford an opportunity to firmly
brand the Axis-Shield name in point-of-
care diagnostics.
A key difference between Axis-Shield and
other emerging healthcare companies is the
strong cash flow from our existing profitable
operations which allows us to fund our R&D at
levels which are substantial compared with our
turnover, without depleting our cash reserves.
Where we see attractive opportunities to make
additional investment which we cannot fund
from our recurring revenues, we finance these
separately to avoid weakening our strong
Balance Sheet. It is for this reason we
successfully completed a share placing to 
raise £8.0 million (net) in April 2002 which has
provided the incremental finance we needed
to accelerate the exceptional opportunity for
COLIBRI in near patient testing.
Operating Highlights
Laboratory Division
Homocysteine remains our key value driver.
Sales have continued to increase, and in
2002, they amounted to £7.4 million,
compared to £6.3 million in 2001, an increase
of 18.1%. However, volumes increased
substantially by 57.5% to 6.3 million tests and
this is partly as a result of one of our major
customers, Abbott, promoting the tests on its
high throughput AxSYM system, rather than
the higher cost IMx platform. The number of
companies now marketing our assays has
increased, and this has expanded the total
available market for our products. The utility
of homocysteine as a general marker for a
number of different conditions is still being
developed and consequently we expect
further significant market growth over the
coming years. Our strong patent protection
for homocysteine testing covers virtually all
modern laboratory detection technologies,
which puts us in a strong position to benefit
from this market development.
The increasing awareness of homocysteine
has been aided by the volume of new
publications (950 in PubMed 2002). This
included several major publications,
particularly in the prediction of risk of
cardiovascular and neurodegenerative
disease. One of the most important of these
was the meta-analysis of 72 homocysteine
trials by David Wald et al in Southampton
and St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London,
published in the British Medical Journal in
November 2002, which concluded that a
raised homocysteine level was a cause of
heart disease. In February 2003, the 
2 Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Chairman’s Statement
2002 has been another positive year of
growth for Axis-Shield. The Company is
now recognised as a leading developer
and manufacturer of innovative in vitro
diagnostic (IVD) products, with the capability
to adapt them to run on major laboratory
analysers. We are also investing in novel
technology to meet the growing demand 
for rapid and effective testing at the 
point-of-care, facilitating earlier disease
diagnosis and better patient management.
Nigel Keen
Non-Executive Chairman Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
3
International Task Force for the Prevention of
Cardiovascular Disease published new
guidelines, which for the first time, included
measurement of homocysteine as one of its
recommendations.
We continue to forge strong OEM
relationships, primarily driven by demand 
for homocysteine testing. Agreements 
were signed with Dade Behring GmbH and
Instrumentation Laboratory Inc. during the
year for homocysteine assays on major
platforms marketed by these companies.
In September 2002, Bayer launched our
homocysteine technology on the ACS-180
and Centaur systems, and sales have been
promising, particularly on the higher
throughput Centaur platform.
There is growing clinical interest in our
patented marker for more effective detection
of vitamin B
12
deficiency, HoloTC. An Axis-Shield
sponsored symposium at the recent 
American Society of Haematology meeting 
in Philadelphia was attended by a capacity
audience of 300, and it concluded that better
methods of determining B
12
malabsorption,
particularly in the elderly, are urgently required.
The fact that we have now developed the
technology for an easy-to-use ELISA test for
HoloTC should significantly enhance sales
prospects and OEM partner interest.
Progress on automation of our assay for
Activated Factor XII continues to be made,
and we have invested in a further clinical trial
and assay validation programme at the
principal hospital in Stavanger, Norway to
accelerate the process.
Our mature autoimmune portfolio has been
significantly enhanced by the launch of our
anti-CCP test for early detection of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and its market
approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration. RA occurs in 1% of the world
adult population. Currently over 60 million
laboratory tests are performed annually to
diagnose this condition. The key to the
successful management of RA lies in early
diagnosis, especially with the recent
availability of new sophisticated drugs which
can arrest disease progression. Rheumatoid
Factor, the present test of choice for RA,
suffers from lack of specificity, and this means
there is a higher level of false positive results.
From the mounting published evidence, the
anti-CCP test from Axis-Shield meets the
need for a specific and sensitive marker for
detection of early RA.
During the year we removed a patent-
infringing competitor from the market for
our CDT test for alcohol abuse. Sales in 2002
increased by 21.7% to £1.7 million and we
continue to seek to develop a non-column
automatable assay for this marker in order to
further develop this market.
Point-of-care (PoC) Division
Sales for the PoC Division showed a small
increase to £16.5 million, compared to £16.0
million in 2001. This low level of growth
reflected the limited product range available
on our ageing NycoCard system, together
with a lower incidence of flu in 2002
affecting sales of our lead product, NycoCard
CRP . However, sales of NycoCard HbA1c, one
of our newer, proprietary tests which is used
to monitor long-term glucose control in
diabetics, were encouraging, at £2.4 million,
a 60% increase on 2001 sales.
Within the business, we have made
considerable progress in the development 
of our new point-of-care system, and 
we undertook a successful fundraising of 
£8.0 million (net) to accelerate its
commercialisation. The funds were primarily
directed towards the one-off costs of external
instrument and cartridge development and
capital investment in assembly lines. As
outlined in the half year statement, the focus
on the PoC programme has increased the
Company’s R&D actual and projected costs 
for 2002 through 2004. However, we anticipate
strong revenues from the PoC system post
launch, with significant impact on overall
profitability in the medium term.
The PoC COLIBRI project remains on schedule
for launch in 2004. A laboratory prototype 
has demonstrated that the challenging
performance targets we have set ourselves
are achievable. We have reached agreement
with partners for the production of the
instrument and cartridges to our exacting
specifications, and believe both organisations
will deliver on schedule. The COLIBRI platform
will offer full automation as well as provide
the opportunity for a wide menu of tests
including those for which we hold a
proprietary position. The concept is designed
to meet the US CLIA-waiver requirements,
with an ease-of-use allowing us to target the
doctor’s office, our principal point-of-care
market in the USA. We are confident that our
new system will meet market expectations
and achieve commercial success in a global
marketplace estimated to be worth in excess
of $4 billion, and that we will have a branded
platform which will allow us to offer our
patented tests at the point-of-care. 4 Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Chairman’s Statement continued
Direct Distribution
Our direct distribution division sells both
Axis-Shield and third party products,
through Medinor in the Nordic Region and
Axis-Shield UK in the United Kingdom.
Medinor successfully integrated Samarit
Engros AS, a regional Norwegian distributor
acquired in September 2002. This has
strengthened our coverage in the south west
of the country. Medinor continued to improve
its gross margin in Norway and expanded its
product portfolio in the other Nordic
countries. Business in Norway and Finland
saw increasing turnover and market share.
In the UK, the team has been very successful
with the distribution of near patient markers
and there is a constant focus on expanding
and replacing the product portfolio with
more competitive products.
Research and Development
The restructuring of R&D has worked well.
The laboratory and PoC operating units have
taken responsibility for their own near-
market projects and Erling Sundrehagen
heads up an exploratory research group to
develop longer term projects for the Group.
A number of patents have been filed and
several new projects are now in the pipeline.
Additionally, we are working on a number of
external projects with organisations such as
Abbott and Dade Behring.
We announced a further agreement with
Glasgow University in September 2002 which
secured rights to patents held by the
University relating to homocysteine
measurement. This strengthens our position
in non-chromatographic homocysteine
detection and should allow us to offer a
wider menu of assays to potential licensees.
Our relationship with OEM partners
continues to grow as a result of the high
quality of our products. We are developing
testosterone and brain natriuretic peptide
(BNP) AxSYM kits for Abbott. We believe the
BNP assay, which is planned for launch later
in 2003, is likely to be particularly successful,
as a result of the considerable interest in the
use of BNP to diagnose heart failure.
Communication
As part of our objective to keep the
investment community informed of the
scope and opportunities for our business, we
held our third annual analyst teach-in during
January 2003, this time in Oslo. The event
was successful and we see this as an
important means of communicating our
message going forward. We are also mindful
of the power of the internet to facilitate both
professional and lay education and have
therefore sponsored the creation of separate
websites, under independent editorial
control, at www.homocysteine.net and
www.HoloTC.net.
Outlook
In the next financial year, we look forward to
continued growth in the Laboratory division
as the utility of our patented markers such as
homocysteine, HoloTC and anti-CCP becomes
increasingly recognised. We expect to build
further OEM relationships and strengthen
existing ties as we seek to ensure our
proprietary markers are available on the
widest possible range of instrumentation
platforms commonly in use.
We will continue to develop our new PoC
system in readiness for launch in 2004. As our
core operations are profitable, we have the
resources to make the investment necessary 
to achieve our launch plan for the COLIBRI
platform. In vitro diagnostic testing is
becoming increasingly recognised as a major
factor in efficient primary healthcare and the
ability to produce results at the time of
patient consultation is seen as an important
factor in the optimisation of patient and
disease management. We expect Axis-Shield
to achieve substantial prominence in this
vital and expanding sector, and as revenues
grow from this investment and our other
businesses we aim to deliver significant
increasing shareholder value.

Chief Executive’s Report 
Introduction
I am pleased with the progress we achieved
in 2002, with generally good growth in all our
strategic business areas. We have recently
disclosed our plans for our new generation
point-of-care platform (code-name COLIBRI,
though this will not be its final brand name)
to potential partners and distributors, and we
have shown them a prototype display model.
The compact and elegant appearance has
impressed everyone and the proposed
performance characteristics and the menu of
markers appear to meet market needs. We
will also include our own proprietary markers
on this platform as their clinical utility
becomes accepted. This will be an important
element of the system as diagnostic testing
in general moves nearer the patient for more
efficient disease management.
Laboratory Diagnostics Division
The increasing utility of homocysteine and 
our strong patent protection covering virtually
all modern laboratory detection technology
continues to be reflected in growing demand
for our assays, aided during the year by several
major publications. We do not know the exact
number of scientific papers including
homocysteine that were published during
2002, but in the PubMed database alone 950
new publications are listed.
Major homocysteine studies published
include a report from O’Callaghan and
colleagues in Dublin showing multiplicative
risk of heart disease in smokers with raised
homocysteine levels and work from
Switzerland demonstrating improved
coronary blood flow when patient
homocysteine levels were reduced. Perhaps
the most significant publication was the
meta-analysis of 72 homocysteine trials by
David Wald et al in Southampton and St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, published
in the British Medical Journal in November
2002, which concluded a raised 
homocysteine level was a cause of heart
disease. The authors state that “a modest
lowering of homocysteine concentrations by
3mmol/l, achievable by increasing folic acid
intake, would reduce the risk of ischaemic
heart disease by 16%, deep vein thrombosis
by 25% and stroke by 24%” .
In February 2003, the International Task
Force for the Prevention of Cardiovascular
Disease published new guidelines which,
for the first time, listed homocysteine as 
an important emerging risk factor,
recommending its routine measurement 
in certain groups, including smokers, and
those with a family history of CHD. This
group of international experts believe that
the cut-off for blood homocysteine should
be 12mmol/l, in contrast to the widely held
view that 15mmol/l should be the threshold
for mild hyperhomocysteinaemia, but in line
with new recognition of the insidious effects
of only slightly elevated homocysteine over
time. The recommendations also include a
treatment algorithm to lower raised levels
below the danger value. This task force
report will influence national guidelines
issued in each country which again should
lead to increased homocysteine testing.
Nearly all the current focus on homocysteine
testing is related to cardiovascular disease.
However, in February 2002, The New England
Journal of Medicine included an article by
Seshadri and colleagues from Boston
University School of Medicine, describing
data from the renowned Framingham study
indicating raised homocysteine was a strong
independent risk factor for the development
of dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease. This
represents an additional substantial
potential market for homocysteine testing.
We have endeavoured to increase physician
awareness of the utility of homocysteine 
using various means of communication and
promotion and this has certainly resulted in
increased press interest. At the same time 
we have recognised the drive for self
maintenance of health, particularly in the
“worried well” , so we have sponsored the
development of a separate website for
homocysteine at www.homocysteine.net
The site is under independent editorial
control and is designed to update both
professional and lay users on the latest 
news and publications on this increasingly
important marker.
Homocysteine sales in 2002 reached £7.4
million representing around 6.3 million 
tests. Although the number of companies
now marketing our assays has increased,
there has been little price erosion and
cannibalisation, but rather an increase in the
total available market. We believe the utility
of homocysteine is being recognised and
expect further significant market growth
over the coming years.
The demand for homocysteine as a disease
marker and our comprehensive patent
protection has led to some attempts 
to develop competitor test systems.
However, we are ready to re-inforce 
our patent position in the courts if it
becomes necessary.
One of the factors associated with elevated
homocysteine is a deficiency of vitamin B
12
.
However it is now well recognised that
conventional testing for total B
12
levels will
often not detect deficiency of the vitamin,
particularly the insidious malabsorption 
seen in many elderly individuals. This is
because only 20% of vitamin B
12
is actually
biologically available. Scientists are now
recognising that measurement of this
available fraction, called holo-transcobalamin,
or HoloTC, is likely to provide a much better 
Axis-Shield is now recognised in our
industry as a modern successful company
with innovative and high quality products
and the ability to invent, develop and sell
unique solutions on both near patient
platforms and large high-throughput
laboratory systems.

Key Clinical Areas
Effective risk assessment, diagnosis and patient 
monitoring in key areas of medical need.
Cardiovascular disease
In cardiovascular disease,
Axis-Shield is involved with two
exciting potential risk markers
–Homocysteine and Activated 
Factor XII (AFT).
Neurodegenerative diseases 
The vast amount of clinical 
research into homocysteine 
has also expanded its utility into
neurodegenerative diseases such as
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
Autoimmune diseases 
The autoimmune basis of major
diseases such as diabetes, multiple
sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) is becoming increasingly
recognised. Axis-Shield’s new 
anti-CCP test is a real breakthrough
in the early identification of RA.
Alcohol-related disease
During the last few decades,
alcohol-related disease has
increased substantially and is
estimated that up to 10% of the
western total population is misusing
alcohol. The CDT test is of major
utility in the identification of
alcohol abuse.
Diabetes
Axis-Shield provides a patented
testing technology for
glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c),
a well established analyte for 
long-term evaluation of blood
sugar control.
Infectious disease
Axis-Shield’s biggest product,
NycoCard C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
is an important diagnostic tool,
enabling physicians to differentiate
between viral and bacterial
infections to decide whether 
or not to prescribe antibiotics.
Vitamin deficiency
Malabsorption of vitamin B
12
is a
real problem, particularly in the
elderly. Axis-Shield’s new HoloTC
test is achieving recognition as a
more definitive way of assessing
B
12
status. 8 Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Chief Executive’s Report continued
assessment of a patient’s B
12
status. Professor
David Smith and his group at Oxford
University have studied this area for 
many years and now believe around 
15% of the elderly may have metabolic B
12
deficiency. He considers insufficient B
12
leads to neuropathies, cognitive deficit and
depression, and that this is clinically very
significant, given that there are 150,000 
new cases of cognitive impairment
(dementia) each year in the UK alone.
Dementia is defined as the global
impairment of memory, intellect and
personality, and about 70% of dementia
cases are classified as Alzheimer’s disease.
The incidence of dementia doubles every 
five years over the age of 60, and it affects
about 6% of people over this age, with about
five million cases in Europe (1995). By 2030 it
is predicted there will be 110 million people
over 60 in Europe, and around 10 million 
will suffer from dementia. We believe that
our test for HoloTC will not only impact the
$85 million global B
12
market, initially as an
aid to the interpretation of conventional
total B
12
measurement, which often
produces indeterminate results, but also
become important in screening of the
elderly. The development of a separate
website has also been sponsored for this
marker at www.HoloTC.net. Homocysteine 
is now also showing utility in this area,
in addition to its relevance in CVD, and 
David Smith has shown that elevated
homocysteine in the normal elderly is
associated with lower cognitive scores and
thinner medial temporal lobes in the brain,
both classical precursors to dementia. We
look forward to continued evidence of the
usefulness of both homocysteine and
HoloTC in this major disease area.
Sales of our autoimmune product range
declined slightly during the year to 
£2.2 million against £2.4 million in 2001, a
decrease of 8.2%. As reported at the half year,
this is largely a consequence of our biggest
OEM customer acquiring an organisation
producing its own autoimmune test kits.
The introduction of our new test for
rheumatoid arthritis (detecting antibodies 
to cyclic citrullinated peptide, or anti-CCP),
with FDA marketing approval, should
produce increased revenues going forward.
Acceptance of this new assay has been 
very positive and the data being generated
confirm its superiority to the current test of
choice for rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid
factor, which is known to produce false
positive results.
Our test for alcohol abuse, %CDT, achieved
an increase of 21.7% on 2001 revenues, with
sales of £1.7 million. We believe the future
success of this product will be dependent on
the development of a non-column method
of detection, and we continue our efforts to
develop such a technology. First results 
from an ongoing US clinical trial from the
University of Wisconsin, examining how 
CDT might help to detect high risk drinking
in 799 primary care patients being treated
for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, have
shown that routine CDT testing will assist
clinicians in identifying patients who are
alcohol abusers, and to institute appropriate
treatment as soon as possible.
In August 2002, Sangui Biotech Inc agreed 
to stop selling a competitive CDT product,
which we believed infringed our patent.
COL1A1 is our genetic test for detection of
predisposition to osteoporosis and bone
fracture. The kit identifies a mutation in 
one of the genes governing the metabolism
of collagen, the building block of bone.
Progress in the USA has been delayed by the
need for an internal control for the US
market but this technical issue is nearing
resolution and we look forward to strong 
US demand for this assay, which represents
probably the strongest genetic link to
osteoporosis in the literature at this time.
Our infectious disease range is now
principally confined to syphilis OEM assays
as a result of our divestment of elements of
this non-core product area during 2001.
Point-of-care (PoC) Division
Sales for the Group as a whole showed
modest growth of 3.5% to £16.5 million.
This illustrates the need to build on our PoC
position and our current mature NycoCard
product range by the introduction of the
new COLIBRI system. Currently close to
10,000 NycoCard instruments have been
placed in more than 40 countries worldwide.
This strong market position will be
invaluable when we launch COLIBRI.
The COLIBRI project remains on schedule for
first phase launch in 2004. The development
programme has resulted in significant third
party development costs, relating
particularly to the engineering of the
instrument and cartridge.
This third party cost, which is additional to
our normal R&D spend, is estimated to be 
£6 million of which £2.4 million was paid in
2002, with slightly more expected for 2003.
All our R&D costs, including the COLIBRI 
R&D costs, are expensed in our Profit and
Loss account rather than being deferred.
This means that we have no capitalised 
R&D costs in our balance sheet.
Once the instrument and cartridge have
been developed, their manufacture will be
subcontracted; however, we will assemble
and fill the cartridges in-house, and of course

hard on delivering the new COLIBRI
platform for 2004, together with the
first wave of analytes. The sense of
excitement is palpable as we near
the launch of what will be a real
breakthrough in diagnosis at the
point of care.
Laboratory Division
Work continues in Oslo and Dundee
to launch our new markers and
improved methods of detection 
of existing analytes. The division 
is particularly concerned with
adapting our novel analytes to the
automated laboratories analyses of
the large global IVD companies. 10 Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Chief Executive’s Report continued
manufacture the reagents required. This will
involve special purpose-built filling lines,
a semi-automated version which will be
delivered Q4 2003 and installed for production
to begin Q1 2004. This line will have a capacity
of up to three million cartridges per annum.
The planned automated filling line will have 
a capacity of around 20 million cartridges 
and delivery is scheduled for Q4 2004, with
validation for production use by Q1 2005. The
cost of the filling equipment will be capitalised
and written off over its useful life.
Laboratory prototypes of the COLIBRI system
have demonstrated that it is possible to
achieve the ambitious performance targets
we believe are necessary for commercial
success. The platform will offer full
automation as well as provide a wide menu
of tests, including tests for which we hold a
proprietary position. The concept is designed
to meet the US CLIA-waiver requirements,
which will enable us to penetrate the total
point-of-care market segment in the US,
including the doctor’s office.
The system will represent a breakthrough in
the field of point-of-care testing and offers:
• a compact, reasonably priced
instrument platform
• a wide menu of tests 
• very low volume whole blood samples
• quick results (3-5 minutes for most tests)
• automation, walk-away system
• a flexible user interface
• data connectivity
We believe the platform will generate much
interest in point-of-care sites throughout
the world.
Direct Distribution
Our direct distribution units are
independent arms-length units that not only
focus on selling our in-house products but
also on achieving individual profitability.
An important aspect of this is the selling of
third party products. At present two thirds 
of revenues are derived from distribution
agreements for non Axis-Shield products,
and this is therefore an important part of 
the business of these units. As a result both
Medinor and Axis-Shield UK can offer their
customers total solutions and in addition
build important business relationships with
other companies in the market.
Sales in the Nordic countries through our
Medinor subsidiary increased by 11.4%,
from £18.5 million in 2001 to £20.6 million 
in 2002. Distributed third party products
in these countries constituted £13.9 million
of this total, up from £11.8 million in the
previous year. This increase was helped 
by the acquisition of the business of the
regional Norwegian distributor Samarit
Engros in September 2002.
In the UK, we achieved total sales of 
£2.0 million, compared to £1.5 million 
in 2001. This included £1.0 million in sales 
of distributed third party products.
Our Plasmatec subsidiary, selling largely 
low technology IVD products to developing
countries, increased sales by 6% to
£1.6 million (2001: £1.5 million), with
particularly promising business from
Middle East tenders.
R&D Activities
By the start of the new millennium, medical
science had mapped out the human 
genome, which encodes for body proteins
and protein variants. These proteins and
protein variants control body function,
steering conception, growth, maturation,
disease, and ultimately the decline and end
of every human life. The science of protein
expression of the genes is today often called
proteomics. Axis-Shield embarked on
research in this area in the mid-1980s, and
2002 was the most successful year for our
R&D in this field to date.
The COLIBRI project brings protein testing 
to the point of care. Automated testing of
panels of protein and protein variants with
high quality, high speed and appropriate
ease-of-use is not readily available in PoC
markets such as the doctor’s office. Axis-
Shield’s unique position in protein variant
testing was the driving force behind our
strategic move into this emerging area.
Two inventions have facilitated this. The
discovery of the vertical filtration gold
colloid technology made in the former
Nycomed Diagnostics Division (acquired by
Axis-Shield in 1999) and the invention of 
a camera-chip monitored micro-fluidics
system. Both are now key elements of the
COLIBRI system.
The COLIBRI platform will bring current
PoC products to the market in upgraded
formats and also allow menu extensions
with additional new markers. Axis-Shield
holds patent positions and has developed
technologies enabling us to offer tests 
for prostate specific antigen (PSA),
homocysteine, high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hsCRP) and other novel markers in
addition to markers already available at the
point of care.

Chief Executive’s Report continued
The breakthrough in our work to develop 
a specific HoloTc binder represents a
significant step for us – we anticipate that
we shall now need about two years before
market introduction of this non-radioactive
automatable immunoassay format.
During 2003 we will decide on which
instrument platform this product should
be launched initially.
Activated Factor Twelve (AFT) is a promising
marker for risk assessment in cardiovascular
disease. It has entered a new phase of
clinical research with a clinical trial in
Rogaland University Hospital in Stavanger 
in Norway, focusing on identifying the key
processes involving AFT in the development
of cardiovascular disease. Axis-Shield
commitment to AFT and its availability in
automated formats is unchanged, and we
expect to be able to report further progress
in this area during 2003.
Work on our marker for Carbohydrate
Deficient Transferrin (%CDT), used to
diagnose health-damaging alcohol
consumption, is focused on the creation of
an automated method which will enable us
to bring this marker out of highly specialised
laboratories to central routine labs and their
automated platforms. A new patent for this
technology was obtained in 2002 but so far
we have not been able to develop a working
prototype.
We continue to search for new markers of
cardiovascular disease. During the last five
years coronary heart disease has been
shown to have important inflammatory
components. Insufficient circulation of
blood leads to inflammation, and this is
often the first sign of disease. Axis-Shield
made discoveries in this area in 2002 and
filed a patent application involving testing
for impaired circulation, and has started 
to develop products for the management
of such disease.
Collaborations with our OEM partners on
new diagnostic products has always been 
a major part of our business. During 2002 
we worked with Dade-Behring and
Instrument Laboratories – two of the world’s
leading diagnostic companies – to develop
new homocysteine testing products to
increase our market penetration in this area.
We signed a new contract with Glasgow
University to strengthen our position in
homocysteine detection technology. With
Abbott Laboratories we are developing 
a product for measuring blood brain
natriuretic peptide (BNP), a new marker
for diagnosing pump failure in the heart,
and a kit for the detection of blood
testosterone.
Outlook
I believe that our unique combination 
of patented novel markers in key areas of
clinical need and our strategy of developing
a branded diagnostic system for the point 
of care represent a winning formula for 
the future prosperity of Axis-Shield. I also
consider that we have a strong management
team which will deliver our ambitious
objectives and by this time next year 
we will have seen further success with
homocysteine and our other laboratory
products, and that the COLIBRI platform 
will be close to launch. I look forward with
confidence to a challenging and profitable
future for our Company.

Financial Review
EBITDA before R & D increased by 
18.5% to £10.7 million.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation (EBITDA) before research
and development (R&D) have increased by
18.5%, from £9.0 million to £10.7 million.
R&D expenditure has increased substantially
to £9.9 million (2001: £6.7 million) including
expenditure of £5.4 million on our PoC
COLIBRI project, of which £2.4 million related
to external expenditure. EBITDA after this
increased R&D was £0.8 million (2001: £2.3
million). The continuing positive EBITDA was
achieved after a 48.6% increase in R&D
expenditure.
Cash Flow
The positive EBITDA also resulted in strong
cash flow from operations. In addition, in
April 2002, we raised £8.0 million in net
funds through the placing of 2.3 million
ordinary shares, to fund the non-recurring
expenditure associated with the
development of our new point-of-care
instrument platform. We also repaid the
vendor loan note, £0.9 million associated
with the acquisition of the point-of-care
Diagnostic Division from Nycomed in
February 2000. Taking these into account,
together with net interest received of £0.4
million (2001: £0.3 million), net capital
expenditure of £2.2 million (2001: £1.1
million), acquisition expenditure of £1.0
million (2001: £nil) and increased working
capital requirements, we have increased our
net funds by £5.3 million since 31 December
2001. At 31 December 2002, our net funds
position was £14.7 million.
Turnover 
Turnover increased by 9.7% to £47.0 million
(2001: £42.8 million). In the Laboratory
Division, revenues from homocysteine
continued to increase to £7.4 million 
(2001: £6.3 million). This 18.1% jump in
revenues reflects increasing demand for
homocysteine testing in the marketplace
with a 58% rise in end user tests during the
year. Sales increased by 21.7% to £1.7 million
(2001: £1.4 million) in our alcohol-related
disease marker, CDT, and the newly launched
Abbott thyroid markers Anti-Tg and TPO
contributed revenues of £1.1 million (2001:
£nil). In addition, our PoC Division returned a
small increase in sales to £16.5 million (2001:
£16.0 million). This was lower than expected
due mainly to lack of demand for the CRP
test, reflecting the lower incidence of flu in
Europe over the last year. Our infectious
disease and autoimmune ranges suffered a
slight decline in revenues due to increased
competition. Finally, we increased our Group
sales in Europe by 4.7%, in Rest of World by
7.2% and in North America by 36.1% where
sales were £9.4 million compared to £6.9
million in 2001.
Gross Margin
The gross margin increased significantly to
54.4% with a gross profit of £25.6 million
(2001: gross margin 51.0%; gross profit: £21.8
million). This increase reflects the efficiency
of higher volumes of products passing
through our production process and the
growth in the revenue stream from higher
margin products.
Research & Development
As predicted, we continued to invest heavily
in R&D and our spending in 2002 rose to
£9.9 million from £6.7 million the previous
year – an increase of 48.6%. R&D
expenditure comprises all development
costs, internal and external, of new projects
both in the Laboratory division and in the
PoC division. However, as a result of the
acceleration of the COLIBRI programme
within PoC, the majority of the increased

R&D spend for the full year was in this 
area. There were significant third party
development costs specifically relating to the
engineering of the instrument and cartridge.
All these costs were expensed to the profit
and loss account. The third party costs which
relate to COLIBRI instrumentation and
cartridge development and which are
additional to our normal R&D spend,
amounted to £2.4 million (2001:
£0.4 million).
Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses increased to 
£14.9 million (2001: £12.8 million).
Depreciation and amortisation of intangibles,
including goodwill, increased to £3.4 million
(2001: £3.1 million) and net interest received
increased from £0.3 million to £0.4 million,
leaving an increased loss before taxation of
£2.2 million compared to £0.4 million in 2001.
Balance Sheet
The Group’s fixed assets at 31 December 2002
were £24.5 million (2001: £21.8 million), which
consisted of tangible assets of £6.8 million,
intangible assets of £17.2 million and other
investments of £0.5 million (primarily relating
to our investment in A/C Diagnostics LLC).
The intangible assets principally relate to the
patents, trademarks and goodwill acquired
when the PoC division was purchased in
February 2000. Stocks and debtors have
increased to £9.4 million (2001: £7.5 million)
and £9.3 million (2001: £7.4 million)
respectively, while current creditors, which 
no longer include the Nycomed vendor loan
note, have increased to £10.0 million (2001:
£9.7 million). Cash increased to £14.8 million
(2001: £10.4 million) which includes the £8.0
million (net) raised by placing 2.3 million
ordinary shares. Our shareholders’ funds now
stand at £47.5 million (2001: £36.7 million).
Capital Structure
Axis-Shield plc has a simple capital structure
and the only borrowings within the Group
arise from assets acquired under hire
purchase finance. At the end of the year, the
Group’s cash balances were held by the banks
in the UK and Norway. The main exposure of
the Group to foreign currency transactions
lies in the US dollar income stream arising
from product sales and royalties. There is also
an exposure in terms of Scandinavian based
operations and net assets located there. The
net effect of the changes in currency
exchange rates during the year resulted in 
a net charge to the Profit & Loss Account 
of £474,000 (2001:£36,000). The profit on
translation of movements in the Balance
Sheet items together with the difference
between year end and average exchange
rates on the Profit & Loss Account has
resulted in a £4,977,000 credit being taken 
to reserves (2001: £64,000).

Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Remuneration Report
Introduction
All matters relating to executive remuneration are determined by the Compensation Committee, a sub-committee of the Board
of Directors. However, the directors believe that the concept of a unitary board is important, and hence include this report on
Executive Remuneration as an integral element of the overall Report and Accounts.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new
statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors’ remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the
Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial
statements will be approved. The Company has voluntarily adopted the same practice for the last three years.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee, which consists of the Chairman and the other three non-executive directors of the Company,
Gordon McAndrew, Tarald Glastad, and Erik Hornnaess, meets several times per year. As appropriate, the Committee may 
invite the Chief Executive Officer to participate in some of its discussions. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the
Committee. No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. The Committee is responsible for
determining the terms and conditions of employment of executive directors. It is also responsible for considering management
recommendations for remuneration and employment terms of the Company’s staff, including incentive arrangements for bonus
payments and grant of share options.
The Compensation Committee’s decisions are made on the basis of rewarding individuals for the nature of jobs they undertake
and their performance therein. Proper regard is given to the need to attract and retain high quality, well-motivated staff at all
levels, to the remuneration being paid by similar companies, and to the fact that as a Scottish-Norwegian organisation there are
additional factors to be taken into account. The Committee receives advice from independent remuneration consultants and
takes into account the remuneration paid by companies of similar size, by other companies in the life-sciences sector and by
other locally based companies. In 2002 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide advice on
structuring directors’ remuneration packages. New Bridge Consultants did not provide any other services to the Company
in 2002.
Details of Remuneration
The remuneration of directors is set out in detail in the table below. The Company’s Compensation Committee decides the
remuneration policy that applies to executive directors and the Group’s other senior management.
Each of the executive directors has a one-year rolling contract. In the event the Company is acquired all of the executive
directors’ contracts can be terminated in the following 12 months by the Company giving them not less than 24 months notice.
The most recent executed contracts for each executive director are as follows: Mr S W F Lien – 27 May 1999, Mr P M Garvey – 
6 May 2000, Mr E M H Sundrehagen – 18 May 1999 and Mr I D Gilham – 1 November 2001. In the event of termination the
executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pensionable service for the notice periods. The appointments
of non-executive directors of the Company are terminable with three months notice.
The Company’s policy is that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance
related. As described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments together with the benefits of participation
in Share Option Schemes.
Constituent Elements of Remuneration Package
In applying the above principles to the determination of executive director remuneration, the Compensation Committee gives
consideration to several components which together comprise the total remuneration package; these consist of the following:
• Basic Salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or
responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the position in the Group, personal and Company
performance and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparable group of companies.
Basic salaries were last reviewed in January 2003, with increases taking effect from 1 January 2003. The next review will take
place in January 2004. Executive directors’ contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for
inspection at the Annual General Meeting. Axis-Shield plc

Remuneration Report continued
• Annual Bonus is paid provided that objectives established by the Committee are met for each financial year. The objectives in
2002 included superior performance against budgeted group EBITDA and cash flow, the Company’s performance against the
FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index and progress against business development and research and development objectives. The
bonus payable was subject to a maximum of 50%. For 2003 the objectives are similar but have more emphasis on the areas
which each of the executive directors can directly influence. The bonus payment is subject to a maximum of 60%. An
additional special bonus, subject to a maximum of £35,000, is payable to the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lien, based upon
achievement of specific objectives. In 2002 these objectives related to research and development investment and additional
revenue generators. The objectives for 2003 are similar.
• Benefits in Kind which comprise company car and running costs, private healthcare and critical illness/death in service cover
and ex-patriate packages where appropriate.
• Pension Contribution. The Group operates a contracted-out defined contribution scheme for executive directors whereby
the Group contributes 12% of a director’s gross salary or, should the director so elect, the contributions can be made into a
director’s personal pension scheme. Under a flexible benefits policy, individual directors can forego other benefits in return for
equivalent increases in Company contribution. No pension contribution is payable on the annual bonus. During the year, four
of the directors had personal pensions to which the Company contributed.
• Share Options. The Group believes there is benefit to be gained from aligning executive directors’ interests (and other
employee interests) with those of shareholders by means of share options. Axis-Shield operates four option schemes - the
Approved Scheme, the Medium Term Share Option Scheme, the Matching Shares Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme – details
of which are given in the Directors’ Report. The award of options is wholly at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
Non-Executive Remuneration
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is agreed by the Group Board taking into account a number of factors
pertinent to their position and role as non-executive directors.

Share Options Granted to Directors
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved and an unapproved share option scheme to reward employees’
performance and to incentivise at all levels. Exercise is subject to performance conditions. For all options granted under the
Medium Term Scheme to date, the exercise criterion has been that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) must be positive for at least the two financial years immediately prior to exercise and EBITDA per share, once positive,
should achieve growth which exceeds the percentage growth in the Retail Price Index by 4% or more. In addition, the growth 
in the Company’s share price between date of grant and at least one day during the option period must put it in the top third 
of companies which comprise the All Share Health Index. The rules of the schemes conform to institutional investor guidelines
on dilution.
The performance criterion, which applies to all executive directors to whom options have been granted under the Scheme, was
chosen as it requires significant improvement in financial performance. Axis-Shield plc

Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company’s performance measured by the total shareholders return, compared with the
performance of the FTSE All Share Health Index and for 2002 only, the FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index, also measured by total
shareholder return. The FTSE All Share Health Index has been selected for this comparison because up until 2002 it provided the
best measure of performance of companies operating in the same sector as the Group. Since 2002 the Techmark Mediscience
Index provided a more appropriate measure of that performance. The FTSE Techmark Mediscience Index only commenced in
November 2001. Until we have five years of comparative performance for this index we will show performance against it and the
FTSE All Share Health Index.

Corporate Governance
The Combined Code
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and is accountable to shareholders for the good
governance of the affairs of the Group. In accordance with the combined code on Principles of Good Governance and Code of
Best Practice (“the Combined Code”) the Board must report to shareholders:
• how the principles of good governance set out in the Combined Code are applied; and
• that the Group complies with the best practice provisions set out in the Combined Code.
The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors, currently consisting of four executive directors and four non-executive directors, bring a wide range of
expertise and experience to the Board. The biographical details are shown on page 16.
The Board meets on a regular basis to discuss and agree matters which are specifically reserved to it for decision. There is also
frequent contact between meetings as is required to further the Group’s business. Specific powers and authorities are also
delegated to an Executive Management Group and to the various other Board Committees set out below.
All matters to be discussed at Board Meetings are formally advised to Board members in advance thereby ensuring that the
Board is properly informed to enable it to discharge its duties. Each of the directors has an important and personal input into
the forward strategy of the Company.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held separately.
The Chairman, Nigel Keen is responsible for the running of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, Svein Lien is responsible
for running the business and chairs the Executive Management Group.
Erik Hornnaess is the nominated senior independent non-executive director.
Board Balance
The Board comprises four executive and four non-executive directors.
All directors bring independent judgment to bear on matters of strategy, resources, performance and standards of conduct.
The Chairman ensures that Board discussions are conducted taking all views into account, so that no individual director or small
group of directors dominates proceedings.
Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive members of the Board comprise the whole of the Audit and the Compensation Committees. The Nomination
Committee includes a majority of non-executives directors. The Company’s non-executive directors have significant input to the
control environment, the corporate governance regime and the overall strategy of the business. The independent judgements
and assessments that the non-executive directors bring to the Board are considered by the Company to be a major strength.
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that actions proposed by the executive directors are
critically examined and thoroughly discussed. The Board considers that all of the non-executive directors are independent of
management and free from any business or other relationships which could materially interfere with the exercise of
independent judgement.
Directors’ Re-election and Appointment
Each of the executive and non-executive directors are required to stand for re-election at the first Annual General Meeting
following their appointment and thereafter at three yearly intervals.
Board Committees 
Compensation Committee
The Company’s Compensation Committee, consisting of Nigel Keen and the other non-executive directors of the Company,
namely: Gordon McAndrew, Erik Hornnaess and Tarald Glastad meets several times each year to discuss and agree the terms and
conditions of the contracts of employment of the executive directors and senior managers. It is also responsible for considering
management recommendations for remuneration (including incentive arrangements covering bonus payments and share option
grants) and employment terms of the Company’s staff.
The Report of the Remuneration Committee appears on pages 18 to 21 which gives details of each director’s remuneration and
includes further explanation as to how relevant principles of the Combined Code are applied and the extent to which relevant  Corporate Governance continued
Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
23
provisions are complied with. Furthermore, the Committee takes cognisance of location specific remuneration levels and those of
other life science companies of similar size, together with the requirement to attract, retain and motivate staff at all levels, when
determining remuneration policy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is agreed by the Board after taking into account factors pertinent to their
position and roles as non-executive directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of the Chairman of the Committee Gordon McAndrew, and the three other non-executive
directors, namely, Nigel Keen, Tarald Glastad and Erik Hornnaess.
The Committee meets as appropriate (but not less than twice a year) to:
• monitor and make recommendations on the relationship with the external auditors including the nature and scope of the
audit and any matters arising;
• review and consider the scope of the internal audit function;
• review the annual report and interim financial statement before submission to the Board, including a consideration of the
accounting policies adopted and any significant areas of judgement.
• monitor compliance with statutory and Financial Services Authority requirements for financial reporting; and
• monitor the system of internal control maintained by the Group to safeguard shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets.
Provision is made for the Committee to meet at least once a year with the external auditors in the absence of the Group’s
executive management.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of the Chairman of the Committee, Nigel Keen, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,
Svein Lien and the other non-executive directors, namely Gordon McAndrew, Tarald Glastad and Erik Hornnaess. The Nomination
Committee meets to approve the selection of new senior executives including executive director positions. A sub-group of the
Committee will involve themselves in the actual selection process.
Accountability and Audit
Financial Reporting
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the preparation of accounts and for the monitoring of systems of internal financial control.
The Board strives to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s position and its prospects and
endeavours to present scientific and other price sensitive information in a balanced way.
The Executive Management Group receives reports setting out key performance and risk indicators and considers possible
control issues brought to their attention by early warning mechanisms which are embedded within the operational units and
reinforced by risk awareness training. The Executive Management Group and the Audit Committee also receive regular reports
from the internal audit function in the UK which includes recommendations for improvement.
The Audit Committee’s role in this area is confined to a high-level review of the arrangements for internal financial control. The
Board’s agenda includes a regular item for consideration of risk and control and receives reports thereon from the executive
management group and the Audit Committee. The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance and not merely
reporting by exception.
Audit Committee and Auditors
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee examines the effectiveness of systems of internal control on a regular basis. Any
significant findings or identified risks are closely examined and are reported to the Board with recommendations for action.
The Audit Committee reviews the scope and results of the audit and non-audit services, the cost effectiveness and the
independence and objectivity of the auditors.
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks,
that it has been in place for the year ended 31 December 2002 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and 24 Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Corporate Governance continued
accounts, that it is regularly reviewed by the Board and that it accords with the internal control guidance for directors on the
Combined Code.
The Control Environment
The Board of Directors has established an appropriate control environment through the systems and procedures outlined above
and as follows:
• manuals of policies and procedures applicable to all aspects of the organisation, with procedures in place for reporting
weaknesses and for monitoring corrective action;
• a budgetary control system;
• the appointment of qualified experienced and professional staff of the necessary ability to fulfil their allotted responsibilities;
and
• a process of systematic internal auditing which covered UK operations.
As a result of these systems and procedures, the Board has reviewed the Group’s internal financial controls and considers them
to be effective.
Social, Environmental and Ethical Matters
The Board takes regular account of the significance of social, environmental and ethical (SEE) matters to the business of the Group.
The Board has identified and assessed the significant risks to the company’s short and long term value arising from SEE matters
as well as the opportunities to enhance value that may arise from an appropriate response.
In 2002, procedures for managing risks to short and long term value arising specifically from SEE matters have been integrated
into existing management structures and systems.
Our Environmental Policy Statement is summarised as follows:-
The prime objective of the Group is to provide customers with product that meets their requirements in terms of fitness for use,
delivery, reliability and value for money through both ISO9001 (2000) and ISO14001 (1996), in particular:-
• Axis-Shield is committed to the development and the sustainability of its business, whilst minimising any adverse impact of 
its operations on the environment.
• Axis-Shield will promote good practices to ensure that the organisation, as a minimum standard, will comply with all
regulatory and legislative requirements. Axis-Shield will also wherever possible work toward industry best practice in
environmental performance.
• Axis-Shield will endeavour to achieve continual improvement in environmental performance.
• Nominated personnel will be allocated resources to monitor and report directly to senior management on issues concerning
the environment. This nominated group will carry out regular reviews of procedures and trends, identify significant impacts
and set objectives and targets to effectively control waste and the consumption of materials, fuel and energy.
• Axis-Shield is committed to minimising adverse environmental effects and pollution associated with both present and future
business activities.
• Axis-Shield will promote, in its staff training programmes and notice boards, the implementation of good environmental
awareness and practices.
As a Group, which is part of the in vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing industry we provide test kits for hospital laboratories and clinics.
Most of our tests, which are conducted on human blood or urine samples, are immunoassays, involving the antibody-antigen
reaction, and use antibodies and other common reagents which have been around for many years and not subject to animal
testing. Our industry is not regulated like the pharmaceutical business and we do not have to undertake toxicology work
because our reagents do not come into contact with the body – in vitro is literally translated as “in glass” or in reality a test tube.
We are transparent in the way we operate and conduct our research and development. Our reagents are chemical or biological
and are normally off the shelf. Any material of potential concern is sourced from the highest quality manufacturers and handled
according to any relevant instructions or legislation. We do not conduct any animal experiments and the raising of antibodies is
undertaken out-of-house by specialist contractors. IVD regulations do not involve animal toxicology, and clinical trials are
performed on patient samples obtained through informed consent procedures. All blood samples received in-house are tested
for standard pathogens such as HIV, HTLV and hepatitis viruses. “Normal” samples are largely obtained through voluntary
donations in-house using a trained phlebotomist. In the validation of our assays we compare performance with an established
product or procedure on samples from patients with the disease in question and from normals without evidence of the disease,
working out sensitivity and specificity. All human biological materials used at our premises are treated as hazardous waste
which is collected regularly by specialist contractors. Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002

Corporate Governance continued
We have a Health and Safety Officer who undertakes regular audits and we are also inspected by the local HSE representative.
We also produce to the highest levels of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) as demanded by the FDA and the European IVD
Directive. Our premises allow manufacture to almost aseptic or sterile levels with positive pressure and high level air filtration and
airlocks/gowning in the key areas. Our safety records demonstrate that there have been no incidents of note since the inception of
the Company in the mid-80’s.
The Identification of Major Business Risks
The composition of the Board and of senior management is aimed at providing an appropriate range of knowledge, skill 
and experience in scientific, medical and commercial matters. Key risk areas are reviewed regularly by executive management
and the Board.
Information Systems
The information produced by the Company is designed to be sufficient and timely and allows management to monitor 
the actual performance of the Company relative to budget and other forward plans and to take decisions based thereon.
The Company will continue to invest to improve its information systems.
Financial Control Procedures
Control procedures take three broad forms:
• checks over individual transactions;
• checks over groups of transactions (e.g. reconciliations) and
• procedures to mitigate risk (e.g. insurance).
The Company has control procedures in place that cover each of the areas mentioned above and also has in place procedures to
monitor the effectiveness of each control procedure. The internal control systems have been designed to take account of the
Company’s particular needs including the needs of the market place and its customers; its current and prospective shareholder
base; the cultural and regulatory climate of the IVD industry; and the operation of an effective and efficient business.
Communication with Shareholders
The Company maintains an open policy of dialogue with all shareholders to ensure that the objectives of the Company are
understood. Institutional shareholders are regularly briefed on any current relevant matters and future developments.
The Company encourages communication with the large number of private investors which it has and endeavours to
communicate effectively through the publication of its comprehensive Annual Report and Accounts, an unaudited Interim
Report and various forms of written correspondence throughout the year. The Board seeks to encourage shareholders to attend
its Annual General Meeting. It uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private investors and encourages their
participation. As part of our objective to keep the investment community informed of the scope and opportunities for our
business,we held our third annual analyst teach-in during January 2003, this time in Oslo. In addition, the Company enables
shareholders and the general public to access all press releases and general information on the Company via its website,
www.axis-shield.com.
Statement of Compliance
Having considered the provisions of the Combined Code, the Board believes that the Company has complied with the best
practice provisions of the Combined Code.
Going Concern
The directors having made enquiries have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and that therefore it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Directors’ Report
Principal Activities
The Directors’ Report should be read in conjunction with the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Report and Financial Review
which contain details of the principal activities of the Group during the year and an indication of likely future developments.
Financial results and Dividend
The Group’s consolidated net loss for the year after taxation was £2.2m (2001: loss of £0.4m). The directors do not recommend
the payment of a dividend and therefore, the loss for the year has been transferred to the reserves.
For the figures included in the profit and loss account an exchange rate of 11.98 NOK = £1 was used which was the average
exchange rate during the year ended 31 December 2002 (2001: 12.99 NOK = £1). At 31 December 2002 the exchange rate was
11.20 NOK = £1 and this figure was used in the balance sheets (2001:13.05 NOK = £1).
Research and Development
The Group continues to invest in research and development. Details of expenditure on research and development are set out in 
Note 2 to the accounts.

Directors Authority to Allot Shares
By law, directors are not permitted to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) unless authorised to do so by
Shareholders. In addition, directors require the specific authority from Shareholders mentioned below before allotting new
shares (or granting rights over shares) for cash without first offering them to existing Shareholders in proportion to their
holdings. A resolution was passed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2002 renewing the directors’
authority, for the period until 20 May 2007; however, the directors consider it advantageous to adopt the practice of renewing
the authority each year. A resolution is proposed to authorise allotment of securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of
£4,713,494 which represents 27.75% of the issued share capital of the Company, and is in line with current best practice. The
general authority to allot shares will provide flexibility for the Company to take advantage of business opportunities as they
arise. The authority will expire on 14 May 2008.
Disapplication of Statutory Pre-emption Rights
At the Annual General Meeting held on 21 May 2002, the directors were empowered to allot new shares for cash without having
regard to the statutory rights of pre-emption. Resolution 10 empowers the directors to renew the power to allot new shares for cash
otherwise than pro-rata to existing shareholders. This power is limited to an aggregate nominal amount of £405,768 being 2.39% of
issued ordinary share capital of the Company. This authority will last until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting. 28 Axis-Shield plc

Employees
Axis-Shield recognises the contributions made by its employees to achieve corporate goals and objectives and is committed to
operating in a way that rewards and recognises the contributions made by its staff. In recent years many of the Group’s staff
have enjoyed the benefits of equity participation arrangements such as the first employee Sharesave Scheme which matured in
February 2000. A second batch of savings contracts under the Sharesave Scheme matured in 2001 and offers to participate in
further savings contracts under this scheme were made to our UK employees in March 2001. A Scandinavian Sharesave Scheme
was introduced for our Nordic employees in January 2001. Axis-Shield will continue to recognise the efforts of its employees to
achieve corporate and personal goals and objectives and is committed to ensuring that these benefits continue 
to be available to all of our employees.
The Group continues to maintain close attention to the wages and conditions of employment of all employees within the Group.
Axis-Shield is an equal opportunity employer committed to promoting equal opportunities in employment regardless of an
individual’s sex, marital status, creed, colour, race, ethnic origin or disability. It is the policy of the Group where practicably possible to
offer retraining and continued employment to employees who become disabled during their period of employment with the Group.
The Group operates in several locations and its employment policies are varied to meet local conditions and requirements but are
established on the basis of best practice. The importance of good communications and working relationships is recognised and the
Group’s policy is to keep employees informed on matters relating to their employment and the Group’s financial and business activities.
Creditor Payment Policy
The Group is committed to maintaining sound commercial relationships with all its suppliers. It is the policy of the Group to
negotiate and agree terms and conditions with its suppliers either directly or through its operating subsidiaries by applying
local best practices. The Group had 59 days’ purchases (2001: 52) outstanding at 31 December 2002 based on the average daily
amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Charitable and Political Contributions
The Group made £2,510 charitable donations in the year to 31 December 2002 (2001: £1,200). No political donations were made
(2001: £nil).
Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are required by UK company law to prepare accounts for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the results of the Group for the year.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently and reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates have been made in the preparation of the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2002. The
directors also confirm that applicable accounting standards have been followed and that the financial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records and for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of
the Company and the Group. They should use reasonable endeavours to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Axis-Shield plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes
that may have occurred to the accounts since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditors
Following the conversion of our auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers to a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) from 1 January 2003,
PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned on 27 February 2003 and the directors appointed their successor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ,
as auditors. A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members 
of Axis-Shield plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheet, the Cash Flow
Statement, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the related notes which have been prepared under the
historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out in the statement of accounting policies. We have also audited 
the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(“the auditable part”).
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ Remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only
the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Report, the Financial Review and the Corporate Governance Statement.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s or Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December 2002
and of the loss and cash flows of the group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting Policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies, which have been applied consistently is set out below.
A. Basis of Accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention. In accordance with the exemption
allowed by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not prepared its own Profit and Loss account.
B. Basis of Consolidation
(I) Subsidiary Companies
The consolidated accounts include the results of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries. In the period of
acquisition, the results of the company acquired are included from the effective date of acquisition. Intragroup sales 
and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
(II) Interests in Associated Undertakings
Interests in associated undertakings are accounted for by the equity method and are stated in the consolidated balance
sheet at the investing company’s share of their tangible net assets. The investing company’s share of the results of the
associated undertaking is included in the consolidated Profit and Loss account. These amounts are taken from 
co-terminous management accounts.
C. Turnover
Turnover represents the value of goods supplied and services rendered to external customers during the period and excludes
value-added tax.
D. Research and Development
Expenditure on new product development and commercialisation is written off as incurred.
E. Pension Costs
The Group operates pension schemes for the benefit of its UK and overseas employees. The cost of providing benefits under
defined benefit schemes is assessed by independent professionally qualified actuaries and is recognised on a systematic basis
over employees’ service lives. Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in the Profit and Loss
account when payable. Under the transitional arrangements permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ , the Group is required to
disclose the information contained in note 19, regarding the pension schemes and the figures that would have been disclosed
under FRS 17 in the Profit and Loss account and Balance Sheet had FRS 17 been fully implemented.
F. Fixed Assets
Depreciation is provided on all fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset
evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements – over the shorter of the lease term or useful life
Plant and machinery – 3 – 10 years
Fixtures and fittings – 5 years
Motor vehicles – 3 – 5 years
Leased assets – the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.
Provisions are made where necessary to reflect any impairment in value of fixed assets.
G. Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired. Purchased goodwill is eliminated by amortisation through the Profit and Loss account over a
period of 5 to 20 years. These are the periods over which the directors estimate that the values of the underlying businesses
acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
In years prior to 2000, goodwill arising on acquisitions, was written off to the Goodwill Reserve in the period of acquisition and
was amortised to the Profit and Loss account reserve over 20 years or its economic useful life, whichever was shorter. Following
the introduction of FRS 10, Goodwill previously carried in this Goodwill Reserve has been written off against the Profit and Loss
account reserve and will be taken to the Profit and Loss account on subsequent disposal of the related assets. 36 Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Accounting Policies continued
H. Intangibie Assets
Acquired research and development projects, patents and trademarks are capitalised. Patents are written off over the period for
which they are valid. Other intangible assets are written off over their expected useful lives through the Profit and Loss account
over a period of 5 to 12 years.
I. Financial Instruments
The Group enters into forward contracts for the purchase and/or sale of foreign currencies in order to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in currency rates.
The Group generally hedges foreign exchange transaction exposures up to one year forward. Hedges are put in place using
forward contracts at the time that the forecast exposure becomes reasonably certain. Gains and losses resulting from changes in
exchange rates on contracts designated as hedges of forecast foreign exchange transactions are deferred and included in the
measurement of the related foreign currency transaction in the period they occur.
J. Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
The financial statements of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance
sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the translation of opening balances are taken to reserves. The profits are
translated using the average exchange rate for the year and differences are taken to the Profit and Loss account reserve.
K. Grants
Capital grants received are treated as deferred income. A proportion is amortised to the Profit and Loss account annually so that
the grant is written off evenly over the expected useful life of the asset to which it relates. Grants of a revenue nature are
credited to income in the period to which they relate.
L. Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving items.
M. Leases and Hire Purchase Contracts
Operating lease rentals are expensed as incurred.
Assets acquired under hire purchase contracts are included in fixed assets and the capital element of the hire purchase contract
is included in creditors. Hire purchase repayments are allocated between capital and interest and the interest is charged to the
Profit and Loss account.
N. Deferred Taxation
The charge for ordinary taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account full provision for deferred tax, using the
approach set out in FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’ in respect of timing differences on a non discounted basis. The introduction of this
standard has had no impact on the results or net assets of the Group. Deferred tax assets are recognised in the financial
statements only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will crystallise in the immediate future. Axis-Shield plc

7. Loss per Ordinary Share
Loss per ordinary 35p share is calculated on the loss for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue
during the year 47,820,820 (2001: 46,232,875). The effect of the potential conversions of share options into ordinary shares is 
not reflected in the diluted loss per share calculation as it would not have been beneficial for holders of share options to have
converted those given the average market price of ordinary shares during the year. The weighted average number of shares 
in issue on this basis is 47,820,820 (2001: 46,233,361).

19. Pension Scheme Arrangements
Axis-Shield Diagnostics Limited, Medinor ASA, Axis-Shield ASA and Axis-Shield PoC AS operate pension schemes for their employees.
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 “Accounting for Pension Costs” and has continued
to account for the overseas pension schemes under Norwegian GAAP , as the directors do not consider there to be a significant
difference in the accounting treatment. The disclosures given in (a) below are those required under SSAP24. FRS 17 Retirement
Benefits was issued in November 2000 but will not be mandatory for the Group until the year ending 31 December 2005 at the
earliest. The additional disclosures required under the transitional arrangements are set out in (b) below.
a) SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs 
Defined Contribution Schemes
The assets of the Axis-Shield Diagnostics Limited Scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently
administered fund and contribution costs for the year are charged to the Profit and Loss account. The contributions for the year
amounted to £192,000 (2001: £148,000). Outstanding pension contributions for the year amounted to £Nil (2001: £ Nil)
Defined Benefit Schemes
The Axis-Shield ASA, Medinor ASA and Axis-Shield PoC AS schemes give the rights to defined future benefits. These are mainly
dependent on the number of earning years, salary level at pension age, and the amount of benefits from the National Insurance
Scheme. The commitments are covered through an insurance company and are compliant with the requirements of Norwegian
securities laws. Axis-Shield PoC AS also operates an insured pensions scheme. This includes an agreed early retirement scheme
which is part of the national wage negotiation. Pension costs relating to each scheme operating in the Nordic countries are
charged in accordance with Norwegian accounting standards. Formal valuations of each scheme have been carried out by 
Vesta Aktuartjenester AS, who are independent, professionally qualified actuaries, on 31 December 2002 using the following
assumptions:
2002 2001
Rate of increase in salaries 2.5% 2.5%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5% 2.5%
Discount rate 6.0% 6.0%
Inflation assumption 2.5% 2.5%
Contributions for the year for all the Nordic region pension schemes totalled £516,800 (2001: £486,000). Outstanding pension
contributions for the year amounted to £Nil (2001: £109,000).

In addition to the fees received by G G McAndrew in respect of his position as non-executive director, he received an additional
£5,368 (2001: Nil) for management consultancy during the year.
23. Acquisitions
On 1 September 2002 the Group’s wholly owned subsidiary, Medinor ASA, acquired the business and certain assets of Samarit
Engros AS (Samarit) for a total cash consideration of £968,000. The total adjustments required to the book values of the assets
and liabilities acquired in order to present the net assets at fair values in accordance with the group accounting policies was
(£64,000), details of which are set out below, together with the resultant goodwill arising. This purchase has been accounted for
as an acquisition.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2002 Samarit contributed £909,000 to turnover, and made an operating profit of
£46,000. Samarit contributed £36,000 to the Group’s net operating cash flows and paid £18,000 in respect of interest. There was
no capital expenditure between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2002.
For the year ended 31 December 2001 Samarit had attributable profits of £34,000.
For the period from 1 January 2002 to the date of acquisition Samarit financial statements show turnover of £1,898,000 and a
loss before taxation of £84,500.
The table below shows the effect of fair value and other adjustments on the balance sheet of Samarit at the date of acquisition.
The book value amounts are reported in accordance with UK accounting principles as stated in the accounting records of the
Company acquired.

24 Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprised borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. It is and has been throughout the year, the Group’s policy that
no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded where permitted by FRS 13.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency and interest rate risks. 50 Axis-Shield plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Notes to the Accounts continued
a) Foreign currency risk
At 31 December 2002, the Group had three significant overseas subsidiaries, Axis-Shield ASA, Medinor ASA, and Axis-Shield PoC
which operate in the Nordic Region and whose turnover and expenses are denominated in Norwegian Kroner, Swedish Kroner,
Danish Kroner and Finnish Mark. As a result, the Group’s Sterling balance sheet can be affected by the exchange rates ruling at
31 December. The Group also has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by an operating unit in
currencies other than the unit’s functional currency (defined as the net amount of trade and inter-company debtors less trade
and inter-company creditors).
The table below details the extent to which Group Companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their
local currency. Foreign exchange differences on retransalation of these balances are taken to the Profit and Loss account of
Group Companies and the Group.

b) Interest rate risk of financial liabilities
The Group does not have a formal policy to manage the exposures of financial liabilities but seeks to minimise levels of
borrowing and take advantage of fixed rates of interest where possible.
The interest rate risk profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2002 was as follows:

Financial Financial Total
Liabilities Liabilities Borrowings
Currency £000 £000 £000
Sterling – 65 65
Norwegian Kroner 887 – 887

All of the Group’s other creditors are excluded from the above table due to the exclusion of the short-term items.
The fixed rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates from approximately 10.15% to 10.29% (2001: 10.99% to 27.50%). These
rates are fixed for the remaining term of the agreements which expire in 2003.
c) Interest rate risk of financial assets
The Group places surplus funds on short term fixed rate deposits. The Group does not have a formal policy to manage the
exposures of these deposits to the movements in the interest rate. However, the Group does take advantage of the best
available rates to it while retaining flexibility for working capital needs.

e) Borrowing facilities
The Group has no borrowing facilities at year end.
f) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group does not consider there to be any material differences between the stated book value and the fair value of financial
assets and financial liabilities other than those disclosed in Note 24g.
g) Hedges
As explained in the Financial Review on pages 14 and 15, the Group’s policy is to hedge currency risk using forward foreign
currency contracts for foreign currency debtors and creditors.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet (unrecognised) gains and losses in respect of
financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year. It also shows the amount of such gains and losses
which have been included in the Profit and Loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be
included in the next year’s or later Profit and Loss accounts.
All the gains and losses on maturity of the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged
transactions or positions.

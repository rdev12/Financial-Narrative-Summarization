is on track
The seven step programme to improve cash returns, known 
as ‘Delivering Value’, is progressing well. The programme 
was mobilised during 2008/09, commenced in 2009/10 
and is due to complete by the end of January 201 1/12. The 
initiatives are supporting the trading performance in the 
shorter term and also better positioning the Group for its 
next stage of development. After two full years of the 
programme Kingfi sher is now a signifi cantly stronger, 
higher returning business.
The fi nancial year 201 1/12 will be another busy year as we 
complete the fi nal milestones for the Delivering Value phase 
and mobilise the activities that will drive the next phase of 
our development.

We have delivered another year of strong profi t growth 
and cash generation in what continue to be challenging 
times for our customers around the world. 
Our ‘Delivering Value’ programme of self-help has been 
a great success so far with profi ts almost doubled since it 
started, return on capital up sharply and fi nancial net debt 
eliminated. Despite signifi cant economic headwinds over 
the last few years we are now a stronger, more valuable 
business. I am also delighted that we are now better able 
to accelerate our expansion where economic returns have 
been proven whilst also signifi cantly increasing our 
dividend for our shareholders, many of whom are now 
our own colleagues. 
Looking ahead, although I see no let up in the challenging 
environment in the short-term, I am excited by our future 
prospects. This year we will be stepping up the pace once 
more with a full set of activities in the fi nal year of the fi rst 
phase of ‘Delivering Value’ as well as mobilising the 
second phase, which is due to start in 2012. I believe we 
have an exciting growth opportunity , sustainable over the 
longer term, by creating a business that is the world’s 
expert at making home improvement easier for customers. 
We are uniquely placed to use our scale, our network of 
international experience and our diversity for the benefi t 
of our customers and shareholders.

Chairman’ s statement
It has been another good year for Kingfi sher. 
Adjusted pre-tax profi ts were up 22.5% to 
£670 million, with growth achieved in all our 
major markets. The dividend was raised again, 
following the increase in the fi nal dividend last 
year and we have a strong balance sheet, with 
net cash standing at £14 million by the end of 
the fi nancial year. Given net debt stood at 
£1.6 billion only three years ago, this is a 
signifi cant achievement.
These results were achieved against an extremely difﬁ cult backdrop. The ongoing economic 
downturn continued to put consumer spending under pressure, as major Western economies, 
such as the UK, increased taxes and reduced spending. 
I believe that Kingﬁ sher’s key strengths have helped us withstand these economic headwinds. 
We have good geographic balance, with approximately 60% of sales and proﬁ ts coming from 
outside the UK. We have strong retail brands with a value heritage, which is vital in tougher 
times. And we have an experienced management team, led by Ian Cheshire, which has taken 
prompt and decisive action. 
We continued to make good progress with our seven step Delivering Value plan. More detail on 
the plan is provided in the ‘Conversation with the Executive Team’, but I would like to pick out a 
few highlights where our focus on ‘self-help’ has driven very good results. We delivered double 
digit proﬁ t growth in the UK and Ireland, France, Turkey and Spain, where our business 
was operating in a very difﬁ cult economy. Poland also increased proﬁ ts against a tough 
backdrop. And in China the losses were signiﬁ cantly reduced as our business there continues 
to improve. 
There is still more to come from the ﬁ rst phase of Delivering Value, which concludes in 2012, 
but I am excited about the next phase of our growth plan which we outlined in March. Our 
business has great potential and I believe the plan we have announced, which is covered in 
more detail on pages 10 and 11, will help us achieve it.
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 5.145p, up 43.9% on the ﬁ nal dividend in the 
previous year. This takes the full year dividend to 7.07p, a 28.5% increase on the prior year.
I am delighted to welcome two non-executives to the Board. Pascal Cagni is Vice President 
and General Manager of Apple Europe, Middle-East, India and Africa, and has been with Apple 
for 10 years in a variety of roles. His background will be of particular help as we develop our 
multichannel strategy. Clare Chapman is Director General of Workforce for the NHS and Social 
Care, where she is responsible for a workforce of more than two million people. She was 
previously Group HR director of Tesco and her experience in talent management and people 
development will be invaluable. Pascal and Clare will further enhance our board, which already 
includes directors with experience gained at Ikea, Carrefour and Cadbury, amongst others.
Finally, I would like to pay heartfelt thanks to our 80,000 staff around the world. It is their hard 
work and dedication that has made this year such a successful one.

A conversation with  
the executive team
Having transformed Kingfisher  
into a stronger business, we are now 
much better placed to accelerate our 
development and create a truly 
world-class leader in home 
improvement retailing.
Ian Cheshire 
Group Chief Executive
Q 
Delivering Value has worked, so what’s the next  
big idea?
A 
Yes it has gone well due to a relentless focus on our self-help 
initiatives rather than any help from our markets, which have all 
suffered in the global downturn one way or the other. So it’s a big thanks 
to an incredible effort by our 80,000 colleagues. But before I tell you 
about our next phase of development let me remind you that we still 
have a very busy year ahead of us to finish the Delivering Value 
programme.
Having transformed Kingfisher into a stronger business, we are now 
much better placed to accelerate our development and create a truly 
world-class leader in home improvement retailing. We operate in an 
attractive market which is ripe for faster growth but it will take real 
leadership to unlock it. We intend to be that leader, accelerating away 
from the pack by becoming the world’s expert at making home 
improvement easier for our customers. By introducing a core common 
range across Kingfisher for the first time, we will make better use of our

unrivalled scale to develop innovative new products that make home 
projects easier and more affordable. This will boost growth in our 
existing markets and enable us to expand faster and more efficiently  
into new territories at the right time. 
Q 
Kingfisher has been an international, scale player for 
years. So what’s different now?
A 
A good question. We have been big for a while but our 
‘conglomerate’ legacy has seen us operate for too long in 
country silos, re-inventing the wheel wherever we go and not fully 
capitalising on our scale and diversity. That said, a lot has changed  
in recent years and we now have a much more unified and aligned 
leadership team, and a fast-developing new approach to cross-Group 
working. Internally we call this the ‘One Team’ culture, a network of 
colleagues working across countries and businesses. Our unique asset 
is our international diversity and expertise, and we are now beginning  
to really leverage it. Today you will see great products selling under our 
Group-wide own brand names in multi-lingual packaging – the result  
of buyers networking as one team. This is just the beginning; I am very 
excited about how much scope we have. 
Philippe Tible 
CEO, Kingfisher France
Q 
The French business is clearly outperforming, what’s  
the secret?
A 
Good retailing is no secret but it’s very hard to do consistently 
well. We have been working very hard for some years now to  
re-position ourselves as the true leader in France, not just by size for 
size’s sake, but the leader for customers. We have modernised our stores 
and introduced innovative own brand products designed to make home 
improvement simpler and easier to do. This is now paying dividends and 
we are growing ahead of the market, especially at Castorama where 
these initiatives are further advanced.
Q 
With 203 stores, is this the end of the road for growth 
in France?
A 
Not at all, I can see plenty of opportunity to add more store 
space in France, whether that’s through extending or relocating 
existing Castorama stores, or adding new Castorama and Brico Dépôt 
stores in regions where we still have a limited presence. I believe we are 
only about 80% of the way through our space expansion programme 
but the last 20% will take quite a long time to deliver organically. So  
we are keeping a good look-out for opportunities to accelerate.
Euan Sutherland 
CEO Kingfisher UK & Ireland
Q 
Great job on profits, but sales densities are still low.  
 Do we need a booming economy to see LFL sales  
growth in the UK?
A 
No we don’t, but we’ve clearly been battling a strong headwind in 
recent years and our market is smaller today than it was in 2004, 
the height of the last home improvement boom. B&Q is a great British 
retail brand but you can never sit still in retail and so we have done a lot 
over the last few years to keep raising our game. Our stores are more 
modern, our operating standards are now much sharper and consistent, 
and we have trained 21,000 colleagues in product knowledge to 
improve our service in store. We do a great job for our ‘everyday DIYer’ 
customer and have really improved our offer for the ‘do it for me’ 
customer. This year we introduced a whole new concept, TradePoint, 
into B&Q stores, which vastly improves our offer for our ‘trade 
professional’ customers. We have also recently launched a new 
customer promise of ‘making it easier’ to improve your home and this is 
where I think we can really differentiate ourselves and grow our market 
share. To this end I recruited Véronique Laury who led the successful 
product development programme at Castorama in France, to be our 
new commercial director. I also recruited Katherine Paterson, previously 
the marketing director of ASDA, to lead our new ‘making it easier’ 
marketing campaign. So I think we have a very exciting time ahead  
of us, building on strong foundations, creating a true market leader. 
Q 
We’ve heard about common ranging before, why will it 
work this time round?
A 
As Ian said earlier, introducing common ranges is a huge growth 
opportunity for Kingfisher, both for driving sales and margin. I think 
the new ‘One Team’ approach is the key to properly harnessing our 
scale and talent this time round. The really good news is it’s no longer 
just a strategy or a dream, it’s happening today in stores. On shelf right 
now in B&Q are outdoor products under the new group-wide ‘Blooma’ 
own brand in multi-lingual packaging. And they are on shelf in France 
and Poland too! That’s a huge breakthrough for Kingfisher and it’s only 
just beginning. One day I want 50% of everything in store to be common 
to all our businesses.  07

Peter Hogsted 
CEO, Kingfisher International
Q 
Eastern Europe is growing fast, but is it just a flash  
in the pan?
A 
Absolutely not, these markets are still in their infancy. There are  
86 million homes in our market in Poland, Turkey and Russia,  
and, as wealth levels grow, a high priority for people is to improve their 
existing homes, catching up with the more developed markets in western 
Europe. The markets are under-developed in a retail sense with much of 
the sales still going to generalists and open air markets. We have opened 
41 stores in the past three years but there is scope to more than double 
our stores and establish a multi-channel approach. So I see many years 
of good growth to come over the longer term. But these things are never 
an entirely smooth road, you have to be ready for some speed bumps 
along the way and build flexibility into your plans. 
Q 
China – stay or leave? 
A 
To be honest I think we need another 12 months before we can 
know for sure. We now have a terrific local team in place and  
they have transformed the business from a large loss maker and cash 
user into one that is capable of making a profit and generating cash.  
But there is more to be done in China and we will need time to prove  
our store format is a success with customers to be sure that we have  
a winning formula. We have learned some important lessons from our 
experiences and we’re determined to get that ‘stay or leave’ decision 
right. After all, you don’t walk away from a market-leading position in  
the world’s second largest economy, nor commit more shareholder 
funds lightly.

amount of debt eliminated  
over the past three years
£1.6bn
Kevin O’Byrne 
Group Finance Director
Q 
Kingfisher with no debt, is it time to give back cash  
to shareholders?
A 
I’m delighted that our efforts right across the businesses have 
eliminated the £1.6bn of financial net debt that we started this 
journey with. It’s true we have a much stronger balance sheet now 
which means we have options going forward – a nice place to be relative 
to the depths of the credit crisis barely two years ago. But it’s not true 
we are debt free. We lease over 600 of our 856 stores and using a  
long-term property yield this equates to additional finance lease debt  
of £5.8 billion. Under today’s accounting rules these can’t be shown on 
the balance sheet but we do include this liability when thinking about 
our balance sheet and funding. 
Our aim is to retain financial flexibility whilst investing in improving and 
growing our business for the longer term. We are also keen to share our 
cash generation with shareholders and that’s why we have increased 
our full year dividend by 29% this year, ahead of our earnings growth. 
And I would expect us to continue to grow our dividends ahead of 
earnings for the next few years so that our dividend cover gently reduces 
from 3 times last year to around 2.7 over the medium term, a level at 
which we can invest in the business, return cash through dividends  
and maintain an appropriate balance sheet gearing. 
Q 
Last year you hinted at acquisitions, are you still  
in the market?
A 
First and foremost our investment will be targeted at expanding 
the store and digital channels for our existing businesses. We  
are planning to increase our organic investment in areas where high 
returns are already proven. If we see any opportunities to accelerate  
this by acquiring small parcels of stores at the right price, we will act.  
As regards anything more meaningful, you can ‘never say never’, but  
we set the hurdles very high indeed when it comes to creating value  
for shareholders via acquisition, so it would need to be a great deal. 08

Delivering more value – 
Creating the leader
We aim to capitalise on the attractive characteristics of our market and to 
use our unrivalled international scale and experience to develop products, 
services and channels for our customers that make their household jobs 
easier to do. By doing this we will create the leader in our industry and 
‘accelerate away from the pack’, delivering faster, sustainable growth and 
higher returns. Over the coming years we will focus on three themes:
1.  EASIER
“We believe we can stimulate the overall market, grow our 
like-for-like sales and our market share by becoming the world’s 
expert at making home improvement easier for our customers.” 
Product
We will establish for the ﬁ rst time a product innovation function to design –
new, easier to use products under the banner of our 10 new own ‘super-
brands’. These products will be exclusive to Kingﬁ sher businesses
We will use our scale and global sourcing expertise to bring these –
products ﬁ rst to market and at great value for money
We will expand our direct sourcing network across the world to ﬁ nd –
the best sources of quality and affordability 
Multi-channel
We will add new digital channels for the convenience of our customers –
Advice
We will be the best at offering advice and demonstration whether –
that is in store, online or through social media
We will de-mystify ‘Eco’ to make this important trend more accessible –
2.  COMMON
“By having a 50% core common range across all our businesses 
we will use our scale to accelerate innovation, stimulating overall 
market demand and growing our like-for-like sales and our market 
share. Our scale will also make home improvement more affordable 
for our customers whilst boosting our margins.” 
This is possible because tastes across our markets are increasingly similar 
as customers travel more and buy products produced from international 
sources. We already sell the same categories in our stores, such as building 
& repair materials and tools, gardening and seasonal products, decoration 
products, kitchens and bathrooms. However, less than 5% of individual 
products on sale across Kingﬁ sher’s businesses are common to more than 
Aim – to deliver faster growth and 
higher returns by working together 
to become the world’s expert at 
making home improvement easier 
for customers
The next phase of our development builds on the success of ‘Delivering 
Value’ which has repositioned Kingﬁ sher as a strong business in the 
attractive home improvement market.
We currently operate in eight countries, spanning over 500 million 
households. Around £120 billion is spent per year on repairing, 
maintaining and improving these households. Spending in developed 
markets has tended to reﬂ ect underlying consumption patterns whilst 
in the developing markets rising wealth is fuelling accelerated growth 
as home owners catch up with developed country standards. As well 
as growth potential, the home improvement market is also attractive to 
retailers because of the relatively small number of well known manufacturer 
brands. This means a specialist home improvement retailer provides a 
vital role for the consumer by offering a wide product choice and expert 
advice. They can offer a high proportion of ‘own brand’ product, achieve 
economies of buying scale and have a more defensible position against 
online or generalist operators when compared with other retail segments. 
However, the lack of sizeable, global manufacturer brands in our sector 
has meant there has been relatively limited product innovation in recent 
years to make home improvement easier and more accessible for the 
consumer. As a result demand has not been stimulated to its full potential. 
This is particularly true in the more developed markets such as the UK 
and France where householders generally have a list of work needed to 
be done but their repair, maintenance or improvement jobs are thought 
to be too complicated or too costly. We believe there is a big opportunity 
for a real retail leader to emerge to address this opportunity and unlock 
the latent demand in these markets.

a fully centralised model we will retain our existing country management 
structures whilst in addition creating a series of teams that work across 
traditional country and business boundaries. A number of these multi-
national, multi-operating company teams are already established, are 
well resourced and empowered to manage key projects, such as 
common ranging and multi-channel development, under the direction of 
the Group Executive. Known internally as ‘One Team’ this new approach 
will enable us to move from the existing 20:80 (common:local) business 
model towards an 80:20 model. 
Challenging goals
A key element of the success of the Delivering Value programme has 
been setting clear and challenging medium-term goals linked to share-
based incentives. As we start to enter the next phase of Kingﬁ sher’s 
development a revision to the existing Performance Share Plan, covering 
the three years to January 2014, will be proposed for approval by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in June 2011. 
Under the proposals, share awards will be made for reaching stretching 
earnings and returns targets. The maximum potential share award will 
vest as follows:
Earnings: 50% for achieving a compound average growth rate (CAGR) –
of 15% in adjusted EPS over the three years. EPS in 2013/14 will need 
to be 31.2p to achieve maximum vesting
Returns: 50% for generating a cumulative Kingﬁ sher economic proﬁ t –
target over the three years. 
Kingﬁ sher economic proﬁ t differs from other reported proﬁ t ﬁ gures 
because it takes into account a charge for the capital employed in the 
business. In doing this the calculation treats leases as though they were 
owned assets within capital employed, capitalising them using long-term 
property yield methodology. For the purposes of the calculation, reported 
adjusted post-tax proﬁ t is used, but interest and lease costs are added 
back. A charge for the cost of capital employed is then deducted by 
applying the Group’s lease adjusted WACC to its lease and pension 
adjusted capital employed. 
These share-based incentives will cover the two Executive Directors 
and the top 50 senior managers with plans to extend elements of this 
scheme to the next 150 senior managers. Further share incentives 
for store managers will also be rolled out next year. 
one business and sourced from a common supplier, reﬂ ecting our previous 
conglomerate organisation. As we progress towards a more integrated 
organisational approach we will increase the proportion of products that 
form a core common range to around 50%. Much of this will be our own 
brands, sourced direct through the global Kingﬁ sher Sourcing Organisation. 
Greater commonality will result in greater convergence of our operating 
models around the Group, enabling operating efﬁ ciency and cost 
productivity gains.
3.  EXPAND
“By becoming the best at making home improvement easier and 
developing a core common range we will be able to accelerate and 
improve our expansion, thereby growing total sales and market share.”
Having strengthened the businesses and established stringent capital 
disciplines, Kingﬁ sher is now in a better position to successfully 
accelerate its expansion. There is potential to grow our current store 
network from 856 to over 1,100 in our existing markets over the long-
term, and also establish a multi-channel presence in each one. Over 
time we would expect participation of sales from the three geographic 
operating divisions to be broadly equivalent (UK & Ireland, France and 
Other International). 
‘Proven’ territories
We will expand faster and deeper into existing markets where returns –
are proven
‘Early phase’ territories
We will continue to develop in China and Russia and determine –
suitability for eventual expansion against challenging return hurdle rates 
New territories
We will identify and enter new markets with stores and other –
channels, leveraging our core common range and more common 
operating model
Organisational development
Successful delivery of the next phase will require us to complete the journey 
from our origins as a retail conglomerate to a single, uniﬁ ed retailer. Much 
progress has been made in recent years and the organisation is now ready 
to complete the ﬁ nal steps in our journey, thereby unlocking the full potential 
of our unique international talent and scale. 
At the same time it is also very important that we retain the value of our 
local diversity and closeness to the local customer. Rather than adopting

Innovation
Kingﬁ sher’s customers are increasingly 
looking for new products, new services and 
new ways of shopping, all at great prices. 
We are making it easier for our customers to 
access new, good value, exclusive products 
for their homes, as well as innovative services 
that make their shopping experience as easy 
as possible, such as in-store DIY classes, 
online 3D kitchen planning and hourly van hire. 
We use customer insights to capture new 
ideas and changing preferences and share 
them between our businesses in order to 
remain at the forefront of home improvement 
innovation. The following pages give 
examples of innovation in our product 
ranges, stores and services.
Blooma garden 
furniture
This spring saw the launch 
of the Blooma own-brand 
range of seasonal garden 
products at B&Q UK and 
Castorama France. This 
launch is part of Kingﬁ sher’s 
development of common 
ranges for sale across 
Europe in multi-lingual 
packaging. Others to be 
launched across the Group 
include Verve garden 
ranges, Cooke & Lewis 
kitchens and Form storage 
products. The 10 exclusive 
own-brands will replace 
around 150 own brands 
currently sold across 
the Group.
Tiling
As part of its ‘C’est 
Castoche’ campaign to 
make home improvement 
easier, Castorama France 
launched a range of 
‘click-together’ tiling which 
requires no grout. This 
range, together with its 
range of ultra thin tiles 
which can be laid on top 
of existing tiles, now 
accounts for 10% of 
Castorama’s tile sales.
Responsibly sourced 
timber
In 201 1 B&Q became the 
ﬁ rst major UK retailer to 
achieve the goal of buying 
all timber products from 
proven responsible sources. 
From garden furniture to 
kitchens, nearly 16,000 
products at B&Q contain 
wood – either as whole 
timber or as an agglomerate. 
B&Q is committed to only 
buying products that are 
traceable to sources that 
have met legal, social 
and environmental 
standards that have 
been independently 
veriﬁ ed, or are recycled.
‘Paste the wall’ 
wallpaper
Part of B&Q UK’s 
campaign to make home 
improvement easier for 
customers is to stock 
more products that are 
easier to use. One 
example is a wider range 
of ‘paste-the-wall’ 
wallpaper which has 
special backing so it can 
be hung dry from the roll. 
Pictured here is the 
Cocktail wallpaper from 
the B&Q Colours range.

Turbo Veg
After a successful trial in 
2010 all B&Q UK stores will 
be selling Turbo Vegetable 
plants this year. They offer 
traditional heavy cropping 
and full ﬂ avoured varieties, 
grafted onto rootstock 
specially developed to resist 
pests and diseases, and 
give the plant extra vigour. 
This means the plants will 
yield approximately twice 
as much as a regular plant. 
There are 13 varieties of 
Turbo Veg (£3.98 per 
plant), including tomatoes, 
aubergines and peppers.
Composite fence 
panels
This new range of fencing, 
mixing composite and 
acrylic panels, was 
brought into Castorama 
France stores in 2010. 
Developed with the 
support of Kingﬁ sher 
Sourcing Organisation, 
its elegance and simple 
functionality has proved 
very popular with 
customers.
Product innovation
The Kingﬁ sher Sourcing Organisation 
(KSO) uses its signiﬁ cant worldwide 
buying strength to bring innovative 
products to customers at affordable 
prices. There are now 10 Kingﬁ sher 
exclusive own-brands, including the 
seasonal Blooma garden products 
range, Verve gardening accessories 
and Blyss heating and cooling products, 
which come in multi-lingual packaging 
common to our stores in the UK, 
France, Poland, Russia and Turkey. This 
is in addition to the aspirational ranges 
from well-known designers.

designed to make it 
easier and give the nation 
the skills and conﬁ dence 
to do more DIY.
You Can Do It classes
B&Q UK is making it easier 
for customers to undertake 
home improvement jobs 
through the expansion of 
its successful ‘You Can 
Do It’ classes. Over 
2,500 customers have 
undertaken a class so 
far, with more than 20 
categories to choose from, 
including tiling, plumbing 
and hanging wallpaper. 
The classes currently 
operate in six B&Q stores 
with a further 9 planned to 
open in spring 2011. Kids’ 
classes are also available 
to help develop the next 
generation of DIYers.
3D kitchen planner
In May 2010 Castorama 
France launched a three 
dimensional website which 
enables customers to 
design their own kitchen 
layout, choose their style 
of kitchen and calculate the 
costs within minutes. The 
tool is part of Castorama’s

Following a successful 
seven-month trial, B&Q is 
rolling out an hourly van

The scheme will help 
customers transport their 
bulky products home in 
a way that’s quick, easy 
and cheap, at only £14

Call, Pay, Collect
In July 2010 Screwﬁ x

Last year was notable for the focus we placed on our leadership 
population, creating a stronger sense of cross-Group unity and further 
developing our leadership capabilities. 
At the same time we continued to invest in training across all our retail 
brands, maintaining an emphasis on giving our store employees the 
expertise required to achieve high levels of customer engagement 
and loyalty.
Leading as One Team 
To maximise the added value from being an international retailer it is 
vital that our 80,000 employees can work as a single team, where ideas 
and experience ﬂ ow freely, successful concepts can be shared and 
talent can be placed where it makes the biggest difference. 
We call this ambition ‘One Team’; we also recognise that our senior 
leadership group is central to us achieving it. In the past year we 
convened two highly innovative and successful conferences with our 
top 200 leaders, enabling us to collect their ideas for shaping our future 
direction. The meetings also saw the forging of stronger cross-Group 
connections and networks, which are essential to making our One 
Team aspirations a reality.
Investing in our leadership capability
During the year we launched our ﬁ rst Kingﬁ sher Leadership Programme, 
which every member of the One Team leadership group will have 
completed by the end of 2011. We see this initiative as the ﬁ rst step in 
developing a coherent learning and development offer at Group level, 
one that will complement the ongoing investments made in this area 
by our various Group businesses, some examples of which include:
During the year Castorama France created six new working groups –
for its Viva training programme, which focuses on some of the ‘softer’ 
leadership skills. All members of the Castorama leadership team are 
scheduled to participate in Viva.
B&Q UK has developed a leadership programme for all of its –
senior managers. This programme, called Leading the Way, aims 
to enhance managers’ skills, knowledge and capabilities so they 
are better placed to drive their own performance and that of their 
teams. B&Q has also put together a renewed cycle of management 
development to be implemented during the next three years, aimed 
at managers in stores and those who lead teams in its head ofﬁ ce.
At Screwﬁ x, all Trade Counter managers began an extensive –
leadership development programme last year, which will continue 
throughout 2011. It is designed to provide front line managers with 
the skills to get the best out of their store teams.
Training to enhance the customer experience
All our businesses are actively engaged in store staff training and see 
it as key to helping our front-line employees provide the service our 
customers need and expect. The highlights in the past year included:
B&Q China – – training for store staff focused on product knowledge 
and selling skills, as the primary customer relationship continues to 
shift from supplier representatives to B&Q China’s own staff.
Koçtas ¸ – – roll-out of e-learning tools and completion of 530 coaching 
days given by internal product experts to new store staff and others 
with speciﬁ c knowledge needs.
Castorama France – – launched a new training scheme called 
Form’acteur which features an online portal enabling employees to 
take responsibility for their own personal development. By year-end 
70% of employees had completed at least one training event using 
the new system.
B&Q UK – – Building on the strong base of innovative, leading training 
that B&Q has already developed, two new City & Guilds accredited 
qualiﬁ cations were launched during the year. The ﬁ rst is a Diploma 
in Retail Skills focusing on selling eco products; the second is a 
Diploma in Retail Management aimed at B&Q’s supervisor population. 
So far more than 21,000 City & Guilds qualiﬁ cations of various types 
have been awarded to B&Q employees since the initiative began 
in 2009.
Measurement of employee engagement
The Gallup Q12 survey, ﬁ rst adopted by B&Q UK in 2000, has become 
our established tool for measuring employee engagement across the 
Group. In May last year Castorama France opened out the survey to 
all 12,500 of its employees, with 89.9% choosing to take part. This initial 
survey produced a GrandMean (the biggest indicator of engagement 
levels) score of 3.70. When the second survey was held in November 
this ﬁ gure rose to 3.87, representing the opinion of 94% of Castorama’s 
employees. These high participation rates are very encouraging for an 
employee population of this size.
Elsewhere, B&Q UK recorded engagement levels that enabled it to 
qualify for the Gallup Great Workplace Award for the ﬁ fth successive 
year, while Kingﬁ sher’s ‘Q12 leadership population’ (comprising 1,200 
senior employees across the Group) continued to demonstrate high 
levels of engagement.

Developing an outstanding portfolio of global Group brands 
The more efﬁ ciently we can source and market own-brand products 
to our customers, the greater the beneﬁ ts we can drive from our Group 
buying strategy. During the past year a project has been completed to 
create a streamlined portfolio of 10 exclusive Kingﬁ sher own-brands 
covering our key product categories. Some are established names; 
others have been newly-created to meet a particular need.
Each brand is available to all our home improvement formats, with 
multi-lingual packaging as standard to minimise production lead times. 
The ﬁ rst common ranges to be delivered under this new strategy were 
seasonal garden products under the Blooma brand, which went on sale 
in B&Q UK, Castorama France, Castorama Poland, Castorama Russia 
and Koçta¸ s  in early 2011.
Taking common ranging to the next level
Our two largest Group businesses, B&Q UK and Castorama France, 
are now aligning their product sourcing strategies more closely than 
ever before. 
In the seasonal category, a product roadshow was held in Hong Kong in 
March 2010 where the buying teams worked together on creating more 
common ranges of barbecues and garden furniture. This resulted in 60% 
of this season’s barbecue range, and 35% of the garden furniture range, 
being common between B&Q UK and Castorama France. We now place 
80% of our total garden leisure purchasing through common suppliers. 
By working together with our suppliers, our combined scale allows us to 
achieve better commercial terms as well as enabling us to create better 
designed products which will help us drive sales. To facilitate more 
cross-Group common sourcing, we have recently created core range 
catalogues containing 3,000 best selling direct sourced products. This 
core range is available across the Group, helping us drive more volume 
through common products.
Ethical sourcing
Kingﬁ sher continues to work with suppliers to improve labour and 
environmental conditions throughout its supply chain and monitor 
compliance with the Kingﬁ sher Code of Conduct for Factory Working 
Conditions. Over 1,000 supplier/factory ethical assessments were 
conducted during the year. 
The Kingﬁ sher Sourcing Organisation works in collaboration with factories 
to improve standards through factory action plans, partnership projects 
and training, such as ethical sourcing workshops for factories in India.
Group buying programmes
New own-brand launch
In 2010, Kingﬁ sher unveiled a range of 10 own-brands. They are being rolled out 
across the Group and replace the previous collection of around 150 own-brands.
Major growth in direct sourcing
In recent years Kingﬁ sher has worked hard to create an infrastructure 
through which our Group businesses can source greater volumes of 
products directly from suppliers. The advantages of such an approach 
are clear: it gives more control of the sourcing process, reduces time 
to market and – crucially – enables our businesses to share ranges 
that offer the greatest value and purchasing appeal to our customers.
Last year saw a genuine step-change in our Group buying performance, 
with the value of direct shipments reaching $1.3 billion, up 66% on the 
previous year and signiﬁ cantly ahead of our $1 billion target. Growth was 
seen across all Group businesses with notably strong results achieved 
by Brico Dépôt France, which more than doubled its direct shipments, 
while Castorama Poland achieved an increase of 88%, Castorama 
France 60% and B&Q UK 49%.
From a product perspective the ranges that saw biggest increases 
in direct shipments were bathroom and kitchen (94%), electrical 
products (86%), lighting (100%) and garden tools (72%).
The Kingﬁ sher Sourcing Organisation (KSO) has further enlarged its 
global footprint, with a new sourcing presence now established in Israel. 
Elsewhere, the KSO’s Vietnamese ofﬁ ce, which opened in 2009, continues 
to extend its reach into South East Asia, while the Warsaw ofﬁ ce is 
sourcing from other eastern European territories including Ukraine, 
Turkey, Romania and the Czech Republic. Products manufactured 
outside Poland now generate 45% of the Warsaw team’s total buying 
volumes, which are up 150% year-on-year.
Optimising our supplier base
We recognise that our suppliers hold the key to us achieving our future 
Group sourcing ambitions. Finding the best manufacturers to meet our 
exacting standards for quality, innovation, exclusivity and value, then 
developing strong and mutually beneﬁ cial relationships with them, is a 
prerequisite if we are to make the most of our combined buying scale.
Last year 86% of the $1.3bn we spent on direct shipments was placed 
with vendors who supply at least two Kingﬁ sher businesses. In addition, 
while China remains our most important sourcing market we have worked 
to establish a truly global supplier base: 25% of our direct sourcing 
vendors are now located outside China across 32 different countries.
Multi-lingual packaging
The new own-brands feature 
multi-lingual packaging, as 
shown on this hose reel.

Local communities
We are committed to supporting local communities everywhere we 
operate and increased our community investment by 70% during 
2010/11. Kingﬁ sher has a number of strategic charity partnerships and 
our operating companies also support a range of projects. For example, 
at Koçta¸ s  head ofﬁ ce staff mentor local students as part of an employee 
volunteering programme, while Castorama Russia has developed a 
partnership with a charity called ‘To Children With Love’, which provides 
support for orphaned children.

2. Making our operations more sustainable
We have reduced our total CO2 equivalent emissions (from energy and 
transport) per £m retail sales by 25% since 2006/07 , exceeding our target 
of a 20% reduction. This year, B&Q UK achieved a 9% reduction in CO2
from electricity, driven by an investment of £2.3 million to improve the 
energy efﬁ ciency of lighting. Kingﬁ sher continues to work with the Carbon 
Trust to further reduce the carbon footprint of its stores. During 2010/11, 
we signiﬁ cantly cut total store waste disposed. For example, Brico 
Dépôt France achieved a signiﬁ cant reduction in waste by setting 
speciﬁ c waste targets for every store manager.
  2006/07 2010/11 Progress
Total CO2 equivalent emissions from energy 59.6 44.5 -25%
and transport (tonnes per £m retail sales)
For several years Kingﬁ sher has been included in the FTSE4Good and 
Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. In 2010 we also gained inclusion into 
the Carbon Performance Leadership Index (CPLI) compiled by the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). 
Corporate responsibility key performance indicators (KPIs)
Minimising our impact on the environment
Kingﬁ sher’s corporate responsibility strategy, which we call Future 
Homes, has two principal aims. The ﬁ rst is to make sustainable living 
easier and more affordable for our customers; the second is to embed 
sustainability into all aspects of our own operations.
1. Sustainable living
We have been working with Forum for the Future, the independent 
sustainability experts, to develop a new 2020 Future Homes vision 
which highlights four key priorities where we can make a real and 
sustainable difference. During the past year we have made signiﬁ cant 
progress, giving us a strong platform from which to work towards our 
longer-term goals.
Product innovation
In 2010/11 sales of eco products totalled £1.1 billion – accounting for 
nearly 11% of total retail sales across the Group. Every item sold in our 
stores which we highlight as an eco product has been independently 
assessed by the sustainability experts BioRegional to ensure it meets 
our rigorous criteria. We have also created Group eco design guidelines 
to help our buying teams incorporate sustainability principles into their 
sourcing strategies.
During the year B&Q UK launched the ﬁ rst ‘best in class’ products. B&Q 
customers can now choose loft insulation made from recycled plastic or 
sheep’s wool and carpet underlay made of 100% recycled clothing, 
while in some stores recycled paint products have been made available 
on a trial basis. Castorama France encourages innovation among 
suppliers through its annual eco product award, now in its third year.
Energy-efﬁ cient homes 
Our two largest businesses, B&Q UK and Castorama France, now 
stock around 10,000 products within their respective eco ranges One 
Planet Home
®
 and La Maison Éco. During 2010 B&Q UK enhanced its 
in-store customer support by introducing trained eco advisers across 
all stores. Castorama France has introduced a new logo, C’est ÉCO, 
to highlight its eco product ranges in stores. Brico Dépôt Spain broke 
new ground by launching a low-cost solar panel kit priced at €79.
Selling good wood
We exceeded our target to source 75% of timber volume from proven 
well managed forests or recycled sources. In the UK, B&Q has now 
achieved 100% responsible timber sourcing, with B&Q offering the 
largest range of ‘good wood’ on the market – more than 16,000 products 
made from or containing sustainable timber. B&Q China has pioneered 
the introduction of FSC-certiﬁ ed timber in its local market, continuing 
this work in January 2011 with the launch of a new FSC-certiﬁ ed 
ﬂ ooring range.

Overview
Total sales grew 0.5% on a constant currency basis and declined by 0.5% to £10.4 billion on a 
reported rate basis. During the year, an additional 21 net new stores were opened taking the store 
network to 826 (excluding 30 Turkey JV stores). This includes the impact of closing three stores 
across the Group. On a like-for-like (‘LFL ’) basis, Group sales were down 0.9%. 
Retail proﬁ t before exceptional items grew by 14.7% to £762 million, and by 11.0% to £756 million 
including exceptional items.
The net interest charge for the year was £27 million, down £30 million on the prior year driven by 
signiﬁ cantly lower average net debt levels and lower interest rates.
Proﬁ t before tax grew by 18.6% to £671 million as a result of improved trading in the year and a 
reduction in net ﬁ nance costs. On a more comparable basis, which removes the impact of one-off 
items and fair value remeasurements, adjusted pre-tax proﬁ t grew by 22.5% to £670 million.
Proﬁ t for the year grew by 27.5% to £491 million. This resulted in the Group recording a basic 
EPS of 21.0p which is up 4.5p (+27.3%) in the year.

Kingﬁ sher France
Kingﬁ sher France outperformed the market with self-help initiatives 
driving sales ahead 2.9% to £4.2 billion (+1.6% LFL, +1.8% on a 
comparable store basis). Across the two businesses, three new stores 
were opened and seven were revamped, adding around 2% new space. 
Retail proﬁ t grew 12.0% reﬂ ecting the sales growth and higher gross 
margins (+100 basis points) beneﬁ tting from a sharp increase in direct 
sourcing, continued buying optimisation beneﬁ ts and fewer promotions 
year on year. 
Castorama total sales grew by 4.6% to £2.3 billion (+3.4% LFL, +3.8% 
on a comparable store basis). According to Banque de France
1
 sales for 
the market on a comparable store basis were up 1.4%. Castorama’s 
strong outperformance was supported by progress with its store 
modernisation programme (63% of total selling space now completed), 
new range introductions and the innovative ‘Do-it-Smart’ marketing 
campaign aimed at making home improvement projects easier 
for customers. 
Kingﬁ sher UK & Ireland 
Total sales were down 2.4% to £4.3 billion (-3.0% LFL) impacted by 
pre-opening disruption from the national rollout of ‘TradePoint’ and 
B&Q UK’s tactical decision in Q2 to limit the use of general, store-wide 
promotions. This approach, whilst impacting LFL sales growth, resulted 
in higher gross proﬁ t
1
 year on year which together with other self-help 
initiatives to drive higher gross margins and lower operating costs, 
resulted in retail proﬁ t up 11.8%.
GFK market data for the UK’s leading home improvement retailers
2
was up around 1% across the year whereas the trade
3
 market declined. 
B&Q UK & Ireland’s total sales were down 2.8% (-3.3% LFL) to 
£3.9 billion. Sales of outdoor products declined around 1% despite 
mixed weather and following strong growth last year (+6%). Reported 
sales across all categories of indoor products were down a similar 
amount reﬂ ecting fewer promotions and as anticipated, building sales 
were also impacted by the roll out of ‘TradePoint’ into B&Q’s large 
format stores. However, underlying kitchen sales responded well to 
improved merchandising, new ranges and more targeted promotions 
across H2 (+7%). 
Sales across outdoor and indoor categories were up a similar amount 
with sales of new decorative ranges, supported by a new catalogue, 
new heating, laminate ﬂ ooring and storage ranges performing 
particularly well. 
Brico Dépôt, which more speciﬁ cally targets the trade professional, 
delivered total sales growth of 1.0% to £1.9 billion (-0.5% LFL). Like-for-
likes were impacted by around 0.5% by the French national strikes and 
adverse weather in northern France in H2. The trade market
2
 was 
down 4%. 
Self-help initiatives to drive sales and footfall progressed well including 
an up-weighted programme of range refreshment, more ‘arrivages’ 
promotions (rolling programme of one-off special buys) and more 
frequent product catalogues to reinforce Brico Dépôt’s value credentials. 
New kitchen (+9% LFL) and hand tool (+4% LFL) ranges introduced last 
year performed well.

All trading commentary below is in constant currencies.
Other International total sales increased by 1.7% to £1.9 billion (-1.2% 
LFL). Retail proﬁ t was up 34.3% to £171 million driven by proﬁ t growth in 
Poland, Spain and Turkey and signiﬁ cantly lower losses in China.
During 2010/11, 10 new stores opened, three in Poland, two in Russia, 
four in Turkey and one in Spain, adding around 6% new space. A further 
16 new stores are planned for 2011/12, including six in Poland, four in 
Russia and six in Turkey, adding around 10% new space. 
In Eastern Europe sales in Poland were up 0.7% (-2.8% LFL) to 
£1,062 million in a more stable market after a difﬁ cult ﬁ rst half (2010/11 
H1 -6.0% LFL). New bathroom and garden catalogues and expanded 
decoration ranges all boosted sales and proﬁ ts. Retail proﬁ t was up 
3.1% to £134 million driven by the sales growth and gross margins (+60 
basis points) beneﬁ tting from sales of higher margin products, shrinkage 
reduction, buying scale beneﬁ ts and tight cost control. Sales in Russia
grew 39.2% to £240 million reﬂ ecting new store openings. In Turkey, 
Kingﬁ sher’s 50% JV, Koçtas ¸ , retail proﬁ t grew strongly due to strong 
sales growth (+7.3% LFL), more direct sourcing beneﬁ tting gross 
margins and tight cost control.
Elsewhere, in Spain proﬁ ts grew strongly with sales up 16.4% to 
£225 million, signiﬁ cantly outperforming the market. Hornbach, in 
which Kingﬁ sher has a 21% economic interest, contributed £31 million 
to retail proﬁ t (2009/10: £30 million). 
B&Q China sales declined 16.2% to £386 million primarily reﬂ ecting 
15% less space now trading compared to the prior year. Like-for-likes 
declined by 2.3%. The ‘ﬁ x-it’ phase of the turnaround plan remains on 
track with losses reducing as planned to £8 million, down almost 80% 
on the prior year (2009/10: loss of £36 million).
‘TradePoint’ continues to progress well and annualised trade sales 
continue to grow and account for 15% of total store sales, up from 
around 10% pre-‘TradePoint’, and are expected to increase as the 
offer becomes better known and trusted by trade professionals. Over 
415,000 customers have now registered as ‘TradePoint’ customers, 
signiﬁ cantly more than were registered with the previous B&Q Trade 
Discount Card. 
Screwﬁ x limited the impact of a challenging smaller tradesman 
market with total sales up 1.6% to £479 million compared with the 
wider trade market which we estimate to have been slightly down. 
Initiatives that drove market share gains included the continued roll 
out of trade counters, the addition of 103 specialist trade desks 
exclusive to plumbers and electricians within existing Screwﬁ x outlets 
and new ranges (e.g. work wear +39% LFL). Fifteen new outlets were 
opened during the year, taking the total to 162, now accounting for 
around 60% of total sales. Retail proﬁ t was £28 million, up 24.7% 
reﬂ ecting the sales growth, distribution efﬁ ciencies, shrinkage 
reduction and tight cost control.

2 This data includes new space added but excludes private retailers e.g. IKEA 
and smaller independents.
3 Based on the Builders’ Merchants Federation data Jan-Dec 2010.
4 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
Retail proﬁ t grew by 10.4% to £215 million with gross margin percentage 
increasing strongly by a further 110 basis points (2009/10: +110 basis 
points) driven by more direct sourcing, further shrinkage reduction and 
fewer promotions. A strong focus on operating cost efﬁ ciencies also 
continued with costs (SG&A

) percentage to sales held broadly ﬂ at 
across the year. 
The roll out of the new B&Q ‘TradePoint’ offer within large stores, 
announced with the preliminary results in March 2010, was completed 
on time and to budget in H1. The proposition takes the best of B&Q 
(extended opening hours, convenient locations, heavy building ranges, 
showrooms and the rest of the stores’ retail products) and adds 
Screwﬁ x’s ranges, systems and logistics expertise to create a merchant 
environment with extended trade brands and trade only prices. This 
offer, which is exclusive to the trade professional and unique in the 
UK, is expected to boost Kingﬁ sher’s low share in the professional 
trade market.
Across H2, an ‘order & collect’ offer was rolled out into all remaining 
B&Q stores. This additional offer is based on next day delivery to the 
tradesman’s nearest store as well as giving access to ‘TradePoint’ 
catalogue prices on selected lines through any B&Q store checkout. 
A major review of all B&Q in-store building ranges was also completed 
to support the ‘TradePoint’ roll out.

Taxation
The effective rate of tax, calculated on proﬁ t before exceptional items, 
prior year tax adjustments and the impact of rate changes is 29% 
(2009/10: 30%). The overall rate is 27% (2009/10: 32%).

The Group’s effective tax rate is sensitive to the blend of tax rates and 
proﬁ ts in the various jurisdictions. Whilst we continue to plan our tax 
affairs efﬁ ciently and adopt a prudent approach towards providing for 
uncertain tax positions, we are aware that with pressure on government 
ﬁ nances, the tax cost of multinationals may increase over time. 
The tax rates for this ﬁ nancial year and the expected rates for next year 
are as follows:

Taxation risk management
The Group’s tax strategy is to manage its tax affairs efﬁ ciently and in a 
way which enhances shareholder value whilst balancing the tax risk it 
faces. Tax risks can arise from change in law, differences in interpretation 
of law, changes in tax rates and the failure to comply with the tax law and 
associated procedures. The Group manages and controls these risks 
through local management, its Group tax department and appropriate 
advice from reputable professional ﬁ rms. Where disputes arise with the 
tax authorities the Group addresses the areas of dispute promptly in a 
professional, open and constructive manner.
Exceptional items
The Group has recorded a net exceptional post-tax charge of £3 million 
in the year (2009/10: gain of £10 million) as follows: 
  2010/11 2009/10

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share have increased by 27.3% to 21.0p (2009/10: 
16.5p). The increase year on year is as a consequence of improved 
underlying performance, partially offset by the adverse movement in 
exceptional items in the year. On a more comparable basis, removing 
the impact of exceptional items and ﬁ nancing fair value remeasurements, 
adjusted basic earnings per share have increased by 25% to 20.5p 
(2009/10: 16.4p).

items on income tax   (0.6)p 0.7p
Adjusted earnings per share 20.5p 16.4p
Dividends
Given the strong performance in 2010/11 and conﬁ dence in the future 
prospects provided by self-help initiatives, the Board believes it is now 
appropriate to start lowering dividend cover from 3.0 times to 2.7 times 
adjusted earnings over the medium term. At this level the Board believes 
the dividend will continue to be prudently covered by earnings and free 
cash ﬂ ow and remain consistent with the capital needs of the business. 
Accordingly, the Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 5.145p, an 
increase of 43.9%. This gives a full year dividend of 7.07p, an increase 
of 28.5% (2009/10: 5.5p). 
As previously announced, the Group’s interim dividend is calculated 
automatically as 35% of the prior year’s total dividend. Based on this, 
the interim dividend to be paid in November 2011 would be 2.47p per 
share (2010: 1.925p per share). The ﬁ nal dividend will continue to be 
proposed each year as part of the full year preliminary announcement 
in March.
The ﬁ nal dividend for the year ended 29 January 2011 will be paid on 
20 June 2011 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 
6 May 2011, subject to approval of shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, to be held on 16 June 2011. A dividend reinvestment plan 
(DRIP) is available to shareholders who would prefer to invest their 
dividends in the shares of the Company.
The shares will go ex-dividend on 4 May 2011. For those shareholders 
electing to receive the DRIP the last date for receipt of electing is 
27 May 2011.

2010/11
Return on Capital (ROC)
The Group has two main Return on Capital (ROC) measures. 
The ﬁ rst measure, Standard Return on Capital, is primarily a Group 
measure. It is stated on a non-lease adjusted basis, although we also 
quote a lease adjusted number. The asset base includes goodwill.
The second measure, Lease Adjusted ROC excluding Goodwill, is used 
to monitor performance at a geographic divisional level.
Group Return
  2010/11 2009/10 Increase
Standard Return on capital (ROC)  9.6% 8.3% +1.3%pps
For Standard ROC, Return is calculated as post-tax Retail Proﬁ t less 
central costs and excluding exceptional items, other than realised 
property proﬁ t. Return is then divided by a two point average of Invested 
Capital (calculated as Net Assets excluding Net Debt and Pension 
related items including related Deferred Tax). 
The strong operating performance combined with improved asset turns 
has resulted in the Standard ROC performance increasing from 8.3% to 
9.6% in 2010/11 compared to the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC) of 8.1%.
Lease adjusted ROC is based on the same deﬁ nition except it excludes 
property lease costs, and Invested Capital is adjusted for lease costs 
capitalised at the long-term property yield. Lease adjusted ROC has 
increased from 6.8% to 7.3% in 2010/11, compared to the Group’s lease 
adjusted cost of capital (WACC) of 6.8%.
Geographic divisional return
Kingﬁ sher’s underlying ROC by geographic division is set out below. 
All divisions improved their returns in 2010/11. Return is stated after 
adjusting for property lease costs and before property proﬁ ts. Invested 
capital excludes goodwill but includes capitalised leases:

The Group exceeded its net debt target for the year, reporting year end 
net cash of £14 million (2009/10: £250 million ﬁ nancial net debt). On a 
constant currency basis net ﬁ nancial debt has decreased by £1.7 billion 
over the last three years (£1.6 billion on a reported currency basis).
Free cash ﬂ ow of £407 million was generated in the year, a movement of 
£354 million year on year mainly driven by movement in working capital. 
In the prior year, signiﬁ cant progress was made on our ‘Delivering Value’ 
objective to reduce working capital and as a result a one-off beneﬁ t of 
£315 million was recorded. Over the full period of ‘Delivering Value’ working 
capital has reduced by over £500 million excluding the impact of LME of 
around £180 million over the same period. LME is the legislative change 
shortening payment terms in France, implemented over the three years 
to 2012. 
In the current year working capital has increased by £141 million. 
The largest single item impacting this is the LME change in France. 
The balance is due to planned earlier purchase of seasonal stock and 
additional stock in newly opened stores. Stock days have increased 
in the period from 92 days in 2009/10 to 95 days on a moving 
average basis.
With a tight focus on cash over the last three years, the Group has been 
able to reduce its reliance on external funding, improving our ﬁ nancial 
ﬂ exibility. In 2010/11 the Group repaid £679 million nominal value of 
gross debt by repaying maturing debt, and by repurchasing signiﬁ cant 
proportions of our 2014 Eurobonds and US Private Placement debt. In 
total over the last three years we have repaid gross debt with a value of 
£1,371 million.

Financial review
Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
The Group will maintain a high focus on free cash ﬂ ow generation going 
forward to fund dividends to shareholders and increased investment in 
growth opportunities where returns are attractive. 
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure increased by 21% in the year to £310 million. 
Of this, £116 million was spent on property (2009/10: £102 million). In 
the year £194 million was spent on ﬁ xtures, ﬁ ttings and intangibles 
(2009/10: £154 million). A total of £87 million of proceeds from disposals 
were received during the year (2009/10: £59 million).
As detailed last year the Group has a rigorous approach to capital 
allocation and authorisation. The process includes:
An annual strategic planning process based on detailed plans for –
all businesses for the next three years. This process drives the key 
strategic capital allocation decisions and the output is reviewed by 
the Board, twice a year.
A capital approval process through a capital expenditure committee, –
attended by the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, 
Group Property Director and the three regional CEOs as required. 
The committee is delegated to review all projects between 
£0.75 million and £15.0 million (including the capitalised value of 
lease commitments).
Projects above this level are approved by the Board although all –
projects above £0.75 million are also notiﬁ ed to the Board.
Clear investment criteria with challenging hurdle rates for IRR (Internal –
Rate of Return) and discounted payback.
An annual post-investment review process to undertake a full review –
of all projects above £0.75 million which were completed in the last 
four years, together with a review of recent performance on all other 
existing stores. The ﬁ ndings of this exercise are considered by both 
the Retail Board and the Board and directly inﬂ uence the Regional 
and Group Development Strategy and the assumptions for similar 
project proposals going forward.
An annual review of return on capital by store is performed which –
drives plans to improve the returns of weaker stores.
Management of liquidity risk and ﬁ nancing
The Group now has low levels of ﬁ nancial net debt. However, the 
Group’s overall leverage, including capitalised lease debt that (in 
accordance with accounting regulations) does not appear on the 
balance sheet, is estimated to be around 50%. At this level the Group 
has ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility whilst retaining an efﬁ cient cost of capital.
Kingﬁ sher is currently targeting to have relatively low levels of ﬁ nancial 
net debt to support a solid investment grade credit rating. Where 
appropriate Kingﬁ sher may purchase current leasehold assets used 
by the Group. This may increase ﬁ nancial net debt but have no 
impact on lease adjusted net debt.
Kingﬁ sher regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required 
to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent cash ﬂ ow 
forecast for the next three years, determining the level of debt facilities 
required to fund the business, planning for repayments of debt at its 
maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide 
a reserve against unexpected outﬂ ows. 
At the year end, Kingﬁ sher had an undrawn £500 million committed 
bank facility, which matures in August 2012.
Kingﬁ sher deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with strong 
credit ratings and with money market funds which have the strongest, 
AAA, credit rating and offer same day liquidity. A credit limit for each 
bank or fund is agreed by the Board covering the full value of deposits 
and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts. The credit risk is 
reduced further by spreading the investments and derivative contracts 
across several counterparties. At the year end, Kingﬁ sher had a total of 
around £500 million of cash deposited with banks and in money market 
funds. The highest single cash investment was a £86 million money 
market fund investment.
The maturity proﬁ le of Kingﬁ sher’s debt is illustrated at: 
http://www.kingﬁ sher.com/index.asp?pageid=76
The terms of the US Private Placement note agreement and the 
committed bank facility require that the ratio of Group operating proﬁ t, 
excluding exceptional items, to net interest payable must be no less 
than 3:1. The Group is in compliance with this covenant, with the ratio 
at the year end being 26:1.
The Group has entered into interest rate derivative contracts to convert 
the ﬁ xed rate payable on its bonds and the US Private Placement note 
to a ﬂ oating rate of interest. The ﬂ oating interest rates paid by the Group 
under its ﬁ nancing arrangements are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR 
plus a margin. The margins were not changed during the year. Under 
the terms of the ﬁ nancing agreements, the margins are ﬁ xed and are 
not subject to change in line with credit ratings or ﬁ nancial ratios.
Financial risk management
Kingﬁ sher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for managing 
certain ﬁ nancial risks to which the Group is exposed, details of which 
are provided in note 24 of the accounts.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and –
retain ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility in order to continue to provide returns 
for shareholders and beneﬁ ts for other stakeholders; and
To maintain a solid investment grade credit rating. –
The Group manages its capital by:
Continued focus on free cash ﬂ ow generation; –
Setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the context –
of current year and forecast free cash ﬂ ow generation;
Rigorous review of capital investments and post investment reviews –
to drive better returns; and 
Monitoring the level of the Group’s ﬁ nancial and leasehold debt in –
the context of Group performance and its credit rating.

Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
The Group is subject to certain externally imposed capital requirements 
as follows:
Kingﬁ sher Insurance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, is –
subject to minimum capital requirements as a consequence of 
its insurance activities; and
Certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of B&Q (China) B.V., a wholly –
owned subsidiary, are subject to minimum capital requirements 
under Chinese statute.
The Group complied with the externally imposed capital requirements 
during the year.
Property
The Group owns a signiﬁ cant property portfolio, most of which is 
used for trading purposes. If the Group had continued to revalue this 
it would have had a market value of £3.3 billion at year end (2009/10: 
£3.0 billion), compared to the net book value of £2.7 billion recorded 
in the ﬁ nancial statements. 
The values are based on valuations performed by external qualiﬁ ed 
valuers where the key assumption is the estimated yields. The valuation 
exercise was performed in October 2010 with approximately one third 
of the portfolio valued by external professional valuers.
Pensions
At the year end, the Group had a deﬁ cit of £58 million in relation to 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension arrangements of which £21 million is in relation 
to its UK Scheme. In 2009/10 the Group had a deﬁ cit of £198 million.
The approach used to prepare the pension valuation is in line with 
current market practice and international accounting standards, and 
has been applied consistently. This uses a number of assumptions 
which are likely to ﬂ uctuate in the future and so may have a signiﬁ cant 
effect on the accounting valuation of the scheme’s assets and liabilities.
The decrease in the deﬁ cit was predominantly due to asset returns and 
changes to the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to value 
the pension obligation. 
The valuation is very sensitive to ﬁ nancial and demographic 
assumptions. To aid understanding of the impact that changes to the 
assumptions could have on the pension obligation, we have included 
sensitivity analysis as part of the pension disclosure in note 27 of the 
accounts. Further details of all the key assumptions are also contained 
within the note.
Changes in the mortality assumptions and updated membership data 
reﬂ ect work done as part of the triennial funding valuation of the UK 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme undertaken as at 31 March 2010.
In line with the valuations undertaken in 2004 and 2007, the Group 
chooses to take a longer view when looking at the funding of the 
pension scheme, and funding levels are set on a 20-30 year horizon 
with a target of full funding of the scheme on a prudent basis at this 
point in time. A similar approach has been adopted for this year’s 
valuation, with the aim of keeping the Group’s annual contributions 
to the scheme at a level broadly consistent with previous years.
This has been achieved principally by the introduction of property 
security held in a partnership, giving the pension scheme recourse to 
the property assets in the event of Kingﬁ sher’s insolvency. The scheme 
will receive a regular income stream from the partnership that forms part 
of the annual cash contribution from the Group to the pension scheme 
under the schedule of contributions.
UK property assets with a market value of £83 million were sold to the 
partnership and leased back to B&Q plc under standard commercial 
lease terms. The Group retains control over these properties, including 
the ﬂ exibility to substitute alternatives. The trustee’s partnership interest 
entitles it to the majority of the income of the partnership over the next 
20 years. At the end of this term, Kingﬁ sher plc has the option to acquire 
the trustee’s partnership interest.
The assets and activities of the partnership are consolidated within the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements by virtue of its control over the partnership. 
Under IFRS, the investment held by the scheme in the partnership does 
not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements. Accordingly, the pension deﬁ cit position recorded 
in the Group ﬁ nancial statements does not reﬂ ect the scheme’s 
investment in the partnership. The future payments to be made to the 
scheme by the partnership will be reﬂ ected as pension contributions 
in the Group ﬁ nancial statements on a cash basis.
The Group will obtain the normal tax deduction for the cash contribution 
made to the scheme during the current year which will be spread over 
the next four years.
A further two UK properties with a combined market value of £116 million 
are likely to be transferred to the partnership during 2011/12, and leased 
back to B&Q plc. The pension trustee may choose to make a further 
investment in the partnership at this time.

Risks
Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
Given the scale and diversity of our businesses, the Board of Directors recognises that the nature, scope and potential impact of our key business 
and strategic risks is subject to constant change. As such, the Board has implemented the necessary framework to ensure that it has sufﬁ cient 
visibility of the Group’s key risks and the opportunity to regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our mitigating controls and strategies.
The Corporate governance report on pages 35 to 40 describes the systems and processes through which the directors manage and mitigate risks.
The Board considers that the principal risks to achieving its objectives are set out below.
Risk Action
1: Sustainable model for emerging markets.
Although the Company has established a strong market share 
and brand presence in our key emerging markets there is a risk 
that we do not develop a sustainable business model that will 
deliver long term opportunities for growth and the desired return 
on invested capital. 
In both Turkey and Poland we beneﬁ t from clear market leadership 
positions supported by strong management teams and robust business 
models.
Our Russian business has seen a step change in leadership capabilities 
and store investment programme. We continue to focus on ensuring we 
have the right disciplines, processes and customer offer to deliver 
a sustainable long-term return.
We have delivered the ﬁ rst phase of our turnaround in China and with 
continued improvements in performance we remain on track to eliminate 
losses during 2011/12.
2: The fragility of economic recovery continues to 
undermine consumer conﬁ dence and restricts 
opportunities for growth.
Uncertainty surrounding the resilience of the global economy and 
the ongoing effectiveness of ﬁ scal stimulus and monetary 
measures continue to impact consumer conﬁ dence and present a 
difﬁ cult trading outlook across the retail sector, particularly in terms 
of delivering opportunities for growth.
The Group is focused on self-help actions to manage in difﬁ cult 
economic environments.
Strong self-help measures and cash generation throughout 2010 have 
contributed to the robust health of our balance sheet and available funding. 
With the ongoing availability of undrawn bank facilities and the recovery 
of the bond markets, we are conﬁ dent that we have sufﬁ cient ﬁ nancial 
ﬂ exibility to mitigate the impact of any worsening of the economic climate. 
3: We fail to take advantage of our combined buying power 
synergies and economies of scale.
There is a risk that we fail to ‘unlock’ the potential to generate real 
shareholder value through the optimisation of combined 
purchasing and commercial synergies.
2010 has seen a signiﬁ cant increase in our direct sourcing initiatives 
across the Group and direct sourcing through the Kingﬁ sher Sourcing 
Organisation now totals US$1.3 billion. 
A new Group Commercial Board has been set up to deliver a challenging 
programme to drive an increased alignment of products and ranges 
across businesses. Key steps within this programme will include:
implementing common and own brand ranges between the UK and –
France from which the rest of the Group can also select
continued investment in direct sourcing to support the common range –
and own brand development
a step change in product innovation investment in uniquely developed –
product, available across the Group
4: Our systems and supply chain infrastructures lack the 
ﬂ exibility and capability to support the delivery of our 
strategic plans.
Our continued investment in delivering new and innovative 
products and solutions to our customers will continue to place 
increasing demands on our existing supply chain and systems 
infrastructure.
There is a risk that our infrastructure will lack the necessary 
scalability, ﬂ exibility and resilience to support its successful 
execution. 
This is particularly relevant to our operating companies in 
developing markets which may not yet have the necessary 
logistics infrastructure and capabilities in place to accommodate 
our ambitious direct sourcing plans. 
We have a programme to ensure that we focus our information 
technology resources on both maintaining or extending the useful lives of 
our existing technologies and developing solutions that support revenue 
generative opportunities and productivity initiatives.
Where possible, we are also seeking to eliminate complex or heavily 
bespoke technologies to reduce our running costs. 
We continue to invest in our supply chain infrastructures to support our 
growth plans. In 2010 we made important enhancements to our supply 
chain capabilities and facilities in Poland, China and Turkey and, in 2011, 
will be making a signiﬁ cant investment in our distribution facilities in 
the UK.

Risk Action
5: We fail to adapt our formats and models to meet ongoing 
changes in consumer trends, particularly given the impact 
of developments in the multi-channel sphere.
Across our businesses we operate in increasingly sophisticated 
and changing markets. Our customers are increasingly using the 
internet more interactively not just to make purchases but also to 
seek inspiration and ideas for their homes.
The ability to offer our customers a full and compelling multi-
channel offering in terms of products, ideas, delivery options and 
innovations is becoming increasingly important and there is a risk 
that if we fail to capitalise on the continued growth of the internet 
and invest in multi-channel technologies we will lose market share 
to both traditional home improvement and new online competitors. 
Improving our multi-channel offer forms a core component of how we 
develop our customer proposition and we are investing to ensure we fully 
exploit not only our multi-channel capabilities, but also to ensure that we 
stay at the forefront of how to connect and engage with our customers 
through social media and 3G technology.
We also continue to invest to improve the quality and depth of our 
knowledge and understanding of customer insights and market trends.
6: Impact of a major health and safety failure affects our 
reputation and results in harm to our employees, penalties 
or prosecution.
There is a risk that repeated health and safety failures could result 
in a major incident that is directly attributable to either a systematic 
or institutionalised failure in our health and safety management 
systems. This would result in damage to our reputation through 
adverse publicity, prosecution and censure.
With 80,000 employees and six million customers visiting over 850 
stores each week, robust health and safety systems are a priority. The 
Board is committed to creating and sustaining a safe environment for 
both our staff and customers and regularly review and challenge health 
and safety performance, standards and targets across our businesses.
Kingﬁ sher’s Corporate Centre is also responsible for facilitating the 
sharing of health and safety best practice between the Group’s 
businesses and the development of minimum Group standards, 
which in some cases will be stricter than local regulatory requirements. 
While regulatory requirements vary from country to country, each 
operating company is required to designate a director with speciﬁ c 
responsibility for health and safety. 
This person is then responsible for ensuring that a written health and 
safety policy is communicated to all staff, that appropriate health and 
safety arrangements are in place to protect our employees and that we 
comply with local regulatory requirements. The ultimate responsibility 
within each operating company remains with the local managing director.
7: We do not make the necessary investment in our people 
to ensure that we have the appropriate calibre of staff, 
skills and experiences across the Group.
Retail is a people business and there is a risk that, given economic 
pressures, we fail to maintain the necessary investment in our 
people to ensure that we have the appropriate calibre of staff for 
speciﬁ c roles and that skills and experiences are deployed in the 
best interests of the individual, the operating company and 
the Group.
We continue to invest in our people across the organisation and 
are committed to ensuring that our people are given opportunities 
to develop themselves to the beneﬁ t of the organisation and 
our customers.
This is done through a wide range of development opportunities ranging 
from store-based training programmes, supported by the delivery of 
nationally accredited and recognised qualiﬁ cations and apprenticeship 
schemes, to leadership academy programmes for our senior managers.
We have also introduced new elements to our share-based long-term 
incentive plans across our business, to ensure that senior management 
rewards are aligned with our targeted performance and earnings growth. 
We also remain committed to the ongoing assessment and 
measurement of our people’s engagement with the business and 
engagement surveys are completed across the Group.

Risks
Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
Risk Action
8: The risk of penalties or punitive damages arising from 
failure to comply with legislative or regulatory 
requirements.
The geographic, political and cultural diversity of the markets in 
which we operate exposes us to wide ranging and complex legal 
and regulatory frameworks. 
There is a danger that we do not understand the risks associated 
with either existing or proposed changes to legislative 
requirements across the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Individual operating companies, supported where necessary by the legal 
and corporate responsibility department, are responsible for ensuring that 
they have access to sufﬁ cient legal and governance resource.
Operational management are also responsible for liaising with either 
local legal resources or the corporate affairs department to resolve any 
potential issues arising from new legislation or any suspected breaches 
of existing legislation or Group policies.
Where new operating companies are either acquired or created, formal 
Group-deﬁ ned governance structures are established from the outset. 
At a minimum, these provide guidance regarding Board and Audit 
Committee processes and procedures, the implementation of which 
are subject to a review by the Legal and Corporate Responsibility Director 
and the internal audit department.
9: The potential impact to Kingﬁ sher’s reputation, arising 
from a major ethical or environmental failure.
As our customers become more knowledgeable about the 
environmental and social impact of our businesses, we are 
increasingly being asked to provide both products and product 
information that support our intent to operate an environmentally 
sustainable and ethically responsible business. As a result, the 
risks to our reputation, arising from a major environmental or 
ethical failure, increase exponentially.
Kingﬁ sher is committed to a long-term investment in promoting ethics, 
social responsibility and environmental sustainability.
Kingﬁ sher’s Future Homes strategy sets out a policy and framework 
for integrating sustainability into the business, and includes speciﬁ c 
standards and targets for all operating companies.
A Corporate Responsibility (CR) risk assessment tool has been 
developed to help our operating companies identify and manage CR 
risks and opportunities.
We also engage with key non-governmental organisations and industry 
forums (e.g. Forum for the Future, FTSE4Good and Business in the 
Community) to ensure that we are at the forefront of the environmental 
debate and assume a leadership position amongst our peers.
For more details see the Corporate Responsibility section on page 18.
10. We do not implement the measures and disciplines to 
effectively assess the shareholder value delivered through 
the Delivering Value programme.
The successful execution of the Delivering Value programme is the 
basis on which we will assess our progress in delivering our key 
priorities of managing working capital, cash, costs, investment 
capital and returns to our shareholders. 
There is a risk that we do not implement effective criteria against 
which to monitor, manage and report our progress in achieving 
the programme’s aims and objectives.
Appropriate corporate planning processes are in place to ensure that our 
operating company and divisional strategies are aligned and contribute 
to the Delivering Value programme.

Employees
The commitment of the Group’s employees is vital to ensure that high

business. The Group is fully committed to treating its employees and 
customers with dignity and respect, and to valuing diversity. It is Group 
policy to:
ensure there is no discrimination in employment on the grounds –
of race, gender, age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or 
religious belief; 
implement measures in stores to ensure a level of customer service –
for disabled people equivalent to that offered to non-disabled people; 
and

give feedback on the Group’s performance and ensure that all 
customer comments are analysed, responded to and acted upon.

Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
Directors’ report
Charitable donations 
Kingﬁ sher and its subsidiaries made contributions to charity/community 
projects worth an estimated £1,598,000 (2009/10: £941,000) during the 
ﬁ nancial year ended 29 January 2011 – equivalent to 0.2% of pre-tax 
proﬁ ts. This included cash donations (£952,000) and gifts-in-kind 
(£443,000 – retail cost). Support was also given through the donation 
of time by employees (£203,000). 
Political donations 
The Board annually seeks and obtains shareholders’ approval to enable 
the Group to make donations or incur expenditure in relation to EU 
political parties, other political organisations or independent election 
candidates under section 366 of the Companies Act 2006. The approval 
given in 2010 restricted such expenditure to an aggregate limit of 
£75,000 during the period of 12 months following the date of the 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Group has made no political donations during the year (2009/10: Nil). 
As with previous annual approvals, the Group has no intention of 
changing its current policy and practice of not making political donations 
and will not do so without the speciﬁ c endorsement of shareholders. 
The Board obtains the approval on a precautionary basis to avoid 
any possibility of unintentionally breaching the relevant provisions.
Supplier payment policy
The Company does not impose standard payment terms on its 
suppliers but agrees speciﬁ c terms with each of them, and then pays in 
accordance with those terms. On average, the Company’s suppliers are 
paid in 45 days.
Signiﬁ cant agreements – change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such 
as bank loan agreements, Medium Term Note (‘MTN’) documentation, 
private placement debt and employee share plans. None of these are 
deemed to be signiﬁ cant in terms of their potential impact on the 
business of the Group as a whole except for: 
the £500 million credit facility dated 15 March 2005 between, –
the Company, HSBC Bank plc (as the facility agent) and the banks 
named therein as lenders, which contains a provision such that in the 
event of a change of control, any lender may, if they so require, notify 
the agent that they wish to cancel their commitment whereupon the 
commitment of that lender will be cancelled and all their outstanding 
loans, together with accrued interest, will become immediately due 
and payable;
the US$297 million US Private Placement notes, issued pursuant to –
a note purchase agreement dated 24 May 2006 by the Company to 
various institutions, which contains a provision such that in the event 
of a change of control, the Company is required to make an offer to 
the holders of the US Private Placement notes to prepay the principal 
amount of the notes together with interest accrued; and
the €200 million MTNs, issued on 23 November 2005 under –
the Group’s €2,500 million MTN programme by the Company to 
various institutions, which contains an option such that in the event 
of a change of control and, as a result of the change of control, the 
Company’s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade 
(BBB – or equivalent) any holder of the MTNs may require the 
Company to prepay the principal amount of that note together 
with interest accrued.
The Company does not have agreements with any director or ofﬁ cer 
that would provide compensation for loss of ofﬁ ce or employment 
resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company’s share 
incentive schemes may cause options and awards granted under such 
schemes to vest on a takeover.
There is no information that the Company would be required to disclose 
about persons with whom it has contractual or other arrangements 
which are essential to the business of the Company. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out in note 28 
of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. All of the Company’s issued 
ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank equally in all respects.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, 
in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained 
from the Company’s website or by writing to the Company Secretary. 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings 
of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on the 
exercise of voting rights attached to them, except (i) where the Company 
has exercised its right to suspend their voting rights or to prohibit their 
transfer following the omission of their holder or any person interested 
in them to provide the Company with information requested by it in 
accordance with Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006 or (ii) where their 
holder is precluded from exercising voting rights by the Financial Services 
Authority Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
The Company has a Sponsored Level 1 American Deposit Receipt 
(‘ADR’) programme in the United States. 
Financial instruments
The Group’s ﬁ nancial risk management objectives and policies are set 
out within note 24 to the ﬁ nancial statements on pages 81 to 83. Note 24 
also details the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange, interest, credit 
and liquidity risks. These notes are included by reference and form part

Directors’ statement 
of responsibility
Going concern
The directors conﬁ rm that, after reviewing expenditure commitments, 
expected cash ﬂ ows and borrowing facilities, they have a reasonable 
expectation that Kingﬁ sher plc (the ‘Company’) and the Kingﬁ sher 
Group of companies (the ‘Group’) have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the next ﬁ nancial year and the foreseeable 
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing these ﬁ nancial statements. Further details of the Group’s 
liquidity are detailed in the ﬁ nancial review on page 19.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this report 
conﬁ rms that: so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as deﬁ ned by section 391(2) of the Companies Act 2006) of 
which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and each director has taken 
all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director in order to 
make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Responsibility for preparing ﬁ nancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
UK company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements 
for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article four of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare 
the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁ ed that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and 
of the proﬁ t or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements, the directors are 
required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; –
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable –
and prudent;
follow applicable UK Accounting Standards (except where any –
departures from this requirement are explained in the notes to 
the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements); and
prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis –
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with IAS1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; –
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that –
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁ c –
requirements in IFRS are insufﬁ cient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s ﬁ nancial position and ﬁ nancial performance; and
make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a –
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁ nancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
The directors conﬁ rm that to the best of their knowledge:
the ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant –
ﬁ nancial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
the business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, –
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Corporate governance
The Board is committed to the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance and recognises that 
effective governance is fundamental 
to enabling the business to deliver 
its strategy whilst generating 
shareholder value and safeguarding 
shareholders’ long-term interests.
In accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the 
Board conﬁ rms that throughout the year ended 29 January 2011, and as 
at the date of this Annual Report, the Company has been in compliance 
with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the UK Financial 
Reporting Council’s 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(the ‘Combined Code’). This report together with the Directors’ Report 
on pages 31 to 33, and the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 41 
to 53 provides details of how the Company has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions of the Combined Code. A copy of the 
Combined Code is available at www.frc.org.uk.
UK corporate governance code
An updated version of the UK Corporate Governance Code (formerly 
the Combined Code) was published on 28 May 2010 (the ‘New Code’). 
The New Code will apply to the reporting periods beginning on or after 
29 June 2010 and will therefore apply to the Company for the ﬁ nancial 
year commencing 30 January 2011. A copy of the New Code is available 
at www.frc.org.uk.
The Board has conducted an initial review of the New Code and has 
identiﬁ ed a number of principles which it has chosen to adopt voluntarily 
in advance of its introduction, and those areas which will require further 
review and/or changes during the next year. The Board has agreed to 
voluntarily adopt the following principles ahead of the implementation 
of the New Code:
all directors will stand for re-appointment at the Company’s Annual –
General Meetings with effect from 2011; and
the performance of the Board will be externally facilitated at least once –
every three years, commencing with the review carried out in 2010.
A number of key changes in the New Code have been identiﬁ ed as 
relevant to the Company. The Board have agreed to conduct a detailed 
review of all aspects of the revised principles of the New Code and will 
provide details of this review in the next Annual Report.
The Board
The Board leads and controls the Group’s business and its powers 
are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, which are available 
at www.kingﬁ sher.com. The Board has ﬁ nal responsibility for the 
management, direction and performance of the Group and is accountable 
to the Company’s shareholders for the proper conduct of the business.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁ cally reserved for its 
approval. The schedule is reviewed periodically and includes, but is not 
limited to, the following matters:
Group strategy, three-year plans and annual budgets; –
major capital expenditure, acquisitions or divestments; –
major changes to the capital structure including tax and –
treasury management;
major changes to accounting policies or practices; –
approval of all ﬁ nancial announcements, the Annual Report and –
accounts and shareholder communications;
approval of any interim dividends and recommendation of the –
ﬁ nal dividend;
the system of internal control and risk management policy; and –
review of management development strategy. –
The Board has delegated authority to standing Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees to carry out certain tasks as deﬁ ned in 
their written terms of reference. Each Committee reports to, and has its 
terms of reference approved by, the Board. The minutes of Committee 
meetings are circulated to, and reviewed by, the Board. Additional 
information on the responsibilities of each of the Board’s Committees 
is set out on pages 38 and 39.
Board meetings
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings throughout the year. 
Unscheduled supplementary meetings may also take place as and 
when necessary. These meetings are structured to allow open 
discussion. At each meeting the Board receives certain regular reports; 
an update from the Group Chief Executive, current trading/ﬁ nance 
(including liquidity) reports from the Group Finance Director, capital 
expenditure approvals and reports from the Company Secretary 
(including governance, legal, insurance and risk, and corporate 
responsibility updates) and the Group HR Director.
All directors participate in discussing the strategy, trading and ﬁ nancial 
performance and risk management of the Group. Comprehensive 
brieﬁ ng papers are circulated to all directors approximately one week 
before each meeting. Directors who are unable to attend a particular 
meeting receive relevant brieﬁ ng papers, are given the opportunity to 
discuss any issues with the Chairman or the Group Chief Executive and, 
where possible, participate by telephone for critical discussions and 
approvals on speciﬁ c matters.
The Board generally meets at the Group’s Head Ofﬁ ce in London and 
holds at least one meeting each year overseas. During the ﬁ nancial year 
under review, the Board held meetings in Warsaw, Poland and Toulouse, 
France. In addition, at least once per year, the Board holds a meeting off 
site, which focuses on presentations from the UK executive team and 
includes visits to stores.

The Senior Independent Director, John Nelson, supports the Chairman and 
is available for approach or representation from signiﬁ cant shareholders 
who may feel they are unable to raise issues with the Chairman. 
During the year, the Board considered the independence of each of 
the non-executive directors (other than the Chairman, who was deemed 
independent by the Board at the date of his appointment) against the 
criteria speciﬁ ed in the Combined Code and concluded that each remained 
fully independent. The continuing independence of John Nelson, who 
has served as a non-executive director for nine years, was subject to 
rigorous review and the Board concluded that he remained independent.
Phil Bentley retired as a non-executive director in March 2010 and 
Michael Hepher, who served on the Board as non-executive director for 
12 years, retired at the conclusion of the 2010 Annual General Meeting. 
Board appointments
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new directors to the Board and this is described in the section on the 
Nomination Committee on page 38. The procedure was followed during 
the selection and appointment of Andrew Bonﬁ eld, Pascal Cagni and 
Clare Chapman who joined the Board as non-executive directors on 
11 February 2010, 17 November 2010 and 2 December 2010 respectively. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of each of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce 
and will also be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting 
for at least 15 minutes before the meeting until its conclusion. 
At the request of any non-executive director, the Chairman will arrange 
meetings consisting of only the non-executive directors to allow the 
opportunity for any concerns to be raised. During the year, the Chairman 
maintained regular contact and met with the Senior Independent 
Director and other non-executive directors.
Board balance and independence
The Board is made up of two executive directors, six non-executive 
directors and a non-executive Chairman. The current balance of the 
Board with its skills, experience and knowledge, together with regular 
brieﬁ ngs by executives below Board level, ensures that views, perceptions 
and discussions are not dominated by any speciﬁ c executive view. The 
executive and non-executive directors have overall collective responsibility 
for the direction of the Company. The current directors’ biographical 
details are set out on page 29.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the Group Chief Executive, which are set out in writing and have been 
approved by the Board. The Chairman, Daniel Bernard, is responsible 
for the overall operation, leadership and governance of the Board. He is 
also responsible for ensuring that all members of the Board develop an 
understanding of the views of major shareholders and that there is an 
open dialogue with shareholders. The Group Chief Executive, Ian Cheshire, 
is responsible for all executive management of the Group’s business, 
consistent with the strategy and commercial objectives agreed by 
the Board.

2010/11
The ICSA facilitator met with each director on an individual basis to 
obtain their views on ﬁ ve aspects of the Board’s performance and to 
ascertain whether their needs and expectations were being met. The 
evaluator ensured that pre-deﬁ ned constituent elements of each topic 
were covered in the discussions and a qualitative score was assigned 
by each director. The ﬁ ve topics were as follows:
board role and responsibilities; –
oversight; –
board composition; –
working together; and –
outcome and achievements. –
The results of the evaluation were considered by the Board at its 
meeting in February 2011 and the meeting considered and noted the 
recommendations to be included in the Board’s overall objectives for 
the following year.
The report concluded that, as a whole, the Board was functioning 
well, that the contribution and commitment of each director, and their 
interaction with each other, was good and that the non-executives as 
a group offered robust challenge where appropriate. 
The Board has conﬁ rmed that the contribution of each of the directors 
continues to be effective and that shareholders should be supportive 
of their re-appointment. The biographical details of all directors seeking 
re-appointment at the 2011 Annual General Meeting are set out on 
page 29.
The Board will continue to review its procedures, effectiveness and 
development in the year ahead and the Chairman will use the output of 
the most recent Board evaluation in his individual meetings with directors 
during the year.
In addition, the Group Chief Executive carried out a performance review 
of the Group Finance Director. The non-executive directors, led by the 
Senior Independent Director, conducted the performance review of the 
Chairman in respect of the ﬁ nancial year.
Conﬂ icts of interest
The Company has robust procedures in place to identify, authorise 
and manage conﬂ icts of interest, and these procedures have operated 
effectively during the year. A register of directors’ conﬂ icts is maintained 
by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the Board on an annual 
basis. The Board is aware of the other commitments of its directors 
and any changes to these commitments are reported to the Board.
Information and professional development
All new directors appointed to the Board receive an induction pack 
in addition to a comprehensive induction programme tailored to their 
experience, background and particular areas of focus, which is designed 
to develop their knowledge and understanding of the Group’s operations 
and culture. In particular, the programme includes:
individual one-to-one meetings with the Chairman, the Group –
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and other directors;
site visits to the Group’s stores and those of its competitors; –
meetings with operating company management and other senior –
management; and 
external training courses at the Group’s expense, if required. –
Subsequent training in speciﬁ c aspects of the Group’s businesses are 
provided to directors, when requested, or regularly as part of site visits. 
Directors are briefed on issues arising at Board and Committee meetings 
and have full and timely access to relevant information ahead of 
each meeting.
The Board also receives regular reports addressing issues and concerns 
raised by the Company’s institutional shareholders. This process allows 
the directors to develop the necessary understanding of the views of 
these shareholders and also enables the Board to judge whether 
investors have a sufﬁ cient understanding of the Group’s objectives.
As well as planned development and brieﬁ ngs, directors are also 
expected to take responsibility for identifying their own individual needs 
and to take necessary steps to ensure that they are adequately informed 
about the Group and their responsibilities as a director. The Board is 
conﬁ dent that all its members have the knowledge, ability and experience 
to perform the functions required of a director of a listed company.
There is also an agreed procedure whereby directors may take 
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties.
Board performance evaluation
The evaluation of the performance of the Board during the ﬁ nancial 
year was undertaken by an external facilitator. Following a review of 
proposals from three external facilitators, the Board appointed ICSA 
Board Evaluation to facilitate a review of its performance.

Remuneration Committee
A report detailing the work of the Remuneration Committee during the 
year is set out on pages 41 to 53.
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee are:
Daniel Bernard (Chairman) –
Andrew Bonﬁ eld (appointed 11 February 2010) –
Pascal Cagni (appointed 17 November 2010) –
Clare Chapman (appointed 2 December 2010) –
Anders Dahlvig –
Janis Kong –
John Nelson –
The primary purpose of the Nomination Committee is to lead the 
process for Board appointments and to make recommendations for 
maintaining an appropriate balance of skills on the Board. In particular, 
the Nomination Committee:
reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board and makes –
recommendations to the Board, as appropriate;
identiﬁ es the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the –
Board and nominates candidates to ﬁ ll Board vacancies;
reviews the time required from the non-executive directors; –
considers succession planning, taking into account the challenges –
and opportunities facing the Group and the future skills and expertise 
needed on the Board; and
reviews the leadership needs of the organisation, both executive and –
non-executive, with a view to ensuring the continued ability of the 
organisation to compete effectively in the marketplace.
The Nomination Committee meets periodically when required and 
external advisers may be invited to attend. Following a rigorous search 
and selection process carried out with the assistance of specialist 
recruitment consultants, the Nomination Committee considered the 
proposed appointments of Andrew Bonﬁ eld, Pascal Cagni and Clare 
Chapman as additional non-executive directors. In making its appointment 
recommendations to the Board, the Nomination Committee reviewed 
the overall balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on the 
Board against current and future requirements of the Company. The 
Board believes that its current composition represents a strong, well 
balanced Board with specialists in retail, technology, ﬁ nance and 
human resources.
Committees
The Board has delegated authority to its Committees to carry out certain 
tasks as deﬁ ned in each Committee’s respective terms of reference. The 
written terms of reference in respect of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees are available on the Company’s website and 
copies are available upon application to the Company Secretary at 
the Company’s registered ofﬁ ce.
Minutes of Committee meetings are made available to all directors on 
a timely basis and the chairmen of the principal Committees provide 
updates to the Board at subsequent Board meetings. The Board is 
satisﬁ ed that the terms of reference for each of these Committees satisfy 
the requirements of the Combined Code and are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Details of each Committee, including membership, are set out in 
the following reports:

without management being present. Further details on the work of the 
Audit Committee can be found under Auditors and the Audit Committee 
Report on pages 40 and 54 respectively.

Internal control
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The responsibility 
for designing, operating and monitoring the system and the maintenance 
of effective control is delegated to the management of each operating 
company. However, such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board has approved a set of policies, procedures and frameworks 
for effective internal control that implement the Turnbull Guidance, ‘Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’, for the 
year under review and to the date of approval of this Annual Report. 
These procedures are subject to regular review and provide an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁ cant risks 
faced by the Group.
There are clear processes for controlling and monitoring the system 
of internal control and reporting any signiﬁ cant control failings or 
weaknesses together with details of corrective action. These include:
a formal quarterly conﬁ rmation provided by the managing director –
and ﬁ nance director of each operating company certifying the 
operation of their control systems and highlighting any weaknesses, 
the results of which are reviewed by regional management, the Audit 
Committee and the Board;
an annual planning process and regular ﬁ nancial reporting, comparing –
results with plan and the previous year on a monthly and cumulative 
basis;
written reports from the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance –
Director are submitted at each Board meeting;
operating company management report formally to the Audit –
Committee regularly on the control environment in their business and 
actions taken to maintain or improve the environment as appropriate; 
and
reports and presentations are received by the Board on certain areas –
of specialist risk. These include treasury, insurance and pensions.
The internal audit function follows a planned programme of reviews that 
are aligned to the Group’s risks. The function:
works with the operating companies to develop, improve and embed –
risk management tools and processes into their business operations; 
reports directly to the Audit Committee and has the authority to –
review any relevant part of the Group;
oversees the operation of the individual operating businesses’ audit –
committees; and
provides the Audit Committee and the Board with objective –
assurance on the control environment across the Group.
Retail Board
The Retail Board consists of the ﬁ ve members of the Group Executive 
(the executive directors and three divisional chief executives) and certain 
other Group functional heads. The Group Executive, whose biographical 
details are set out on page 30, meets formally up to 12 times a year 
under the chairmanship of the Group Chief Executive. The remaining 
members of the Retail Board, whose biographical details are also set 
out on page 30, participate in at least four meetings per year and other 
meetings upon invitation.
The Group Executive, supported by the Retail Board, are primarily 
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group’s businesses 
and the overall ﬁ nancial performance of the Group against its strategic 
plans and budget. 
The Retail Board are responsible for reviewing and making 
recommendations to the Board on:
strategic, and business plans of individual businesses; –
monthly Group trading performance; –
the individual progress of operating companies; –
the Group’s capital structure and funding; –
capital expenditure proposals, major acquisitions or disposals –
of businesses;
the Group’s key risks; –
management development and senior executive succession plans; –
and
the Group’s corporate responsibility programme. –
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Board and its 
Committees and, with the consent of the Board, may delegate 
responsibility for the administration of the Committees to other suitably 
qualiﬁ ed staff. The Company Secretary is also responsible for ensuring 
that the correct Board procedures are followed and advises the Board 
on legal and corporate governance matters. All directors have access to 
the advice and services of the Company Secretary and his appointment 
and removal is one of the matters reserved to the Board.
Accountability, risk management and internal control
The Board considers risk assessment, identiﬁ cation of mitigating actions 
and internal control to be fundamental to achieving the Group’s strategic 
corporate objectives. The Board of directors has overall responsibility 
for the Group’s system of internal control and risk management.
Risk management
The Group’s enterprise-wide risk management and reporting process 
helps Group management to identify, assess, prioritise and mitigate risk. 
Management at each operating company has responsibility for the 
identiﬁ cation and evaluation of the signiﬁ cant risks applicable to their 
business and any mitigating actions to be taken. The Retail Board 
reviews, identiﬁ es and evaluates the risks that are signiﬁ cant at a Group 
level as well as the mitigating actions against those risks. These are then 
considered by the Board. The type of risks identiﬁ ed include strategic 
risk, external factors (such as competition, environment and regulation), 
change management programmes, health and safety, retention of key 
management and macro market risks.

Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and 
operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
of achieving the desired control objectives. Management is required to 
apply judgement in evaluating the risks facing the Group in achieving its 
objectives, in determining the risks that are considered acceptable to 
bear, in assessing the likelihood of the risks concerned materialising, in 
identifying the Group’s ability to reduce the incidence and impact on the 
business of risks that do materialise and in ensuring the costs of operating 
particular controls are proportionate to the beneﬁ t.
The Board conﬁ rms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of the internal 
control system, including ﬁ nancial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management in accordance with the Combined Code for the 
period from 31 January 2010 to the date of approval of this Annual Report. 
If signiﬁ cant losses were to be incurred during the year as a result of a 
failure of controls, a detailed report would be provided to the Audit 
Committee and Board. The Board conﬁ rms that no signiﬁ cant 
weaknesses were identiﬁ ed in relation to the review carried out 
during the year and therefore no remedial action is required.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP were appointed as the external auditors to the Group in 2009. 
A resolution proposing the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as external 
auditors to the Group will be put to the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Each of the Group’s businesses is consulted on the effectiveness and 
independence of the external auditors annually. In addition, the external 
auditors provide the Audit Committee with a schedule of each matter on 
which there was an initial difference between them and management in 
relation to the accounting treatment, and with the ﬁ nal decisions on 
these issues. The Audit Committee is satisﬁ ed with the effectiveness 
and independence of the external auditors.
In addition to their statutory duties, the services of Deloitte LLP are 
also engaged where, as a result of its position as external auditor, it 
either must, or is best placed to, perform the work in question. This 
is primarily work in relation to matters such as shareholder circulars, 
Group borrowings, tax advice, regulatory ﬁ lings and certain business 
acquisitions and disposals. Other work is awarded on the basis of 
competitive tendering.
The Group has a policy on the use of its external auditors for non-audit 
work and this is regularly reviewed. The external auditors are precluded 
from engaging in non-audit services that would compromise their 
independence or violate any laws or regulations affecting their 
appointment as external auditors. The approval of the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee is required prior to awarding contracts for non-audit 
services to the external auditors, where in excess of speciﬁ ed amounts. 
The external auditors report to the Audit Committee annually on their 
independence from the Company. Periodic rotation of key audit partners 
is also required.
During the year, Deloitte LLP charged the Group £1.4m (2009/10: £1.3m) 
for audit and audit-related services and a further £0.3m (2009/10: £0.3m) 
for non-audit services during the year. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company is committed to communicating its strategy and activities 
clearly to its shareholders and, to that end, maintains an active dialogue 
with investors through a planned programme of investor relations 
activities. The investor relations programme includes:
formal presentations of full-year and interim results; –
conference calls to discuss quarterly trading statements; –
regular meetings between institutional investors and senior –
management to ensure that the investor community receives a 
balanced and complete view of the Group’s performance and the 
issues faced by the Group;
hosting investors’ and analysts’ sessions at which senior management –
from relevant operating companies deliver presentations which 
provide an overview of their individual businesses;
responding to enquiries from shareholders through the Company’s –
investor relations team;
regular meetings with institutional investors and analysts by the –
Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director to discuss 
business performance; and
a section dedicated to shareholders on the Company’s website. –
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the chairmen 
of the Board’s Committees are available to meet major investors on 
request. The Senior Independent Director has a speciﬁ c responsibility to 
be available to shareholders who have concerns, and for whom contact 
with the Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director 
has either failed to resolve their concerns, or for whom such contact 
is inappropriate.
Annual General Meeting
The principal means of communication with private investors is by 
electronic communications and through the Annual General Meeting, 
an occasion attended by all the Company’s directors and at which 
all shareholders present are given the opportunity to question the 
Chairman and the directors as well as the chairmen of the Board 
Committees. After the Annual General Meeting, shareholders have 
the opportunity to meet informally with directors. 
A summary business presentation is given at the Annual General 
Meeting before the Chairman deals with the formal business of the 
meeting. At the Annual General Meeting in June 2011, the Chairman 
will use his discretion to call for a poll on all resolutions. The results 
of the votes in relation to all resolutions will be disclosed to those in 
attendance at the meeting, published on the Company’s website and 
announced via the regulatory new service shortly after the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) and has been prepared in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’) issued 
under the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) and describes how the Board 
has applied the principles relating to directors’ remuneration set out in 
the Combined Code, and complied with the Financial Services Authority 
Listing Rules.
This report sets out the policy for the year just ended, the forthcoming 
year, and subject to ongoing review by the Committee, subsequent 
years. A resolution will be put to the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 16 June 2011 asking them to approve this report.
Highlights
Since the appointment of Ian Cheshire as Group Chief Executive in –
January 2008, the Group has performed strongly and made great 
progress, resulting in Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) growth of 93% and 
similar share price growth. Part of Ian Cheshire’s LTIP award made 
upon appointment, vested in full after the end of the ﬁ nancial year, 
following the measurement of the Company’s Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) performance versus the FTSE 100 in that period, and 
reﬂ ects the recovery of the Group during his tenure. A graph on page 
52 illustrates this performance, and shows the Company’s TSR for 
the three years to 29 January 2011, plotting the value of £100 
invested in Kingﬁ sher plc over the last three years compared to the 
performance of the FTSE100 Index over the same period, placing 
Kingﬁ sher in the top four performing stocks of the FTSE100 Index 
in the period. For the purposes of calculating the TSR, the base 
return index was averaged over each weekday in the one month 
period from 1 January 2008 to 31 January 2008. The end return was 
averaged over each weekday in the one month period from 1 January 
2011 to 31 January 2011.
Previously the Committee reported that the executive directors’ –
salaries would be reviewed in January of each year. The Committee 
reviewed the Group Chief Executive’s basic salary and concluded it 
should remain unchanged at £816,000. The Committee approved an 
increase for the Group Finance Director in June 2010 of 2.4% to 
£600,000 in recognition of his contribution to the business. No 
further increase was awarded in January 2011 and the next review 
is due in January 2012. 
The Committee reviewed the ﬁ nancial performance measures for –
the 2010/11 annual bonus award. Despite the continuing challenging 
global economic climate, the Group produced excellent results in 
terms of cashﬂ ow such that the ﬁ nancial outcomes exceeded the 
ﬁ nancial targets that had been set. Signiﬁ cant progress also 
continued with regard to the non-ﬁ nancial measures. Accordingly, 
both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director 
received near maximum bonuses. A third of these bonuses are 
awarded in the form of deferred shares, which will vest after a 
three-year holding period contingent on continued employment, 
and these levels of bonus are commensurate with the level of 
bonus paid elsewhere in the Group.
The Committee reviewed the Kingﬁ sher executive remuneration –
structure for 2011/12, and concluded that three changes are 
appropriate: (a) the weighting of ﬁ nancial measures under the 
annual bonus has increased to 60% with the non-ﬁ nancial measures 
reducing to 40%; (b) executives should receive a single award under 
the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) of up to 500% of salary in 2011 
(instead of three awards of 200% in 2011, 2012 and 2013) with no 
further awards to continuing executives until 2014, the awards being 
subject to stretching ﬁ nancial targets as set out on page 44 of this 
report and with 50% of any shares which vest being released after 
three years and 50% after four years. This structure for the awards 
is felt to be an important incentive to complete the Group’s recovery 
programme over that period. A resolution seeking shareholder 
approval for an amendment to the rules of the PSP to facilitate this 
award is included in the Notice of the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting; (c) consistent with developments in best practice guidelines 
the Group’s various incentive plans have been amended to give the 
Committee the ability to claw-back any sums paid to participants in 
certain circumstances.
The Company welcomed Andrew Bonﬁ eld, Pascal Cagni and Clare –
Chapman to the Board on 11 February 2010, 17 November 2010 and 
2 December 2010 respectively. Details of their terms of appointment 
and their remuneration can be found later in this report.

Advisers
The Committee also has authority to obtain the advice of external 
independent remuneration consultants and is solely responsible for their 
appointment, retention and termination, and for approval of the basis of 
their fees and other terms. In the ﬁ nancial year to 29 January 2011, the 
following external advisers provided services to the Committee. Unless 
otherwise stated, the advisers have no other connection with the Group:
Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’)
Advice on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share 
plans and executive remuneration generally.
Allen & Overy LLP
Legal advice on service and employment contracts and for other 
employment and remuneration issues in relation to the executive 
directors. (Allen & Overy LLP also provide advice to the Group on 
other legal matters.)
Towers Watson
Advice on the wider review of remuneration policy and benchmarking 
on the market competitiveness of remuneration for executives in the UK 
and overseas. (Towers Watson also provide advice to the Group on

The Remuneration Committee
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s primary purpose is to make recommendations to 
the Board on the Group’s framework or broad policy for executive 
remuneration and its costs. The Board has delegated responsibility 
to the Committee for determining the remuneration, beneﬁ ts and 
contractual arrangements of the Chairman, executive directors, certain 
senior executives and the Company Secretary, and for overseeing the 
Group’s share-based incentive schemes and bonus schemes. The 
remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman 
and executive members of the Board.
The Committee recommends and monitors the structure and levels of 
remuneration of senior managers throughout the Group and for executive 
directors, ensures that contractual terms on termination, and any payments 
made are fair to the individual and the Group, ensuring that failure is 
not rewarded and that the departing manager’s duty to mitigate is 
fully recognised.
The Committee is committed to the principles of accountability and 
transparency, and to ensuring remuneration arrangements demonstrate 
a clear link between reward and performance. Operating under delegated 
authority from and reporting to the Board, its activities are governed by 
terms of reference which are available from the Company Secretary and 
can be found on the Company’s website www.kingﬁ sher.com. 
Membership
The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive 
directors during the ﬁ nancial year to 29 January 2011. 
Chairman John Nelson
Committee members Daniel Bernard 
 Andrew Bonﬁ eld  (appointed 17 June 2010)
 Janis Kong
  Michael Hepher (retired 17 June 2010)
Meetings
The Committee is required by its terms of reference to meet at least 
twice a year, and has a standing calendar of items within its remit. 
During the year the Committee met nine times. Committee meetings 
are attended by the Group Chief Executive (other than when his own 
remuneration is being discussed) who provides advice that is of material 
assistance to the Committee. The Group HR Director (from her 
appointment on 6 April 2010) and the Head of Group Reward also 
attend Committee meetings and provide material assistance and advice 
on remuneration policy, and the Group Finance Director attends by 
invitation on matters relating to the performance measures and targets 
for the Group’s share-based incentive schemes. The Company 
Secretary generally acts as Secretary to the Committee. No member of 
the Committee has any personal ﬁ nancial interest (other than as 
a shareholder), conﬂ icts of interests arising from cross-directorships, 
or day-to-day involvement in running the business. No person plays 
a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. Details of 
individual attendance are given in the Corporate Governance section.

Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration strategy is to attract, retain and motivate 
executives of the highest quality, incentivising them to deliver exceptional 
performance aligned with the interests of the Company’s shareholders 
and to deliver the Group’s business plan. The remuneration strategy 
continues to ensure that a signiﬁ cant element of executives’ 
remuneration remains ‘at risk’. 
The key principles of the Group’s remuneration policy are to:
provide executives with a remuneration package that recognises –
the experience of the individual concerned and the role fulﬁ lled;
ensure performance-related remuneration constitutes a substantial –
proportion of the remuneration package;
encourage a high-performance culture by offering substantial –
reward only for exceptional performance;
be competitive in the market in which the Group competes; –
be fair and transparent; and –
ensure remuneration arrangements apply consistently throughout –
the Group.
The Committee intends to continue this policy and is satisﬁ ed that there 
is an appropriate balance between the ﬁ xed and variable elements of 
pay, as described within this report.

Alignment with shareholder interests
The Committee proactively consults with its largest shareholders and their 
representative bodies regarding its remuneration policy to ensure that 
their views are understood and duly taken into account in its deliberations, 
particularly in relation to changes in Kingﬁ sher share-based incentive scheme 
arrangements and wider trends in executive remuneration. The interests 
of shareholders are also considered when structuring remuneration 
packages. Annual bonus objectives focus on a mixture of ﬁ nancial and 
non-ﬁ nancial measures to ensure the operational success of the Group, 
whilst sustained performance is rewarded through incentive measures 
designed to improve shareholder returns. Short-term rewards are further 
aligned with shareholders’ interests through the compulsory deferral 
of one-third of annual bonuses into share awards under the Kingﬁ sher 
Incentive Share Scheme (the ‘KIS’). Long-term rewards are similarly 
aligned with shareholders’ interests by the requirement that executives 
hold a speciﬁ ed percentage of their annual salary in shares of the 
Company, and that they may not sell shares vesting under these 
plans until a minimum shareholding has been achieved. 
Alignment with Group strategy
The executive directors were incentivised to deliver milestones 
addressing the Group’s strategic plans for ‘Delivering Value’ to:
drive up B&Q UK’s proﬁ t; –
exploit our UK Trade opportunity; –
expand our total French business; –
roll out in Eastern Europe; –
turn around B&Q China; –
grow Group sourcing; and –
reduce working capital. –
Please see pages 8 and 9 of this report for further information 
on progress made in achieving the Group’s ‘Delivering Value’ strategy. 
Planned future changes
The structure for remuneration for executives for the year 2011/12 
was debated by the Committee and remains broadly similar to previous 
years. However, whereby in 2010/11 50% of the annual bonus was 
measured against ﬁ nancial targets and 50% against non-ﬁ nancial 
targets, for the 2011/12 ﬁ nancial year, the split between ﬁ nancial and 
non-ﬁ nancial measures will be re-balanced so that 60% of the bonus 
is payable against ﬁ nancial objectives and 40% against non-ﬁ nancial 
objectives. There is no change to the level of maximum bonus 
opportunity of 200% of annual salary. Given the achievements on 
reducing debt and generating cash, the ﬁ nancial target for 2011/12 
will focus on proﬁ t. 
The Committee is recommending a change to the structure of the 
long-term incentive scheme and has recommended proposals for 
changes to the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards to be made 
in 2011. The revised PSP would grant certain executives an award of 
500% of their annual base salary with shares vesting subject to suitably 
stretching earnings per share (‘EPS’) and Kingﬁ sher Economic Proﬁ t 
(‘KEP’) targets over the three ﬁ nancial years to January 2014. 50% of 
any vesting shares would be released to participants in 2014 with the 
remaining shares held over for release in 2015. This award would replace 
the 200% annual award with no further awards made under the PSP 
to those executives participating in the 2011 award until 2014. This is 
to enable recipients to receive a single award in 2011 in lieu of awards 
which would otherwise have been made in 2011, 2012 and 2013. This is 
felt to be both appropriate to incentivise the completion of the recovery 
programme and in the interests of shareholders (as the single award is 
smaller than the sum of the individual awards would have been). The 
awards will be subject to two separate performance targets:
Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’)
50% of the shares subject to an award will be subject to an EPS 
condition against the following targets:
Compound annual growth in EPS Percentage of this part of the award that will vest
Below 8% 0%
8% (Threshold) 15%
10% 50%
15% (Maximum) 100%
The deﬁ nition of EPS remains unchanged from prior awards and 
compares the Company’s EPS for the ﬁ nal ﬁ nancial year in the 
performance period (i.e. the year to January 2014) to the EPS for 
the year to January 2011 (20.5p).
Kingﬁ sher Economic Proﬁ t (‘KEP’)
50% of the shares subject to an award will be subject to a KEP target with 
the following targets:
Aggregate KEP over 
the performance period Percentage of this part of the award that will vest
Below £229m 0%
£229m (Threshold) 15%
£257m 50%
£386m (Maximum) 100%
KEP is deﬁ ned as consolidated EBIT, lease adjusted – (Capital employed, 
including capitalised leases, adjusted from pensions x WACC). The 
exchange rates assumed at the outset will be ﬁ xed for the period as 
will the Company’s cost of capital of 6.8%. These targets compare 
with a KEP for the year to January 2011 of £68.4m. Subsequent Annual 
Reports will disclose the Company’s performance to date against 
the KEP targets.

The Committee considers these targets to be the most appropriate 
measures over the next three years, to incentivise the Group’s highly 
respected management team to focus on and deliver against the 
completion of the Group’s recovery programme which requires each 
of; top-line growth, keen cost control and efﬁ cient use of shareholders’ 
capital. The structure of these awards will extend to the senior executive 
team across the Group (approximately 50 individuals) although the two 
targets will be re-expressed as divisional ones where relevant. The 
Committee considers it important to operate a coherent arrangement 
across the entire leadership team. Senior executives below Board level 
received a similar one-off award in 2008 on the launch of the recovery 
programme under Ian Cheshire’s leadership, and the Committee 
believes that was an important contributor to the signiﬁ cant growth in 
shareholder value over the last three years and that it is appropriate 
to repeat such an approach as the Company moves into the second 
phase of that strategy.
In addition, the Committee has recently amended the rules of the 
PSP, consistent with best practice guidelines, to include provision for 
claw-back in certain circumstances. 
The making of these awards is conditional on shareholders approving 
the amendment to the rules of the PSP to increase the individual limit 
at the Annual General Meeting.
During the year, the Committee debated the impact of changes in UK 
pension legislation reducing the annual allowance for pension contributions. 
From April 2011, when an executive’s pension contributions breach the 
annual allowance in a tax year, the Company pension contribution will 
be converted to a cash supplement.

Overview of executive directors’ remuneration
The remuneration package for executive directors consists of the following elements: base salary, annual bonus including the deferred share award 
under the Kingﬁ sher Incentive Scheme (KIS), the long-term incentive under the PSP, the Sharesave Option Scheme for all-employees (ShareSave), 
pension contributions and non-cash beneﬁ ts. The Committee considers that the total remuneration package links corporate and individual 
performance with an appropriate balance between short and long-term elements, and ﬁ xed and variable components.
Table 1 below shows the breakdown of the remuneration package into its main constituent elements and assumes maximum payment of annual 
bonus and maximum vesting of PSP deferred share awards, the Company’s long-term incentive plan.

Note: the ﬁ xed elements in the charts above include pensions and beneﬁ ts. For the purposes of the above, the historic practice of awarding 200% of base salary annually under 
the PSP is assumed.
The Committee believes that the targets set for the different elements of performance-related remuneration are both appropriate and stretching in 
the context of the business environment and the challenges with which the Group is faced. The performance-related remuneration constitutes a 
substantial proportion of the remuneration package, and is ‘at risk’, being subject to achievement of performance hurdles, deferral periods during 
which the individual must remain employed, and ﬂ uctuations in the market price of shares. The maximum bonus payable under the KIS is made up 
of 133% of salary in cash and 67% in deferred forfeitable shares, and the maximum vesting under the PSP is currently 200% of salary in deferred 
forfeitable shares. Accordingly, the maximum awards under the KIS and PSP result in 75% of total remuneration being performance-related.

and Accounts
2010/11
Components of executive directors’ remuneration 2010/11
Details of each individual element of the remuneration package are given below.
Base salary
Executive salaries are reviewed with effect from January each year and are generally set to be competitive, taking into account the prevailing market 
and economic conditions, affordability, the level of increases awarded to employees generally and the individual’s contribution. 
In June 2010 the basic salary of Kevin O’Byrne was increased by 2.4% to £600,000. Ian Cheshire proposed that his salary was not reviewed in 
January 2011 and no further review was applied to Kevin O’Byrne. The base salaries of the executive directors as at 23 March 2011 were £816,000 
for Ian Cheshire and £600,000 for Kevin O’Byrne.
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus is earned by the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee at the start of each ﬁ nancial year and is delivered 
under the KIS. 
The KIS comprises the Kingﬁ sher Cash Incentive Scheme 2003 (‘KIS Cash Scheme’) and the Kingﬁ sher Incentive Share Scheme 2003 (‘KIS Share 
Scheme’). Senior executives may receive a performance-related cash bonus under the KIS Cash Scheme, and a contingent share award under 
the KIS Share Scheme, in the proportions of 67% of the bonuses earned being payable in cash, and 33% in deferred shares. The vesting of the 
deferred shares are subject to a three-year holding period, with the shares being subject to forfeiture should the executive leave the Group during 
the holding period as a result of voluntary resignation or dismissal for cause. Participants granted deferred shares under the KIS Share Scheme are 
entitled to receive a dividend equivalent payment in the form of additional deferred shares, which is equal to the value of dividends that would have 
been earned over the holding period. These additional shares are conditional upon the original deferred shares vesting. The award of deferred 
shares is subject to a claw back provision, whereby unvested deferred shares previously granted under the KIS Share Scheme may lapse if the 
Committee decides the grant of deferred shares was not justiﬁ ed.
Included as an element of a KIS award, individuals now receive a grant under the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) an HMRC approved plan, 
which provides tax and NIC advantages for participants and potential NIC savings for Kingﬁ sher at no additional cost for the Group. The CSOP is 
underpinned by a matching ﬁ xed value element of the KIS, however, the value of the total award remains unchanged.
The maximum bonus is considered in the light of market practice for companies of a similar size and industry sector. The maximum bonus payable 
is 200% of base salary, which remains unchanged from last year. 
The executive directors’ targets for the 2010/11 bonus were based on both corporate and individual objectives and were structured equally between 
ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial measures as in the previous year as set out below. 
      Group Personal

The non-ﬁ nancial measures included KPIs of Group sourcing achievement; employee engagement and market share; plus a personal 
performance element.

2010/11
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The PSP remains the primary long-term share incentive plan for the top senior executives, which allows a maximum annual award not exceeding 
200% of base salary or 300% of base salary in exceptional circumstances. The PSP currently runs over a period of three years and has performance 
hurdles requiring Kingﬁ sher’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) to exceed median level of TSR measured against the FTSE 100, and adjusted 
Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’). Relative TSR was considered as a valid benchmark as it measures the performance of executives in terms of delivery 
of shareholder return against that of other businesses. The Committee chose the FTSE 100 as the comparator group because of the general lack 
of directly quoted home improvement businesses against which to compare the Company’s TSR speciﬁ cally. HNBS independently carries out 
the relevant TSR calculations for the Committee. This relative measure is coupled with EPS as a driver for absolute performance.
The TSR and EPS performance targets for all PSP awards in 2010/11 are set out in the notes to the PSP awards table on page 50.
Shares delivered on the vesting of an award receive a dividend ‘roll-up’ calculated on the basis of a notional purchase of shares on each relevant 
ex-dividend date using that day’s closing mid-market price. Shares used to satisfy awards under the PSP are normally purchased in the market by 
the Kingﬁ sher Employee Beneﬁ t Trust. As described earlier in this report, the Committee has reviewed the appropriateness of the quantum and 
performance measures under the PSP during the year and subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General meeting on 16 June 2011, 
awards in 2011/12 will be made on the basis set out on page 44.
Other long-term incentive plans
Apart from the Sharesave Option Scheme and those described above, all other option and incentive arrangements for executive directors have 
been discontinued, but awards made under these schemes in previous years will vest over time in accordance with the rules governing the various 
plans. The details are shown in the section entitled Closed Incentive Plans on page 51. 
Pension provision
Ian Cheshire is a member of the main deﬁ ned beneﬁ t arrangement, the Kingﬁ sher Pension Scheme, and subject to the scheme cap (currently 
£123,600). Following his appointment as Group Chief Executive, Ian Cheshire also receives a 30% Company contribution, on his base salary above 
the pension cap, into deﬁ ned contribution arrangements. Kevin O’Byrne commenced employment after the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section had closed to 
new members and thus is a member of the deﬁ ned contribution arrangements and receives a Company contribution of 20% of base salary.
Other beneﬁ ts
Each executive director is entitled to a car or car allowance, an allowance for ﬁ nancial planning, medical insurance, life insurance equivalent to four 
times salary, a subsidised staff canteen, a staff discount card and 30 equivalent working days’ holiday per year.
Outside appointments for executive directors
Subject to the rules governing conﬂ icts of interest, the Company encourages its executive directors to hold non-executive roles outside the Group 
as it recognises that such roles can broaden experience and knowledge which can beneﬁ t the Group. Subject to the Committee’s agreement, any 
fees may be retained by the individual. Kevin O’Byrne is a non-executive director of Land Securities Group plc, and acts as Chairman of their Audit 
Committee; he is paid £60,000 and £17,500 respectively for fulﬁ lling these roles and retains these fees. In January 2011, Ian Cheshire became 
a non-executive director of Whitbread plc and was appointed Chairman of their Remuneration Committee; he is paid £55,000 and £10,000 
respectively for fulﬁ lling these roles and retains these fees. In January 2011, Ian Cheshire was invited to act as the lead non-executive member 
of the Department for Work and Pensions Board. He waived his right to the fees payable for this role. 
Share ownership guidelines 
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director are required to build a shareholding in the Company. The table below details the minimum 
shareholding required and the date by which that shareholding must be acquired. Shares which have not yet vested under any share-based 
incentive plans are not taken into account in applying this test.

6 Award subject to TSR performance targets only. TSR conditions require the Group’s TSR to be at least median plus 1% for 15.625% to vest and upper quintile plus 1% for it all 
to vest. Intermediate performance vests on a sliding scale basis between these points.
7 Award is subject to EPS and TSR conditions (50% of the shares to each). The EPS condition requires EPS at the end of the three-year performance period to be at least 15.9p 
for 15.625% of that part to vest and 19.6p for all of it to vest. The TSR condition requires the Group’s TSR to be at least median plus 1% for 15.625% to vest and upper quintile 
plus 1% for it all to vest. In both cases, intermediate performance vests on a sliding scale basis.
8 Award is subject to EPS and TSR conditions (50% of the shares to each). The EPS condition requires EPS at the end of the three-year performance period to be at least 20p for 
15.625% of that part to vest and 23p for all of it to vest. The TSR condition requires the Group’s TSR to be at least median plus 1% for 15.625% to vest and upper quintile plus 
1% for it all to vest. In both cases, intermediate performance vests on a sliding scale basis.

1 In accordance with the terms of his appointment, the Committee offered Ian Cheshire the opportunity to purchase 266,667 shares in the Company and in return receive a 
matching award of 200% of salary (i.e. broadly a 4:1 match, he purchased 268,924 shares at 148p) subject to performance conditions and his continuing to hold the purchased 
shares. The value of the matching award was £1,600,000 as of the date of appointment. 
2 No Matching Shares vest unless EPS at the end of the four-year performance period is greater than 15.9p, at which level of performance 15.625% of the award will vest. The 
percentage vesting increases on a pro-rata basis so that 50% of the Matching Shares vest if EPS is 17.0p. Full vesting occurs if EPS is 19.6p at the end of the performance 
period with pro-rata vesting between 17.0p and 19.6p.
3 As the awards are structured as nominal cost options (on payment in aggregate of a maximum of £1) they can be exercised within a six month period starting from the 
vesting date.

periods. On exercise, only the cash equivalent to any gain will be paid and disclosed as remuneration at that time. 
In the period 1 February 2010 to 28 January 2011, the highest and lowest market price for Kingﬁ sher shares was 271.3p and 198.5p respectively. 
The market price at close of business on 28 January 2011 was 255.6p.
Dilution limits 
Kingﬁ sher share plans comply with recommended guidelines on dilution limits and the Company has always operated within these limits. The 
current Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’) guidance on headroom limits provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 
ten year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period on executive plans. Assuming 
none of the extant options lapse and will be exercised and having included all exercised options, the Company has utilised 4.53% of the 10% in 
ten years and 3.67% of the 5% in ten years in accordance with the ABI guidance on dilution limits.
Directors’ pension beneﬁ ts
Ian Cheshire has an entitlement to part of his pension beneﬁ ts through the Kingﬁ sher deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme (subject to the scheme cap) 
and partly through deﬁ ned contribution schemes. Kevin O’Byrne only has an entitlement to a deﬁ ned contribution pension.
The following table shows details required under both Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 and the Listing 
Rules as they apply to Kingﬁ sher for the year ended 29 January 2011. In respect of the Companies Act 2006, the details shown represent for the 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section:
accrued pension beneﬁ ts at the relevant dates; –
the increase in the amount of accrued pension during this year; –
the transfer value amounts as at 31 January 2010 and 29 January 2011; and –
the increase in transfer value between those dates, net of member contributions paid. –

Service contracts
Non-executive directors are appointed under letters of engagement. Appointments have historically been for an initial period of three years and 
invitations to act for subsequent three-year terms are subject to a review of performance, and taking account of the need to progressively refresh 
the Board.
The appointment may be terminated by either party giving the other not less than three months’ prior written notice, unless terminated earlier in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, and the Company has no obligation to pay compensation when their appointment terminates. 
Non-executive directors are subject to re-appointment by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment, and 
subsequently at intervals of no more than three years. In advance of the implementation of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Company 
has voluntarily adopted the requirement for all directors to submit themselves for re-appointment at each Annual General Meeting, accordingly, 
all directors will be offering themselves for re-appointment at the Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 June 2011.
The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive directors under a policy which seeks to recognise the time commitment, responsibility and 
technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to an effective Board. The Board will also review information on fees paid to non-executive 
directors in similar companies and will review fees for non-executive directors in January each year. 
All fees payable to non-executive directors were increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 February 2011. The fee for a non-executive director increased 
from £55,000 p.a. to £56,375 p.a.; the fee payable to the Chairman of the Audit Committee increased from £17,000 p.a. to £17,425 p.a.; the fee 
payable to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee increased from £10,000 to £10,250; and the fee payable to the Deputy Chairman 
increased from £45,000 p.a. to £46,125 p.a.

Audit Committee report
Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
The Audit Committee (the ‘Committee’) is appointed by the Board from 
the non-executive directors. The terms of reference are regularly 
reviewed by the Committee and any amendments are referred to the 
Board for approval. These are available at www.kingﬁ sher.com.
Andrew Bonﬁ eld replaced Phil Bentley as Chairman of the Committee 
in March 2010. Full details of the members of the Committee are set out 
on page 38. Details of those members with recent and relevant ﬁ nancial 
experience, together with the number and attendance by members at 
Committee meetings are set on pages 29 and 36 respectively. 
All members of the Committee receive appropriate induction, which is 
in addition to the induction which all new directors receive. The induction 
programme covers an overview of the business, its ﬁ nancial dynamics 
and risks. New Committee members also obtain access to the Group’s 
operations and staff and all members of the Committee undertake 
ongoing training as required.
The Committee has an agenda linked to events in the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
calendar. At the invitation of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board 
and the Group Chief Executive regularly attended meetings, as did the 
Group Finance Director, Group Audit and Risk Management Director, 
Group Financial Controller and the external auditors. Private meetings 
were also held with the external and internal auditors at which 
management were not present.
The Committee maintains a formal calendar of items for consideration 
at each meeting and within the annual audit cycle to ensure that its work 
is in line with the requirements of the Combined Code. A summary of 
the role of the Committee is set out on page 38. During the year and up 
to the date of this Annual Report the Committee has:
reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference and its effectiveness. –
The review concluded that no signiﬁ cant amendments to the terms 
of reference were required;
agreed the terms of engagement, the fees, areas of responsibility –
and scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the external 
auditors. Details of the amounts paid to the external auditors are 
given in note 7 to the accounts;
undertook an assessment of the qualiﬁ cation, expertise and –
resources, and independence of the external auditors and the 
effectiveness of the audit process;
considered the Internal Audit function’s reports on the Group’s risk –
management system, ﬁ ndings from reviews, and the remit, 
organisation, annual plan and resources of the internal audit function;
undertaken a review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function; –
monitored progress on the programme announced during 2008/09 –
to standardise and improve the control processes in a number of key 
areas including B&Q China business and IT systems;
received reports from the external auditors on their ﬁ ndings including –
any control observations relevant to their audit work;
reviewed the annual and interim ﬁ nancial statements. In doing so –
the Committee reviewed signiﬁ cant accounting policies, ﬁ nancial 
reporting issues and judgements (including those disclosed in note 3 
to the ﬁ nancial statements), together with the reports received from 
the external auditors on their audits;
considered reports on the output from the Group-wide process used –
to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks;
reviewed and approved the scope of non-audit services provided by –
the auditors to ensure that there was no impairment of independence 
and objectivity, and subsequently monitored the non-audit work 
performed to ensure it was within policy guidelines;
reviewed the potential impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements –
of signiﬁ cant corporate governance and accounting statements;
received presentations from the senior management of all –
operating companies;
reviewed the policy and process enabling employees within –
the Group to make disclosures about suspected ﬁ nancial and 
operational improprieties; and
reviewed an annual report on the Group’s systems of internal –
control and its effectiveness, and reported the results of the 
review to the Board.
The Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP 
be re-appointed as the Company’s auditor.
As a result of its work during the year, the Committee has concluded 
that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and has 
ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. 
The Chairman of the Committee will be available at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions about the work of the Committee.

Notes to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements
1 General information
Kingﬁ sher plc (‘the Company’), its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (together ‘the Group’) supply home improvement products and services through 
a network of retail stores and other channels, located mainly in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and China. 
Kingﬁ sher plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business 
review on pages 1 to 28.
The address of its registered ofﬁ ce is 3 Sheldon Square, Paddington, London W2 6PX.
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 23 March 2011.
2 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently 
applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a. Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January each 
year, except as disclosed in note 17 and in note 4 of the Company’s separate ﬁ nancial statements. The current ﬁ nancial year is the 52 weeks ended 29 January 
2011 (‘the year’). The comparative ﬁ nancial year is the 52 weeks ended 30 January 2010 (‘the prior year’). 
The directors of Kingﬁ sher plc, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the Group to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 
29 January 2011. Refer to the Directors’ statement of responsibility on page 34.
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European 
Union, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The following new standards and amendments, which are mandatory for the ﬁ rst time for the ﬁ nancial year ended 29 January 2011, are relevant for the Group:
IAS 27
(amendment)
Consolidated and separate ﬁ nancial 
statements – Non-controlling interests 
(effective from 1 July 2009)
Requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling (minority) interests to be 
recorded in equity if there is no change in control. They will no longer result in goodwill 
or gains and losses. The amended standard also speciﬁ es the accounting when control 
is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value and a gain or loss 
is recognised in proﬁ t or loss. The impact of this on the results presented has not 
been signiﬁ cant.
IFRS 3 
(amendment)
Business combinations 
(effective from 1 July 2009)
Harmonises business combination accounting with US GAAP. The amended standard 
will continue to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, but with 
certain signiﬁ cant changes. All payments to purchase a business will be recorded 
at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently 
remeasured at fair value through income. Goodwill and non-controlling (minority) 
interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis. All transaction costs will be 
expensed. The impact of this on the results presented has not been signiﬁ cant.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations, which are mandatory for the ﬁ rst time for the ﬁ nancial year ended 29 January 2011, are either 
not currently relevant or material for the Group:
IAS 39 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement – Eligible hedged items’; –
Improvements to IFRSs 2009; –
IFRS 1 (revised November 2008), ‘First-time adoption of IFRS’; –
IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payments – Group cash-settled payment transactions’; –
IFRIC 17, ‘Distributions of non-cash assets to owners’; and –
IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from customers’. –
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁ nancial statements, the following new standard, which is expected to be relevant to the Group’s results, was issued but 
not yet effective:
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
(effective from 1 January 2013)
Introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring ﬁ nancial assets. This 
includes the removal of available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets and held-to-maturity 
investments, and the introduction of a new category of ﬁ nancial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. For certain liabilities held at fair value, gains 
recognised on reduction in the fair value of these liabilities are to be recognised through 
other comprehensive income rather than in proﬁ t and loss. This is still subject to 
endorsement by the European Union, but is currently expected to be applied in the 
Group’s 2013/14 ﬁ nancial statements.

Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modiﬁ ed by the use of valuations for certain ﬁ nancial 
instruments, share-based payments and post employment beneﬁ ts. A 
summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies is set out below. 
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use 
of certain accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving critical accounting estimates and judgements, 
which are signiﬁ cant to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, are disclosed 
in note 3.
Use of non-GAAP measures
Kingﬁ sher believes that retail proﬁ t, adjusted pre-tax proﬁ t, effective tax rate, 
adjusted post-tax proﬁ t and adjusted earnings per share provide additional 
useful information on underlying trends to shareholders. These and other 
non-GAAP measures such as net debt/cash are used by Kingﬁ sher for internal 
performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for 
employees. The terms ‘retail proﬁ t’, ‘exceptional items’, ‘adjusted’, ‘effective tax 
rate’ and ‘net debt/cash’ are not deﬁ ned terms under IFRS and may therefore 
not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures.
Retail proﬁ t is deﬁ ned as continuing operating proﬁ t before central costs 
(principally the costs of the Group’s head ofﬁ ce), exceptional items, amortisation 
of acquisition intangibles and the Group’s share of interest and tax of joint 
ventures and associates.
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items, which are 
presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement category, 
helps provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. 
The principal items which are included as exceptional items are:
non trading items included in operating proﬁ t such as proﬁ ts and losses –
on the disposal, closure or impairment of subsidiaries, joint ventures, 
associates and investments which do not form part of the Group’s 
trading activities;
proﬁ ts and losses on the disposal of properties; and –
the costs of signiﬁ cant restructuring and incremental acquisition –
integration costs.
The term ‘adjusted’ refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing 
operations excluding exceptional items, ﬁ nancing fair value remeasurements, 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles, related tax items and prior year tax 
items. Financing fair value remeasurements represent changes in the fair 
value of ﬁ nancing derivatives, excluding interest accruals, offset by fair value 
adjustments to the carrying amount of borrowings and other hedged items 
under fair value hedge relationships. Financing derivatives are those that relate 
to underlying items of a ﬁ nancing nature.
The effective tax rate represents the effective income tax expense as a 
percentage of continuing proﬁ t before taxation excluding exceptional items. 
Effective income tax expense is the continuing income tax expense excluding 
tax on exceptional items and tax adjustments in respect of prior years and 
changes in tax rates.
Net debt/cash comprises borrowings and ﬁ nancing derivatives (excluding 
accrued interest), less cash and cash equivalents and current other 
investments.
b. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the ﬁ nancial statements of 
the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has the power 
to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies, generally accompanying a 
shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiary undertakings 
acquired during the period are recorded under the acquisition method of 
accounting and their results included from the date of acquisition. The results 
of subsidiaries which have been disposed of during the period are included 
up to the effective date of disposal.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values 
of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued 
by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset 
or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-
related costs are expensed as incurred. Identiﬁ able assets acquired and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying 
amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes 
in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deﬁ cit balance.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identiﬁ able net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is 
recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated 
unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries have been changed 
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(ii) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control, with a third 
party, to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating activities of that entity. The equity 
method is used to account for the Group’s investments in joint ventures.
Associates are entities over which the Group has the ability to exercise 
signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The equity method is used to 
account for the Group’s investments in associates.
Under the equity method investments are initially recognised at cost. The 
Group’s investments in joint ventures and associates include goodwill (net 
of any accumulated impairment losses) identiﬁ ed on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition proﬁ ts or losses is recognised in the 
income statement within operating proﬁ t, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-
acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
investment. When the Group’s share of losses equals or exceeds its interest, 
including any other long term receivables, the Group does not recognise any 
further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the joint venture or associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures 
and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures and 
associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group.

Notes to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements
2 Principal accounting policies continued
c. Foreign currencies
(i) Presentation and functional currencies
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the 
Group’s presentation currency. Items included in the ﬁ nancial statements of 
each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (i.e. its functional currency).
(ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the 
transaction or, for practical reasons, at average monthly rates where 
exchange rates do not ﬂ uctuate signiﬁ cantly. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into Sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement. Exceptions 
to this are where the monetary items form part of the net investment in a 
foreign operation or are designated and effective net investment or cash ﬂ ow 
hedges. Such exchange differences are initially deferred in equity.
(iii) Group companies
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in 
Sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Proﬁ ts and losses 
of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average 
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation 
of foreign operations are recognised in a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net 
investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments 
designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign 
operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Principal rates of exchange against Sterling:
   2010/11 2009/10
  Average Year end Average  Year end
  rate rate rate rate
Euro  1.17 1.16 1.13 1.15

Polish Zloty 4.65 4.52 4.86 4.69
Chinese Renminbi 10.41 10.45 10.79 11.01
d. Revenue recognition
Sales represent the supply of home improvement products and services. Sales 
exclude transactions made between companies within the Group, Value Added 
Tax, other sales-related taxes and are net of returns, trade and staff discounts.
Sales of in-store products are generally recognised at the point of cash 
receipt. Where award credits such as vouchers or loyalty points are provided 
as part of the sales transaction, the amount allocated to the credits is deferred 
and recognised when the credits are redeemed and the Group fulﬁ ls its 
obligations to supply the awards.
Sales are also recognised when the product has been delivered or, for 
installation income, when the service has been performed. Sales from 
delivered products and services represent only a small component of the 
Group’s sales as the majority relates to in-store purchases of products.
Other income is generally composed primarily of external rental income and 
proﬁ ts and losses on disposal of assets. Rental income from operating leases 
is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.
e. Rebates
Rebates received from suppliers mainly comprise volume related rebates on 
the purchase of inventories. 
Volume related rebates are recognised based on actual purchases in the 
period as a proportion of total purchases forecast over the rebate period 
where it is probable the rebates will be received and the amounts can be 
estimated reliably. 
Rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the balance sheet 
date are deducted from the carrying value so that the cost of inventories is 
recorded net of applicable rebates. Such rebates are credited to the income 
statement when the goods are sold. 
f. Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the Company’s 
shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
g. Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic beneﬁ ts arising from assets acquired 
in a business combination that are not individually identiﬁ ed and separately 
recognised. Such beneﬁ ts include future synergies expected from the combination 
and intangible assets not meeting the criteria for separate recognition.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
amortised and is tested annually for impairment by assessing the recoverable 
amount of each cash generating unit or groups of cash generating units to 
which the goodwill relates. The recoverable amount is assessed by reference 
to the net present value of expected future pre-tax cash ﬂ ows (‘value-in-use’) 
or fair value less costs to sell if higher. The discount rate applied is based upon 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for 
the risks associated with the relevant cash generating unit or groups of cash 
generating units. When the recoverable amount of the goodwill is less than its 
carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income 
statement which cannot subsequently be reversed. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold.
(ii) Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring to use the speciﬁ c software. These costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives of two to seven years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identiﬁ able and unique 
software products controlled by the Group, which are expected to generate 
economic beneﬁ ts exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as 
intangible assets. Direct costs include software development, employee and 
consultancy costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Costs 
associated with identifying, sourcing, evaluating or maintaining computer 
software are recognised as an expense as incurred.
h. Property, plant and equipment
(i) Cost 
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the business are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
40328_Kingfisher[Back]p55-108_FINAL.indd 62 40328_Kingfisher[Back]p55-108_FINAL.indd   62 14/4/11 12:23:39 14/4/11   12:23:39 63
Kingﬁ sher plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts
2010/11
(ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to reﬂ ect a straight line reduction from cost to 
estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: 
Freehold land – not depreciated
Freehold and long leasehold buildings – over remaining useful life down 
to residual value
Short leasehold land and buildings – over remaining period of the lease
Fixtures and ﬁ ttings – between 4 and 20 years
Computers and electronic equipment – between 2 and 5 years
Motor cars – 4 years
Commercial vehicles – between 3 and 10 years
Long leaseholds are deﬁ ned as those having remaining lease terms of more 
than 50 years. Asset lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date.
(iii) Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable 
amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future 
pre-tax cash ﬂ ows (‘value-in-use’) of the relevant cash generating unit or fair 
value less costs to sell if higher. The discount rate applied is based upon the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the 
risks associated with the relevant cash generating unit. Any impairment in value 
is charged to the income statement in the period in which it occurs. 
(iv) Disposal
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in the income statement. Sales of land and buildings 
are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts. 
(v) Subsequent costs
Subsequent costs are included in the related asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic beneﬁ ts associated with the item will ﬂ ow to the Group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
i. Leased assets
Where assets are ﬁ nanced by leasing agreements which give rights 
approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been 
purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value or 
the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term at 
the inception of the lease. The assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term or their useful life. Obligations relating to ﬁ nance leases, net of ﬁ nance 
charges in respect of future periods, are included, as appropriate, under 
borrowings due within or after one year. The ﬁ nance charge element of rentals 
is charged to ﬁ nance costs in the income statement over the lease term. 
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments are generally 
charged to the income statement in the period to which the payments relate, 
except for those leases which incorporate ﬁ xed minimum rental uplift clauses. 
Leases which contain ﬁ xed minimum rental uplifts are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Where a lease is taken out for land and buildings combined, the buildings 
element of the lease may be capitalised as a ﬁ nance lease if it meets the criteria 
for a ﬁ nance lease, but the land element will in most cases be classiﬁ ed as an 
operating lease. If the contracted lease payments are not split between land 
and buildings in the lease contract, the split is made based on the market 
values of the land and buildings at the inception of the lease. 
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are released to the 
income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
j. Investment property
Investment property is property held by the Group to earn rental income or 
for capital appreciation. The Group’s investment properties are carried at cost 
less depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a 
consistent basis with that applied to property, plant and equipment.
k. Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Interest on borrowings to ﬁ nance the construction of properties held as 
non-current assets is capitalised from the date work starts on the property 
to the date when substantially all the activities which are necessary to get the 
property ready for use are complete. Where construction is completed in 
parts, each part is considered separately when capitalising interest. Interest 
is capitalised before any allowance for tax relief.
l. Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, on a 
weighted average cost basis. 
Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads and direct expenditure 
incurred in the normal course of business in bringing goods to their present 
location and condition. Costs of inventories include the transfer from equity 
of any gains or losses on qualifying cash ﬂ ow hedges relating to purchases. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Write 
downs to net realisable value are made for slow moving, damaged or obsolete 
items and other events or conditions resulting in expected selling prices being 
lower than cost. The carrying value of inventories reﬂ ects known and expected 
losses of product in the ordinary course of business. 
m. Employee beneﬁ ts
(i) Post employment benefi ts
The Group operates various deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution pension 
schemes for its employees, some of which are required by local legislation. A 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme is a pension scheme which deﬁ nes an amount of pension 
beneﬁ t which an employee will receive on retirement. A deﬁ ned contribution 
scheme is a pension scheme under which the Group usually pays ﬁ xed 
contributions into a separate entity. In all cases other than some of the legally 
required schemes, a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing 
liabilities. The assets of each of these funds are either held under trusts or managed 
by insurance companies and are entirely separate from the Group’s assets.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension schemes is the fair value of scheme assets less the present 
value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation at the balance sheet date, together with 
an adjustment for any past service costs not yet recognised. The deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂ ows using interest 
rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in 
which the beneﬁ ts will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating 
to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income as they arise. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless 
the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining 
in service for a speciﬁ ed period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past 
service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.

Notes to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements
2 Principal accounting policies continued
For deﬁ ned contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions to privately 
administered pension schemes on a contractual basis. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions 
are recognised as an employee beneﬁ t expense when they are due. 
(ii) Share-based compensation
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based compensation 
schemes. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for 
the grant of options or deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is 
calculated using Black-Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of 
the options or deferred shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions. The value of the charge is adjusted to reﬂ ect expected and 
actual levels of options vesting due to non-market vesting conditions. 
n. Taxation
The income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁ t for the year. Taxable proﬁ t 
differs from proﬁ t before taxation as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other 
years or which are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences or unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are 
not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill in a business combination. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
which affects neither the taxable proﬁ t nor the accounting proﬁ t. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments 
in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able 
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet 
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁ cient 
taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates which have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, 
except when they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the current or deferred tax is also recognised directly in equity. 
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when 
the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
o. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outﬂ ow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax rate which reﬂ ects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks 
speciﬁ c to the liability.
p. Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to 
the cash ﬂ ows from the ﬁ nancial asset expire or the Group has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities (or a part 
of a ﬁ nancial liability) are derecognised when the obligation speciﬁ ed in the 
contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with 
banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less.
(ii) Borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net 
of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Where 
borrowings are in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships, 
adjustments are made to their carrying amounts to reﬂ ect the hedged risks. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are amortised to the income statement using the 
effective interest method.
(iii) Other investments
Other investments include bank deposits, government bonds and other short 
term investments with an original maturity of more than three months. 
(iv) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost less any provision for bad and doubtful debts. 
(v) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost.
(vi) Derivatives and hedge accounting
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to which it is not 
effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise. Changes in the fair value of derivatives transacted as 
hedges of operating items and ﬁ nancing items are recognised in operating 
proﬁ t and net ﬁ nance costs respectively. 
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently carried at fair value. The accounting 
treatment of derivatives and other ﬁ nancial instruments classiﬁ ed as hedges 
depends on their designation, which occurs at the start of the hedge 
relationship. The Group designates certain ﬁ nancial instruments as:
a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability or unrecognised ﬁ rm –
commitment (‘fair value hedge’);
a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or ﬁ rm commitment –
(‘cash ﬂ ow hedge’); or
a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (‘net investment hedge’). –

Fair value hedges 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged 
item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged 
with the corresponding entry being recorded in the income statement. Gains 
or losses from remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are 
recognised in the same line of the income statement.
Cash fl ow hedges 
Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of derivatives that are 
designated as hedges of future cash ﬂ ows are recognised directly in equity, 
and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement 
where relevant. If the cash ﬂ ow hedge of a ﬁ rm commitment or forecast 
transaction results in the recognition of a non-ﬁ nancial asset or liability, then, at 
the time it is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that 
had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement 
of the non-ﬁ nancial asset or liability. For hedges that result in the recognition of 
a ﬁ nancial asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net 
proﬁ t or loss. 
Net investment hedges
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through 
foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the retranslation of the 
borrowings are recognised in equity. If the Group uses derivatives as the 
hedging instrument, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, 
with any ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement. Gains 
and losses accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement 
on disposal of the foreign operation. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents in advance the 
relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The 
Group also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the relationship 
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the 
hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. The 
effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the 
hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting. At 
that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in 
equity is retained in equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs. 
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁ nancial instruments or other host contracts 
are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are 
not closely related to those of host contracts, and the host contracts are not 
carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the 
income statement.
3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated ﬁ nancial statements under IFRS requires
the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates 
and assumptions which have a signiﬁ cant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are 
discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other assets
As required, the Group applies procedures to ensure that its assets are 
carried at no more than their recoverable amount. The procedures, by their 
nature, require estimates and assumptions to be made. The most signiﬁ cant 
are set out below.
The Group is required, on at least an annual basis, to test whether goodwill 
has suffered any impairment. As part of this testing the recoverable amounts of 
cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. 
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash ﬂ ows expected to 
arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice 
of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the forecast 
cash ﬂ ows. Actual outcomes could vary signiﬁ cantly from these estimates. 
Further information on the impairment tests undertaken, including the key 
assumptions, is given in note 12.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable 
amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined as the higher of 
fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated on the basis of 
management’s assumptions and estimates.
At each reporting date the Group is required to assess whether there is 
objective evidence that its investments in associates and joint ventures may 
be impaired. This requires estimates of the investments’ recoverable amounts, 
including present values of the Group’s share of future cash ﬂ ows.
Inventories
As inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value this 
requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of goods to customers in 
the future. A high degree of judgement is applied when estimating the impact 
on the carrying value of inventories of factors such as slow moving items, 
shrinkage, damage and obsolescence. The quantity, age and condition of 
inventories are regularly measured and assessed as part of range reviews 
and inventory counts undertaken throughout the year and across the Group. 
Refer to note 18 for further information. 
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Signiﬁ cant 
judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each 
territory. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate 
tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The 
Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates 
of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the ﬁ nal outcome of these matters 
is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such 
determination is made. Refer to notes 9 and 25 for further information.
Restructuring provisions
The Group carries a number of provisions in relation to historical and ongoing 
restructuring programmes. The most signiﬁ cant part of the provisions is the 
cost to exit stores and property contracts. The ultimate costs and timing of cash 
ﬂ ows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores 
and subletting surplus space. Refer to note 26 for further information.
Post employment beneﬁ ts
The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t liabilities recognised on the balance 
sheet is dependent on a number of assumptions including interest rates of high 
quality corporate bonds, inﬂ ation and mortality rates. The net interest charge or 
return is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds 
and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets. The assumptions are 
based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can 
lead to signiﬁ cant movements in the estimated obligations. The key 
assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis, are given in note 27.

Income tax expense        180 181
The effective rate of tax on proﬁ t before exceptional items and excluding tax adjustments in respect of prior years and changes in tax rates is 29% (2009/10: 30%). 
Tax on exceptional items for the year is a credit of £3m, all of which relates to current year items. In 2009/10 tax on exceptional items was a charge of £7m, all of 
which related to current year items. The effective tax rate calculation is set out in the Financial review on page 22. 
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of £33m has been charged directly to equity (2009/10: £55m credit), of which a £5m credit 
(2009/10: £12m credit) is included in current tax and a £38m charge (2009/10: £43m credit) is included in deferred tax.
The revised comparatives in the income tax expense table above reﬂ ect a reassessment of balances expected to be settled on behalf of UK and overseas 
operating companies.
Kingﬁ sher paid €138m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this 
as an exceptional tax charge. Kingﬁ sher appealed against this tax liability and the tribunal found in favour of Kingﬁ sher in June 2009. As a result, on 7 September 
2009 the Group received €169m (£148m) from the French tax authorities, representing a refund of the €138m and €31m of repayment supplement. The French 
tax authorities have appealed against this decision and the appeal court hearing date is awaited. No income has therefore been recognised in respect of this receipt.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁ t for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) which for the purpose of this calculation are treated 
as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. These represent 
share options granted to employees where both the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s shares during the year and any related 
performance conditions have been met.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash generating units (‘CGUs’) as follows:
£ millions     UK France Poland China Total
At 29 January 2011
Cost     1,796 518 81 117 2,512
Impairment     – – – (117) (117)

Impairment     – – – (112) (112)
Net carrying amount     1,796 518 81 – 2,395
The recoverable amounts of these groups of CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The groups of CGUs for which the carrying 
amount of goodwill is deemed signiﬁ cant are the UK and France. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below:
Assumptions
The cash ﬂ ow projections are based on ﬁ nancial budgets and strategic plans approved by the Board covering a ﬁ ve year period. These are based on both –
past performance and expectations for future market development.
Key drivers in the plans are like-for-like (‘LFL ’) sales, margin and operating proﬁ t percentage. LFL sales are based on the Group’s market expectations and the –
CGUs’ market shares.
Cash ﬂ ows beyond this ﬁ ve year period are calculated using a growth rate of 1.9% (2009/10: 1.9%) which does not exceed the long term average growth rate –
for retail businesses operating in the same countries as the CGUs.
Working capital movements are included in the model, building in anticipated movements due to the level of trading and including reductions across the Group –
as part of the Delivering Value programme over the ﬁ rst three years.
The weighted average cost of capital, used to discount future cash ﬂ ows, is calculated using a combination of the cost of debt and the cost of equity balanced –
according to the Group’s level of ﬁ nancial gearing. A risk adjustment is then made for the country in which the CGU operates.

2010/11
UK
The risk-adjusted discount rate of 11.2% (2009/10: 11.3%) is pre-tax and reﬂ ects the speciﬁ c risks inherent in the UK market. The Board do not consider that a –
reasonably possible change would lead to the recoverable amount being below the carrying amount of goodwill.
France
The risk-adjusted discount rate of 11.4% (2009/10: 11.6%) is pre-tax and reﬂ ects the speciﬁ c risks inherent in the French market. The Board do not consider –
that a reasonably possible change would lead to the recoverable amount being below the carrying amount of goodwill.
Poland
The risk-adjusted discount rate of 12.7% (2009/10: 13.2%) is pre-tax and reﬂ ects the speciﬁ c risks inherent in the Polish market. The Board do not consider –
that a reasonably possible change would lead to the recoverable amount being below the carrying amount of goodwill.

Properties that were held at 1 February 2004 are carried at deemed cost, being the fair value of land and buildings as at the transition date to IFRS. Fair value is 
taken to be the open market value at the date of valuation. All property acquired after 1 February 2004 is carried at cost.
Included in land and buildings is leasehold land that is in effect a prepayment for the use of land and is accordingly being amortised on a straight line basis over 
the estimated useful life of the assets. The cost and depreciation of leasehold land included in land and buildings at 29 January 2011 are £264m and £54m 
(2009/10: £331m and £56m) respectively. 
The Group does not revalue properties within its ﬁ nancial statements. A valuation exercise is performed for internal purposes annually in October by independent 
external valuers covering over one third of the property portfolio with the remaining portfolio valued internally. Based on this exercise the value of property is £3.3 
billion (2009/10: £3.0bn). The key assumption used in calculating this is the estimated yields.

Bank overdrafts and loans
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and current bank loans mature within the next 12 months. Bank overdrafts are arranged at ﬂ oating rates of interest. 
Current bank loans include Chinese Renminbi loans drawn under committed and uncommitted facilities expiring in July 2013 and July 2011 respectively. These 
loans bear interest based on the People’s Bank of China reference rate and are ﬁ xed for periods of up to six months. At the year end the effective borrowing rate 
on the drawn amounts was 4.8%. Other current bank loans are arranged at ﬂ oating rates of interest.
Non-current bank loans have an average maturity of two years (2009/10: two years) and are arranged at ﬁ xed rates of interest with an effective interest rate of 
4.3% (2009/10: 6.1%).
There has been a reduction in the level of bank loans in China during the year.

 Swapped to ﬂ oating rate Euro based on 3 month EURIBOR plus a margin using a cross-currency interest rate swap. £149m was repurchased in the year.
The Group values its MTNs and USPP on an amortised cost basis, adjusted for fair value gains and losses (based on observable market inputs) attributable to the 
risk being hedged in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships. 
The carrying amounts of the MTNs and USPP have been impacted both by exchange rate movements and fair value adjustments for interest rate risk. 
At 29 January 2011, the cumulative effect of interest rate fair value adjustments is to increase the Group’s MTNs and USPP carrying amounts by £44m 
(2009/10: £70m). 
The USPP contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual ﬁ nancial reporting period, the ratio of operating proﬁ t to net interest 
payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period. The Group has complied with this covenant for the year 
ended 29 January 2011. 
Finance leases
The Group leases certain of its buildings and ﬁ xtures and equipment under ﬁ nance leases. The average lease term maturity for buildings is seven years 
(2009/10: seven years) and for ﬁ xtures and equipment is two years (2009/10: two years). Certain building leases include a clause to enable upward revision 
of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.
Future minimum lease payments under ﬁ nance leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments, are as follows:

Present value of minimum lease payments       70  65
The interest rates inherent in the ﬁ nance leases are ﬁ xed at the contract date for the lease term. The weighted average effective interest rate on the Group’s 
ﬁ nance leases is 8.4% (2009/10: 8.2%).

22 Borrowings continued
Fair value of borrowings
The fair values of current borrowings approximate to their carrying amounts.
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair values of non-current borrowings. Where market values are not available or are not reliable, 
fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ﬂ ows at prevailing interest and foreign exchange rates. The carrying amounts and fair values of non-current 
borrowings are as follows:
       2010/11   2009/10
       Carrying  Fair Carrying Fair
£ millions      amount value amount value

The net fair value of derivatives by hedge designation at the balance sheet date is:
£ millions        2010/11 2009/10
Fair value hedges         58 116

Current liabilities        (11) (25)
Non-current liabilities        (17) (47)

The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash ﬂ ows arising from the instruments and adjusting for credit risk. These fair value measurements are all made using 
observable market rates of interest, foreign exchange and credit risk and are therefore classiﬁ ed as ‘level 2’ in the IFRS 7 , ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, fair value 
hierarchy. At 29 January 201 1 net derivative assets included in net debt/cash amount to £56m (2009/10: £20m net derivative assets). 
Fair value hedges
Fair value hedges comprise interest rate swap contracts that convert ﬁ xed rate debt issued under the Group’s MTN programme and the US Private Placement to ﬂ oating 
rate liabilities, along with certain cross-currency swaps. At 29 January 201 1 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £537m (2009/10: £984m). During the year, 
interest rate swaps have been cancelled as a result of repayments or repurchases of underlying debt. The Sterling equivalent amount of those cancellations (at year end 
exchange rates) was £551m.
Cash ﬂ ow hedges
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases. At 29 January 201 1 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is 
£279m (2009/10: £264m). The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months. Gains of 
£14m (2009/10: £5m gains) have been transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year.
Net investment hedges
Cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge currency exposures of overseas investments. At 29 January 201 1 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £48m 
(2009/10: £138m).
Non-designated hedges
The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against ﬂ uctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions. At 
29 January 2011 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £1,038m (2009/10: £1,100m). These have not been accounted for as hedges, since the 
fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet positions. These include short term foreign 
exchange contracts.
The Group has reviewed all signiﬁ cant contracts for embedded derivatives and none of these contracts has any embedded derivatives which are not closely 
related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately.

24 Financial risk management
Kingﬁ sher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for managing certain ﬁ nancial risks to which the Group is exposed. The Board reviews the levels of exposure 
regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of ﬁ nancial instruments required to manage these risks. Kingﬁ sher’s treasury function is not run as a proﬁ t 
centre and does not enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
In the normal course of business the Group uses ﬁ nancial instruments including derivatives. The main types of ﬁ nancial instruments used are Medium Term Notes 
and other ﬁ xed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk
Borrowings arranged at ﬂ oating rates of interest expose the Group to cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at ﬁ xed rates of interest expose the Group 
to fair value interest rate risk. The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable 
on the Group’s underlying debt instruments, principally the Medium Term Notes and other ﬁ xed term debt.
Currency risk
The Group’s principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi. The Euro, Polish Zloty and Chinese Renminbi exposures 
are operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Ireland, Poland and China. Balance sheet Euro translation exposure is hedged 
by maintaining a proportion of the Group’s debt in Euro, whilst Chinese Renminbi balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China. It is the 
Group’s policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings into Sterling. In addition, the Group has signiﬁ cant transactional exposure arising on the purchase 
of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign exchange contracts. Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to 
hedge committed inventory purchases and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Kingﬁ sher’s policy is to manage the interest rate and currency proﬁ le of its issued debt using derivative contracts. The effect of these contracts on the Group’s net 
debt/cash is as follows:

Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the signiﬁ cant market risks impacting Kingﬁ sher, are borrowings, deposits and 
derivatives. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of net ﬁ nance costs (reﬂ ecting the impact on proﬁ t) and derivative cash ﬂ ow hedges (reﬂ ecting the 
impact on other comprehensive income) to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

Due to the Group’s hedging arrangements and offsetting foreign currency assets and liabilities, there is no signiﬁ cant impact on proﬁ t from the retranslation of 
ﬁ nancial instruments.

The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash ﬂ ow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars used to hedge forecast 
US Dollar purchases of inventories. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the purchases occur. See note 23 for further details. 
The retranslation of foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations is reported in equity, but offset 
by the retranslation of the hedged net investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables and receivables, due to 
the low associated sensitivity, and are before the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis that the Group’s debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting 
designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts remain constant, reﬂ ecting the positions at 29 January 2011 and 30 January 2010 
respectively. As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended. In preparing the 
sensitivity analysis it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective.
The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Liquidity risk
The Group regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent cash ﬂ ow forecast for the next 
three years, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayments of debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate 
amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected outﬂ ows. 
The following table analyses the Group’s non-derivative ﬁ nancial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. It excludes trade and other payables due to the low associated liquidity risk. The 
amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ﬂ ows (including interest) and as such may differ from the amounts disclosed on the 
balance sheet.

At 29 January 2011 the Group has an undrawn revolving facility of £500m which matures in August 2012. The £500m facility contains a covenant requiring that, 
as at the end of each annual ﬁ nancial reporting period, the ratio of operating proﬁ t to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 
3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month period. The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 29 January 2011.

Credit risk
The Group deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with strong credit ratings and with money market funds which have the strongest, AAA, credit rating 
and offer same day liquidity. A credit limit for each counterparty is agreed by the Board covering the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of 
derivative contracts. The credit risk is reduced further by spreading the investments and derivative contracts across several counterparties. At 29 January 2011, 
the highest cash deposit with a single counterparty was £86m (2009/10: £101m).
The Group’s exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash at bank and short term deposits and the fair value of derivative assets.
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts as the Group has a low concentration of credit risk in 
respect of trade receivables. Concentration of risk is limited as a result of low individual balances with short maturity spread across a large number of unrelated 
customers.
At 29 January 2011, trade and other receivables that are past due but not provided against amount to £34m (2009/10: £29m), of which £3m (2009/10: £4m) are 
over 120 days past due.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £268m (2009/10: £316m) available for offset against future proﬁ ts. A deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of £4m (2009/10: £7m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £264m (2009/10: £309m) 
due to the unpredictability of future proﬁ t streams. Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China of £213m (2009/10: £245m) which can only 
be carried forward in the next one to ﬁ ve years and tax losses arising in Spain of £21m (2009/10: £27m) which can only be carried forward for up to 15 years. 
Other losses may be carried forward indeﬁ nitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the 
Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Earnings which could be remitted on which there would be tax to pay total £99m 
(2009/10: £91m).

Within the onerous property contracts provisions, Kingﬁ sher has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a shortfall and long term idle properties, 
except those related to restructuring programmes which are included in the restructuring provisions. The provisions are based on the present value of future cash 
outﬂ ows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
Restructuring provisions include the estimated costs of the UK and China restructuring programmes. The provisions have been discounted to reﬂ ect the time value 
of money and the risks associated with the speciﬁ c liabilities.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash ﬂ ows related to the above provisions are largely dependent on exiting the property lease contracts and subletting 
surplus space.
27 Post employment beneﬁ ts
The Group operates a variety of post employment beneﬁ t arrangements covering both funded and unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes and funded deﬁ ned 
contribution schemes. The most signiﬁ cant are the funded, ﬁ nal salary deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution schemes for the Group’s UK employees. Various 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution schemes are operated in France and Poland, where they are retirement indemnity in nature, and in China. The overseas 
schemes are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
Deﬁ ned contribution schemes
Pension costs for deﬁ ned contribution schemes, at rates speciﬁ ed in the individual schemes’ rules, are as follows:
£ millions        2010/11 2009/10
Charge to operating proﬁ t        6 4
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes
The Group’s principal deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme is in the UK. The assets of this scheme are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds. 
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the scheme’s beneﬁ ciaries.
The UK scheme was closed to new entrants in 2004. A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the 
scheme Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2010. The Company monitors the scheme funding level on a regular basis and will 
review with the scheme Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place.
UK scheme interest in property partnership
On 28 January 2011 the Group entered into an arrangement with the scheme Trustee to address an element of the current scheme deﬁ cit.
The Group established a partnership, Kingﬁ sher Scottish Limited Partnership (‘Kingﬁ sher SLP’). The partnership interests are held by the Group and by the 
scheme, the latter resulting from a £78m investment made by the scheme Trustee. This investment followed a Group contribution of the same amount into the 
scheme. Under IAS 19, ‘Employee beneﬁ ts’, the investment held by the scheme in Kingﬁ sher SLP does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the Group’s 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Accordingly the pension deﬁ cit position does not reﬂ ect the £78m investment. The Group has control over the partnership and 
therefore it is consolidated in these Group ﬁ nancial statements. Accordingly, advantage has been taken of the exemptions provided by Regulation 7 of the 
Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 from the requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of the partnership’s accounts.
UK property assets with a market value of £83m were transferred into the partnership and leased back to B&Q plc. The Group retains control over these 
properties, including the ﬂ exibility to substitute alternative properties. The Trustee has a ﬁ rst charge over the properties in the event that Kingﬁ sher plc becomes 
insolvent. The scheme’s partnership interest entitles it to the majority of the income of the partnership over the next 20 years. These future payments to the 
scheme by Kingﬁ sher SLP will be reﬂ ected as Group pension contributions on a cash basis. At the end of this term, Kingﬁ sher plc has the option to acquire the 
Trustee’s partnership interest in Kingﬁ sher SLP.

The estimated amount of total contributions expected to be paid to the UK, France and other pension schemes by the Group during the next ﬁ nancial year is £49m. 
Principal actuarial valuation assumptions
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes are set by the Directors after consultation with 
independent professionally qualiﬁ ed actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to 
signiﬁ cant movements in the estimated obligations, as illustrated in the sensitivity analysis.
The UK scheme discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between 
iBoxx and scheme liabilities. The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reﬂ ects market expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns 
and the mix of assets in the schemes.

For the UK scheme, the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience of the 
membership of the scheme from 2007 to 2010. The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected 
forward to 2010 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females. In addition, allowance has been 
made for future increases in life expectancy. For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 
1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the average of the standard series and long cohort improvements, subject to a minimum of 1% pa. These 
improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends.
The assumptions for life expectancy of UK scheme members are as follows:
Years        2010/11 2009/10
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)  
– Male        86.4 87.2
– Female         87.1 85.9
Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years’ time)  
– Male        87.1 88.8
– Female        88.7 87.1
The following sensitivity analysis for the UK scheme shows the estimated impact on obligations resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions, whilst holding 
all other assumptions constant.

 The charge to the income statement for the years ended 29 January 2011 and 30 January 2010 in respect of share-based payments includes the ﬁ rst year’s charge of the 2011 
and 2010 Kingﬁ sher Incentive Share Scheme (‘KISS’) grants respectively, based on the cash bonus for the year. Since grants under the KISS are made following the year end to 
which the ﬁ rst year of charge relates, it is not possible to give the number of options granted until after the year end.

 The weighted average exercise price for options granted during the year represents a blend of nil price KISS, Performance Share Plan and Store Manager Incentive Plan options 
and discounted ShareSave options (see below).
Information on the share schemes is given in note 13 of the Company’s separate ﬁ nancial statements.
Options have been exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. On that basis, the weighted average share price during the year, rather than at the date of 
exercise, is £2.30 (2009/10: £1.96). The options outstanding at the end of the year have exercise prices ranging from nil to £2.38 and a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of 2.1 years (2009/10: 2.6 years).
The Group recognised a total expense of £21m in the year (2009/10: £20m) relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Under IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’, the Group recognises a charge for share options granted after 7 November 2002. Option numbers and other disclosures 
above are for those options granted after this date. A full list of outstanding options is given in note 13 of the Company’s separate ﬁ nancial statements.

34 Contingent liabilities
Kingﬁ sher plc has an obligation to provide a bank guarantee for £50m (2009/10: £50m) to the liquidators of Kingﬁ sher International France Limited in the event 
that Kingﬁ sher plc’s credit rating falls below ‘BBB’. The obligation arises from an indemnity provided in June 2003 as a result of the demerger of Kesa Electricals.
A guarantee of £57m (€66m) denominated in Euros has been provided to the Italian tax authorities in respect of a tax credit. This has been covered by a 
guarantee for the term of the contingent liability.
In addition, the Group has arranged for certain bank guarantees to be provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business. The total amount outstanding 
at 29 January 2011 is £34m (2009/10: £36m). 
The Group is subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and provision is made where liabilities are considered likely to arise on the 
basis of current information and legal advice.
35 Related party transactions
During the year, the Company and its subsidiaries carried out a number of transactions with related parties in the normal course of business and on an arm’s

Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
and for being satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁ nancial statements sufﬁ cient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁ cant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial information in 
the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁ nancial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁ nancial statements
In our opinion the Group ﬁ nancial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 29 January –
2011 and of its proﬁ t for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the –
European Union; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies –
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been –
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
the information given in the Directors’ report for the ﬁ nancial year for which –
the Group ﬁ nancial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by law are not –
made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for –
our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ responsibilities –
statement in relation to going concern;
the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s –
compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code 
speciﬁ ed for our review; and
certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on –
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements of 
Kingﬁ sher plc for the year ended 29 January 2011.

Notes to the Company 
fi nancial statements
1 Principal accounting policies
The ﬁ nancial statements of Kingﬁ sher plc (‘the Company’) are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January each year. 
The directors of Kingﬁ sher plc, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the Company to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 
29 January 2011. Refer to the Directors’ statement of responsibility on page 34.
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁ ed by the use of valuations for certain ﬁ nancial instruments, share-
based payments and pensions, and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006.
The Company’s ﬁ nancial statements are included in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of Kingﬁ sher plc. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 
2006, the proﬁ t and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses are not presented. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
from preparing a cash ﬂ ow statement under the terms of FRS 1, ‘Cash ﬂ ow statements’. The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8, ‘Related party 
disclosures’, from disclosing related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries of Kingﬁ sher plc. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
to provide ﬁ nancial instrument disclosures under the terms of FRS 29, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these ﬁ nancial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to the 
years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a. Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
on monetary items are taken to the proﬁ t and loss account.
Principal rate of exchange against Sterling:
Euro        2010/11 2009/10
Year end rate            1.16 1.15
b. Tangible ﬁ xed assets
Tangible ﬁ xed assets are carried in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. Depreciation is provided to reﬂ ect 
a straight line reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: 
Fixtures and ﬁ ttings   – between 4 and 20 years
Computers and electronic equipment – between 2 and 5 years
Motor cars   – 4 years
Tangible ﬁ xed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review 
for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value-in-use and net realisable value. Any impairment in value is 
charged to the proﬁ t and loss account in the period in which it occurs.
c. Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are included in the balance sheet at cost, less any provisions for impairment.
d. Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account in the period to which the payments relate. Incentives received or paid to enter into 
lease agreements are released to the proﬁ t and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date on which the rent is 
ﬁ rst expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate.

e. Employee beneﬁ ts
(i) Pensions
The Company operates deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned contribution pension schemes for its employees. A deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme is a pension scheme that deﬁ nes 
an amount of pension beneﬁ t that an employee will receive on retirement. A deﬁ ned contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the Company usually 
pays ﬁ xed contributions into a separate entity. In all cases a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing liabilities. The assets of each of these funds 
are either held under trusts or managed by insurance companies and are held entirely separate from the Company’s assets.
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes is the fair value of scheme assets less the present value of 
the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation at the balance sheet date, together with an adjustment for any past service costs not yet recognised. The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outﬂ ows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the beneﬁ ts 
will be paid and which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited directly to the proﬁ t and loss 
reserve as they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the proﬁ t and loss account, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees 
remaining in service for a speciﬁ ed period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period.
For deﬁ ned contribution schemes, the Company pays contributions to privately administered pension schemes on a contractual basis. The Company has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee beneﬁ t expense when they are due. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
(ii) Share-based compensation
The Company operates several equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of options or deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount to be expensed over 
the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or deferred shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions. The value of the charge is adjusted to reﬂ ect expected and actual levels of options vesting due to non-market vesting conditions.
(iii) Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’)
The ESOP is a separately administered discretionary trust. Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise 
shares in the Company. 
Own shares held by the ESOP are deducted from equity shareholders’ funds and the shares are held at historical cost until they are sold. The assets, liabilities, 
income and costs of the ESOP are included in both the Company’s and the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
f. Deferred tax
Provision is made for deferred tax using the incremental provision approach and is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date subject to the following:
Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date. –
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not recognised. 
Deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only where dividends are accrued as receivable or there is an –
intention to remit these in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more –
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences. –
g. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outﬂ ow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

fi nancial statements
1 Principal accounting policies continued
h. Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂ ows from the ﬁ nancial asset expire or the Company has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities (or a part of a ﬁ nancial liability) are derecognised when the obligation speciﬁ ed in the contract 
is discharged or cancelled or expires.
(i) Borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Where borrowings 
are in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made to their carrying amounts to reﬂ ect the hedged risks. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the proﬁ t and loss account using the effective interest method.
(ii) Trade creditors
Trade creditors are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
(iii) Derivatives and hedge accounting
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to which it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the proﬁ t and loss 
account as they arise.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently carried at fair value. The accounting treatment of 
derivatives classiﬁ ed as hedges depends on their designation, which occurs at the start of the hedge relationship. The Company designates certain derivatives 
as a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability (‘fair value hedge’).
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the 
corresponding entry being recorded in the proﬁ t and loss account. Gains or losses from remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are also recognised 
in the proﬁ t and loss account.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company documents in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. 
The Company also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the 
hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains 
highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting. 
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁ nancial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the proﬁ t and loss account.

Within the onerous property contracts provision, the Company has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a shortfall and long term idle 
properties. The provision is based on the present value of future cash outﬂ ows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
9 Net pension asset/(liability)
The Company participates in both a funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme and a funded deﬁ ned contribution scheme. 
Deﬁ ned contribution scheme
Pension costs for the deﬁ ned contribution scheme, at rates speciﬁ ed in the scheme’s rules, are as follows:
£ millions        2010/11 2009/10
Charge to operating proﬁ t            1 1
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme
Kingﬁ sher plc is one of a number of Group companies that participate in the Kingﬁ sher Pension Scheme, and therefore the Company has accounted for its share 
of the scheme assets and liabilities. The valuation of the scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010 and has been 
updated to 29 January 2011.
On 28 January 2011 the Company entered into an arrangement with the scheme Trustee to address an element of the scheme deﬁ cit. Further details on this 
arrangement are given in note 27 of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. As part of this arrangement, the Company made a contribution of £78m to the scheme 
and subsequently recharged the other participating Group entities based on their share of pensionable payroll. This net cash contribution made by the Company 
resulted in an increase of £2m in the Company’s share of the scheme’s assets.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes are set by the Directors after consultation with 
independent professionally qualiﬁ ed actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to 
signiﬁ cant movements in the estimated obligation.
The discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated Sterling corporate bond index adjusted for the difference in term between iBoxx 
and scheme liabilities. The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets reﬂ ects market expectations at the valuation date of long term asset returns and 
the mix of assets in the scheme.

For the UK scheme, the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience of the 
membership of the scheme from 2007 to 2010. The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected 
forward to 2010 with the medium cohort improvement factors for males and with the standard improvement factors for females. In addition, allowance has been 
made for future increases in life expectancy. For males, the allowance is in line with medium cohort improvements subject to a minimum rate of improvement of 
1% pa, and for females, the allowance is in line with the average of the standard series and long cohort improvements, subject to a minimum of 1% pa. These 
improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends.
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows:
Years        2010/11 2009/10
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)  
– Male        86.4 87.2
– Female         87.1 85.9
Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years’ time)  
– Male        87.1 88.8
– Female        88.7 87.1

The Kingﬁ sher Incentive Share Scheme (‘KISS’) and Performance Share Plan are described as part of the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 41 to 53. 
Restricted Special Awards are granted as one-off compensatory awards granted under the rules of the KISS. They are nil cost options, as with the KISS, but do 
not accrue dividends until after they are exercised. Vesting dates may vary according to individual grants.
Certain employees, excluding Directors, have been granted contingent share awards under the Kingﬁ sher Retention Plan.
The Store Manager Incentive Plan provided provisional awards to store managers in 2009 that will vest in April 2011 and April 2012. There are performance 
conditions based on store standards and an award will lapse if these are not maintained throughout the performance period. These awards do not accrue 
dividends during the vesting period.
Under the UK ShareSave scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into HMRC approved savings contracts for a period of three or ﬁ ve years, 
whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract. The option price is the average market price over three days shortly before an offer to 
subscribe, discounted by 20%. Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or ﬁ ve year period. The International ShareSave 
scheme, which operates along the lines of the UK ShareSave scheme, includes eligible employees in certain overseas locations. 
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option schemes was made in April 2003. Under these schemes, 
participants received a bi-annual grant of options based on their position in the Group. These options are normally exercisable from the third anniversary of the 
date of the grant (up to the tenth anniversary), except where the performance condition has not been met, in which case this date is deferred accordingly. The 
performance conditions for all options have now been met, except for the grant made in April 2003. On the exercise of Phantom Share Options, participants 
receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of shares in the Company. 
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
Under FRS 20, ‘Share-based payment’, the Company recognises a charge for share options granted after 7 November 2002. The Company has not repeated 
the disclosures required by FRS 20 as these are already included in note 30 of the Kingﬁ sher plc consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.

The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’)
The ESOP is funded by an interest free loan from the Company of £45m (2009/10: £51m) to enable it to acquire shares in Kingﬁ sher plc. The shares are used to 
satisfy options awarded under the KISS, Performance Share Plan, Kingﬁ sher Retention Plan, Store Manager Incentive Plan, International ShareSave, Executive, 
International Executive and Phantom Share Options schemes.
The ESOP’s shareholding at 29 January 2011 is 12 million shares (2009/10: 15 million shares) with a nominal value of £2m (2009/10: £2m) and a market value of 
£30m (2009/10: £32m). Dividends on these shares were waived for the interim and ﬁ nal dividends.
14 Contingent liabilities
The Company has an obligation to provide a bank guarantee for £50m (2009/10: £50m) to the liquidators of Kingﬁ sher International France Limited in the event 
that the Company’s credit rating falls below ‘BBB’. The obligation arises from an indemnity provided in June 2003 as a result of the demerger of Kesa Electricals.
In addition, the Group has arranged for certain bank guarantees to be provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business. The total amount outstanding 
at 29 January 2011 is £4m (2009/10: £4m).
15 Related party transactions

Independent auditors’ report to 
the members of Kingfi sher plc
We have audited the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements of Kingﬁ sher plc for 
the year ended 29 January 2011 which comprise the Parent Company balance 
sheet and the related notes 1 to 15. The ﬁ nancial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements and for being satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the ﬁ nancial statements sufﬁ cient to give reasonable assurance that the 
ﬁ nancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of signiﬁ cant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁ nancial 
and non-ﬁ nancial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited ﬁ nancial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams)
Kingﬁ sher plc is legally obliged to make its share register available to the 
general public. Consequently some shareholders may receive unsolicited mail, 
including correspondence from unauthorised investment companies.
Companies have become increasingly aware that their shareholders have 
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK 
shareholders offering to sell what often turn out to be worthless or high risk 
shares in US or UK investments. They can be very persistent and extremely 
persuasive. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be 
included in Company mailings.

Payment methods 
Shareholders can elect to receive their dividends in a number of ways:
Cheque – cash dividends will automatically be paid to shareholders by 
cheque, which will be sent by post to the shareholder’s registered address.
BACS – cash dividends can be paid by mandate directly to a UK bank or 
building society account through the BACS system. This method of 
payment reduces the risk of your cheque being intercepted or lost in the 
post. Shareholders wishing to receive their dividends in this way can update 
their mandate instructions at www.investorcentre.co.uk or should complete 
a dividend mandate form and return it to the Registrars;

is on track
The seven step programme to improve cash returns, known 
as ‘Delivering Value’, is progressing well. The programme 
was mobilised during 2008/09, commenced in 2009/10 
and is due to complete by the end of January 201 1/12. The 
initiatives are supporting the trading performance in the 
shorter term and also better positioning the Group for its 
next stage of development. After two full years of the 
programme Kingfi sher is now a signifi cantly stronger, 
higher returning business.
The fi nancial year 201 1/12 will be another busy year as we 
complete the fi nal milestones for the Delivering Value phase 
and mobilise the activities that will drive the next phase of 
our development.

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements included in this Annual Report and Accounts are forward-looking and 
are therefore subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to 
differ materially from those expressed or implied because they relate to future events. These 
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the Company’s 
expectations around its three key priorities of Management, Capital and Returns and the 
associated seven steps to Delivering Value objectives.
Forward-looking statements can be identiﬁ ed by the use of relevant terminology including the 
words: “believes”, “estimates”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “goal”, “target”, “aim”, 
“may”, “will”, “would”, “could” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or 
comparable terminology and include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a 
number of places throughout this Annual Report and Accounts and include statements regarding 
our intentions, beliefs or current expectations and those of our ofﬁ cers, directors and employees 
concerning, amongst other things, our results of operations, ﬁ nancial condition, changes in tax 
rates, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the businesses we operate. 
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the 
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, global economic business conditions, 
monetary and interest rate policies, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and property prices, 
the impact of competition, inﬂ ation and deﬂ ation, changes to regulations, taxes and legislation, 
changes to consumer saving and spending habits; and our success in managing these factors.
Consequently, our actual future ﬁ nancial condition, performance and results could differ 
materially from the plans, goals and expectations set out in our forward-looking statements. 
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) – the Company also offers 
shareholders a DRIP, whereby shareholders can use their cash dividend 
to buy further shares in the Company. Shareholders can apply online at
www.investorcentre.co.uk or complete a mandate form and return it to 
the address shown above; and
Global Payments Service – this service provided by the Registrar enables 
shareholders to have dividend payments paid directly into their bank account 
in their chosen local currency. To view terms and register, please visit 
www.computershare.com/uk/investor/GPS.

The Company has a Sponsored Level 1 ADR programme in the United States. 
Each ADR represents two Kingﬁ sher shares.
Electronic communication
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting the Company obtained shareholder 
approval to adopt the changes in law regarding electronic communications, 
allowing the Company to use the Kingﬁ sher plc website as the main method 
of communication with shareholders, unless they have elected to continue 
receiving hard copy statutory documentation. Shareholders who have not 
elected to receive shareholder documentation in electronic form, can sign 
up by visiting www.investorcentre.co.uk/ecomms and registering their details. 
When you register for e-communications, shareholders will be sent an email 
each time the Company publishes statutory documents, providing a link to 
the information. 
Electing for e-communications does not mean shareholders can no longer 
obtain hard copy documents. Should shareholders require a hard copy version 
of any of the Company’s statutory documentation, they should contact the 
Registrar at the address stated under the section headed ‘Registrar’.
Document viewing
Shareholders will have the opportunity to view certain documentation as 
outlined in the Notice of Annual General Meeting from at least 15 minutes prior 
to the meeting, until its conclusion.

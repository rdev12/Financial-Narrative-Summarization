www.capitalandcounties.com 7 
I am pleased to report that 2013 was a year of excellent 
performance for Capco. This is our fourth set of annual 
results following our establishment as an independent 
company , a period in which the business has grown in 
value and capability with a strong focus on its two 
estates in central London, Covent Garden and Earls 
Court Properties. In 2013, signiﬁ cant milestones were 
achieved across the business as Capco continued to 
execute its strategy to generate market-leading total 
returns for shareholders. 
At Covent Garden, ERV increased by 11 per cent to 
£58.0 million and we have welcomed a number of 
luxury brands to the estate, including Dior Beauty , 
Burberry Beauty Box and Miller Harris. In December 
2013, Westminster Council resolved to grant planning 
consent for a redevelopment of Kings Court and 
Carriage Hall which will cover over 90,000 square feet, 
our ﬁ rst major development at Covent Garden.
The Earls Court Masterplan has achieved outline 
planning consent and a detailed planning application 
in respect of Earls Court Village to progress the design 
of the scheme has been submitted. As the development 
is implemented, the local community will beneﬁ t 
through commitments made under the Section 106 
agreement. Discussions with Transport for London 
(“TfL”) regarding a proposed joint venture to enable 
the development of EC1 & EC2 in line with the Earls 
Court Masterplan are progressing well. At Lillie Square, 
our joint venture is preparing to launch the ﬁ rst phase 
of a residential scheme that will provide over 800 
new homes. 
Following recent investment to enhance the Olympia 
venue, the exhibitions business has been re-launched 
as Olympia London.
In December 2013 the Company became a constituent 
of the JSE 40 index in South Africa which comprises 
the largest companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock 
Exchange. Capco remains a member of the FTSE 250 
index in the UK.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
In 2013, Capco delivered strong performance with 
a total return of 23 per cent, of which the main 
component was the increase in EPRA adjusted, diluted 
NAV per share from 203 pence to 249 pence. The 
valuation of the Group’s property assets increased by 
19.9 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Total shareholder 
return was 37 per cent.
The Directors are proposing a ﬁ nal dividend of 
1.0 pence per share, bringing the total dividend 
paid and payable for 2013 to 1.5 pence per share. 
I would like to thank the Executive Directors and all 
Capco’s staff  for their hard work and commitment 
during 2013 which has generated the Group’s 
performance.
THE BOARD AND ITS ACTIVITIES
Capco’s Board operates openly and transparently , 
allowing dialogue and debate between the Executive 
and Non-executive Directors. The eff ective operation 
of the Board was endorsed by an external Board 
evaluation undertaken during the year, which is 
described on page 55. I would like to thank the 
Non-executive Directors for their continued 
commitment during 2013.
During the year, the Board considered the Group’s 
strategy and conﬁ rmed that the focus on central 
London retail and residential property , with the 
ﬂ exibility to consider non-core opportunities, 
remained appropriate.
2013 saw the application of a revised UK Corporate 
Governance code as well as new remuneration 
reporting regulations. Our Audit Committee Report 
on page 57 and Directors’ Remuneration report on 
page 62 reﬂ ect these new disclosure requirements.
More details on the Board’s activities may be read in 
the Corporate Governance Report on page 52.
COMMUNITY
Our corporate strategy is complemented by continued 
investment and participation in the communities 
where our estates are based. Many of our staff  
participated in our Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) 
programme during the year, contributing over 
515 hours to supporting projects. In 2013 the CR 
programme included fund raising events for The Sir 
Simon Milton Foundation and the Covent Garden 
charity Mousetrap Theatre Projects, engagement with 
schools in both Earls Court and Covent Garden and the 
sponsorship and organisation of a Community Fun Day 
at Earls Court. 
MOVING FORWARD
London continues to thrive as a global city and the 
value of this remains attractive to investors. As we 
begin 2014, macroeconomic conditions appear to be 
improving, but we must not be complacent and we will 
continue to focus on the delivery of Capco’s strategy .
I am conﬁ dent that this clear strategy , with its focus 
on London, and Capco’s strong ﬁ nancial position will 
enable the Company to capitalise on the momentum 
of 2013 and continue to deliver attractive returns for 
shareholders, whilst embarking on exciting place-
making initiatives at both of our landmark estates.

DELIVERING 
VALUE 
THROUGH 
PERFORMANCE
Chief Executive’s Review
Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive
Capco performed strongly in 2013 as a result of the strategy to 
grow value at Covent Garden and create value at Earls Court. 
Adjusted NAV per share grew 22.4 per cent to 249 pence per share, 
driven by a total property return of 21.9 per cent. Underlying 
earnings were 1.0 pence per share in 2013.
The central London property market continues to perform strongly , 
with a deep pool of investors and occupiers. London continues to 
thrive as a global city , beneﬁ ting the retail and residential sectors 
on which Capco focuses.
The creative place-making strategy at Covent Garden has again 
enabled the estate to outperform other areas in central London. 
The Group’s vision for Earls Court has led to the outline planning 
consent for a 10.1 million sq ft scheme, adding further momentum 
to the project.
Valuations
The Group beneﬁ ted from strong valuations across the business. 
The property portfolio is valued at £2.3 billion as at 31 December 
2013, an increase of 19.9 per cent like-for-like over the year.
Covent Garden
The Covent Garden estate has performed strongly in 2013. The 
neighbourhood is now established as a vibrant and exciting 
district of central London and is receiving global recognition 
as a world-class retail destination.
The estate is valued at £1,156 million as at 31 December 2013, 
a like-for-like increase of 19.2 per cent during 2013. The major 
component of this increase is the strong growth in ERV , up 
11.0 per cent on a like-for-like basis to £58.0 million. The ERV 
target has been revised to £75.0 million by December 2016.
Over the past four years, since Capco was established as an 
independent company , the valuation of Covent Garden has grown 
at an annual like-for-like rate of 12.3 per cent, and ERV has grown 
at 8.9 per cent. 
The arrival of a number of luxury retail and restaurant brands, 
including Dior Beauty and Burberry Beauty Box, alongside Chanel 
Beauty boutique, Ladurée and Balthazar, has made Covent Garden 
the destination of choice in central London for both Londoners 
and visitors. 
“Our strategy is clear and focused. The 
creative place-making strategy at Covent 
Garden has established the estate as a world-
class retail and dining destination. At Earls 
Court, a number of major planning and land 
assembly milestones, including the receipt of 
outline planning consent for the Masterplan, 
have enabled us to drive further momentum 
as we progress this exciting scheme.” Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 9 
The value creation at Covent Garden has progressed 
with the resolutions to grant planning consent for 
the Kings Court and Carriage Hall schemes. This will 
have a major impact on the area, opening up a new 
pedestrian route between Long Acre and King Street, 
and establishing new, high quality retail and restaurant 
space in and around Floral Street.
Earls Court
The receipt of outline planning consent for the Earls 
Court Masterplan is a major success and is the 
culmination of the initial strategy that commenced 
when Capco acquired its ﬁ rst interest at Earls Court 
in 2007 .
The valuation of Capco’s interests at Earls Court, 
represented by Earls Court Properties, has grown 
strongly in the year to £934 million. EC1 & EC2, 
principally the Group’s interests in the Earls Court 
exhibition centres, has beneﬁ ted from the strong 
London residential market and planning consent, 
increasing by 24.0 per cent to £453 million.
Lillie Square continues to progress towards a formal 
sales and marketing launch. The project team has 
focused on creating a high quality product that will be 
competitive in the current marketplace. The intention 
remains to commence construction of the scheme later 
this year.
The remaining interest in the Empress State Building 
was acquired during 2013, giving Capco 100 per cent 
ownership of this major offi  ce building at the heart of 
the Earls Court area. Proposals have been submitted for 
a conversion to residential use.
Venues
The performance of Venues in 2013 reﬂ ects the 
continued uncertainty over the Earls Court venue. 
The Olympia venue was rebranded Olympia London, 
following Capco’s signiﬁ cant investment over the 
past three years to prepare it for the full transition of 
the business to this venue. The team has successfully 
negotiated the transfer of a number of shows to 
Olympia from Earls Court for 2015, including the 
International Book Fair and Top Drawer.
Outlook
Capco remains well positioned to create signiﬁ cant 
further value for shareholders from its value growth 
and value creation strategy at Covent Garden and Earls 
Court. The central London property market remains 
strong, and expectations for the economy are positive, 
although the impact of rising interest rates and the 
withdrawal of central bank liquidity will need to be 
carefully monitored. The capital structure remains 
conservative with suffi  cient levels of liquidity 
maintained to manage the increased activity across 
the Group.
At Covent Garden, the focus will continue to be on 
introducing new retail and restaurant brands across 
the estate, and implementing residential conversions 
where appropriate. The Kings Court and Carriage 
Hall schemes off er the potential to transform the 
north-western area of the estate and drive rental 
values. We will continue to redeﬁ ne global luxury in 
London and cement the district’s status as a thriving 
dining destination.
At Earls Court, the detailed planning applications start 
the process of re-imagining the area and creating a 
new neighbourhood where Kensington, Chelsea and 
Fulham meet. The team at Lillie Square is focusing on 
achieving a successful launch shortly .

Three year measures above are based on annualised returns to 31 December 2013.
A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level (including underlying earnings per share) or speciﬁ cally relevant to each estate, 
for example ERV at Covent Garden and EBITDA at Venues. These are discussed further in the asset-speciﬁ c operating reviews in the Strategic Report.
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Group’s strategy of creating and 
growing value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer-term. Total Property Return, underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual bonuses 
available to certain of the Group’s employees.

Principal risks and uncertainties
EFFECTIVE RISK 
MANAGEMENT
Through risk management and internal control 
systems the Group is able to identify , assess 
and prioritise risk within the business and 
seeks to minimise, control and monitor their 
impact on proﬁ tability whilst maximising the 
opportunities they present
RISK ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Group risk management. It reviews 
principal risks and uncertainties regularly , 
together with the actions taken to 
mitigate them. The Board has delegated 
responsibility for the assurance for 
the risk management process and the 
review of mitigating controls to the 
Audit Committee.
Executive Directors together with Senior 
Management from every division and 
corporate function of the business complete 
a Group risk register. Risks are considered 
in terms of their impact and likelihood 
from both a ﬁ nancial and reputational 
perspective. Risks are assessed both gross 
and net of mitigating controls. Review 
meetings are held to ensure consistency 
of response and adequacy of grading. 
Detailed risk registers are reviewed twice 
yearly and upon any material change in the 
business with a full risk review undertaken 
annually , at which point it is also reviewed 
in detail by the Audit Committee with 
new or emerging risks considered by the 
Committee as appropriate. This allows 
the Audit Committee to monitor the 
most important controls and prioritise 
risk management and internal audit 
activities accordingly .

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
London’s neighbourhood
Covent Garden is one of the most vibrant and dynamic districts 
in London. Attracting 44 million visits a year, the estate mixes a 
unique shopping experience, all day dining, entertainment and 
culture in a historic, pedestrianised setting.
Overview
The Covent Garden estate represents 51 per cent of Capco’s gross 
assets and showcases its value growth strategy which is realised 
through place-making, creative asset management, acquisitions, 
investment and strategic development. In total, Capco owns 64 
buildings comprising 378 lettable units and over 912,000 sq ft 
of lettable space in Covent Garden. 
The value of the estate continues to grow with a capital value of 
£1,156 million, a 19.2 per cent like-for-like uplift year-on-year at 
31 December 2013. ERV was £58.0 million, 11.0 per cent higher on a 
like-for-like basis. In 2013, 49 new lettings and renewals (excluding 
those with non-standard terms such as development breaks) were 
negotiated securing £5.9 million of passing rent, an 11.6 per cent 
increase above the 31 December 2012 ERV level.
Tenant demand remains strong across the estate which is 
operating at near full occupancy at 99 per cent. Gross income 
was £40.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Footfall in Covent Garden continues to be consistently strong 
at 44 million customer visits per year. Londoners now account 
for 56 per cent of the total visitor numbers with 27 per cent 
international and 17 per cent domestic visitors. Of the UK based 
audience, 93 per cent is classiﬁ ed as ABC1, and 52 per cent AB.
Capco works with stakeholders in the community such as 
Westminster City Council and the Covent Garden Area Trust to 
preserve, maintain and celebrate the attributes which make the 
area unique. In addition, Capco embeds Corporate Responsibility 
into its strategy in Covent Garden, spearheading initiatives which 
involve the local community such as the Royal British Legion 
Poppy Event which returned for the second year and saw a day 
of fundraising and activity hosted on the Piazza.
Retail
In 2013 Covent Garden attracted a number of new retailers 
including Dior Beauty , Burberry Beauty Box, Moleskine, Miller 
Harris, Aesop and Aveda. A luxury beauty hub has been created by 
working with luxury brands to introduce new concepts to Covent 
Garden, following on from the success of the Chanel Beauty 
Boutique in 2012. 
The Market Building also saw an inﬂ ux of premium new tenants 
with Godiva, Il Papiro and Penhaligon’s all taking space. 
The contemporary luxury off er on King Street expanded with the 
arrival of Sandro, the signing of Brazilian brand Galeria Melissa and 
a pop up store by luxury footwear designer Sophia Webster. Luxury 
handbag designer Lulu Guinness opened a new concept store on 
Floral Street in August, whilst luxury sportswear brand Y-3 also 
opened on Floral Street in September. Reebok chose Long Acre for 
its new Fit Hub store which opened in September and cult yoga 
brand lululemon athletica is moving its showroom on Floral Street 
to Long Acre to create its ﬁ rst offi  cial store in the UK which is set to 
open in March.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Dining
February 2013 saw the opening of Balthazar, one of the 
most highly anticipated restaurants to open in London. 
Brought over from New York by Keith McNally in 
partnership with Caprice Holdings, the restaurant 
is the only one outside of Manhattan and has been 
a destination for visitors from the UK and abroad. 
Balthazar Bakery also opened alongside the brasserie. 
Following Balthazar’s success, terms were agreed with 
Caprice Holdings for a new ﬂ agship restaurant for One 
South Piazza. The team behind The Ivy , one of the most 
famous and successful restaurants in Covent Garden, 
will develop the unit, which will boast all day dining 
from breakfast until after theatre. The site, formerly 
occupied by Lloyds Bank and Pizza Hut, will anchor 
both The Beecham residences and Henrietta Street.
In July the arrival of Shake Shack, Danny Meyer’s New 
York cult burger concept, transformed the food off ering 
in the south side of the Market Building increasing 
both footfall and overall dwell time. Shake Shack took 
over units previously occupied by The Icecreamists and 
New York Deli to create the ﬁ rst Shake Shack in the UK 
with al fresco dining within the Market Building and 
on the south Piazza. In November, Copenhagen and 
Japanese fusion concept Sticks ‘n’ Sushi opened on 
Henrietta Street in a space formerly occupied 
by Walkabout. 
Residential 
The residential strategy in Covent Garden complements 
the value creation from the ground ﬂ oor retail and 
dining off er, by capturing the opportunity to extract 
further value on the upper parts of buildings through 
residential conversions which bring the area back to its 
17th Century residential roots. 
Following the successful sale of four apartments in 
The Henrietta, the second residential building, The 
Russell, was launched in April. Situated on a corner 
location on the Piazza and close to the Royal Opera 
House, The Russell created a further ﬁ ve luxury 
apartments. Four of the ﬁ ve apartments have been sold, 
setting a price record in the area with an average sales 
price of over £2,400 per sq ft. Conversion work for 
two further residential blocks in The Beecham and 
The Southampton has started and will create a further 
16 apartments which will come to market during 2014. 
In addition to the residential property intended for 
sale, the ﬁ rst premium residential rental product was 
launched in September at 9 King Street and is fully let, 
achieving a record rent in the area of £65 per sq ft. 
Further space that can be converted to residential 
rental property in due course has been identiﬁ ed.

Kings Court and Carriage Hall
In December, resolutions to grant planning consent 
for a new mixed-use development that will transform 
the area between Floral Street and King Street were 
received from Westminster City Council. 
The Kings Court development will enhance the retail 
off ering on Floral Street including a new retail anchor, 
and will create a new passage with retail and restaurant 
space between Long Acre and King Street to improve 
pedestrian movement in the district and open the 
existing courtyard area to the public. 45 high quality 
new residential units will be created on the upper levels 
with views over the courtyard. The development covers 
approximately 84,000 sq ft, of which 20,000 sq ft is new 
space. Work is expected to start on site in Autumn 2014.
The Grade II listed Carriage Hall on Floral Street, 
opposite the Kings Court scheme will also be 
refurbished, creating a large anchor store. Work is 
expected to be carried out at the same time as the 
Kings Court development. 
The total development cost of both schemes is expected 
to be in the order of £85 million.
FUTURE PRIORITIES 
Capco’s strategy in Covent Garden remains on track 
to grow and create value through creative asset 
management, large scale interventions and place-
making. Tenant engineering and the curation of the 
retail and dining mix continue to be the key activities 
in order to grow rental values in line with those of the 
wider prime West End retail areas. This will include 
a targeted increase in the luxury off ering within the 
estate, particularly with the repositioning of the Royal 
Opera House Arcade and Henrietta Street. 
The implementation of the Kings Court and Carriage 
Hall schemes, as well as an active approach to future 
development opportunities and acquisitions within 
and around the boundaries of the existing estate will 
be areas of focus. Kings Court will be the ﬁ rst major 
development to be undertaken by Capco at Covent 
Garden, and the construction of the scheme is being 
carefully planned to ensure its success and to minimise 
the disruption to the wider estate. Other future 
priorities include extending the residential portfolio 
and continuing to improve the Covent Garden 
environment through investing in and improving 
the public realm.
Chanel’s successful beauty pop up

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Earls Court is a unique opportunity for urban 
re-imagination, located where Kensington, Chelsea 
and Fulham meet. 
Earls Court Properties represents Capco’s interests in 
Earls Court, which principally comprise:
• The leasehold interests of the Earls Court Exhibition 
Centres and the freehold of the Northern Access 
Road (“EC1 & EC2”)
• 100 per cent of the Empress State Building 
• 50 per cent interest in the Lillie Square joint venture
The valuation of Earls Court Properties has increased 
signiﬁ cantly during 2013, reﬂ ecting the progress made 
in planning and land assembly . The total valuation 
has increased to £934 million up 24.5 per cent on a 
like-for-like basis. EC1 & EC2 increased to £453 million, 
up 24.0 per cent like-for-like.
In January Capco entered into the Conditional Land 
Sale Agreement (“CLSA”) with the London Borough of 
Hammersmith & Fulham (“LBHF”) to acquire the West 
Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates (the “Estates”). 
This agreement is discussed further below within 
‘Land Assembly’ .

Planning momentum
In November, planning consent was granted for 
the outline Earls Court Masterplan, marking the 
culmination of the planning process that has taken 
several years and has won the support of the Royal 
Borough of Kensington & Chelsea (“RBKC”), LBHF 
and the Mayor of London. It provides approval for a 
10.1 million sq ft residential led, mixed use scheme 
which off ers the opportunity to create a leading address 
in central London.
A detailed planning application for Earls Court Village 
which progresses the design of the scheme beyond the 
outline consent was submitted in December to RBKC 
and LBHF . These proposals off er the opportunity for 
continued value creation for Capco by illustrating the 
quality of the neighbourhood to be created. Garden 
squares, sweeping crescents and the Lost River Park 
will create a new district of London with over 1,300 new 
homes and the ﬁ rst phase of London’s new High Street. 
The local community will beneﬁ t as the development 
is implemented through commitments made in the 
Section 106 agreement. This agreement includes 
improvements to transport and infrastructure, a new 
primary school, health facilities and investment in 
employment and training. 
The judicial review hearing in relation to the 
Supplementary Planning Document was successfully 
defended by the local authorities in October following 
the hearing in July . Capco participated in the hearing as 
an interested party as the challenge was made against 
LBHF and RBKC. This is the third challenge that the 
Councils have successfully defended in relation to the 
Earls Court Masterplan. No application for judicial 
review has been received in relation to the outline 
planning consent. However the risk of further judicial 
review challenges against planning decisions or land 
assembly cannot be discounted. 
Land Assembly
The land assembly process in relation to the Earls Court 
Masterplan is progressing well. In February 2014, the 
Boards of TfL and Capco approved terms for a proposed 
joint venture which would be owned 63 per cent by 
Capco and 37 per cent by TfL to enable the development 
of EC1 & EC2 in line with the Earls Court Masterplan. 
Legal documentation is currently being ﬁ nalised.
TfL owns the freehold to the Earls Court exhibition 
centres and Capco is the leaseholder of both sites. 
The proposed joint venture will establish a joint entity 
which will own new 999 year leases over the sites, as 
well as the Northern Access Road and the air rights 
over the West London Line. The ownership of the 
joint entity reﬂ ects the value created by combining 
both organisations’ respective freehold and leasehold 
interests. No cash consideration will be payable by 
either party . Capco will be the business manager of 
the joint entity , which will enable a comprehensive 
approach to be taken for the implementation of the 
Earls Court Masterplan for the wider Earls Court 
and West Kensington Opportunity Area (“ECOA”). 
Preparation has commenced within Capco to meet the 
operational and governance requirements of this role. 
At this stage, no agreement is in place regarding the 
Lillie Bridge Depot, however TfL has stated it will form 
part of the Earls Court Masterplan if and when it is 
operationally feasible to do so. 
In March an agreement with Network Rail was 
completed regarding the air rights above the West 
London Line. As part of the agreement, Capco has 
secured a new 999 year lease to replace the existing 
lease in respect of the Earls Court 2 site for an initial 
consideration of £5.3 million. Within the terms of the 
agreement, Capco can exercise options for a period of 
50 years for further 999 year leases over the remainder 
of the West London Line to allow for development of 
the Lost River Park within the Earls Court Masterplan. 
Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 
5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be 
payable by Capco at the time development or disposal 
of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan is initiated.

Of the total cash consideration of £105 million, £15 million was 
originally paid for the Exclusivity Agreement and is now held as 
a prepayment against a future draw down of the land; whilst the 
properties acquired in 2013, at the time of signing the CLSA, are 
accounted for as investment properties and accordingly were 
revalued at 31 December 2013. Following exercise of the CLSA in 
November, the Group has become committed to the payment of the 
residual £75 million due under the agreement. The £75 million 
is expected to be paid in ﬁ ve annual instalments of £15 million 
starting on 31 December 2015 which are independent of the land 
draw down process.
Empress State
In August Capco completed the acquisition of the 50 per cent 
of the Empress State Building not already owned for a value 
of £117 million. The 460,000 sq ft offi  ce tower is let to the 
Metropolitan Police Authority which provides a secure income 
stream until 2019.
As part of the wider value creation strategy , a planning application 
was submitted in November to LBHF for a change of use to 
residential in line with the wider Earls Court Masterplan. 
This would create over 300 high quality apartments within the 
structure of the existing 31 storey building.
FUTURE PRIORITIES 
Earls Court presents a unique opportunity to create a new district 
of central London. The focus of activities this year will be to ﬁ nalise 
the land assembly and to bring the Masterplan to life through 
place-making initiatives to create further value.
For Earls Court Village and the Empress State Building, the priority 
is to obtain approval for the detailed applications that were 
submitted in late 2013. 
For North End Village, a process for drawing down the ﬁ rst phase 
of land is being developed in conjunction with LBHF under the 
terms of the CLSA. This is likely to involve the commencement of 
construction of the ﬁ rst phase of replacement social housing, in 
order to commence the process of enabling vacant possession of 
the Estates.
In November Capco exercised its option under the CLSA which it 
entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to LBHF’s land 
within the redevelopment area. The CLSA was approved by the 
Secretary of State for the Department of Communities & Local 
Government in April and comprises approximately 22 acres 
including the West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates. 
The land relating to the Estates is not currently recognised within 
these ﬁ nancial statements as the timing and phasing of the land 
draw down remains subject to a detailed process. No phase can be 
transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the 
relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession is given of 
the phase. With the option exercised and with the outline planning 
consent granted, Capco is working closely with LBHF under the 
detailed mechanisms within the CLSA to identify the requirements 
for the ﬁ rst tranche of replacement homes which would enable 
vacant possession of the ﬁ rst phase of land to be provided.

LILLIE 
SQUARE
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Overview
Lillie Square is a 1 million sq ft scheme and is owned by 
a joint venture between Capco and the Kwok Family 
Interests (“KFI”). The scheme covers over 7 .5 acres and 
will deliver modern garden-square living for future 
residents, in 608 private and 200 aff ordable homes. 
Project Update
The focus of the Lillie Square development in 2013 
has been on ﬁ nalising the design of the scheme and 
construction contracts alongside preparing for the 
sales and marketing launch. Design amendments 
were submitted to LBHF and approved in August. 
These amendments included enhancements to the 
previously consented buildings and an improved 
landscape strategy . 
The changes to the scheme and the enhanced 
speciﬁ cation have increased the expected total build 
cost to £360 million. However, due to the phasing of 
the project, the peak capital requirement is expected 
to be in the order of £130 million (Capco’s share: 
£65 million). Documentation is currently being agreed 
for a new loan facility to fund the construction of Lillie 
Square which will cover this peak capital amount.
Preparations are being made to commence formal 
sales and marketing with a launch planned shortly . 
The current intention is to commence work on site 
later this year.
Capco notes the on-going legal situation in Hong Kong 
regarding charges against certain members of the Kwok 
family , but the operation of the joint venture continues 
to be unaff ected.
• Lillie Square valued at £153 million (Capco’s share) 
up 31 per cent (on a like-for-like basis)
• Enhancements to the original scheme consented 
by LBHF
• Create value through the delivery of a high quality 
residential led scheme with joint venture partner
• Sales launch of ﬁ rst phase
• Construction to commence in 2014

FUTURE PRIORITIES
Adjacent to the wider Earls Court Masterplan, Lillie Square is one 
of the largest development projects in West London and off ers an 
exciting opportunity to re-imagine the area creating values in line 
with established neighbourhoods surrounding the site.
The focus of our activities this year will be a successful sales launch 
and commencement of the ﬁ rst phase of construction of this 
project, which is expected to deliver 237 units in 2015 and 2016. 
The central London residential market is currently positive, 
and the success of the sales launch will in part depend on these 
conditions continuing to prevail.

Venues management team
OLYMPIA 
LONDON
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Overview
The Venues business continues to perform in line with 
expectations. Bookings are lower than in previous years 
reﬂ ecting the continued uncertainty around the future 
of the Earls Court venue. Earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) in 2013 were 
£10.4 million, down 26 per cent from 2012. Much of the 
decrease can be attributed to the one-off  contribution 
in 2012 from the Olympic Games.
The enhanced Olympia London venue remains the 
focus of the future of the Venues business. Several 
exhibitions have now decided to move to Olympia 
London in 2015 including Top Drawer and the 
International Book Fair. This is very positive for 
London’s most historic venue and will enable the 
transition of the business from the Earls Court venue 
to commence next year. Olympia London’s improved 
prospects are reﬂ ected in the 2013 valuation 
performance, up 6.3 per cent to £161 million. At this 
time, the Earls Court venue is taking bookings for 2014.
As part of the on-going investment in improvement 
works to Olympia London a series of planning 
applications were submitted in July which aim to 
re-instate and enhance the entrance to Olympia Grand 
and improve Olympia Way through cycle lanes, 
improved surfaces and signage. Consent was also 
received for a hotel on the G-Gate site.
FUTURE PRIORITIES
The focus for the Venues business is on the successful 
transition of the business to the enhanced Olympia 
London. The decision of the larger shows to move 
to Olympia from the Earls Court venue in 2015 will 
• Successful rebrand of Olympia London
• International Book Fair and Top Drawer conﬁ rmed 
for Olympia London in 2015
• Planning applications for further enhancements to 
Olympia London approved
• Finalise transition plan to reinforce Olympia London 
as the home of the exhibitions business

Financial review
EPRA adjusted, diluted net assets per share rose 22.4 per cent 
during the year, increasing from 203 pence at 31 December 2012 
to 249 pence. This 46 pence increase together with the 1.5 pence 
dividend paid during the year represents a total return of 
23.1 per cent.
The London property market has performed well in 2013, in 
particular the retail and residential sectors to which the Group is 
exposed. There continues to be strong tenant and investor demand 
for well managed properties in prime central London locations.
Both yield compression and ERV growth at Covent Garden 
increased the value of the estate by 18.8 per cent (19.2 per cent 
like-for-like), reﬂ ecting strong letting performance and increased 
residential sales values achieved.
The value of Earls Court Properties, the Group’s interests at Earls 
Court, has increased by 19.8 per cent (24.5 per cent like-for-like), 
as a result of the planning and land assembly milestones achieved 
in respect of the Earls Court Masterplan during the year and the 
strong central London residential sales market. The valuation of 
the Group’s EC1 & EC2 interests by Jones Lang LaSalle, the Group’s 
external valuers, implies a land value of £31.7 million per acre for 
the combined freehold and leasehold interest, based on the terms 
of the proposed arrangement with TfL.
Post year-end, the Group has agreed a new £665 million unsecured 
revolving credit facility for Covent Garden. This new facility will 
replace the three existing secured facilities and increases the 
Group’s available liquidity by over £150 million. It will improve 
operational and ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility to support the strategy for 
the estate.

Control acquired of former joint venture
In May the Group acquired 100 per cent control of The Empress 
State Limited Partnership which owns and manages the Empress 
State Building, a building adjacent to the Group’s property 
interests at Earls Court. The transaction was accounted for as 
a business combination and from the date of exchange the 
partnership has been fully consolidated. Completion occurred 
in August. 
A brief summary of the result this transaction has had on the 
Group’s 31 December 2013 balance sheet is set out below:
Balance sheet £m
Investment property Increased by 132.5
Borrowings Increased by (48.6)
Other net liabilities Increased by (22.6)
Change in net assets 61.3
Conditional Land Sale Agreement (CLSA)
In November the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, which 
it entered into with the London Borough of Hammersmith & 
Fulham (“LBHF”) in January , for the purchase of the West 
Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates.
The overall consideration payable is expected to be £105 million 
cash plus the planning requirement to provide up to 760 
replacement homes.
Of the consideration, £15 million was originally paid for the 
Exclusivity Agreement and is now held as a prepayment against 
a future draw down of the land; whilst the properties acquired 
in 2013, at the time of signing the CLSA, are accounted for 
as investment properties and accordingly were revalued at 
31 December 2013. 
On exercise in November the Group became committed to 
payment of the residual £75 million due under the agreement, 
and is entitled to draw down the land subject to certain conditions 
as discussed in the Earls Court Properties Operating Review. 
This £75 million is expected to be paid in ﬁ ve annual instalments 
of £15 million starting on 31 December 2015 which are independent 
of the land draw down process. The payment proﬁ le could be 
altered due to certain obligations, primarily compensation related 
to achieving vacant possession, which are subject to an overall cap 
of £55 million. Should any payments be made in respect of these 
obligations they will be deducted from the total consideration 
due to LBHF .
The option is value neutral as the underlying asset does not 
currently meet the recognition criteria required for investment 
and development property . The future payments of £75 million 
represent a capital commitment towards the purchase of 
investment and development property that has not yet been 
received. Where any amounts are paid prior to the transfer of 
property , they will be carried on the Group’s balance sheet as 
prepayments against future land draw down. A transfer from 
prepayment to investment and development property will occur 
once the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the Group. 
Once this occurs, in line with the Group’s accounting policy , the 
land will become subject to bi-annual valuation with any uplift 
reﬂ ected in the Group’s reported net asset measure.
Discontinued operations
In June, The Great Capital Partnership (“GCP”), the joint venture 
between the Group and Great Portland Estates plc, announced 
the sale of its ﬁ nal asset, Park Crescent West, which marked the 
culmination of its activities.
As GCP has historically represented a separate major line of 
business, its results and cash ﬂ ows have been reported for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 as having arisen from a discontinued 
operation. The requirement extends to the prior year comparative 
which has been re-presented in line with reporting requirements. 
For the purposes of this ﬁ nancial review, continuing and 
discontinued operations have been combined.
Segmental analysis
With the cessation of GCP and the changes more widely in the 
business over the past year, the Group has revised its segmental 
analysis. As a result of these changes the discontinued activity of 
GCP is now disclosed within ‘Other’. The segment previously called 
Earls Court & Olympia has been split in two: Earls Court Properties 
and Venues. Earls Court Properties represents the Group’s interests 
at Earls Court, predominantly comprising EC1 & EC2, the Empress 
State Building and 50 per cent of the Lillie Square joint venture 
(previously Seagrave Road). Venues comprises the exhibitions 
business including the Olympia London property interests. 
Covent Garden remains unchanged. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 38

Investment, development and trading property
The market value of the Group’s property portfolio increased in 
value by £343.8 million during the year, up 19.9 per cent on a 
like-for-like basis. 
Total property return for the year was 21.9 per cent which compares 
favourably to the IPD Total Return index for the corresponding 
period which recorded a 10.9 per cent return.
Valuation surpluses on properties held for trading are not recorded 
in the income statement and their balance sheet valuation does not 
reﬂ ect market value, but rather the lower of cost and market value. 
Any unrealised surplus is however reﬂ ected within the EPRA 
adjusted, diluted net asset measure.
At 31 December 2013, the unrecognised surplus on trading property 
was £69.2 million, up from £37 .5 million at 31 December 2012. 
This principally arises on property assets at Lillie Square, which has 
been consented for the development of residential units for sale.
Excluding the acquisition of the residual 50 per cent interest 
in the Empress State Building (discussed above), property 
acquisitions in the year totalled £65.3 million, mainly being small 
acquisitions at Earls Court. Property disposals were £64.7 million, 
primarily relating to the sale of the ﬁ nal asset within GCP , Park 
Crescent West.
Debt and gearing
In July , the Group entered into a new ﬁ ve year £118.5 million facility 
to reﬁ nance the debt facility secured on the Empress State Building. 
Excluding the debt assumed on the acquisition of control of 
Empress State, net debt increased by £50.5 million in the year 
principally the result of property acquisitions and capital 
expenditure (£123.1 million) off set by proceeds from the sale of 
residential units at Covent Garden and the ﬁ nal asset within 
GCP (£78.4 million) and further distributions from the Group’s 
investments in China.
Other than the reﬁ nancing of the Empress State facility discussed 
above, other debt repayments in the year were £24.8 million 
which consisted of £20.0 million repayment of funds drawn on 
the revolving credit facilities and £4.8 million of which was paid 
on maturity of GCP’s debt facility in March. 
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan-to-
value (“LTV”). LTV at 31 December 2013 was 15 per cent. The LTV 
remains comfortably within the Group’s current limit of no more 
than 40 per cent.

The new £665 million Covent Garden debt facility was signed in 
February 2014 and has a ﬁ ve year term. The margin for the loan 
is 1.65 per cent. It is an unsecured revolving credit facility which 
will provide improved operational and ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility for 
the estate. The Group’s available liquidity will increase by over 
£150 million.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 39 
Completion of the facility is expected in March 2014 when the 
existing Covent Garden facilities will be repaid. The Group will 
incur an exceptional charge of approximately £12 million relating 
to fees on the new facility and unamortised fees on the existing 
facilities; as well as approximately £18 million relating to the 
termination of derivative contracts.
The Group’s policy is to substantially eliminate the short and 
medium-term risk arising from interest rate volatility . The Group’s 
banking facilities are arranged on a ﬂ oating-rate basis, but swapped 
to ﬁ xed-rate or capped using derivative contracts coterminous 
with the relevant debt facility . At 31 December 2013 the proportion 
of gross debt with interest rate protection was 100 per cent (2012: 
100 per cent).
The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants. 
The Group has capital commitments of £105.9 million at 
31 December 2013 which compares to £21.4 million at 
31 December 2012. The increase principally relates to the 
CLSA as discussed above.

Typically the main cash ﬂ ow items are operating cash ﬂ ows, 
dividends paid and capital transactions undertaken. 
Recurring cash ﬂ ow was £8.0 million compared to £4.8 million for 
2012, mainly due to the lower ﬁ nancing costs.
Investing activities comprise acquisitions (£70.7 million), capital 
expenditure (£59.7 million) and payments made to acquire full 
control of the former Empress State joint venture (£50.3 million), 
off set in part by proceeds received from the disposal of property and 
investments (£81.6 million). 
Property acquisition and development expenditure was mainly in 
respect of Earls Court Properties. Proceeds from the sale of property 
and investments comprise the disposal of the last remaining asset 
within GCP , the sale of residential units at Covent Garden and a 
further distribution from the Group’s investments in China.
Financing cash ﬂ ows relate to the repayment on maturity of the 
GCP facility in March, together with the reﬁ nancing and scheduled 
amortisation payments on the Empress State facility .
Dividends paid of £6.9 million reﬂ ect the ﬁ nal dividend payment 
made in respect of the 2012 ﬁ nancial year and the 2013 interim 
dividend paid in September. This was lower than the previous year 
due to the scrip dividend alternative, the take up of which was 
signiﬁ cantly higher at 48 per cent and 21 per cent respectively .
Cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2013 were 
£287 million. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 40

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group has presented an underlying calculation of proﬁ t 
after tax and adjusted earnings per share ﬁ gures in addition to 
the amounts reported under IFRS. The Directors consider this 
presentation to provide useful information on the underlying 
performance of the business as it removes exceptional and other 
one-off  items.

Underlying proﬁ t after tax 7.3 12.5
Underlying earnings per share 
(pence) 1.0 1.8
Income
Net rental income fell by £0.5 million (6.0 per cent like-for-like) 
in the year. The sale of properties within GCP and the weaker 
performance of the Venues business, both of which are in line with 
expectations, reduced net rental income by £9.2 million. This has 
been off set by increased income at Covent Garden and income 
arising from Earls Court Properties which includes the Empress 
State Building and a number of small income producing assets. 
The acquisition of control of Empress State in May has contributed 
£4.4 million to the net rental income for the year. Net rental income 
for Covent Garden in 2014 is likely to be a similar level to 2013 due 
to the number of initiatives being pursued to grow the value of the 
estate but which reduce income in the short-term.
Other income of £10.6 million principally relates to trading 
property proﬁ ts of £10.4 million which arose on the sale of 
residential units at Covent Garden.
Gain on revaluation and sale of investment property
The gain on revaluation of the Group’s investment and 
development property was £310.6 million. Proﬁ ts recorded on the 
sale of investment and development property were £2.8 million, 
the result of the sale of the last GCP asset, Park Crescent West. 
Administration expenses
Administration expenses increased 30 per cent to £33.8 million. 
The majority of the increase is attributable to a higher than 
anticipated charge of £8.3 million relating to costs associated with 
the Group’s equity based compensation schemes, which are linked 
in part to share price performance. This level of administration 
expense is now indicative of normalised operating costs. Any 
further increases will be in line with headcount as the Group’s 
activities expand.
Net ﬁ nance costs
Excluding gains arising from the change in fair value and 
one-off  costs incurred on the termination of derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments, the Group’s underlying net ﬁ nance costs for the year 
fell to £20.9 million from £22.8 million in 2012, the result of 
various debt prepayments and repayments during 2012, together 
with the beneﬁ t of reﬁ nancing in a historically low interest 
rate environment. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 41 
Exceptional items
In addition to revaluation and sale of investment and development 
property and fair value movements on derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments, exceptional items which have been removed from 
the calculation of underlying proﬁ t include:
 – Other income of £10.6 million of which proﬁ t on sale of 
trading property represented £10.4 million
 – Write back of impairment charges in respect to loan notes 
receivable of £2.0 million
 – Trading property write down of £1.7 million
 – Other exceptional items totalling £0.3 million
Taxation
The total tax charge for the year was £12.6 million which is made up 
of both underlying tax and exceptional tax. 
Underlying tax, the amount of tax charged on the underlying 
proﬁ ts of the Group was £2.3 million, reﬂ ecting an underlying tax 
rate of 23.3 per cent in line with the current rate of UK corporation 
tax. The UK corporation tax rate is expected to fall to 21 per cent 
from April 2014 and again to 20 per cent from April 2015. 
The exceptional tax of £10.3 million arises predominantly on 
disposals of trading properties and gains on the change in fair value 
of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments.
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable 
on a theoretical disposal of all investment properties held by the 
Group remains £nil. The contingent tax position is arrived at after 
allowing for indexation relief and Group loss relief. A disposal 
of the Group’s trading properties at their market values as per 
Note 15 would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 
£16.1 million (23.3 per cent of £69.2 million). 
The Group’s tax policy , which has been approved by the Board and 
has been disclosed to HM Revenue & Customs, is aligned with the 
business strategy . The Group seeks to protect shareholder value 
by structuring operations in a tax effi  cient manner, with external 
advice as appropriate, which complies with all relevant tax law and 
regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as a 
responsible taxpayer. As a Group, we are committed to acting in 
an open and transparent manner. 
Consistent with the Group’s policy of complying with relevant tax 
obligations and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the Group 
maintains a constructive and open working relationship with 
HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining 
advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment 
may be uncertain.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be 
paid on 19 June 2014 to shareholders on the register at 23 May 2014. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to off er a scrip 
dividend alternative.
Going Concern
At 31 December 2013 the Group’s cash and undrawn committed 
facilities were £287 million. The agreement to reﬁ nance the 
Group’s Covent Garden facilities in February 2014 has expanded the 
Group’s committed undrawn facilities by a further £150 million. 
With weighted average debt maturity exceeding 4 years, LTV of 
15 per cent and suffi  cient headroom against all ﬁ nancial covenants, 
there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and Group will have adequate resources to meet both ongoing and 
future commitments for the foreseeable future. Accordingly , the 
Directors have prepared the 2013 Annual Report & Accounts on a 
going concern basis.

Corporate responsibility
From the Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee
Corporate responsibility (“CR”) is the way in which 
Capco manages its environmental impacts and 
engages with the communities where our assets are 
based. Our established corporate responsibility 
programme supports the delivery of the Company’s 
strategy and the creation of value for shareholders.
The Board believes that being a responsible neighbour 
is of beneﬁ t to both the community and the Company , 
and accordingly we encourage our staff  to participate 
fully in our corporate responsibility initiatives. In 
2013 each head offi  ce employee was given a corporate 
responsibility objective during the annual review 
process and Capco staff  spent 515 hours on CR related 
activities, a marked increase on the previous year.
In 2013 the Committee was particularly pleased 
with the success of the Leadership Development 
Programme which aimed to develop the leadership 
capability of participants. 
Our 2013 CR report outlines the progress made 
against the 2012 targets, and sets out new targets for 
2014. This year we have also reported our Greenhouse 
Gas emissions to comply with new environmental 
reporting requirements.
Our approach to CR continues to evolve, and will 
be kept under review by the Committee as the 
Company continues to implement its strategy . 
We welcome feedback from our stakeholders on 
environmental and community issues.

 Some progress

   Good progress
A highlight of our 2013 community strategy was the ‘Take 
Three’ project which used digital media to engage children in 
community safety issues. 70 pupils from local schools in Covent 
Garden and Fulham took part. The pupils worked in groups of 
ﬁ ve or six, with the support of adult mentors from Capco, to 
create a digital book or ﬁ lm on a personal safety , anti-social 
behaviour or crime issue important to them. Media professionals 
worked with the pupils to teach them more about ﬁ lmmaking 
and to help them create their digital book or ﬁ lm.
The work culminated in a showcase event where the 13 groups 
presented their digital books or ﬁ lms to a panel of judges and 
an audience of 250 people. There was ‘live judging’ of each 
project and all the children who took part received a medal for 
their achievements.

Continue to monitor our 
carbon footprint.
  
Capco’s carbon footprint for 2012 was measured 
by Environ to be approximately 14,000 tonnes 
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2
e) compared with 
approximately 15,000 tonnes CO
2
e in 2011. The largest 
element of this came from Earls Court, which made up 
57 per cent of the total footprint; Olympia London 
contributed 32 per cent, Covent Garden 9 per cent and 
Head Offi  ce 1.5 per cent.

People
The number of people employed across the Group at the year end 
totalled 300 of which 214 were based in the Venues business.
We continue to attract talented individuals to the Company and 
have made signiﬁ cant hires at all levels. Typically , we accelerate 
career development for individuals by giving them signiﬁ cant 
responsibility early in their careers. Our fast-moving business 
requires high performance at all levels and we set clear objectives 
during a review process which measures performance in key 
skills and ensures that individual goals are clearly linked to 
Company strategy .
We have an induction programme which enables people to 
integrate quickly and clear performance objectives are deﬁ ned 
at the outset for every employee.
An internal Leadership Development Programme for our senior 
management team ran throughout the year and concluded in 
November. The aim of the programme was to develop the 
leadership capability of the participants through a combination 
of interactive simulation sessions and practical skills workshops. 
Each delegate received mentoring from a Board member and 
developed a personal development plan following participation 
in a 360 feedback process. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 49 
We further support our people in their 
professional development through 
academic study and currently have six 
employees working towards professional 
qualiﬁ cations. 
We believe that high performance should 
be recognised and therefore bonus awards 
are linked to ratings received during the 
performance review process. Furthermore, 
as part of our remuneration strategy 
employees participate in our share schemes 
and this ensures that individual reward is 
aligned to business strategy . We value the 
well-being of our workforce and aim to 
encourage healthy and balanced lifestyles. 
Diversity is important to us and we 
recognise the beneﬁ ts of employing 
people with varied perspectives. The ratio 
of women to men within our senior 
management team is 3:2. Information on 
our approach to Board diversity can be 
found in the Nomination Committee report 
on page 61.
Aware of the challenges that young people 
are facing entering the job market, we aim 
to provide work experience placements 
across the business.
We recognise the importance of developing 
our talent pool at graduate level and in 2013 
we ran a summer intern programme for 
undergraduates and attended a number of 
recruitment fairs to launch our graduate 
programme. As a consequence, we hired 
two graduates in 2013 and a further three 
will join in 2014.
This report does not contain speciﬁ c 
information on human rights issues as 
this is not considered necessary for an 
understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the Company’s 
business. However, Capco has adopted 
a CR policy and a supply chain policy 
which reﬂ ect a responsible approach to 
human rights.

ENGENDERING TRUST
Ian Durant, Chairman
The Board is responsible for the success of the 
Company , providing strategic leadership, monitoring 
delivery of its objectives and managing its risk. 
The Company’s framework of oversight, controls 
and reporting supports the business and allows the 
Company to operate internally with an appropriate 
level of openness, with both formality and ﬂ exibility. 
Externally the Company has endeavoured to 
communicate its expectations, objectives and 
milestones for success clearly; all key ingredients to 
engendering conﬁ dence in ongoing creation and 
growth of value for our owners.
We were pleased to welcome Anne Byrne as General 
Counsel during the year. Although not a Director, 
Anne is invited to attend all Board meetings. 
During the year we have worked to plan succession 
for Non-executive Directors who will be retiring from 
the Board in coming years. Maintaining the culture 
of openness and debate with constructive relations 
between Executive and Non-executive Directors is a 
key objective and I am grateful to Board members and 
senior management for their commitment to this.
As I reported last year, an updated UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which applies to Capco for the ﬁ rst 
time this year, was introduced in 2012 and a number 
of changes have been made to narrative reporting 
and remuneration disclosures. We adopted many 
of the new disclosures in our 2012 Annual Report 
and we have continued this progress in this year’s 
Annual Report.
The Remuneration Committee has continued its 
review of Executive Director remuneration to ensure 
that the arrangements are fully aligned with the 
interests of shareholders and continue to motivate a 
highly successful team. The Remuneration Report 
includes single ﬁ gures for the remuneration paid to 
each Director in 2013, as well as a number of other 
disclosures for which the disclosure requirements 
had not been ﬁ nalised at the time of the 2012 
Annual Report.
The Audit Committee has been active in monitoring 
the Company’s internal controls, key accounting 
and reporting matters, especially in areas requiring 
judgement. It has also given due attention to 
ensuring that the external and internal audits are 
conducted as eff ectively as possible. Its 2013 report 
has been reviewed and extended to include fuller 
descriptions of the work undertaken by the 
Committee during the year, and explain how 
signiﬁ cant issues were considered.
The governance of the Company is designed to create 
and maintain an environment in which management 
can realise their potential and optimise the long-term 
value of the business and its assets, responsibly . The 
following pages explain how Capco’s Board and its 
Committees work to support these objectives.
Ian Durant
Chairman
25 February 2014
“ Capco’ s governance supports 
management as they optimise the 
long-term value of the business and 
its assets.”

Corporate Governance Code during 2013 www.capitalandcounties.com 53

STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Company was fully compliant with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code during 2013.
Board composition
As at 31 December 2013 the Board comprised the 
Chairman, three Executive Directors and six Non-
executive Directors. The table below summarises the 
membership of the Board and Committees. In addition, 
biographies of all the Directors including information 
on their skills and experience can be found on
pages 50 and 51.
Board independence
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires that, 
excluding the Chairman, at least half the Board 
should comprise Non-executive Directors determined 
to be independent.
The Board has considered the independence of the 
Non-executive Directors, and the table below sets 
out those Directors considered to be independent 
in character and judgement. Each of these Directors 
has also conﬁ rmed that there is no reason why they 
should not continue to be considered independent. 
In considering Director independence, the Board 
concluded that Directors’ tenure should be counted 
from the date of their ﬁ rst election by shareholders to 
the Capco Board.

AN EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP 
STRUCTURE
The Board is collectively responsible for 
the long-term success of the Company , 
and for its leadership, strategy , control 
and management.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are distinct and formally 
documented, with the Chairman being 
responsible for the leadership of the Board, 
ensuring its eff ectiveness and setting its 
agenda, and the Chief Executive for 
developing the Company’s strategic 
direction, implementing policies and 
strategies decided by the Board and 
managing the business.
Day-to-day management of the Group is 
delegated to the Executive Directors, 
subject to formal delegated authority 
limits, however certain matters have been 
reserved for consideration by the Board. 
These matters are reviewed annually 
and include: Board and Committee 
composition, Company strategy , 
signiﬁ cant funding decisions and 
corporate transactions, delegated 
authority limits and dividend policy .
Through the Chairman, the Company 
Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board on matters of corporate governance, 
and ensures good information ﬂ ows 
within the Board and its Committees and 
between senior management and Non-
executive Directors. The General Counsel 
attends Board meetings and meetings of 
the Audit Committee.
The Board meets formally throughout the 
year with main meetings timed around the 
ﬁ nancial calendar, and additional meetings 
convened to consider speciﬁ c matters as 
required. Attendance at Board and Board 
Committee meetings held during 2013 is 
shown in the table on page 56. If matters 
require approval at short notice, written 
approval is sought from the Directors. 
Board papers are typically circulated a 
week in advance of meetings to ensure 
that Directors have suffi  cient time to 
consider their content prior to the meeting. 
The Chairman also meets regularly with 
the Non-executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present.
It is in the nature of the Company’s business 
that matters requiring the Board’s decision 
are often large, complex and slow moving. 
To assist the Board, informal update 
meetings are held between Board meetings 
which are designed to allow Board members 
adequate time and preparation to explore, 
understand and challenge decisions in 
preparation. These are sometimes 
combined with site visits and provide 
an opportunity for the Non-executive 
Directors to meet senior management. 
Four such updates were held during 2013.
ENSURING AN EFFECTIVE 
BOARD
Board performance and evaluation
Recognising that Capco’s Board must be 
eff ective, the Board conducts an annual 
evaluation of its own performance and that 
of its Committees and Directors. In 2013 the

Communications with shareholders
Communication with the Company’s investors is a priority for 
the Board. The Company has an extensive investor relations 
programme, and the Chief Executive and Finance Director hold 
meetings with institutional shareholders throughout the year, 
including results presentations, webcasts, road shows, one-to-one 
meetings and investor tours.
The Company’s major shareholders are encouraged to meet with 
the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director to discuss any 
matters they may wish to raise. During 2013 the Chairman and 
Company Secretary met with several of the Company’s South 
African shareholders and the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee discussed proposed amendments to the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration with Capco’s major shareholders.
The Directors receive regular updates on the Company’s major 
shareholders, and receive reports on shareholder feedback at each 
Board meeting. The Non-executive Directors are invited to attend 
the Company’s results presentations. Private shareholders may 
raise questions through the Company Secretary’s offi  ce either by 
telephone or by email (feedback@capitalandcounties.com).
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Chairman’s other business commitments are set out in his 
biography on page 51.
During the year the Chairman was appointed as Non-executive 
Chairman of Greggs plc. The Board remains satisﬁ ed that this 
additional commitment has not interfered with the performance 
of his duties as Chairman of Capco.
The Deputy Chairman is a Director of the Board of Capco’s joint 
venture in respect of the Lillie Square development. He receives 
no remuneration for this appointment. The Board considered 
this appointment carefully before conﬁ rming its approval and 
is satisﬁ ed that there is no conﬂ ict of interest and that the 
appointment does not compromise his independence.
On appointment, and each subsequent year, Non-executive 
Directors are required to conﬁ rm in writing that they have 
suffi  cient time to devote to the Company’s aff airs. In addition 
they are required to seek prior approval from the Chairman 
before taking on any additional external commitments which 
may aff ect their time available to devote to the Company .
The Board remains satisﬁ ed that all Non-executive Directors are 
contributing eff ectively to the operation of the Board.
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
authorise potential conﬂ icts of a Director’s interests that may arise. 
The Board has adopted a procedure under which Directors must 
notify the Chairman of any potential conﬂ icts. The Chairman then 
decides whether a conﬂ ict exists and recommends its authorisation 
by the Board where appropriate. A Director who had a conﬂ ict of 
interest would not be counted in the quorum or entitled to vote 
when the Board considered the matter in which the Director had 
an interest.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration, Nomination 
and Corporate Responsibility Committees. The terms of reference 
of each Committee are available on the Company’s website 
www.capitalandcounties.com. The activity of each Committee 
is described on pages 57 to 81.

The disclosures required under DTR 7 .2 of the Disclosure and

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Henry Staunton, Chairman of the 
Audit Committee
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2013 Audit Committee Report which 
explains the Committee’s role in monitoring all aspects of ﬁ nancial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management, and provides an overview 
of the work undertaken by the Committee over the past year.
During 2013 the Committee considered a number of topics, the most 
signiﬁ cant of which are described below. A description of this work, and 
information about the other signiﬁ cant issues that the Committee 
considered during the year can be found on page 58.
Henry Staunton
Chairman of the Audit Committee, 25 February 2014
Members:
Henry Staunton (Chairman)
Ian Henderson
Andrew Strang
The Audit Committee, reporting to the Board, 
oversees the ﬁ nancial reporting process, monitors the 
eff ectiveness of internal control, internal audit, risk 
management, and the statutory audit and monitors 
the independence of the statutory auditors and the 
provision of non-audit services. As at 31 December 2013 
and the date of this report the Committee comprises 
three independent Non-executive Directors, and is 
chaired by Henry Staunton who is considered to have 
signiﬁ cant, recent and relevant ﬁ nancial experience.
The Committee’s meetings were also attended by 
the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance 
Director, General Counsel, Company Secretary 
and Financial Controller together with senior 
representatives of the external and internal auditors. 
The valuers and members of senior management, 
including the Head of Tax, attended by invitation 
to present reports required for the Committee to 
discharge its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee met three times during 2013. 
Attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on 
page 56. The Committee also met privately during the 
year with both the external and internal auditors.
The Committee follows an annual programme that 
ensures it gives thorough consideration to matters 
of particular importance to the Company , and 
additional matters are considered when appropriate. 
The Company’s 2013 agenda is shown in the table 
below, and the signiﬁ cant matters considered by the 
Committee during the year are explained on page 58.

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE DURING 2013
Matter considered What the Committee did
Valuations The independent external valuers presented the half-year and year-end valuations to the 
Committee. The Committee reviewed the methodology and component parts of the 
valuations, discussed the valuations with the external auditors and challenged the valuers on 
the assumptions used which included how land assembly transactions with Network Rail 
and Transport for London should be reﬂ ected. The Committee also advised the Board on the 
independence of the valuers and obtained conﬁ rmation that management had provided all 
requested information. The Committee was satisﬁ ed that the approach taken by the valuers 
was appropriate. Please refer to note 18 on pages 106 to 108 in the notes to the accounts.
Deferred tax The Group Head of Tax presented regular reports to the Committee, explained the basis 
of the Group’s tax position and updated the Committee on the ongoing relationship with 
HMRC. The Committee challenged the assumptions made in arriving at the tax position 
and discussed with the external auditor the assumptions and judgements made in arriving 
at the deferred tax position including appropriations from investment to trading property . 
The Committee was satisﬁ ed that the policy was appropriate for the Group. Please refer to 
note 14 on page 103 in the notes to the accounts.
Signiﬁ cant 
and complex 
transactions
The Committee received updates from the Group Financial Controller on signiﬁ cant and 
complex transactions, including the CLSA, the acquisition of the residual ﬁ fty per cent 
interest in The Empress State Building and the Network Rail lease re-gear. The Committee 
discussed the accounting treatments of each transaction with management and the external 
auditors and is satisﬁ ed that the appropriate approach has been taken. Further information 
in respect of the CLSA is available within the Financial Review.
Risk The Committee reviewed the Group’s risk register, the approach taken in its compilation 
and the proposed principal risk disclosures as explained on page 12 and ensured that they 
were consistent and appropriate. The Committee also monitored changes to the regulatory 
environment, including the introduction of the Strategic Report and the requirement for the 
Board to state that the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, 
to ensure that the Company’s reporting remained appropriate and compliant.
External and internal auditors
(a) External auditors
The Committee oversees the relationship with the 
external auditors, and is responsible for developing, 
implementing and monitoring the Company’s policy 
on external audit, and for monitoring the auditors’ 
independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical, 
professional and regulatory requirements. 
Capco tendered its external audit contract in 2010, and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) were appointed 
as Group auditors on an annual rolling contract. 
The Committee monitored PwC’s eff ectiveness and 
performance during 2013, and considered a paper 
prepared by the Financial Controller which conﬁ rmed 
that in management’s view PwC were providing a 
high quality audit service and continued to deliver 
against all facilities considered at their appointment. 
The Committee is satisﬁ ed that the Group is receiving 
a robust and challenging objective audit and has 
therefore recommended to the Board that PwC be 
reappointed in 2014. It is expected that, in compliance 
with the requirement that the audit partner responsible 
for the Group and subsidiary audits is rotated every ﬁ ve 
years, a new audit partner will be assigned to the Group 
by PwC in 2014.
(b) Internal auditors
Capco has appointed BDO LLP as its internal auditor. 
During 2013 BDO’s audit plan had a strategic focus 
and included reviews of contract management of 
outsourced providers, project management, HR, IT 
security , anti-bribery and corruption policies, bank 
mandates, expenses and credit control. The 2014 
internal audit programme will include property 
valuations, service charges, disaster recovery and 
business continuity , environmental impact 
management and IT strategic planning. The Committee 
is satisﬁ ed that the internal auditor was independent 
and its services eff ective.
(c) Non-audit services
The Company has adopted a policy to ensure that the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors 
does not compromise its independence or objectivity . 
The policy requires prior approval by the Audit 
Committee Chairman for non-audit work with a cost 
exceeding the lower of £50,000 or 15 per cent of the 
estimated annual level of the auditors’ fees at that time. 
Approval is only given following a full and thorough 
assessment of the value case for using the auditor and 
the skills and experience the auditor would bring. 
Additionally , consideration must be given to the 
preservation of auditor independence; and the external 
auditors are required to conﬁ rm that they are acting 
independently and must not audit their own work; 
make management decisions for the Company; create 
Audit committee report continued www.capitalandcounties.com 59 
Governance Financial statements Strategic report
a mutuality of interest; develop close personal 
relationships with the Company’s personnel; or ﬁ nd 
themselves in the role of advocate for the Company . The 
Committee is satisﬁ ed that the policy remains eff ective.
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2013 were 
£377 ,000, of which £11,000 related to non-audit work. 
These fees primarily relate to corporate transactions 
and a staff  presentation in respect of the Bribery Act 
2010. The Committee is satisﬁ ed that the external 
auditors remain independent and objective.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
risk management framework and system of internal 
control and the ongoing review of their eff ectiveness. 
A summary of the risk management framework is set 
out on page 12. The framework is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risk, and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Audit Committee 
monitors and reviews the Group’s internal controls 
and risk, and reports to the Board on its work 
and conclusions.
The Company has established processes to identify , 
evaluate and manage the signiﬁ cant risks faced by 
the Group. These controls accord with the Turnbull 
guidance ‘Internal Control – Guidance for Directors 
on the Combined Code’ and remained in place up to 
the date of the approval of this Annual Report. 
The procedures are reviewed by the Board on an 
annual basis.
The key elements of the Group’s day-to-day procedures 
and internal control framework are:
 – Schedule of matters reserved for the Board
 – Delegated authority limits
 – Documentation of signiﬁ cant transactions
 – The Executive Directors are closely involved in the 
day-to-day operations of the business and hold 
regular meetings with senior management to 
review all aspects of the business, including risks 
and controls
 – The Board receives regular updates on strategy 
and project developments at Board meetings and 
Board updates
 – A whistleblowing procedure under which staff  may 
raise matters of concern is in place. No calls were 
received during the year.
The Committee conducts an annual review of the 
eff ectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
considers reports provided by the Financial Controller, 
external auditor and internal auditor. The Committee 
is satisﬁ ed that the Group’s internal controls are 
operating eff ectively.
Speciﬁ c controls relating to ﬁ nancial reporting and 
consolidation processes include:
 – Management structure staff ed by appropriate 
personnel, with clear lines of responsibility 
and accountability
 – A comprehensive budgeting and review system. 
The Board and Audit Committee receive regular 
reports from the Finance Director which include 
forecasts and performance against budget and 
ﬁ nancial covenants
 – The internal audit programme undertaken by BDO 
 – Led by the Chief Executive, the Group ﬁ nance team 
participates in the control self-assessment and policy 
compliance elements of the risk management 
framework and sets formal requirements with 
business unit ﬁ nance functions which specify the 
reports and approvals required. BDO regularly 
reviews the eff ectiveness of internal controls and 
report its ﬁ ndings to the Audit Committee. 
 – An annual risk management process is followed 
to identify risks and review the eff ectiveness of 
mitigating controls. Risk registers are completed 
by senior management across the Group and 
reviewed by the Chief Executive and other Executive 
Directors. The Group risk register is then compiled 
and is reviewed twice a year and upon any material 
change to the business, with a full review being 
undertaken annually , at which point it is also 
reviewed by the Audit Committee with new or 
emerging risks considered by the Committee as 
appropriate. The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties are set out on pages 12 to 15. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 60

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Diversity
Diversity is important to Capco across the 
Group and we recognise the business 
beneﬁ ts of employing people with varied 
outlooks. We are keen to develop female 
talent and the ratio of women to men 
within our senior management team is 3:2. 
Further information on our people 
practices, including our learning and 
development strategies, is contained in 
the Corporate Responsibility Report on 
pages 48 and 49.
At present Capco has one female Director. 
The Board does not feel that it is 
appropriate to set targets on gender 
diversity as all appointments must be 
made on merit; however, gender and wider 
diversity will continue to be taken into 
consideration when evaluating the skills, 
knowledge and experience desirable to ﬁ ll 
each Board vacancy .
Board composition and succession
During the year the Nomination 
Committee has reviewed the skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge 
of Board members in the context of the 
changing nature of Capco’s business. 
This will be reﬂ ected in the Committee’s 
recommendations to the Board on 
future appointments.
Matters considered by the 
Committee during the year 
include:
 – CR reporting
 – The Company’s CR strategy
 – Updates on Group CR activity
 – Charitable donations and spend 
against budget
 – Brieﬁ ng on energy performance

Directors’ remuneration report
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
Ian Henderson, Chairman of Remuneration 
Committee
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders
This report covers the work of the Remuneration 
Committee in the past year. The key objective for the 
Committee, as in previous years, is to ensure that the 
executive team are appropriately incentivised, and 
that the remuneration arrangements are fully aligned 
with the Company’s strategy to provide long-term 
market-leading returns to shareholders. 
Management incentives are linked to the KPIs which 
the Company uses to create and grow value for 
shareholders. These KPIs are set out on page 11. 
In 2013 Capco signiﬁ cantly exceeded each of its KPI 
performance targets, delivering total shareholder 
return of 36.6 per cent, total property return of 
21.9 per cent and total return of 23.1 per cent. 
The remuneration of the Executive Directors 
reﬂ ects this performance.
There has been much public comment about the new 
remuneration reporting regulations introduced by 
BIS, and this report follows these requirements. 
The single ﬁ gures of remuneration set out on page 71 
reﬂ ect the strong alignment of Capco’s remuneration 
policy with shareholders’ interests; the signiﬁ cant 
impact on Directors’ remuneration of the share 
price growth that has beneﬁ ted all shareholders is 
illustrated on page 77 .
The remuneration policy in the policy report, which 
we wish to apply from our 2014 AGM, will be subject 
to a binding vote at the 2014 AGM. The annual 
report on remuneration, which explains how the 
Remuneration Committee has implemented the 
remuneration policy over the last year and how it 
intends to implement the remuneration policy this 
year, the second year of a three-year cycle, will also be 
put to a shareholder vote.
The Executive Directors have led a transformation 
of Capco since its establishment in 2010. This year, 
in recognition of the Company’s transition and the 
achievement of numerous milestones required to 
bring about this transformation, including the 
securing of planning consent for the Earls Court 
Masterplan, the ﬁ nalisation and exercise of the CLSA, 
the continued letting success at Covent Garden and 
the securing of a resolution to grant planning consent 
for the Kings Court and Carriage Hall proposals, the 
Committee has exercised an existing discretion to 
award a 2:1 match on the deferred element of the 
Executive Directors’ 2013 annual bonuses. This 
additional award is subject to more stretching 
performance conditions which are set out on page 75, 
and to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
I reported last year that the Committee felt that the 
salary of the Chief Executive remained below the level 
that reﬂ ected the Company’s performance. At present, 
the Chief Executive’s salary is some 12 per cent below 
the median for FTSE350 property companies, taking 
into account Capco’s relative market capitalisation. 
Accordingly , following both further excellent 
performance and corporate growth, which brings an 
inherent increase in responsibility , the Committee 
has awarded a 6 per cent salary increase to the Chief 
Executive in 2014. The Committee is minded to keep 
the Chief Executive’s salary under review in 2014 and, 
if appropriate, consider a similar level of increase in 
2015, depending on circumstances at that time.
The Committee believes that its remuneration policy 
has been successful in incentivising management to 
deliver value for shareholders, and therefore hopes to 
receive your support at our AGM.

The information in this report subject to audit 
comprises the single ﬁ gure of remuneration and 
associated detail, the incentive achievement for 2013, 
the incentives to be awarded in 2014 and the details 
of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests.
1. POLICY REPORT
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report sets out Capco’s future 
remuneration policy . Details of actual 
remuneration paid, share awards made, 
and the associated performance conditions 
are set out within the annual report on 
remuneration which starts on page 70.
1.1 Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s 
remuneration policy are to:
• Strongly align executive and 
shareholder interests
• Underpin an eff ective pay-for-
performance culture
• Support the retention, motivation and 
recruitment of talented people who are 
commercially astute
• Encourage executives to acquire 
and retain signiﬁ cant holdings of 
Capco shares
The Committee aims to achieve an 
appropriate balance between ﬁ xed and 
variable remuneration, and between 
variable remuneration based on short-term 
and longer-term performance. Fixed 
remuneration includes base salary , beneﬁ ts 
and pension. Variable remuneration 
includes an annual bonus, half of which 
is deferred in shares and may be matched 
via the Matching Share Plan (MSP), 
co-investment under the MSP and awards 
under the Performance Share Plan (PSP).
The remuneration policy is aligned to the 
strategy and nature of the Company , and 
reﬂ ects the importance of total return and 
the long-term nature of Capco’s business, 
rewarding the Executive Directors for 
delivering strong performance against 
the Company’s Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs).
The Remuneration Committee is not 
proposing any material amendments to the 
Company’s existing remuneration policy .
Details of each element of remuneration, 
their operation, purpose, link to strategy 
and performance metrics are set out in 
this section. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 64 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
1.2 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR POLICY TABLE
The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors:
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Base Salary
To provide an appropriately 
competitive base salary , whilst placing 
emphasis on the performance related 
elements of remuneration.
The Committee believes base salary 
for high-performing experienced 
Executive Directors should be at 
least median. 
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase taking eff ect from 1 April.
The Committee reviews base salaries with reference to:
• other property companies (including the constituents of the long-term incentive plans’ comparator group)
• UK companies of a similar size
• each Executive Director’s performance and contribution during the year
• scope of each Executive Director’s responsibilities
• changes to the remuneration and overall conditions of other employees
When reviewing base salaries, the Committee is mindful of the gearing eff ect that increases in base salary will 
have on the potential total remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Beneﬁ ts
To be appropriately competitive with 
those off ered at comparator companies.
Beneﬁ ts will be in line with those off ered to some or all employees and may include private dental and 
healthcare, life insurance, personal accident cover, travel insurance, income protection and a car allowance, 
currently paid in cash.
Other beneﬁ ts may be introduced from time to time to ensure the beneﬁ ts package is appropriately competitive 
and reﬂ ects individual circumstances. For example, Directors may be off ered relocation and/or expatriate 
beneﬁ ts should a Director be required to relocate as a result of emerging business requirements.
Pension
To be appropriately competitive with 
that off ered by comparator companies.
Capco off ers a deﬁ ned contribution pension scheme.
Executive Directors may elect to be paid some or all of their entitlement in cash.
Annual Bonus
To incentivise and reward performance.
The Committee selects performance 
measures and targets each year to 
reinforce the strategic business 
priorities for the year.
The deferral of half of the bonus into 
shares is designed to further align 
executives with shareholders’ interests.
The annual bonus arrangements are reviewed prior to the start of each ﬁ nancial year to ensure performance 
measures and weightings are appropriate and support the business strategy .
The Committee reviews performance against the annual bonus targets but has the ability to take into account 
broader factors and may exercise two-way discretion to ensure that the annual bonus awarded properly reﬂ ects 
the performance of the Company and each Director.
Adjudication of bonuses will be explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil-cost options for three years (under the MSP) 
subject to risk of forfeiture should an Executive Director leave the Company . Alternatively the Committee may 
invite Executive Directors to use 50 per cent of their net bonus to purchase shares in the Company which will be 
matched under the MSP and held for three years subject to equivalent restrictions.
Performance Share Plan “PSP”
To incentivise and reward long-term 
outperformance, and help retain 
Executive Directors over the 
longer term.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards under the PSP , which may be made as market value share 
options, shares, or nil-cost options, at the discretion of the Committee.
In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions, the Committee must satisfy itself that the ﬁ gures are 
a genuine reﬂ ection of underlying ﬁ nancial performance, and may exercise discretion when determining the 
proportion of an award that will vest.
Matching Share Plan “MSP”
To further align the interests of 
Executive Directors with those 
of shareholders.
To enable participants to enhance their 
long-term incentive opportunity by 
committing to signiﬁ cant long-term 
investment in the Company .
To provide a link between short-term 
and long-term remuneration.
A matching award may be made in respect of deferred bonus described above.
Executive Directors may also be off ered the opportunity to co-invest up to 150% of salary in aggregate (across 
outstanding award cycles) under the MSP .
In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions, the Committee must satisfy itself that the ﬁ gures are 
a genuine reﬂ ection of underlying ﬁ nancial performance, and may exercise discretion when determining the 
proportion of an award that will vest.
All Employee Share Schemes
The Company does not currently operate any All Employee Share Schemes, however if such a scheme were 
introduced the Executive Directors would be able to participate on the same terms as other employees. www.capitalandcounties.com 65 
Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of the 
annual review and will normally be in line with increases awarded 
to other employees. However, the Committee may make additional 
adjustments in certain circumstances to reﬂ ect, for example, an 
increase in scope or responsibility , to address a gap in market 
positioning and/or to reward the long-term performance of an 
individual. The Chief Executive will have the highest base salary of 
all Executive Directors, and the maximum base salary for the Chief 
Executive will be within the top quartile of the Chief Executive 
salaries for the constituents of the long-term incentive schemes 
comparator group (current constituents listed on page 75).
The Committee considers individual and Company performance when setting 
base salary .
Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate in light of 
relevant market practice for the role and individual circumstances. 
The cost of all beneﬁ ts will not exceed 10 per cent of base salary , with 
the exception of any future expatriate and/or relocation beneﬁ ts, 
which would be disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
N/A
The maximum and current contribution rate for Executive 
Directors is 24 per cent of base salary .
N/A
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is 
150 per cent of annual salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary 
payable for achieving target levels of performance. No bonus is 
payable for below threshold performance. The payment for 
threshold performance will not exceed 10 per cent of maximum. 
Awards are made on a straight-line basis for performance between 
threshold and target, and on a separate straight-line basis for 
performance between target and maximum.
Executives’ performance is measured relative to challenging targets in key ﬁ nancial, 
operational, and strategic measures. The measures selected and their weightings vary 
each year according to the strategic priorities.
At least 75% of the bonus will be measured against ﬁ nancial performance.
Measures and respective weightings used for the current annual bonus, and proposed 
for next year’s annual bonus are set out in the annual report on remuneration on 
pages 72 and 73.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 66.
Each year participants may be granted up to 150 per cent of salary in 
shares or nil-cost options or up to 300 per cent of salary in market 
value share options.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee can make awards of 
up to 200 per cent of salary in shares or nil-cost options or up to 
400 per cent of salary in market value share options.
The Committee’s policy is to consider exceptional executive 
performance (in the year prior to grant) as a circumstance that could 
warrant the granting of exceptional awards under incentive plans.
For awards made under the usual scheme limit, 33 per cent vests 
for median performance. Where an exceptional award is made, 
25 per cent vests for median performance.
PSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, however the additional 
element of an exceptional award is subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to continued employment and the Company’s 
Performance over a three-year performance period based:
• 50% on relative Total Return (Net Asset Value growth plus dividends)
• 50% on relative TSR
For both measures, performance is measured relative to a comparator group 
comprising the largest FTSE350 property companies.
The performance measures and weightings which apply to the PSP are reviewed by 
the Committee annually , and the Committee may make non-signiﬁ cant changes to 
the weightings and/or comparator group to ensure that they remain relevant to the 
Company strategy and suitably stretching.
Details of the performance conditions for previous years’ awards, and those proposed 
for 2014 awards are set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 74 to 75.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 66.
Participants may earn up to one matching share for each invested 
share, in normal circumstances.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee can award two 
matching shares for each invested share.
The Committee’s policy is to consider exceptional executive 
performance (in the year prior to grant) as a circumstance that could 
warrant the granting of exceptional awards under incentive plans.
For awards made under the usual scheme limit, 33 per cent vests 
for median performance. Where an exceptional award is made, 
16.5 per cent vests for median performance.
MSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, however the additional 
element of an exceptional award made in respect of deferred bonus is subject to a 
two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to the same conditions as the PSP .
Details of the performance conditions for previous years’ awards, and those proposed 
for 2014 awards, are set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 74 to 75.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 66.

1.3 NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
Performance measurement selection
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses 
depending on the Company’s ﬁ nancial 
performance and their own individual 
performance. The current structure of the 
annual bonus performance conditions is 
illustrated within the annual report on 
remuneration on page 72. The ﬁ nancial 
performance measures and the importance 
of each are set out in the table below.
The annual ﬁ nancial performance targets 
are set by the Committee in the ﬁ rst 
quarter of each year following an analysis 
of external and internal expectations 
compiled by the Committee’s independent 
adviser, Kepler Associates. The Committee 
sets targets it believes to be appropriately 
stretching, but achievable.
Long-term incentives
As mentioned above, the performance 
conditions are consistent for the MSP and 
PSP , which ensures that the interests of 
participants in diff erent plans are aligned, 
and comprise two measures:
• Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
• Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
The Committee believes that these two 
measures are the most appropriate 
measures of long-term success for 
Capco as long-term relative performance 
provides an appropriately objective and 
relevant measure of Capco’s success 
which is strongly aligned with 
shareholders’ interests.
The Committee believes that NAV growth 
is the most important internal measure of 
success for Capco at this time. Accordingly , 
the Committee considered it appropriate to 
reward NAV performance in both the short 
and long-term incentive arrangements, 
with 1-year absolute NAV growth being 
used in respect of the annual bonus 
arrangements and 3-year relative NAV (as 
the main component of 3-year Total Return) 
being used in respect of the long-term 
incentives. NAV is used as a performance 
measure by over half of FTSE350 property 
companies in their long-term incentive 
arrangements.
Relative TSR helps align the interests of 
Executive Directors with shareholders 
by incentivising share price growth and, 
in the Committee’s view, provides an 
objective measure of the Company’s 
long-term success.
Performance is measured relative to a 
comparator group comprising the largest 
FTSE350 property companies and Capco. 
The members of the comparator group are 
shown in ﬁ gure 4 on page 75.
In order for any awards to vest, the 
Committee must also satisfy itself that 
the TR and TSR ﬁ gures are a genuine 
reﬂ ection of underlying ﬁ nancial 
performance. In assessing the extent to 
which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee consults with its 
independent remuneration adviser. The 
calculation of the returns is also reviewed 
by the Company’s auditors as appropriate.
The performance targets are set by the 
Committee following an analysis of internal 
and external expectations, and are believed 
to be appropriately stretching.
The current structure of the long-term 
incentive performance conditions is 
illustrated within the annual report on 
remuneration on page 75. 
Payments resulting from existing 
arrangements
Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
payment resulting from contractual 
arrangements entered into or the vesting of 
any award made prior to the approval and 
implementation of the remuneration policy 
detailed in this report.
Bonus malus
Awards granted from 2013 (other than 
awards made in respect of the 2012 ﬁ nancial 
year) are subject to bonus malus in the event 
of gross misconduct of a Director which 
is considered to have had a material 
detrimental impact on the business of any 
group company or to have brought the 
business of such company into signiﬁ cant 
disrepute, or in the event that the prior 
ﬁ nancial statements of any group company 
or any business unit or division of any 
group company are materially restated, 
corrected or amended. The application 
of any malus is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Why is each performance measure appropriate for Capco?
Measure Reason
Growth in Net Asset Value 
per share
Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the present time.
Relative Total Property Return Rewards the additional portfolio value created by management over and above any changes in value from tracking the 
property market as a whole, as measured by IPD.
Earnings Per Share Rewards value growth in net rental income as well as the management of ﬁ nancing and other costs. However, given 
the current stage of the Company’s development, the Committee considers EPS to be less relevant as an indicator of 
value creation than growth in Net Asset Value per share. www.capitalandcounties.com 67 
Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Remuneration of employees below 
the Board
The policy and practice with regard to the 
remuneration of head offi  ce and Covent 
Garden employees below the Board is 
consistent with that for the Executive 
Directors, except as set out below. 
Employees below Board level have not, 
to date, participated in the MSP but do 
participate in the PSP with awards being 
subject to the same performance conditions 
as apply to awards made to Executive 
Directors (with the exception of the 
conditions that apply to any exceptional 
portion of an award made to an Executive 
Director). The 2014 awards for employees 
below the Board will be subject to the same 
performance conditions as previous years’ 
awards. In exceptional circumstances, such 
as recruitment, long-term incentive awards 
may be granted without performance 
conditions to participants below the Board.
The pension contribution rate for 
employees below the Board is lower 
than that for Executive Directors.
Employees below the Board are not 
subject to any minimum shareholding 
requirement.
The Venues business has separate 
remuneration arrangements appropriate 
for that business. These comprise salary , 
separate pension arrangements and 
discretionary bonuses. 
Shareholding guidelines
The Chief Executive is required to achieve 
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 300 per cent of salary and the other 
Executive Directors are required to achieve 
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 200 per cent of base salary , to be achieved 
by retaining at least 50 per cent of any 
vested share awards (net of tax) and/or 
within three years. The Committee believes 
that these shareholding requirements are 
the most stringent in the listed property 
sector in the UK. The current shareholdings 
of the Executive Directors are set out on 
page 79. The Chairman is required to 
maintain a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to 100 per cent of his base fee.
1.4 Performance scenario charts
The potential reward opportunities 
illustrated in ﬁ gure 1 are based on the policy 
which will apply in 2014, applied to the base 
salary at the salary review date, 1 April 2014, 
and provide estimates of the potential 
future reward opportunity for each 
Executive Director, and the potential 
split between the diff erent elements of 
remuneration under three diff erent 
performance scenarios: ‘Below Threshold’ , 
‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’.
The Below Threshold scenario includes 
base salary , pension and beneﬁ ts (ﬁ xed pay). 
No annual bonus or PSP and MSP elements 
are included (variable pay). The Target 
scenario includes ﬁ xed pay , on target bonus 
and threshold vesting of PSP and MSP 
awards. The Maximum scenario includes 
ﬁ xed pay , maximum bonus and full vesting 
of PSP and MSP awards.
For variable pay , the amounts illustrated 
are the normal maximum opportunities, 
except for the 2013 MSP co-investment 
matching opportunity which is based on 
an exceptional match on an annualised 
co-investment of 50 per cent of salary . 
It should be noted that the PSP and MSP 
awards granted in a year do not normally 
vest until the third anniversary of the date 
of grant. The projected values of long-term 
incentives shown here exclude the impact 
of share price movement and dividends.

1.5 Approach to recruitment remuneration
When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration, 
as follows:
Element of remuneration Policy on recruitment Maximum opportunity
Salary Based on scope and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the 
candidate’s experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs. 
market pay levels for comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate’s 
current salary .
n/a
Pension On a similar basis to other Executive Directors.
Beneﬁ ts Appropriate beneﬁ ts will be provided, which may include the continuation of 
beneﬁ ts received in a previous role. 
Annual Bonus New Executive Directors will participate in the annual bonus scheme on 
the same basis as existing Executive Directors, pro-rated for proportion of 
year served.
Normal policy table limits may 
be exceeded on recruitment 
in exceptional circumstances. 
The maximum additional bonus 
opportunity will be limited to 
50 per cent of salary .
Matching Share Plan* New Executive Directors may participate in the MSP on similar terms to 
other executives.
As per the normal policy table.
Performance Share Plan* New Executive Directors may be granted awards under the PSP on similar terms 
to other executives.
As per the normal policy table.
Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors, the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors (including quantum, 
the nature of remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Capco and its shareholders. 
Remuneration may include:
• An award made in respect of a new appointment to “buy out” existing incentive 
awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In such cases the compensatory 
award would typically be a like-for-like award with similar time-to-vesting, 
performance conditions and likelihood of those conditions being met. The fair 
value of the compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being 
replaced. To facilitate such a buyout, the Committee may use an award under a 
diff erent structure or an additional award under the PSP or MSP .
• A relocation package, should this be required.
In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, the Company would 
honour any existing contractual arrangements.
* Awards are subject to performance conditions.
1.6 Service contracts and exit payment policy
The service contracts of Executive Directors are approved by the Remuneration Committee and are one-year rolling contracts. The current 
contracts commenced on 17 May 2010. The service contracts may be terminated by either party giving one year’s notice to the other. It is the 
Company’s policy that termination payments should not exceed the Director’s current salary and beneﬁ ts for the notice period.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of his/her statutory employment rights or any other 
claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Committee will be entitled to enter into a settlement agreement with the 
Director. The Company may pay a Director’s legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and 
participants. Any annual bonus payment in respect of the year of termination is subject to the discretion of the Committee.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
The table below summarises how MSP and PSP awards are typically treated in speciﬁ c leaver circumstances, with the ﬁ nal treatment 
remaining subject to the Committee’s discretion:
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Treatment of awards
Good leaver Normal vesting date, although 
the Committee has discretion 
to accelerate
Payments are pro-rated for time and remain subject to outstanding performance 
conditions. Where vesting is accelerated, payments are further pro-rated to reﬂ ect the 
extent to which the performance conditions had been satisﬁ ed at the date of leaving.
Change of control Immediately Except in certain cases which were set out in full in the Company’s prospectus dated 
12 March 2010, vesting will be pro-rated for time and remain subject to performance 
conditions. However the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest in full in 
such circumstances if it deems this to be fair and reasonable
Any other reason Awards lapse
An individual would generally be considered a ‘good leaver’ if they left the Group’s employment by reason of injury , ill-health, disability 
approved by the Committee, redundancy or retirement with the agreement of the employing company . The table above summarises how 
MSP and PSP awards are typically treated in speciﬁ c leaver circumstances, with the ﬁ nal treatment remaining subject to the Committee’s 
discretion, for example an individual may be considered a ‘good leaver’ for any other reason at the absolute discretion of the Committee, 
and the vesting of awards may be reduced for ‘good leavers’.
There are no obligations on the Company contained within the existing Directors’ service contracts which would give rise to payments not 
disclosed in this report.
The service contracts of any future-appointed Directors will provide for mitigation in the event of termination.
1.7 Non-executive Director Policy Table
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment. The letters of appointment of the 
Non-executive Directors are reviewed by the Board annually and contain a one month notice period. The Chairman’s letter of appointment 
contains a twelve month notice period. 
Non-executive Directors’ dates of appointment and unexpired terms:
Date of appointment
Date of most recent letter of 
appointment Unexpired term
Graeme Gordon 23 Feb 2010 7 May 2013 27 months
Ian Henderson 23 Feb 2010 7 May 2013 3 months

Directors’ remuneration report continued
1.8 External Directorships
The Company’s policy is to encourage each 
Executive Director to take up one or more 
Non-executive Directorships, subject to 
Board approval. Fees received for serving 
as a Non-executive Director of a company 
outside the Capco Group are retained by 
the Executive Director. Details of current 
external appointments are set out on 
page 50.
1.9 Consideration of conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
When setting Executive Director pay the 
Committee considers the remuneration 
and overall conditions of all employees. 
The Committee does not consult with 
employees when deciding remuneration 
policy , but it receives regular updates from 
the HR Director on salary increases, bonus 
and share awards made to Group employees 
and is aware of how the remuneration 
of Directors compares to that of other 
employees, for example, salary increases 
are generally in line with increases 
awarded to other employees, which are 
set with reference to market data. 
1.10 Consideration of shareholder views
It is the Committee’s policy to consult 
with major shareholders as appropriate 
e.g. prior to ﬁ nalising any major changes 
to its executive remuneration policy . 
The shareholder engagement undertaken 
by the Committee Chairman and Company 
Chairman during 2013 and early 2014, and 
its conclusions, are described in section 2.3 
of this report.
2. ANNUAL REPORT ON 
REMUNERATION
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report explains how Capco’s remuneration 
policy has been implemented during 
the year.
2.1 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining and 
recommending to the Board the policy 
for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, setting targets for the Company’s 
incentive schemes and determining the 
total individual remuneration package for 
each Executive Director.
Membership of the Committee as at 31 
December 2013 and the date of this report 
is set out on page 62. In addition, the 
Company Chairman, Chief Executive, 
Company Secretary and the Director of 
HR & CR are invited to attend Committee 
meetings and contribute, except on matters 
relating to their own remuneration.
Attendance at the ﬁ ve meetings held during 
the year is shown in the table on page 56 
and a summary of the matters considered 
by the Committee during the year is set out 
in the adjacent shaded box.
2.2 Remuneration Committee and 
its advisers
The Committee appointed Kepler 
Associates as its independent remuneration 
adviser following a selection process on the 
Company’s establishment. The Committee 
has received advice on matters including 
remuneration structure, incentive design 
and target setting. Kepler Associates is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to its code of conduct. 
The Committee has received conﬁ rmation 
of independence from Kepler, and is 
satisﬁ ed that the advice received was 
objective and independent. In addition to 
advice provided to the Committee, Kepler 
also provided share award valuation 
services to the Company . During 2013 the 
Company paid a total of £83,031 to Kepler 
Associates in respect of advice to the 
Committee, Kepler’s fees were charged 
on a time basis.
2.3 Statement of shareholder voting
The table below shows the results of the 
advisory vote on the 2012 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report at the 3 May 2013 
AGM.
Although a signiﬁ cant number of votes 
were cast against the 2012 Directors 
Remuneration Report, it is worth noting 
that the report was supported by the 
Company’s largest shareholders. The 
reasons for the voting of shareholders who 
voted against the report were not uniform, 
however they included:
• Size of salary increases awarded to 
Executive Directors
• Off er of exceptional 2:1 co-investment 
opportunity to Executive Directors
• Exceptional PSP award made to 
Executive Directors
• No binding vote on remuneration policy 
in 2012
It is the Committee’s policy to consult with 
major shareholders prior to any major 
changes to its executive remuneration 
structure. The Chairman of the Committee 
wrote to the Company’s 20 largest 
shareholders, the Association of British 
Insurers (ABI) and Institutional 
Shareholder Services (ISS) regarding the 
Committee’s proposals for executive 
remuneration in 2014 and a number of 
discussion meetings were held. 
Matters considered by the 
Committee over the past year 
include:
• Remuneration policy and Executive 
Director remuneration
• Shareholder discussion meetings
• New disclosure requirements and 
shareholder rights
• Directors’ Remuneration Report
• Committee terms of reference
• Institutional investor voting reports
• Setting of and evaluation of 
performance against Executive 
Directors’ performance targets 
• Annual bonus structure and 
application across the Group
• Share scheme awards and 
performance targets
• Chairman and Chief Executive’s 
expenses

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
The Committee received indications of 
support from the largest of its shareholders 
but a small proportion of shareholders 
did not fully endorse the proposals in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The Committee acknowledges that some 
shareholders do not consider exceptional 
performance to be a circumstance 
warranting exceptional incentive awards, 
and, should the Committee wish to make 
an exceptional award in a future year, it 
would expect to consult with shareholders.
2.4 Single ﬁ gure of remuneration
The tables below show the single ﬁ gures of 
total remuneration paid to each Director 
in 2013 and 2012. The charts in ﬁ gure 2 on 
page 72 illustrate the contribution that 
each element of remuneration made to 
the total remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, including the substantial 
proportion of remuneration that has 
resulted from the share price growth from 
which all shareholders have beneﬁ ted.

3  In the 2012 ﬁ gures, this comprises the value on vesting of PSP and MSP awards which had a performance period that ran from 2010 to 2012, and either vested during 2013 or are 
expected to vest during 2014. The value on vesting of the 2010 awards has been included in the 2012 single ﬁ gure as the performance conditions relating to these awards had been 
substantially (but not fully) completed during 2012. On the same basis, the expected value of the 2011 MSP and PSP awards which are expected to vest in early 2014 has been disclosed 
in the 2013 single ﬁ gures. The value of these awards has been calculated using the share price on the date when each award vested, except for share options where the performance 
conditions have been satisﬁ ed but the option is not yet exercisable; for these awards, £3.368, being the average share price for the last three months of 2013 has been used. 100 per cent 
vesting of the 2011 awards has been assumed.

2.5 Incentive outcomes in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2013
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses 
depending on the Company’s ﬁ nancial 
performance and their own individual 
performance. Awards are based 75 per cent 
on ﬁ nancial performance, and 25 per cent 
on individual performance.
The ﬁ nancial performance element for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 was based on 
growth in absolute NAV per share (NAV), 
Total Property Return relative to the IPD 
Total Return All Property Index (TPR), and 
adjusted EPS (EPS). In determining the 
annual targets for these measures in 2013, 
the Committee recognised the long-term 
nature of some aspects of the Company’s 
strategy , and the extent to which this 
would be reﬂ ected in these measures on 
a 12-month horizon. The performance 
measures, weightings and targets that 
applied in respect of the 2013 annual bonus 
are summarised in the table on page 73. 
The TPR target is included in the 
Company’s KPIs on page 11. The KPIs are 
in part dependent upon the occurrence of 
certain discrete events. Therefore, whilst 
the out-performance targets that apply to 
the long-term incentives are disclosed, the 
Committee has decided that disclosing 
speciﬁ c short-term NAV and EPS targets 
would provide a level of information to 
counterparties that could prejudice the 
Company’s commercial interests. The 
Committee expects to publish these 
performance targets once they cease to 
be commercially sensitive.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 
2013, the Company performed strongly 
against its ﬁ nancial targets, for example 
NAV per share was over 9 per cent higher 
than the top end of the target range set by 
the Committee, and Total Property Return 
at 21.9 per cent compares to 10.9 per cent for 
the IPD index. The Committee exercised 
discretion to modify the EPS outcome to 
adjust for the impact of the strong share 
price growth in 2013 that had a material 
impact on the measure. The modiﬁ ed 
EPS ﬁ gure was within the target range. 
Accordingly awards of 107 per cent of 
salary were made to each Executive 
Director in respect of the ﬁ nancial 
performance measures.
The Committee assessed individual 
performance against a set of KPIs which 
align with the Company’s objectives 
outlined on page 10 of the Annual Report.
These KPIs include:
• Corporate objectives: enhancing Capco’s 
position and reputation in the market; 
progress towards meeting medium-term 
corporate objectives
• Financial objectives: optimising liquidity 
and ﬁ nancing; eff ective cost and capex 
management; other budgeted KPIs
• Investment objectives: strategic 
investment initiatives; launch of 
marketing initiatives
• CR/HR objectives: optimisation of 
divisional structure; nurturing 
of future leaders; evolution of 
environmental targets.
The performance of the Executive 
Directors in 2013 was considered to have 
been excellent, including the continued 
transformation of Covent Garden into a 
world class address, securing resolutions to 
grant planning permission for the Kings 
Court and Carriage Hall proposals, the 
ﬁ nalisation and exercise of the CLSA, 
securing planning consent for the Earls 
Court Masterplan and the acquisition of 
the Empress State Building. Accordingly , 
awards of 35 per cent of salary were made 
to each Executive Director in respect of 
the individual performance measures.

Long-term Incentive Arrangements
Matching Share Plan (MSP)
The operation of, and the maximum 
opportunities under, the MSP are explained 
in the remuneration policy on page 65. 
Details of the awards made to Executive 
Directors under the MSP in 2013 and in 
past years are set out in tables on page 80 
and 81. These awards include deferred 
bonus shares, and matching awards 
made in respect of deferred bonus and 
co-investment, in accordance with the 
remuneration policy .
Annual bonus: In previous years the 
Committee has awarded a 1:1 match under 
the MSP in respect of deferred bonus 
shares. In light of the executive team’s 
exceptional performance during 2013, 
the Committee has awarded an exceptional 
2:1 matching opportunity in respect of 
Directors’ deferred bonus shares for 2013. 
Any additional matching shares will only 
be earned for performance above the 
normal stretch targets, and will be subject 
to a two-year post-vesting holding period. 
Co-investment opportunity: In 2010 (the 
inception year of Capco), Executive 
Directors were invited to co-invest up to 
150 per cent of salary in the Company’s 
shares during the ﬁ rst 12 months of 
inception (subsequently extended to 24 
months as the Company was subject to 
extended restricted periods during which 
Directors were unable to purchase Capco 
shares) in return for the opportunity to 
receive up to two shares for each share 
purchased, subject to three-year 
performance. The Committee considered 
that the MSP had been highly successful 
and had played a crucial role in motivating 
and retaining management. Accordingly , 
and in light of the Company’s strong 
performance since 2010, which signiﬁ cantly 
exceeded the maximum level of 
performance rewarded under the original 
performance conditions, the Committee 
off ered the Executive Directors an 
opportunity to invest up to 150 per cent of 
2013 salary between 2013 and 2016 when 
permitted by scheme headroom with an 
exceptional matching opportunity of 2:1. 
The additional matching opportunity can 
only be earned for performance above the 
normal stretch targets, as illustrated in 
ﬁ gure 4 on page 75. The MSP awards made 
in respect of co-investment under this 
invitation to date are set out on page 81. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 74 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The operation of, and the maximum 
opportunities under, the PSP are explained 
in the remuneration policy on pages 64 and 
65. Details of the awards made to Executive 
Directors under the PSP in 2013 and in past 
years are set out in the tables on pages 80 
and 81. Since 2011, in line with common 
market practice, the Committee has made 
awards to Executive Directors in nil cost 
options which utilise a lower proportion of 
the Company’s share capital than market 
value share options. 
Following the review of executive 
remuneration in 2012 the Committee made 
an exceptional award of 200 per cent of 
salary in nil cost options to Executive 
Directors in 2013 in light of the Company’s 
strong performance since demerger which 
signiﬁ cantly exceeded the maximum level 
of performance rewarded under the current 
performance conditions. The Committee 
has decided that an award of 150 per cent of 
salary in nil-cost options will be made to 
Executive Directors in 2014.
In 2013 the Committee determined that 
the performance conditions relating to 
the market value options awarded under 
the PSP in 2010 had been satisﬁ ed and 
accordingly the awards vested in full.
Details of the performance conditions that 
apply to awards made under the PSP are set 
out in ﬁ gure 4 on page 75. The potential 
additional 50 per cent of salary awarded in 
2013 can only be earned for performance 
above the normal stretch targets, as 
illustrated in ﬁ gure 4 and is subject to a 
two-year post-vesting holding period.
The Committee continues to explore ways 
of structuring future awards under the 
long-term incentive arrangements in a 
potentially more tax effi  cient manner for 
participants. The Committee will ensure 
that any changes are cost neutral to Capco. 
No changes are proposed at this time.
2.6 Long-term incentive performance 
conditions
As explained in the policy report, the 
current performance conditions are the 
same for both the MSP and PSP and 
comprise two equally weighted measures:
• Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
• Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
The Committee has reviewed the 
performance conditions for the PSP and 
MSP and concluded that the existing 
performance measures are believed to be 
appropriately stretching and remain 
appropriate. The Committee believes 
relative TSR outperformance of +4 per cent 
per annum to be broadly equivalent to an 
upper quartile level of performance.
The performance conditions for the MSP 
and PSP awards made previously (which 
will continue to apply to MSP awards 
made in respect of deferred bonus) and 
the performance conditions for MSP 
co-investment and PSP awards made from 
2013 are illustrated in ﬁ gure 4 on page 75.
2.7 Vesting of 2010 and 2011 MSP and 
PSP awards
In 2013 the Committee determined that 
Capco’s Total Return had outperformed the 
median of the comparator group by 3.3% 
p.a. (vs. an outperformance target of 2.5%) , 
and that Capco’s Total Shareholder Return 
had outperformed the comparator group 
median by 20% p.a. (vs. an outperformance 
target of 4% p.a.), and as such the 
performance conditions relating to the 
2010 PSP and MSP awards had been met in 
full. Accordingly the 2010 PSP and MSP 
awards vest in full subject to continued 
employment on the third anniversary 
of grant. 
In 2014 the Committee determined that 
Capco’s Total Shareholder Return had 
outperformed the median of the 
comparator group by 14.3% p.a. (vs. an 
outperformance target of 4%), and that 
Capco’s Total Return was expected to 
outperform the median of the comparator 
group by approximately 8.1% p.a. (vs. an 
outperformance target of 2.5%p.a.) and 
as such, subject to ﬁ nal determination 
of Capco’s relative Total Return 
outperformance, the 2011 PSP and MSP 
awards are expected to vest in full, subject 
to continued employment on the third 
anniversary of grant.  www.capitalandcounties.com 75

2.10 External Non-executive 
Directorships
During the year Ian Hawksworth received 
a fee of £25,000 in respect of his Non-
executive Directorship of AIM-listed 
Japan Residential Investment Company 
Limited. No other Executive Director 
currently serves as a Non-executive 
Director elsewhere.
2.11 Statement of implementation of 
policy for 2014
Salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries are 
reviewed annually . 
The current salary positioning of the Chief 
Executive remains below the level that the 
Committee believes to be appropriate for 
the contribution and experience of the 
individual concerned. The Committee 
believes that the Chief Executive’s salary 
is currently approximately 12 per cent 
below the median for FTSE350 property 
companies, taking into account Capco’s 
relative market capitalisation. The 
Remuneration Committee is proposing to 
raise the salary by 6 per cent (to £525,000) in 
2014 (which is an increase within the range 
of the expected increases for the rest of the 
workforce). In addition, the Committee 
is minded to keep the Chief Executive’s 
salary under review during 2014 and, if 
appropriate in 2015, to consider a similar 
level of increase to a competitive level, 
depending on the circumstances at the 
time. The salaries of the Investment 
Director and Finance Director will be 
increased in line with the average increase 
for the rest of the workforce, which 
is expected to be in the range of 4 to 
6 per cent.
The proposed revised salaries for the 
Executive Directors are set out in the 
table below: 
Executive Director Salaries – 2013 and 2014
2013 2014 % Increase
Ian Hawksworth £495,000 £525,000 6.06
Soumen Das £360,000 £374,364 3.99
Gary Yardley £440,000 £457,556 3.99 www.capitalandcounties.com 77 
Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Pension and beneﬁ ts
As described in the Policy Table on pages 64 
and 65.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity will remain 
unchanged for 2014. 
The ﬁ nancial performance targets for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 were based on 
growth in absolute NAV per share, Total 
Property Return relative to the IPD Total 
Return All Property Index, and adjusted 
EPS. The Committee has decided that these 
measures remain appropriate for 2014 as 
they reﬂ ect the KPIs by which the Company 
measures its success. Further information 
on the Company’s KPIs can be found on 
page 11. The weightings of each ﬁ nancial 
measure are unchanged from 2013 and 
reﬂ ect the Committee’s view of their 
relative importance for 2014 given the 
current stage in the execution of Capco’s 
strategy . The key area of focus for 2014 
continues to be capital growth.
The Committee has decided that the 2014 
annual bonus targets should not be 
disclosed prospectively due to commercial 
sensitivity . The Committee expects to 
publish the performance targets 
retrospectively once they have ceased 
to be commercially sensitive.
Matching Share Plan
The MSP awards to be made in 2014 are 
described on page 73.
Performance Share Plan
PSP awards of 150 per cent of salary will be 
made in 2014 (2013: 200 per cent).
The Committee believes that the Executive 
Director remuneration proposed for 2014 
is appropriate given performance over the 
last year and the importance of the current 
management team continuing to deliver 
Capco’s ambitious strategy . 
Chairman and Non-executive Director 
remuneration
The Chairman has been appointed for 
a three-year term, subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders, which will 
expire at the 2016 AGM. The Chairman’s 
annual base fee for 2013 was £225,000, 
however this was varied such that a 
proportion of the fee was paid into a 
SIPP arrangement. 
The remuneration of the Chairman is 
reviewed annually . Following the 2013 
review it was agreed that the Chairman’s 
annual base fee would be increased to 
£234,000 with eff ect from 1 May 2014. 
During his ﬁ rst three years the Chairman 
also received a car allowance and a 
supplement of 15 per cent of his base fee in 
lieu of any pension contributions, however 
these transitional beneﬁ ts ceased on the 
renewal of his appointment. In addition, 
the Company made a matching award of 
deferred shares comprising 200 per cent of 
the number of invested shares in respect 
of each Capco share he purchased within 
the ﬁ rst 12 months of inception of Capco 
(up to 150 per cent of his base fee.) This 
represented a 1:1 match, grossed up on the 
basis of an income tax rate of 50 per cent. 
This award vested on 10 May 2013.
The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors is considered by the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive, with regard to 
market comparatives, and recommended to 
the Board as a whole. The Non-executive 
Director fees are reviewed annually . 
Following the 2013 review it was agreed 
that the Non-executive Director fees would 
be increased as set out in the table below 
with eff ect from 1 May 2014.

2.15 Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and Share Interests
(a) Directors’ Shareholdings
The beneﬁ cial interests in the shares of the Company for each Director who served during the year are set out in the table below. The Chief 
Executive is required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 300 per cent of salary and the other Executive Directors are 
required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary , to be achieved by retaining at least 50 per cent 
of any vested share awards (net of tax) and/or within three years. The Chairman is required to maintain a shareholding equivalent to 
100 per cent of his base fee. The Committee believes that these shareholding requirements, which have been met, are the most stringent 
in the UK property sector. The current shareholdings of the Chairman and Executive Directors are illustrated in ﬁ gure 7.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report & 
Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union (EU) have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and  
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time,  
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and 
– the Directors’ report contained includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces. 
– having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought  
to the attention of the Board during the year into account, the 
Directors consider that the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as  
a whole are fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors 
believe that the disclosures set out in of the Annual Report & 
Accounts provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
 
Signed on behalf of the Board on 25 February 2014.

REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Our opinion 
In our opinion: 
– The financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view 
of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and of the Group’s 
and Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended; 
– The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
– The Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
– The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
This opinion is to be read in the context of the remainder of  
this report. 
What we have audited 
The Group financial statements and Parent Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”), which are prepared by 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC, comprise: 
– the Group and Parent Company balance sheets as at  
31 December 2013; 
– the consolidated income statement and statement of 
comprehensive income for the year then ended; 
– the Group and Parent Company statements of changes in equity 
and statements of cash flows for the year then ended; and 
– the notes to the financial statements, which include a  
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent Company, as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)).  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: 
– whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
– the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and 
– the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report & Accounts (“Annual Report”) to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware  
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report. 
Overview of our audit approach 
Materiality 
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to 
determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for the Group financial statements as a whole to be £23 million. 
This represents approximately 1 per cent of total assets. We set a 
specific materiality level of £9 million for the audit of net rental 
income, finance costs and administrative expenses.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £1 million as well 
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Overview of the scope of our audit 
The Group is structured along four business lines, being Covent 
Garden, Earls Court Properties (including the Lillie Square 
development), Venues and Other (including the discontinued 
operation, The Great Capital Partnership), each of which is a 
reporting unit. The Group financial statements are a consolidation 
of these reporting units and centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at  
the reporting units by us, as the group engagement team, or 
component auditors within PwC UK operating under our 
instruction. Where the work was performed by component 
auditors, as was the case at Venues reporting unit, we determined 
the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at 
those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Of the Group’s four reporting units, we identified three which, in 
our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, 
as they are each financially significant. This, together with 
additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the 
evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
Areas of particular audit focus 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors made a  
number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by 
assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in  
the financial statements. 
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling 
and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. 
We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required 
particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all 
risks or areas of audit focus identified by our audit. We discussed 
these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on 
those matters that they considered to be significant issues in 
relation to the financial statements is set out on page 58.

Area of focus   How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus 
Valuation of investment and development property 
The valuation of property is inherently subjective due to, among other 
factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the 
expected future rental revenues for that particular property. Specific to 
Earls Court Properties there are additional valuation considerations such 
as the nature of interests held, contracts for land assembly, commitments 
to acquire land under the Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”) 
with the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the status  
of planning permission. 
(Refer also to note 18 to the financial statements). 
 
We assessed whether the properties held by the Group were valued on 
a consistent basis and using appropriate methods. 
We performed testing over data provided by the Group to the external 
valuers, including lease data. 
We also tested the controls over the external valuation process and met 
with the external valuers to understand and challenge their assumptions 
and conclusions, utilising our valuation experience. 
We performed testing over significant contracts which underpin land 
assembly and planning permission, in particular the Network Rail  
lease re-gear and accounting treatment of the Conditional Land Sale 
Agreement with the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. 
Taxation 
We focused on this area because of the degree of judgement involved 
in the ongoing activity of the Group including transfers and disposals 
of property portfolios. This gives rise to material tax considerations  
on the calculation, recognition, and classification of deferred tax 
balances from both a tax compliance and accounting perspective. 
(Refer also to note 31 to the financial statements).  
Using our previous experience of similar matters, we assessed the 
principal assumptions and judgements made in arriving at the current 
and deferred tax position. We read the open dialogue with HMRC 
and evaluated the Group’s position with senior management, the  
in-house tax specialists and their external advisers. 
Revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition. Because of this we focused on the timing of the  
recognition of rental income and revenue from the disposal of  
properties and its presentation in the income statement as well as  
gains on the valuation of investment and development property.  
(Refer to note 1 to the financial statements). 
 
We evaluated the relevant IT systems and tested the internal controls 
over the data included in the property management system and the 
reconciliations between the property revenue systems used by the 
Group and its financial ledgers. 
We tested the timing of revenue recognition, taking into account 
contractual obligations, and in particular considered how the Group 
recorded revenue based on sales of investment and trading properties.
The scope of our work on the valuation of investment and development 
property is described above. 
Risk of management override of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. 
 
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including 
the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions, and 
interviewed senior management and the Group’s internal audit function. 
We examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements 
relevant to the financial statements for evidence of bias by the Directors 
that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We also 
tested journal entries. 
Going Concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Director’s 
statement, set out on page 83, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
As noted in the Director’s statement, the Directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s and Parent Company’s 
financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting. 
The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Parent 
Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that 
the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the 
date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we 
have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis  
is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
OPINIONS ON MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006 
In our opinion: 
– the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; 
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
– the information given in the Corporate Governance Report  
set out on pages 52 to 56 in the Annual Report & Accounts  
with respect to internal control and risk management systems 
and about share capital structures is consistent with the  
financial statements.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
General information 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC was incorporated and registered 
in England and Wales on 3 February 2010 under the Companies  
Act as a public company limited by shares, registration number 
7145051. The registered office of the Company is 15 Grosvenor 
Street, London, W1K 4QZ, United Kingdom. The principal activity 
of the Company is to act as the ultimate parent company of Capital 
& Counties Properties PLC Group (the “Group”), whose principal 
activity is the development and management of property. 
The Capital & Counties Properties PLC Group’s assets principally 
comprise investment and development properties at Covent 
Garden, Earls Court and the exhibition halls at Olympia. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union, International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) 
interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of 
property, available-for-sale investments and financial instruments 
held for trading.  
Standards and guidelines relevant to the Group that were in issue 
and endorsed at the date of approval of the consolidated financial 
statements but not effective at the balance sheet date and have not 
been adopted early are: 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in other Entities’ 
IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (revised) 
IAS 28 ‘Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures’ (revised) 
IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amendment) 
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ (amendment) 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ 
(amendment) 
Revisions and amendments issued but not effective are not 
anticipated to have a material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements with the exception of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’.  
This standard, which has been endorsed by the EU, removes the 
proportional consolidation option currently available under  
IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’. This will impact the Group’s 
published accounting policy in respect of joint ventures. Rather 
than proportionally consolidating the Group’s share of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis, the Group’s 
net interest in the joint venture will be disclosed as a single line 
item in both the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated 
income statement. This change will reduce the total assets and total 
liabilities as currently presented, but there will be no overall change 
in net assets. This standard will be adopted by the Group from  
1 January 2014. During 2013, the following accounting standards 
and guidance were adopted by the Group:  
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (amendment) 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (revised) 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ (amendment) 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’  
Collectively these pronouncements had no significant impact on 
the consolidated financial statements and resulted in changes to 
presentation and disclosure only. 
A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, which 
have been applied consistently across the Group is set out below. 
Going concern basis 
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for 
this reason the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation 
These consolidated financial statements include the consolidation 
of the following limited partnerships: Capital & Counties CGP, 
Capital & Counties CGP 9, Capco CGP 2010 LP, Capco CGP 2012 LP, 
EC Properties LP and The Empress State Limited Partnership.  
The members of these qualifying partnerships have taken 
advantage of disclosure exemptions available in Statutory 
Instrument 2008/569 and therefore will not produce consolidated 
accounts at the partnership level. The consolidated financial 
statements are prepared in British pounds sterling, which is also 
determined to be the functional currency of the Parent. 
Subsidiaries and joint ventures 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the 
Group is deemed to govern the financial and operating policies  
of an entity, whether through a majority of the voting rights or 
otherwise. Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated from the date  
this control is lost.  
All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses are 
eliminated in full. 
The Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities is accounted  
for using proportional consolidation. The Group’s share of the 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the 
equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a  
line-by-line basis. 
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are reviewed at least 
annually for impairment. Where an indication of impairment 
exists, an assessment of the recoverable amount is performed.  
The recoverable amount is based on the higher of the investment’s 
continued value in use or its fair value less cost to sell; fair value is 
derived from the entity’s net asset value at the balance sheet date. 
Estimation and uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates.  
The most significant area of estimation and uncertainty in the 
consolidated financial statements is in respect of the valuation of 
the property portfolio and investments, where external valuations 
are obtained. The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is 
inherently subjective due to the assumptions as outlined within the 
property portfolio note. As a result, the valuations the Group places 
on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and 
are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be 
accurate and could therefore have a material effect on the Group’s 
financial performance and position. 
Other areas of estimation and uncertainty are included within the 
accounting policies below, the more significant being: 
Revenue recognition 
Share-based payment 
Provisions 
Pensions 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Income taxes 
Trade and other receivables 
Derivative financial instruments 
Operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments with 
reference to reports on divisional financial performance and 
position that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive,  
who is deemed to be the chief operating decision maker.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting  
from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of available-for-sale investments which 
are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
Revenue recognition 
Property rental income and exhibition income consist of gross 
income calculated on an accruals basis, together with services  
where the Group acts as principal in the ordinary course of 
business, excluding sales of property. Rental income is spread 
evenly over the period from lease commencement to lease expiry.  
Lease incentive payments, including surrender premiums paid 
which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income, are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Upon receipt 
of a surrender premium for the early termination of a lease, the 
profit and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the lease 
concerned are immediately reflected in net rental income. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed  
at the inception of a lease, for example increases arising on rent 
reviews, are recorded as income in the periods in which they  
are earned.  
Rent reviews are recognised as income, based on management 
estimates, when it is reasonable to assume they will be received. 
Estimates are derived from knowledge of market rents for 
comparable properties determined on an individual property  
basis and updated for progress of negotiations. 
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of property, it is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to  
the buyer. This will normally take place on exchange of contracts 
unless there are conditions that suggest insufficient probability of 
future economic benefits flowing to the Group. For conditional 
exchanges, sales are recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Dividend income is recognised when the relevant Group 
undertaking’s right to receive payment has been established. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view are 
required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance. These items are excluded from the calculation of 
underlying earnings. 
Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the 
year and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.  
In accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ deferred tax is provided 
for using the balance sheet liability method on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of those assets 
and liabilities. However, temporary differences are not recognised 
to the extent that they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; or are associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be 
controlled by the parent, venture or investor, respectively, and it  
is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believes it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be available against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset when  
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the 
same taxable group or different taxable entities where there is an 
intention to settle balances on a net basis.  
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates to 
items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.  
An investment property accounted for at fair value will normally  
be recovered through sale rather than use.  
Discontinued operation 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business 
that represents a separate major line of the business that has been 
disposed of or meets the criteria for classification as held for sale. 
Discontinued operations are presented separately from continuing 
operations in both the income statement and statement of cash 
flows. The comparative period is also re-presented in line with 
reporting requirements.  
Share-based payments 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised through 
the income statement with reference to the fair value of the 
instrument at the date of grant.  
The income statement is charged over the vesting period of the 
options with a corresponding increase in equity. 
An option pricing model is used applying assumptions around 
expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility.  
Upon eventual exercise, a reserves transfer occurs with no further 
charge reflected in the income statement. 
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and 
other share-based payment arrangements are treated as treasury 
shares and deducted from equity.  
Investment and development property 
Investment and development property are owned or leased by  
the Group and held for long-term rental income and capital 
appreciation and exclude property occupied by the Group. 
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model. Property and any 
related obligations, are initially recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards attached to the property have transferred to the 
Group. Payments made in respect of the future acquisition of 
investment and development property, as is the case for the CLSA, 
are initially recognised as prepayments until the recognition 
criteria outlined above have been met. Investment and 
development property are recorded at cost and subsequently 
revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by 
professionally qualified external valuers on the basis of market 
value after allowing for future transaction costs.  
The fair value of property is arrived at by adjusting the market 
value as above for directly attributable lease incentive assets and 
fixed head leases. 
Property held under leases is stated gross of the recognised finance 
lease liability.   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 96 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
The valuation is based upon assumptions as outlined within the 
property portfolio note. These assumptions conform with the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation Professional 
Standards. The cost of development properties includes capitalised 
interest and other directly attributable outgoings, with the 
exception of properties and land where no development is 
imminent in which case no interest is included. Interest is 
capitalised (before tax relief) on the basis of the weighted average 
cost of debt outstanding until the date of practical completion. 
When the Group redevelops a property for continued future use, 
that property is classified as an investment and development 
property during the redevelopment period and continues to be 
measured at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
property are recognised in the income statement in the period  
in which they arise. Depreciation is not provided in respect of 
investment property including plant and equipment integral  
to such investment property. 
When the use of a property changes from trading property to 
investment property, the property is transferred at fair value  
with any resulting gain recognised as trading property profit.  
Investment properties cease to be recognised as investment 
property when they have been disposed of or when they cease  
to be held for the purpose of generating rental income or for  
capital appreciation.  
Where the Group disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s 
length transaction the carrying value immediately prior to the  
sale is adjusted to the transaction price, offset by any directly 
attributable costs, and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in  
the income statement.  
A property ceases to be recognised as investment property and  
is transferred at its fair value to trading property when, in the 
Directors’ judgement, development commences with the intention 
of sale. Criteria considered in this assessment include, the Board’s 
stated intention, contractual commitments and physical, legal and 
financial viability.  
Trading property 
Trading property comprises those properties that in the Directors’ 
view are not held for long-term rental income and capital 
appreciation and are expected to be disposed of within one year of 
the balance sheet date or to be developed with the intention to sell.  
Such property is either acquired or if transferred from investment 
property, transferred at fair value which is deemed to represent 
cost. Subsequently trading property is carried at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and selling costs. In the case of trading property this 
approximates market value as determined by professionally 
qualified external valuers at the balance sheet date.  
The amount of any write-down of trading property to market value 
is recognised as an expense in the period the write down occurs. 
Should a valuation uplift occur in a subsequent period, the amount 
of any reversal shall be recognised as a reduction in the previous 
write-down in the period in which the uplift occurs. This may not 
exceed the property’s initial cost.  
The sale of trading property is recognised as income when the 
significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. 
Total costs incurred in respect of trading property are recognised 
simultaneously as an expense. 
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. 
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other 
leases are normally classified as operating leases.  
Group as a lessee: 
In accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’, property held 
under finance and operating leases may be accounted for as 
investment property. Finance leases are recognised as both an  
asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments. 
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet  
at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum  
lease payments, gross of the recognised finance lease liability.  
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the fair 
value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and the useful life of the asset.  
Rental expenses under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consist of fixtures, fittings and other  
office equipment. Plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset plus any 
attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition for 
its intended use. Depreciation is charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life to a 
maximum of five years. 
Investment in Group undertakings 
Investment in Group undertakings, which is eliminated on 
consolidation, is stated in the Company’s separate financial 
statements at cost less impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses 
are determined with reference to the investment’s fair value less 
estimated selling costs. Fair value is derived from the subsidiary’s 
net assets at the balance sheet date. On disposal, the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is 
included in the income statement. 
Investments 
Available-for-sale investments, being investments intended to  
be held for an indefinite period, are initially recognised and 
subsequently measured at fair value.  
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-
for-sale investments are included in other comprehensive income, 
except to the extent that losses are determined to be attributable  
to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the income 
statement and may not be reversed in subsequent periods. 
Disposals are recorded upon distribution, at which time 
accumulated fair value adjustments are recycled from reserves to 
the income statement.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Directors 
exercise judgement as to the collectability of the Group’s trade  
and other receivables and determine when it is appropriate to 
impair these assets.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Impairment of financial assets 
An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine 
whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by  
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
Factors such as days past due, credit status of the counterparty, 
historical evidence of collection and probability of deriving future 
economic benefit are considered to assess whether there is objective 
evidence of impairment. The amount of any potential loss is 
calculated by estimating future cash flows or by using fair value 
where this is available through observable market prices. If, in a 
subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the original impairment was recognised, the impairment 
reversal is recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent 
with the original charge. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks  
and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses non-trading derivative financial instruments to 
manage exposure to interest rate risk. These instruments have  
not been designated as qualifying for hedge accounting and are 
classified as held for trading. They are initially recognised on the 
trade date at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value 
based on market price. Changes in fair value are recognised directly 
in the income statement. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired in the 
ordinary course of business. Trade payables are recognised at fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost until settled. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability 
once approved by shareholders. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation 
arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at their net proceeds as an 
approximation of fair value and subsequently carried at amortised 
cost. When cash flows can be reliably measured, any transaction 
costs, premiums or discounts are capitalised and recognised over 
the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest rate 
method. When cash flows can not be measured reliably, or in the 
event of early repayment, transaction costs, premiums or discounts 
paid or unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
Pensions 
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Group’s 
personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year in 
which they fall due.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments  
and changes in actuarial assumptions of the defined benefit  
scheme are recognised immediately as a charge or credit in other 
comprehensive income for the period in which they arise with a 
corresponding increase in the pension surplus or deficit. These  
re-measurements are not reclassified to the income statement  
in subsequent periods. Past service costs, current service costs, 
curtailment or settlement gains or losses and net interest income  
or expense are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
opening plan assets and scheme obligation. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method and applying assumptions which 
are agreed between the Group and its actuaries. 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed where there are present or 
possible obligations arising from past events, but the economic 
impact is uncertain in timing, occurrence or amount. A description 
of the nature and, where possible, an estimate of the financial effect 
of contingent liabilities are disclosed. 
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a 
contractual future obligation which has not been provided for at 
the balance sheet date, as is the case for the CLSA. Amounts are only 
provided for where such obligations are onerous. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
Where the Group’s own shares are re-purchased, the consideration 
paid is classified as treasury shares and deducted from equity. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or re-issued, any 
consideration received is included in equity.  
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based on 
reports reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to be  
the chief operating decision maker. The principal performance 
measures have been identified as net rental income and net  
asset value. 
With the cessation of The Great Capital Partnership (“GCP”)  
and the changes more widely in the business over the past twelve 
months, the chief operating decision maker has revised the 
segmental analysis. As a result of these changes, the segment 
previously called Earls Court & Olympia has been split in two:  
Earls Court Properties and Venues. Outlined below are the 
operating segments of the Group: 
– Covent Garden. 
– Earls Court Properties comprises the Group’s interests at Earls 
Court, predominantly EC1 & EC2, the Empress State Building  
and 50 per cent of the Lillie Square joint venture (previously 
Seagrave Road). 
– Venues comprises the exhibitions business including the 
Olympia property assets. 
– Other comprises the discontinued activity of GCP, the Group’s 
residual China investments, the business unit historically known  
as Opportunities and other head office companies. 
The Group’s operating segments derive their revenue primarily 
from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Venues 
whose revenue principally represents exhibition income.  
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally 
which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to 
individual segments.

6 PROFIT ON SALE OF SUBSIDIARIES 
On 9 February 2012, the Group disposed of its shareholding in The Brewery by EC&O Limited for a consideration of £2.0 million, resulting 
in a profit of £1.1 million.  
On 29 February 2012, the Group disposed of its shareholding in Covent Garden Restaurants Limited for a consideration of £1.0 million, 
resulting in a profit of £0.6 million.  
7 LOSS OF CONTROL OF FORMER SUBSIDIARY 
On 30 August 2012, the Group completed a joint venture arrangement with the Kwok Family Interests. The venture, to develop land 
interests at Lillie Square, resulted in the loss of control of the former subsidiary Lillie Square GP Limited (formerly Seagrave Road GP 
Limited), and the disposal of a 50 per cent limited partnership interest in Lillie Square LP (formerly Seagrave Road LP). Consideration 
received of £7.5 million and associated costs resulted in a net loss of £1.0 million. On the date control was lost, the 50 per cent investment 
retained was re-measured and reflected at fair value resulting in a gain on appropriation to trading property of £6.3 million.  
The disposal of the net assets of the partnership together with reorganisation of internal funding (previously fully provided by the Group 
and now reorganised to reflect the respective 50:50 partnership interests) resulted in a net cash inflow of £65.4 million. 
8 WRITE BACK OF IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER RECEIVABLES 
Following an impairment review of loan notes receivable by the Group, a write back of £2.0 million was recognised in 2013 (2012:  
£0.6 million). The write back was calculated with reference to the market value of certain property assets that the Group would have 
priority over in the event of default.

12 BUSINESS COMBINATION  
The Empress State Limited Partnership 
On 29 May 2013, the Group acquired control of the 50 per cent interest not already owned in The Empress State Limited Partnership, which 
owns and manages, through its general partner, the Empress State Building in West London. This 451,000 sq ft 31 storey office building is 
adjacent to the Group’s EC1 & EC2 interests and benefits from an index linked lease to the Metropolitan Police Authority until 2019.  
The partnership contributed revenues of £2.4 million during the period between exchange in May and completion in August, of which 
£1.2 million is disclosed as being attributable to non-controlling interests. A net profit of £1.0 million was attributable to non-controlling 
interests during this time. Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013 the Group’s revenue and the net profit would have been  
£3.1 million and £7.9 million higher respectively. The net profit amount includes revaluation gains recognised on exchange of contracts. 
On the date control was acquired, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the business combination were fair valued with resulting 
gains or losses being taken to the Group’s income statement. No deferred tax was recognised on this date because the tax base of the 
underlying asset was equal to its fair value.  
The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the business combination were as follows: 
 £m 
Non-current assets 117.0
Current assets 2.8
Current liabilities  (75.9)
Net assets acquired  43.9
Completion of the acquisition occurred on 1 August 2013. Consideration for the net assets acquired, including the non-controlling interest 
share of profits, was £45 million. Total cash paid was £50.3 million comprising both consideration and the repayment of the joint venture 
partner’s loan account. The Empress State Limited Partnership is now consolidated as a subsidiary of the Group.  
A&P Bolding Limited 
On 5 September 2013 the Lillie Square joint venture acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of A&P Bolding Limited for the purpose of 
obtaining a number of properties situated adjacent to the joint venture’s land interest at Lillie Square.  
The Group’s share of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the business combination, which represents the 
consideration paid, was as follows: 
 £m
Current assets 7.4
Current liabilities (0.1)
Net assets acquired 7.3
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013, there would have been no material impact on either the Group’s revenue or profit. 
13 DISCONTINUED OPERATION 
On 29 April 2013, the Group exchanged contracts for the disposal of the final asset, Park Crescent West, in The Great Capital Partnership 
(“GCP”). This was effected as part of the Group’s strategy to dispose of non-core assets in support of the Group’s core estates and, as a 
result, the partnership has been presented as a discontinued operation with comparatives re-presented accordingly. GCP was established 
as a joint venture in 2007 with Great Portland Estates plc, to own, manage and develop a number of central London properties.  
The partnership has been accounted for as a joint venture of the Group and has been proportionately consolidated in accordance  
with the Group’s published accounting policy. 
The Group’s share of results and residual net assets of GCP which have been included in the income statement and balance sheet, were  
as follows:

Tax arising on items recognised in other comprehensive income is also reflected within other comprehensive income. This includes 
deferred tax on an element of the pension movement. Tax arising on items recognised directly in equity is reflected in equity.  
This includes deferred tax on an element of the share-based payment. 
Further amendments to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2013 Budget which included changes to the main 
rates of UK corporation tax. The main rate of corporation tax decreased from 24 per cent to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013, and will reduce 
further to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014, and 20 per cent from 1 April 2015. 
15 PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF CAPITAL & COUNTIES PROPERTIES PLC 
Profit after tax of £6.7 million was attributable to the shareholders of the Parent Company for 2013 (2012: £5.0 million). No income 
statement or statement of comprehensive income is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 Companies Act 2006.

1 Gain on valuation recognised in the income statement within gain on revaluation and sale of investment and development property. This gain is unrealised and relates to assets 
held at the end of the year. 
2  In respect of the transfer value of Earls Court Properties, further details are disclosed in note 7. 
3 The value of trading property carried at net realisable value was £39.1 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: £1.8 million). 
4 Included within investment and development property is £0.8 million (2012: £2.6 million) of interest capitalised during the year on developments in progress. 
5 The unrecognised revaluation surplus on trading property is shown for informational purposes only and is not a requirement of IFRS. Trading property continues to be 
measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value in the consolidated financial statements. 
At 31 December 2013, the Group was contractually committed to £105.9 million (2012: £21.4 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Refer to note 35 for further 
information on capital commitments. The fair value of the Group’s investment, development and trading property as at 31 December 2013 
was determined by independent, appropriately qualified external valuers Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties (excluding the 
Empress State Building) and Venues; and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Group’s investment, development and trading 
property. The valuations conform to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation Professional Standards. Fees paid  
to valuers are based on fixed price contracts. 
Each year the Investment Director, on behalf of the Board, appoints the external valuers. The valuers are selected based upon their 
knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group. 
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Group’s portfolio. At each reporting  
date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. Valuers submit and 
present summary reports to the Group’s Audit Committee, with the Investment Director reporting to the Board on the outcome of each 
valuation round. 
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition. The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent  
or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs 
including any site specific costs (for example section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, 
planning and construction timelines, lease regear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar 
properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development are considered. 
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. When considering the highest and best use a valuer will 
consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable. Where the 
highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing  
this change in arriving at its valuation.  
A number of the Group’s properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use. 
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties the Group’s interests at EC1 & EC2 have been valued on the basis of a mixed use, residential  
led scheme. The properties are currently used as exhibition venues, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to 
achieve the change in use is being implemented. Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have  
been valued on the basis of their development potential, principally for the conversion of existing use to residential use or for improving 
the configuration of retail units.  
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based  
upon assumptions of capital and rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the 
development. Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developer’s profit before arriving at a valuation. 
The valuer has applied this methodology to derive a residual land valuation of the Group’s interests at EC1 & EC2 on the basis of a 
standalone development of these interests. 
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets. 
The most significant of these occur when planning permission or lease extension and renegotiation of use are required (as is the case 
currently regarding the Empress State Building and EC1 & EC2 respectively) or when a credit facility is in place. These restrictions are 
factored into the property’s valuation by the external valuer. Also see disclosures surrounding development risks on page 15. 
   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 108 
18 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED 
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment, development and trading property held by the Group, are required 
to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted. The different valuation levels are defined as: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets. 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly 
or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices. 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. 
All investment, development and trading properties held by the Group are classified as Level 3. When the degree of subjectivity or nature 
of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between fair value levels is deemed to have occurred. 
Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer between Level 3 and Level 2. The following tables set out 
the valuation techniques used in the determination of fair values on a property by property basis, as well as the key unobservable inputs 
used in the valuation models.

Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leasehold interests in investment and development property. Certain leases provide for payment of 
contingent rent, usually a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the minimum lease payments above. 
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.

29 OPERATING LEASES 
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases. 
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of five  
to 15 years at market rent with provisions to review every five years.  
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Group’s operations: market risk (including interest rate risk, and market price 
risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of 
Directors. The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are  
summarised below. 
Market risk 
(a) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. 
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest 
rates. Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas 
borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.  
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives. Swaps have the economic 
effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate 
paid at the collar’s ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor. Interest rate swaptions provide the 
Group with the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap on a specific future date at a set rate. 
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn borrowings profile of the Group:

Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 374.2 – 348.0 –
Interest rate protection 100% 100.0%
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent. 
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective is 3.2 per cent (2012: 3.6 per cent).

30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement in 
fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of £6.2 million (2012: £9.8 million). The 
approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement in fair 
value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of £6.2 million (2012: £9.8 million). In practice, 
a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely. However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect 
from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents management’s assessment of possible 
changes in interest rates. Because the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term floating rate debt, such a 
movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall. 
(b) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group does not have significant foreign exchange exposure. 
(c) Market price risk 
The financial results are subject to movements in the value of underlying investment and development properties, interest rates and 
economic sentiment. 
A one per cent increase in the valuation of investment and development property would increase the valuation of investment and 
development property in the consolidated income statement by £20.5 million. A one per cent decrease in the valuation of investment and 
development property would decrease the gain on revaluation of investment and development property in the consolidated income 
statement by £20.5 million.  
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.  
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Group’s operational requirements and investment 
commitments.  
The Group’s treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities. 
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entity’s ability to meet the relevant facility’s 
financial covenants. The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.  
The Group’s policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing 
risk. The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost. 
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the 
regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted 
maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk. This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the  
desired refinancing. 
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to 
make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those 
implied by the par yield curve.

30 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk arises primarily 
from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Group’s undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits 
and loans with financial counterparties.  
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously 
monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default. 
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial 
information. As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2013 is  
£4.2 million (2012: £3.1 million). 
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is the Group’s policy to calculate any impairment 
specifically on each contract. 
In relation to the Group’s exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full. Additionally, specific provisions  
are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns. The amounts of trade 
receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. 
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: 
Group  
2013  
£m 
Group 
2012 
£m
Up to 90 days 5.5 8.4
Over 90 days 0.3 0.4
Trade receivables 5.8 8.8
In 2013 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of £0.1 million (2012: £0.1 million). This is considered to be an immaterial 
amount and within budgeted levels given current economic conditions. 
Also included within receivables are £6.0 million (2012: £4.0 million) of loan notes. All loan notes have been reviewed for potential 
impairment and the carrying values at year end are deemed to be recoverable. 
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury. Relationships are 
maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit 
ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA).  
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by 
managing the capital structure. The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity 
capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.  
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio. The Group aims 
not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent. These are 
discussed in the financial review on pages 36 to 41.

Fair value estimation  
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The different levels are defined as follows: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets. 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly 
from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices. 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. Valuations at this level are more subjective and 
therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models. Such testing has not indicated that any 
material difference would arise due to a change in input variables. 
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs change, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between  
fair value levels is deemed to have occurred.

flows to the net present values.

All of the Group’s Level 3 financial instruments are unlisted equity investments. The valuation of the available-for-sale investment is based 
on expected cash distributions to be received from China Harvest Fund 1 with reference to the market value of the underlying assets held.  
31 DEFERRED TAX PROVISION 
The decreases in corporation tax rate referred to in Note 14 have been substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ and 
therefore have been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of the realisation of deferred tax. 
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the 
properties’ original tax base cost. Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief, the Group’s holding structure and  
the application of the REIT provisions to disposals occurring 2 years or more post exit (7 May 2012). The Group’s recognised deferred tax 
liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is £3.1 million as at 31 December 2013 (2012: £1.8 million).  
The Group’s contingent tax liability which is calculated on the same basis as the IAS 12 liability above is £nil (2012: £nil) after allowing  
for loss relief.  
A disposal of the Group’s trading property at their market value as per note 18 would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 
£16.1 million (23.3 per cent of £69.2 million).

35 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
At 31 December 2013, the Group was contractually committed to £105.9 million (2012: £21.4 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Of the £105.9 million 
committed, £29.5 million is committed 2014 expenditure. The Group’s share of joint venture commitments included within this  
amount was £1.9 million (2012: £0.2 million).  
In November the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to LBHF’s land 
interest within the Earls Court Masterplan. Under the terms of the CLSA, the Group can draw down land in phases but no phase can be 
transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession is given of the 
phase. The Group has already paid £30 million of the £105 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA. Independent of the  
land draw down process, exercising the option commits the Group to the payment of the residual £75 million which is yet to be paid.  
This is expected to be settled in five annual instalments of £15 million starting on 31 December 2015.  
36 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
Under the terms of the CLSA the Group has certain compensation obligations relating to achieving vacant possession, which are subject  
to an overall cap of £55 million. Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations, they will be deducted from the total 
consideration payable to LBHF (see note 35 ‘Capital Commitments’ above). 
In March, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West London Line 
where it runs within the ECOA. Within the terms of the agreement, during the next 50 years the Group can exercise options for further 
999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development within the Earls Court Masterplan. Network Rail  
is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be payable at the time of development or disposal  
of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan. In addition, the Group has certain obligations to Network Rail to make contributions to a 
sinking fund in respect of the maintenance of the existing platform above the West London Line which would be triggered by any future 
demolition of the Earls Court exhibition halls. 
As at 31 December 2012 the Group had no contingent liabilities.

1 The Directors of Capital & Counties Properties PLC have been determined to be the only individuals with authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling  
the activities of the Company.  
During 2012 GCP disposed of a portfolio of properties to Great Portland Estates plc, the Group’s joint venture partner, a related party. 
Consideration of £135.0 million (Capco share) was received in cash. The market value of these properties at date of disposal was  
£124.4 million (Capco share). 
In September 2012, the Company completed a placing of 68.4 million new ordinary shares at a price of 218 pence per share. Blackrock 
Investment Management (UK) Limited, a related party controlling more than 10% of the voting rights in the company, subscribed for  
13.2 million shares. 
40 DIRECTORS’ EMOLUMENTS 
The details of individual Directors remuneration and pension benefits as set out in the tables contained in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 62 to 81 form part of these financial statements.  
41 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives. All schemes are equity 
settled, as such the cost recognised relates to the fair value of equity instruments determined at the grant date of the instruments.  
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are 
expected to vest. 
Reconciliations of movements in incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 124 to 126. 
1. Performance Share Plan 
Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the Capital 
& Counties Properties PLC Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
Exercise is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant.  
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: 
(a) the Group’s Total Return (“TR”) over three consecutive financial years (the TR Performance Period) relative to the median of the TRs 
over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc,  
Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc (the Comparator Group); and  
(b) the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over a period of three years (the TSR Performance Period) relative to the median of 
the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group. 
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.  
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR 
performance period. In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be  
added back.  
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested  
in ordinary shares.  
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 65, 74 and 75. 
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of 
underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2013 124 
41 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 
1. Performance Share Plan (continued) 
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased  
to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.  
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group (whether to replace a removed member or otherwise) if it  
believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group. 
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. In general, options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme; therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as 
approved options. 
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2013 were exercisable between nil pence and 268.1 pence and have a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2014 and 2023.  
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of share options for the year ended 31 December 2013 was £1.7 million 
(2012: £1.8 million).

employment and satisfaction of performance conditions. 
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of deferred shares awarded under the PSP was £0.4 million (2012:  
£0.1 million). 
2. Matching Share Plan 
Under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Matching Share Plan (“MSP”), deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus.  
Awards may also be made as nil cost options.  
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that 
participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award. Awards of nil cost 
options were made in both the current and comparative periods. The fair value of share awards will be determined by the market price  
of the shares at the grant date. The average share price during the year was 308 pence (2012: 208 pence).

Under the Matching Share Plan, awards, which may be awarded as nil cost options, may also be made in respect of certain shares purchased 
by Directors or in respect of awards of the deferred shares or nil cost options described above made under the Company’s annual bonus 
scheme. The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred. In exceptional circumstances the 
matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred. 
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions. Vesting of 
matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally 
determined. The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. Full details  
of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 65, 74 and 75. 
Matching shares and matching nil cost options generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased or 
deferred shares.

The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect to the MSP was £2.5 million (2012: £0.9 million). 
The Chairman does not participate in the PSP or MSP, however for any shares purchased within 12 months of the establishment of Capco  
in May 2010 up to a value of 150 per cent of his base fee, the Company made a 1:1 matching award of deferred shares on a gross of tax basis.  
The Chairman invested more than 150 per cent of his base fee in the Company’s shares during 2010, and accordingly an award of 529,536 
deferred shares was made to him on 1 September 2010. The Chairman’s matching share award carried no performance conditions but was 
subject to him remaining in office for three years and retaining ownership of the invested shares. The shares vested in full on 10 May 2013. 
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of the Chairman’s award was £0.1 million (2012: £0.2 million). The share 
price at the date of vesting was 327.9 pence. 
42 PENSIONS 
(a) Current pension arrangements 
Earls Court & Olympia group (“EC&O”) has a hybrid pension scheme comprising an ongoing money purchase section and a final salary 
section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011. The final salary section is a funded 
defined benefit scheme (“the Scheme”) which is contracted out of State Second Pension. 
The Group’s current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements. 
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: 
1. Investment risk – the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these 
assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be 
required if deficit emerges. 
2. Interest rate risk – the Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities. 
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. 
3. Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme’s assets are 
expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging. 
4. Mortality risk – in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.

The expected return on the Scheme’s assets for 2013 was 6.8% (2012: 6.1%). The expected return on assets is a weighted average of the 
assumed long-term returns for the various asset classes. Equity and property returns are developed based on the selection of an appropriate 
risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds. Bond returns are selected by 
reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the Scheme’s holdings of these instruments. The assets do not 
include any investment in shares of the Group.

2013  
%  
(per annum) 
2012 
% 
(per annum)
Discount rate 4.4 4.1
Rate of inflation (based on the Retail Prices Index) 3.4 2.7
Increases to pensions in payment (Limited Prices Index 5%) 3.4 2.7
Increases to deferred pensions before payment 2.7 2.2
Post retirement mortality assumption (SM1 PXA CM1) 1.5 1.3
The discount rate is determined on the yield available on a high quality long dated corporate bond of appropriate term and currency.  
As a result, a discount rate of 4.4 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2013 (2012: 4.1 per cent). This is higher than the rate used in 
prior year given the changes to the yields on bonds over the current period. 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from 
time to time to reflect current trends. The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA, CMI 
(150%), and Year of Birth. The table makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each member. 
 2013  2012
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:  
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 45): Male 89.9 89.0
 Female 92.4 91.2
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 65): Male 87.7 87.2

The Group has no significant exposure to any other post-retirement benefit obligations. 
The estimated contribution expected to be paid to the Scheme during 2014 is £0.9m (2013: £nil). 
(ii) Defined contribution arrangements 
The pension charge in respect of other schemes is the actual contributions paid. These amounted to £0.7 million (2012: £0.6 million). 
43 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD 
On 5 February 2014, the Board of Transport for London (“TfL”) approved a proposed arrangement with the Group relating to the land 
currently occupied by the Earls Court exhibition centres. The proposed arrangement would establish a venture that would be granted  
999 year leases over this land (and certain adjacent interests, the most significant of which is the Northern Access Road), this venture  
would be owned 63 per cent by the Group and 37 per cent by TfL. Legal documentation is being finalised. 
On 21 February 2014, a £665 million five year unsecured revolving credit facility was signed to replace the Group’s existing Covent Garden 
facilities. The Group will incur an exceptional charge of approximately £12 million relating to fees on the new facility and unamortised 
fees on the existing facilities; as well as approximately £18 million relating to the termination of derivative financial instruments.

Dividends 
 
 
 
The Directors of Capital & Counties Properties PLC have proposed  
a final dividend per ordinary share (ISIN GB00B62G9D36) of  
1.0 pence payable on 19 June 2014.  
Dates 
The following are the salient dates for payment of the proposed 
final dividend: 
Annual General Meeting 2 May 2014
Sterling/Rand exchange rate struck 8 May 2014
Sterling/Rand exchange rate and dividend amount  
in Rand announced 9 May 2014
Ordinary shares listed ex-dividend on the JSE, 
Johannesburg 19 May 2014
Ordinary shares listed ex-dividend on the London 
Stock Exchange 21 May 2014
Record date for final dividend in UK and South Africa 23 May 2014
Dividend payment date for shareholders 19 June 2014
South African shareholders should note that, in accordance with 
the requirements of Strate, the last day to trade cum-dividend  
will be 16 May 2014 and that no dematerialisation of shares will be 
possible from 19 May 2014 to 23 May 2014 inclusive. No transfers 
between the UK and South Africa registers may take place from  
9 May 2014 to 23 May 2014. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer an optional 
scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2013 final dividend.  
The above dates are proposed and subject to change. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Information for South African Shareholders: 
The final cash dividend declared by the Company will constitute a 
dividend for Dividends Tax purposes. Dividends Tax will therefore 
be withheld from the amount of the final cash dividend which  
is paid at a rate of 15 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies for  
an exemption and the prescribed requirements for effecting the 
exemption, as set out in the rules of the Scrip Dividend Scheme,  
are in place. 
It is the Company’s understanding that the issue and receipt of 
shares pursuant to the scrip dividend alternative will not have any 
Dividends Tax nor income tax implications. The new shares which 
are acquired under the scrip dividend alternative will be treated as 
having been acquired for nil consideration. 
This information is included only as a general guide to taxation  
for shareholders resident in South Africa based on Capco’s 
understanding of the law and the practice currently in force.  
Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position  
should seek independent professional advice.

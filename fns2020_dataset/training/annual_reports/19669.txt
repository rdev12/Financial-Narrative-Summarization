Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Key points in this section:
 – Organic sales increased by 
2% to £667 .2 million*
 – Adjusted operating profit 
increased by 4% at constant 
currency to £152.4 million* 
 – Un f a v o ur a b le c ur r e n c y 
movements reduced sales 
and operating profit by 4%
 – Adjusted operating profit 
margin improved to a record 
22.8%
 – Increase in the total Ordinary 
dividend of 7% to 69.0p 
per share
Adjusted operating profit increased by 
4% at constant currency to £152.4 million. 
Profit was strongly ahead in  
Watson-Marlow. In the steam specialties 
business, there was good progress at 
constant currency in EMEA, largely offset 
by a reduction in Asia Pacific; the Americas 
was flat. Unfavourable currency movements 
reduced Group operating profit by 4%, 
leaving reported profit broadly flat compared 
with operating profit of £153.0 million in 
2014. The adjusted operating profit margin 
improved by 40 bps at constant currency, 
to a record 22.8%.
Net finance costs reduced from £3.0 million 
to £1.5 million but the total income from 
Associates reduced from £1.2 million to 
£0.2 million due to the sale in March 2015 
of our investment in India, ahead of the 
start-up of our wholly owned direct sales 
operation. The Group adjusted pre-tax 
profit was therefore £151. 1 million, 4% 
ahead at constant currency. Adjusted basic 
earnings per share was ahead 2% at 142.6p 
(2014: 140.4p) and was up 6% at constant 
currency, in part due to the number of 
shares in issue being reduced by 3.6% 
with effect from 15th June 2015, following 
the special dividend and associated share 
consolidation of 28 existing Ordinary shares 
into 27 new Ordinary shares.
The pre-tax profit on a statutory basis was 
£139.7 million (2014: £144.8 million) and 
includes a number of non-operational items 
explained more fully in Note 2. The statutory 
basic earnings per share was 129.9p 
(2014: 132.8p).
Cash and dividends
Cash generation was robust, with very 
good cash conversion and we finished the 
year with net cash of £5 million, despite the 
payment of £91 million on 15th July 2015 in 
respect of the special dividend for 2014 of 
120p per share.
The interim dividend for 2015, which was 
paid on 6th November 2015, was raised 
by 6.7% to 20.8p per share (2014: 19.5p 
per share). The Board is recommending 
an increase in the final dividend of 7 . 1% to 
48.2p per share (2014: 45.0p), with a total 
of £35 million payable on 27th May 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 29th April 
2016. The total Ordinary dividend for the 
year, subject to approval by shareholders 
at the AGM on 10th May 2016 of the final 
proposed dividend, is therefore 69.0p per 
share, an increase of 7 .0% over the 64.5p 
per share for the prior year. The proposed 
dividend is in line with the Group’s dividend 
policy, which is to progressively increase 
the dividend to appropriately reflect the 
underlying trading performance, the 
maintenance of a healthy dividend cover, 
the level of cash generation and the capital 
requirements of the business.
Governance and Board  
changes 
In October 2015, we announced that David 
Meredith will retire at the conclusion of 
the AGM on 10th May 2016 after nearly 
24 years as Group Finance Director and 
after a total of 27 years of service to the 
Group. On behalf of our shareholders 
the Board acknowledges with gratitude 
the significant contribution to the Group’s 
growth and prosperity made by David over 
multiple economic cycles. During his time 
with the Company, David’s knowledge 
and experience have been instrumental 
in helping to guide the business through 
significant changes and challenges, earning 
him the highest respect from shareholders, 
the Board and colleagues. We understand 
David’s desire to step down after such a 
long and successful period of service and 
wish him the very best in this new chapter 
of his life.
“I am pleased to report a solid set of results in 
2015 against a background of progressive 
deterioration in the rate of global industrial 
production growth.”
Bill Whiteley 
Chairman
Performance
Organic sales increased by nearly 2% 
to £667 .2 million. Additional sales from 
acquisitions were broadly matched by 
a reduction from the disposal of M&M 
International (M&M) in the period, with a net 
contribution of 0.5%. Currency movements 
were again unfavourable, reducing sales 
on translation by 4%, leaving reported 
sales down 2% compared with sales of 
£678.3 million in 2014. We achieved strong 
9% organic sales growth in our  
Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group 
(WMFTG or Watson-Marlow) spread across 
all regions, while the Spirax Sarco steam 
specialties business was flat, with progress 
in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 
and the Americas offset by a decline in 
Asia Pacific.
*  Unless otherwise stated, all profit measures exclude 
certain non-operational items, as set out and explained 
in the Financial review and in Note 2 on page 130.

Signed by:
Bill Whiteley 
Chairman
on behalf of the Board of Directors 
2nd March 2016
As previously announced, we are pleased 
that Kevin Boyd will join the Company on 
1 1th April 2016 and succeed David as 
Group Finance Director and Executive 
Director on 1 1th May 2016. Kevin is both 
a Chartered Accountant and a Chartered 
Engineer and is currently Group Finance 
Director of Oxford Instruments plc, the 
leading provider of high technology 
instrumentation, with sales broadly spread 
around the world across a number of 
sectors and listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. He is a highly experienced 
Finance Director with a strong international 
track record. Previous experience included 
Group Finance Director of Radstone 
Technology plc and before that he held 
senior ﬁnance positions with TI Group (now 
Smiths Group plc). Kevin is a Non-Executive 
Director of EMIS Group plc.
During the year an independent Board 
effectiveness review was undertaken by 
Dr Long CBE of Boardroom Review Ltd. 
Following this review, we have placed 
increased emphasis on Board succession 
planning to ensure the Board is refreshed 
in accordance with the Code. By starting 
this work now, we will achieve a phased 
approach for the succession of key roles 
over the next few years, with adequate 
handover periods to ensure a smooth 
transition. We are committed to appropriate 
engagement with shareholders throughout 
the process.
Employees
On behalf of the Board, I thank all our 
employees in the 57 countries around the 
world in which we have a direct presence. 
Our strategy for growth recognises that 
people are our most important asset 
and through their dedication, hard work 
and personal advancement, we achieve 
success for all stakeholders in the business.  
We value and celebrate the individual 
contributions to the solid results in 2015.
Prospects 
Steam as a heat source, and niche pumps 
and associated ﬂuid path technologies, 
are widely used across different industry 
sectors, geographic regions and customers. 
This leads to our markets being strongly 
inﬂuenced by the level of industrial 
production and changes in its rate of growth 
during the year, with a typical time-lag of a 
few quarters. Global industrial production 
growth progressively slowed from mid-2014, 
reaching no growth by the end of 2015, with 
the deceleration noticeably more marked 
in emerging markets. The likely path of 
global industrial production growth remains 
uncertain, with successive projected upturns 
being continually pushed back.
We have historically outperformed our 
markets, increasing sales ahead of 
general market growth, whilst exhibiting 
considerable resilience in more difﬁcult 
economic conditions. Our strategy 
is focused on self-generated growth, 
to reduce our reliance on the market. 
Our strategic initiatives are targeted at 
increasing the effectiveness of our highly 
trained direct sales force, broadening our 
geographic presence, leveraging our new 
product development and optimising our 
supply chain. We are investing resources 
into these strategic priorities and developing 
a more sector-aligned organisation.
In 2016, we will beneﬁt from the full-year 
effect of the actions taken in 2015 to reduce 
costs and will reinvest these beneﬁts in 
the execution of our strategy for growth, 
including the creation of the new Spirax 
Academy. If recent exchange rates prevail 
for the remainder of the year, sales will 
increase by 3% on translation into sterling 
compared to 2015.

Our customers: The value we add:
Where is steam used?
Steam is widely used across a diverse range of industries and 
in most manufacturing processes for heating, curing, cooking, 
cleaning and drying. Industries using steam in this way include 
Food & Beverage, Pharmaceutical & Biopharmaceutical,  
Oil & Petrochemical, Chemical, and Pulp & Paper.
Steam is also widely used in hospitals and buildings for space 
heating, humidiﬁcation and sterilisation, and to provide a reliable 
source of hot water at a constant temperature. 
How our products, solutions and  
services beneﬁt our end users
Why is steam used?
Steam is a preferred heat transfer ﬂuid in most industrial 
processes because of its high energy content (steam can hold ﬁve 
or six times as much energy as an equivalent mass of water). 
Steam is highly controllable and can be generated at high 
pressures to give high temperatures. Temperature can be 
controlled throughout a steam system by controlling pressure.
Steam is a highly efﬁcient heat transfer medium. When steam 
reaches the point of use, the condensation process efﬁciently 
transfers heat to the product being heated. 
Steam can surround or be injected into a product being heated. 
It can ﬁll any space at a uniform temperature and will supply 
heat by condensing at a constant temperature; eliminating 
temperature gradients.
Steam can be easily and cost effectively distributed to the point of 
use because it naturally ﬂows from high to low pressure, meaning 
that costly circulating pumps are not required. 
Steam is clean, sterile, non-hazardous and environmentally 
sound, and water is relatively inexpensive and plentiful. 
Steam is convenient; it can be used for multiple purposes on a 
site from process applications, to space heating, sterilisation or 
hot water generation.

Spirax Sarco engineered solution reduces steam system 
pressure to help Spanish brewery improve beer quality, 
increase productivity and lower costs
Compañía Cervecera de Canaris (CCC), 
part of the SABMiller Group, is a large 
Spanish based brewery. Located in the 
Canary Islands, the company produces 
its own beer brands Dorada and 
Tropical, and under licence Carlsberg, 
as well as distributing several other well-
known brands. 
Within the brewing process, boiling the 
wort is a crucial stage that serves various 
functions including sterilisation, the removal 
of volatile materials, concentration of the 
wort and reduction of pH levels. Hops are 
also added to the wort during boiling, which 
takes place in large stainless steel “kettles”. 
Boiling lasts approximately 60-90 minutes 
and is monitored by measuring the 
evaporation rate, which should be no more 
than 4% per hour for optimum beer quality. 
CCC was experiencing instability in 
the production process with periods of 
excessively vigorous wort boiling, resulting 
in evaporation rates of 7%. These periods 
of overheating and excessive boiling 
caused sugars within the wort to burn and 
caramelise, darkening the wort, affecting 
its flavour and resulting in product spoilage. 
The caramelised sugars coated the heating 
surfaces, increasing the frequency of shut 
down for cleaning and reducing productivity.
An expert sales engineer from  
Spirax Sarco, with extensive experience 
within the Brewing industry, was asked 
to identify the cause of heating instability 
and to design a solution. He found that 
the steam, at 5.5 bar(g) pressure, which 
was being used to heat the kettles, was 
regulated by a control valve that opened 
at a fixed rate, allowing steam at a higher 
pressure than required to heat the kettles.
Spirax Sarco designed a bespoke pressure 
control loop for installation before the 
process equipment. The engineered 
solution enables the steam system to 
self-regulate the pressure, and hence the 
temperature, of the steam to an optimum 
level prior to it reaching the kettles. 
The solution also included steam flow 
metering equipment to monitor steam use 
and efficiency, as well as various ancillary 
products such as thermodynamic steam 
traps and pipeline connector steam trapping 
stations to optimise steam system efficiency.
In addition to designing and commissioning 
the solution, Spirax Sarco ensured that 
heat transfer is optimised by testing the 
steam in accordance with steam sterilisation 
standard EN285, to confirm steam 
dryness and incondensable gas content is 
satisfactory for the application.
Following the installation of the engineered 
solution from Spirax Sarco, the wort 
evaporation rate was reduced to less than 
4%, improving beer quality and brewery 
productivity, and reducing product spoilage. 
Maintenance downtime has been reduced 
by 90%, energy use has fallen by 20% 
and steam consumption and costs have 
also been reduced. In addition, better 
steam system metering has improved 
steam consumption knowledge, allowing 
more accurate steam cost assignation, 
and facilitated the customer’s ability to test 
different steam conditions to identify the 
most efficient conditions for boiling the wort.
Key customer benefits
 – Improved beer quality
 – Increased productivity from 
lower evaporation rates, 
reduced product spoilage and 
less maintenance downtime
 – Reduced energy use, steam 
consumption and lower costs Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Hygienic applications
In peristaltic pumps the pump does not touch the ﬂuid, making 
them ideal for hygienic applications where clean ﬂuids must not be 
contaminated. A sterile tube makes a sterile pump.
Watson-Marlow pumps and ﬁlling machines are widely used in the 
Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical, and Food & Beverage industries.

Single-use applications
Single-use is a growing trend in the Biotechnology and 
Pharmaceutical industries. Our cleanroom manufactured 
products reduce risk of contamination, enable the manufacture 
of single-use assemblies and improve the ease of our end users’ 
validation processes.
Dirty applications
In peristaltic pumps the ﬂuid does not touch the pump, making 
them ideal for dirty or abrasive ﬂuids – such as slurries, pigments, 
chemicals and efﬂuent – which would contaminate or damage other 
pump types. 
Our high performance tubing offers excellent long-term 
performance as it is variously designed for resistance to chemicals, 
abrasive ﬂuids and oils, greases or detergents.

asepticSU™ single-use technology, from Watson-Marlow 
Fluid Technology Group, eliminates the need for cleaning 
validation and simplifies traceability at Cancer Research’s 
research unit in Hertfordshire, UK.
A Cancer Research facility in Hertfordshire, 
UK, is among a growing number of clinical 
trial sites that have adopted asepticSU™ 
single-use fluid path technology from 
Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group. 
Used in conjunction with two of our Flexicon 
FP50 automated filling and stoppering 
machines, asepticSU™ has helped the 
charity’s Biotherapeutics Development Unit 
(BDU) to eliminate the need for cleaning 
validation and simplified traceability of 
applied product contact components. 
The BDU is an important facility in which 
the development and production of novel 
“Investigational Medicinal Products” 
for Phase 1 clinical trials takes place. 
Deputy Production Manager, John Emerson 
explained, “Put simply, we are a clinical trial 
supply unit within the charity, and we have 
our own filling lines in a sterile environment. 
As a result, exploiting the benefits of 
disposable, single-use technology such 
as asepticSU™ made perfect sense.”
Single-use technology transforms the way 
filling lines are used, ensuring systems are 
kept clean and free from contamination. 
Sterility is guaranteed as all parts are 
provided to the customer double bagged 
and pre-sterilised using a validated gamma 
irradiation process. This eliminates the 
need for costly laminar air flow assembly 
areas, autoclaves and labour for the 
on-site assembly and sterilisation of filling 
accessories. Once the filling process 
is complete, users simply remove the 
asepticSU™ unit and replace it with a 
new one for a sterile, contamination-
free changeover.
At the centre of asepticSU™ is  
Watson-Marlow’s Accusil platinum 
cured silicone tubing, the only silicone 
tubing optimised for Flexicon fillers. 
Engineered specifically for post-irradiation 
dispensing stability and manufactured in 
Watson-Marlow’s ISO 14644-1 Class 7 
certified cleanroom, under tight tolerances, 
Accusil is also post-cured for lowest 
extractables and features laser etched lot 
data. Importantly, the tubing helps to ensure 
superior filling accuracy of ±0.5%, thereby 
preventing costly overfilling. 
Pumping accuracy is essential. “We fill 
vials between 2 and 50ml, although 5ml 
is probably our most common size,” said 
Mr Emerson. “A batch is usually 5 or 10 
litres, which means filling 1,000 or 2,000 
5ml vials. It is important we don’t overfill.”
Watson-Marlow’s understanding 
of the unique requirements of the 
Biopharmaceutical industry and ability to 
advise on and provide appropriate and 
sterile single-use products along the fluid 
path, were central to Cancer Research’s 
decision to purchase the asepticSU™ 
technology. 
“Thanks to the adoption of asepticSU™ 
we have benefited in a number of ways 
from its inherent design characteristics,” 
confirms Mr Emerson. “As the liquid being 
filled is not in contact with any mechanical 
parts, permanent pipework or the external 
environment, there is no risk of cross-
contamination. In terms of traceability, all 
of the documentation is provided with the 
validation pack from Watson-Marlow, which 
makes our job much simpler. We order 
using a single part number, which simplifies 
inventory management, and the system 
arrives pre-configured so we are ready 
to go. Everything is fully integrated with 
standard connections, so set-up time is 
virtually zero.”

Q:
 
 What do you expect to 
happen to industrial 
production growth rates?
Prospects for global industrial production 
are uncertain, following successive periods 
where projected improvements have been 
pushed back. However, we will be focusing 
on realising the benefits of our strategy, with 
emphasis on self-generated growth.
Q:
 
 Are you affected by low 
oil price?
Whilst the price of oil may influence the cost 
of energy to our end users, the correlation 
between the price of oil and our sales 
is relatively weak as payback on energy 
cost savings is only one of a wide range of 
motivations for customers to trade with us. 
Our direct sales business model means 
that our sales engineers work closely 
with end users to identify improvements 
to their steam systems, and peristaltic 
pump and associated fluid path systems. 
Typical benefits, other than energy savings, 
include reduced carbon emissions, water 
savings, productivity improvements, 
efficiency improvements, reduced costs and 
regulatory compliance. While lower energy 
prices will increase the payback period 
on some projects, the productivity and 
process improvements that our solutions 
offer still provide significant incentive for our 
customers to buy from us.
Our markets:  
top line growth
Our closeness to our customers ultimately helps to insulate the Group from 
much seasonal and cyclical demand.
Some frequently asked questions: 
Q:
 
 What is your view on global 
industrial production 
growth rates?
Our businesses serve very diverse markets 
across a wide range of different industries, 
geographic regions, customers and 
products. As steam and pumps are so 
widely used across many applications, our 
markets broadly reflect changes in global 
economic conditions and, in particular, 
movements of industrial production 
growth rates. 
Global industrial production growth, which 
we typically lag by a few quarters, has 
progressively slowed over the past year to 
currently very low levels. At the end of 2015, 
year-on-year industrial production growth 
was around zero, with a decline in non-
OECD markets. The slowdown in industrial 
production growth has been particularly 
marked in China and other emerging 
markets where we have long had a strong 
presence, with recessionary conditions in 
Latin America and Russia. This slowdown 
has also been evident in the developed 
markets of North America and Europe, 
although industrial production growth rates 
in the latter have been relatively stable albeit 
at levels of growth of less than 1%. 
1. Our long-term market growth drivers remain positive
Population growth
Increased consumption and demand in all our major 
industry sectors
Ageing population
Increased demand for healthcare and pharmaceutical products
Increase in global energy consumption
Increased investment in the Oil & Petrochemical industry and 
demand for energy management solutions
Economic development in emerging markets
New markets and increased consumption
National and international climate change 
mitigation strategies
Requirement for companies to manage energy more efficiently, 
increasing demand for energy management products 
and services
Industrial production
As steam and pumps are so widely used across industry, 
our markets reflect changes in industrial production but our 
sales have consistently outperformed our markets as we have 
expanded our addressable market, extended our geographical 
penetration and grown our market share
For more information about our risks  
see pages 32–33
For our Viability statement  
see page 111
While the impacts of the low oil price are 
relatively muted, we are not immune. 
During 2015 we saw a negative impact in 
Korea and Canada in particular, as well as 
Brazil and China, for different local reasons. 
Overall, we estimate that the weaker Oil 
& Petrochemical sector and lower energy 
prices reduced our sales growth rate by 
around 1% during 2015.
Q:
 
How confident are you of 
achieving future growth?
We are confident in our ability to grow, 
despite the difficult global trading 
conditions, for the following reasons:
1.  Long-term market drivers remain positive 
for global industrial production growth.
2.  Lower levels of large project work are 
largely offset by growth in our day-to-day 
business, reflecting increased demand 
from end users’ replacement and 
maintenance spending, from which we 
derive a large proportion of our revenues 
and better margin business.
3.  A large proportion of Group revenue 
is derived from defensive, less 
cyclical industries.
4.  We remain focused on staying close 
to our customers and targeting self-
generated growth opportunities which 
come from our ability to identify our 
end users’ unrecognised needs, solve 
their difficult challenges, which many 
suppliers cannot, and gain market share 
by winning new installations that then 
become the base for future revenue. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

sterilising. Our pumps and 
associated equipment are 
used to meter ingredients, 
deliver food to process lines 
and treat process waste.
Beverage 
Steam is essential for brewing 
and distilling processes. 
It is used to protect product 
quality and ﬂavour, and ensure 
compliance with industry 
standards. Pumps are 
used to transfer fruit, juice, 
concentrates, yeast and 
other additives. 
Pharmaceutical & 
Biopharmaceutical
Clean steam reduces the 
risk of product and process 
contamination, and our 
peristaltic pumps, valves 
and single-use components 
enable precise ﬂow 
control and ﬂuid isolation 
in the Pharmaceutical and 
Biopharmaceutical industries.
OEM Machinery 
Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs) are 
companies that build and 
supply machines for use in 
industry. Our activities with 
OEMs vary from simple 
product supply to advising 
on machine performance 
improvements and process 
plant design. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

“Last year we extensively reviewed, revised and 
presented the Group strategy. During 2015 we 
remained focused on implementing our strategy 
for growth across the Group.”
Nicholas Anderson 
Group Chief Executive
Self-generated growth
Our six Group strategic themes reflect the 
key elements of the Spirax Sarco steam 
business strategy, the Watson-Marlow Fluid 
Technology Group strategy, and the Group 
acquisitions strategy, which are summarised 
on the following page. The objective of 
our strategy is to deliver self-generated

To accomplish this, we are focusing on 
our strategic themes, which are designed 
to increase the effectiveness of our direct 
sales organisation, leverage our strengths 
in key sectors, take advantage of the 
most attractive opportunities, expand our 
addressable markets and align and direct 
our resources more effectively to improve 
business performance. 
Through implementing our strategy we 
are further strengthening our direct sales 
business model and enhancing our ability 
to self-generate growth, which we achieve 
as we work closely with our end users to 
identify their unrealised needs and provide 
products and solutions to solve their difficult 
operational challenges.

Deﬁnition
Organic revenue growth measures the change 
in revenue in the current year compared with 
the prior year from continuing Group operations. 
The effects of currency movements, acquisitions 
and disposals have been removed.
Progress in 2015
Organic sales increased by 2%. The strongest 
growth was again in Watson-Marlow where we 
achieved growth in all geographic regions. Organic 
sales in the steam specialties business were ﬂat; 
we achieved continued modest sales growth in 
EMEA and made a small advance in the Americas 
but organic sales were lower in Asia Paciﬁc.
Link to remuneration   
Revenue growth is a key driver of proﬁt 
generation and a central element in the annual 
planning process. Bonus targets are driven off 
annual plans and therefore revenue growth drives 
a key measure of variable remuneration.
Link to remuneration   
Group operating proﬁt is the other key element of 
the annual planning process. Bonus targets are 
driven off annual plans and therefore proﬁt is a 
key measure of variable remuneration.
Link to remuneration   
Executive Directors’ variable remuneration is 
measured on two main indicators: proﬁt and 
ROCE. Operating proﬁt margin is a key driver of 
both proﬁt and ROCE.
Deﬁnition
Adjusted operating proﬁt is the proﬁt earned from 
our business operations before interest, taxes, 
the share of proﬁt of Associate companies and 
certain non-operational items.*
Progress in 2015
Adjusted operating proﬁt was 4% ahead at 
constant currency. Watson-Marlow again 
performed strongly and in the steam specialties 
business, proﬁts grew by double-digits at 
constant currency in EMEA, the Americas was 
ﬂat and Asia Paciﬁc registered an operating proﬁt 
reduction at constant currency.
Deﬁnition
Operating proﬁt margin is deﬁned as adjusted 
operating proﬁt expressed as a percentage 
of revenue.
Progress in 2015
The operating proﬁt margin expanded to a record 
22.8%, beneﬁting from the modest sales growth, 
the focus on price management, efﬁciency gains 
and cost savings actions, particularly in the UK and 
USA early in 2015, and a second year of broadly 
ﬂat costs for materials. Business mix was generally 
favourable across the steam specialties business.

Link to remuneration   
ROCE is a key measure in Executive Directors’ 
annual bonus arrangements.
Link to remuneration   
EPS measured over three-year periods is one  
of the two components of the Performance 
Share Plan.
Link to remuneration  
The safety of our employees is central to the 
sustainability of our business and has an impact 
on the ﬁnancial success and proﬁtability of the 
Group, creating an indirect link with Executive 
Directors’ variable remuneration.
Deﬁnition
ROCE is a pre-tax measure of the efﬁciency 
with which the Group generates operating 
proﬁts from its capital. ROCE is calculated as 
adjusted operating proﬁt divided by average 
capital employed.
Progress in 2015
ROCE edged lower to 44.1% due to a 90 bps 
impact from our start-up in India. Excluding this, 
ROCE improved by 70 bps reﬂecting our close 
control of the various components of capital 
employed and improvement in the operating 
proﬁt margin.
Deﬁnition
Earnings per share is a measure of the proﬁt 
performance of the Group, taking into account 
the equity structure. EPS is deﬁned as the 
adjusted after-tax proﬁt attributable to equity 
shareholders divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue.
Progress in 2015
Basic earnings per share increased by 6% at 
constant currency, beneﬁting from the higher 
pre-tax proﬁt, small reduction in the tax rate and 
a reduction of 3.6% in the number of shares in 
issue from 15th June 2015, following the share 
consolidation in conjunction with the special 
dividend paid in July 2015.
Deﬁnition
The number of work-related accidents that 
resulted in over seven days of absence per 1,000 
employees. For an accident to be considered 
“work-related” the machinery, plant, substances, 
or equipment being used; the way the work was 
carried out; or the condition of the site, must have 
played a signiﬁcant role.
Progress in 2015
Our over seven day lost time accident rate 
fell signiﬁcantly to 3.3 accidents per 1,000 
employees, a 38% improvement, reﬂecting a fall 
in the total number of accidents to 16  
(2014: 26). The improved performance follows 
increased focus on H&S and proactive 
management of H&S risks.

Strategic Report
Our strategy in action
In this section we demonstrate how we are implementing and making 
progress against each of our six strategic themes.
1
Increase direct sales effectiveness through  
sector focus
Why we are focusing on this
It is not our products alone that provide value to 
customers. The extensive application and systems 
knowledge of our direct sales and support people 
is at the heart of our Customer Value Propositions. 
Through expanding the sector focus of our direct sales 
force we will enhance our Customer Value Propositions 
and increase our sales effectiveness.
How we are doing it
We have identified several priority industries, such as 
Food & Beverage, Healthcare and Oil & Petrochemical, 
to act as a focus for investment and sales force 
sectorisation. Our priority industries have been chosen 
for their potential return on investment and for our 
already strong competitive position within these markets. 
We are also increasing our focus on thermal energy 
management within those priority sectors, with the goal 
of making our Spirax Sarco steam specialties business 
the customers’ first choice provider for steam solutions 
and thermal energy management.
In practice
Spirax Sarco Mexico sectorises its sales force
Until recently, Spirax Sarco Mexico’s sales and service 
engineers worked geographically across five regions. 
During 2015 the company completed an extensive 
reorganisation and sectorisation of its sales force. 
The process began with a comprehensive analysis of 
steam users and market segments by a wide range of 
factors including geographical location, market size and 
sales. The optimum number of sales engineers required 
to effectively address each market sector was identified, 
analysis of the sales force was undertaken to determine 
how each sales engineer could be utilised most effectively, 
the sales force was restructured and weekly training 
sessions established to deepen the sector specific 
knowledge of the sales engineers. Sectorisation of the sales 
force has already seen results, with segment specialists 
offering improved customer service and sales in target 
industries growing.
Results to date
 – Approximately a quarter of Spirax Sarco operating 
companies completed the sectorisation of their 
sales force during 2015 
 – £1.6 million investment approved to consolidate 
the manufacture of “clean steam” products in a 
state-of-the-art, ISO 14644-1 Class 7 cleanroom 
facility in Cheltenham, UK 
Next steps
 – Continue to implement sales force sectorisation 
across our businesses
 – Complete the “clean-steam” manufacturing facility 
to enhance our manufacturing capability, widen 
our product offering and provide a showcase 
for customers from the Food & Beverage, 
Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology industries  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

2
Develop the knowledge and skills of our expert  
sales and service teams
Why we are focusing on this
Continually improving the competency, technical skills 
and in-depth application knowledge of our sales and 
service engineers is central to our direct sales business 
model. Understanding our end users’ processes and 
applying appropriately engineered solutions to their 
steam or niche pumping problems are pivotal to our 
business success. Through continually investing in the 
professional development of our people, we develop a 
level of expertise that is unrivalled by our competitors.
How we are doing it
We train our customer facing employees in our 48 
state-of-the-art training centres located around the 
world, most of which are equipped with live steam or 
pumping installations that facilitate hands-on training. 
Our engineers also undergo extensive on-the-job training 
and mentoring. We have developed a wide range of 
training materials and tools that are internet-based and 
available through our training centres, to facilitate the on-
going professional development of all our engineers.
In practice
Spirax Sarco Malaysia opens new state-of-the-art training centre
During 2015, Spirax Sarco Malaysia opened a new state-of-
the-art training centre, equipped with live steam installations. 
The training centre is now being used to further develop the 
expertise of our sales engineers and other customer facing 
employees, as well as providing training to our end users’ 
technical and maintenance staff. 
The training centre, which is part of a new office and 
warehouse complex, was opened by Nicholas Anderson 
(pictured centre) on 24th June. The fit out of the four-storey 
building, which also includes offices, a warehouse and a 
cafeteria, was project managed by Ciara O’Sullivan (pictured 
left), during a six month overseas secondment as part of her 
two-year sponsored graduate placement with Spirax Sarco. 
Following the success of her secondment, Ciara has now 
secured a permanent position with the Company. 
Identifying and recruiting high calibre employees and then 
developing their skills is a core component of our strategy 
for growth.
Results to date
 – New training centres opened in Malaysia, 
the Philippines and France during 2015
 – 40 new or upgraded courses added to our 
e-learning library during 2015
 – Spirax Sarco recognised for excellence at 2015

Broaden our global presence
Why we are focusing on this
Our strong global presence is a result of decades of 
investment in building easily recognisable brands that 
symbolise expertise and reliability. We achieve a first-to-
market advantage from early entry into new markets and 
profit from the growth opportunities that the emerging 
markets represent.
How we are doing it
Our strong infrastructure around the world is enabling 
us to branch into neighbouring markets. We generally 
enter new markets through establishing a direct sales 
presence in the country through the creation of a sales 
office or the installation of one or more sales engineers. 
Occasionally, we purchase our distributor to allow 
us a foothold in an emerging market. Leveraging our 
existing strong infrastructure, we are also pioneering 
the introduction of Watson-Marlow into much of the 
developing world, demonstrating the superior technology 
and lower life-cycle costs of peristaltic and niche pumps.
Results to date
 – Four new Spirax Sarco steam specialties 
operating units commenced trading during 2015 
in Egypt, Peru, India and Colombia 
 – Three new Watson-Marlow operating units 
commenced trading during 2015 in Japan, T aiwan 
and Chile 
 – A Spirax Sarco direct sales presence established 
in the Ivory Coast and Algeria
Next steps
 – Continue to identify geographical markets that 
provide opportunities to expand our global presence
 – Increase Spirax Sarco sales coverage in India
 – Increase Spirax Sarco presence in North Africa and 
the Middle East
 – Continue to broaden the presence of  
Watson-Marlow in Asia Pacific and the Middle East
In practice
Spirax Sarco commences direct sales in India
During 2015 our Spirax Sarco steam specialties business 
commenced direct selling in a newly established, wholly 
owned operation in India, following the sale of our 49.3% 
interest in our Associate company Spirax Marshall in 
March. We are constructing a world-class manufacturing 
plant, warehouse, sales offices and state-of-the-art training 
facilities in Chennai, which are due for completion in Q2 
2016, and have established two further regional sales 
offices in Mumbai and Delhi. We currently employ around 
40 people, including sales and service engineers, and are 
actively strengthening this team in line with business growth. 
By establishing a direct sales presence, and manufacturing 
and holding stock locally, we have created the flexibility 
required to take advantage of the good medium 
and long-term growth prospects in this important 
developing economy.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Leverage our R&D investments
Why we are focusing on this
Our ability to deliver an increasingly wider range of 
solutions to reduce energy and water usage, lower plant 
emissions and improve plant productivity and efficiency, 
rests with our commitment to new product development. 
We believe that investing in R&D is crucial to the long-
term sustainability and success of the Group. 
How we are doing it
We have increased our R&D investments in recent years 
and will leverage these investments to generate sales 
growth, with shorter time-to-market of new products and 
solutions in such areas as thermal energy management, 
controls, condensate management and new pumping 
technologies and systems. Product development 
will increasingly be aligned to sector requirements. 
Where appropriate, we will look to make acquisitions in 
related areas that deliver new products and technologies 
and expand our addressable markets.
Results to date

In practice
Spirax Sarco receives a Queen’s Award for Enterprise in Innovation
During 2015 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc received a 
Queen’s Award for Enterprise in Innovation – the UK’s 
highest accolade for business success – for the design 
and manufacture of a novel flowmeter.
The Spirax Sarco TVA flowmeter is a revolutionary 
alternative to traditional steam flow measurement, 
combining reliable, accurate and cost-effective steam

Optimise supply chain effectiveness
Why we are focusing on this
Our direct sales business model, with extensive product 
ranges and short order books, requires a regional 
manufacturing strategy with plants throughout the 
world to optimise customer service and minimise costs. 
Through optimising effectiveness, we are developing 
our entire supply chain to enhance product availability, 
increase flexibility, reduce costs and improve service 
levels in support of sales growth.
How we are doing it
We have strategically located our manufacturing 
plants in Europe, North America, Latin America and 
Asia, to optimise supply chain efficiency. During 2014 
we appointed a Group Supply Chain Director to 
provide management across the supply chain, identify 
inefficiencies, share best practice and better align our 
manufacturing and sales organisations. During 2015 
we further expanded the Group Supply Chain function, 
adding a Group Supply Chain Sourcing Manager and a 
Group Supply Chain Operations Manager.
Results to date
 – Supply Chain Strategy launched, focused on 
delivering excellence in our supply chain
 – “Demand driven planning” systems deployed; 
strong improvements in delivery performance and 
inventory optimisation
 – Supply chain agility actions delivered, compressing 
lead times and enabling greater responsiveness
Next steps
 – Continue to execute our Supply Chain Strategy
 – Further strengthen our supply chain community, 
delivering greater synergy and effectiveness
 – Deliver continuous improvement across all 
Operational Excellence metrics
In practice
Global Excellence in Manufacturing, Watson-Marlow tubing manufacture
Global Excellence in Manufacturing (GEM) is  
Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group’s way of working, 
our operating system, the way we manage our operations 
and our daily work. It brings together best practice in 
manufacturing from within and outside the Group and 
drives continuous improvement across the supply chain. 
GEM is focused on meeting the needs of our customers 
and is people driven. It is process orientated, data led and 
supportive of sustainable growth. GEM improvements can 
either be individual bright ideas which are reviewed, agreed 
and implemented, or larger business led projects requiring 
capital expenditure. Since 2012, GEM has resulted in over 
£1 million of savings, added nearly 15,000 hours to capacity, 
improved customer service and increased sales.
For example, pump roller press automation at our Falmouth 
site reduced the length of time required to assemble 1,000 
rollers from three hours to 20 minutes. This created over 
500 hours of extra capacity in labour savings during 2015.

Operate sustainably and help improve  
our customers’ sustainability
Why we are focusing on this
Sustainability is at the core of our business operations, 
driving our strategy to innovate and manufacture 
products that improve the sustainability and 
competitiveness of our customers’ operations, while 
improving our own operational efficiency, reducing our 
environmental impacts and improving the quality of life 
of our employees, their families and the communities 
in which we operate. In a resource constrained and 
competitive world we have an obligation to create a 
more sustainable way of life and to ensure the long-term 
sustainability of our business.
How we are doing it
Our approach to sustainability encompasses five primary 
areas of emphasis: our workplaces, our supply chain, 
our environment, our customers and our communities. 
Through setting strategic objectives in each of these 
areas we are continuously improving our sustainability 
and the sustainability of our customers’ processes 
and operations.

Group Chief Executive’s report
“The Group achieved another solid financial result in 
2015, demonstrating the continued strength and 
resilience of our strong direct sales business model.”
Nicholas Anderson 
Group Chief Executive
Key points in this section:
 – Considerable progress in our 
strategy for growth
 – Background of slowing 
industrial production growth 
rates and currency headwinds
 – Organic sales increased by 
2%, continued strong growth 
in Watson-Marlow
 – Adjusted operating profit 4% 
ahead at constant currency
 – Reinvesting cost saving 
benefits in the execution of our 
strategy for growth
Introduction
The Group achieved another solid financial 
result in 2015, demonstrating the continued 
strength and resilience of our strong 
direct sales business model, achieved 
against the background of a progressive 
slowing in global industrial production 
growth to very low levels and also further 
currency headwinds. Additionally, we 
made considerable progress in our 
strategy for growth, continued our market 
development, took actions to improve 
efficiency and reduce costs, opened 
six new geographic sales companies, 
completed five acquisitions and made two 
strategic disposals.
Our direct sales approach in both our 
steam specialties and Watson-Marlow 
businesses, through our team of over 1,300 
highly skilled and experienced sales and 
service engineers, is effective in uncovering 
opportunities to improve customers’ steam 
systems and fluid path processes. This 
“self-generated” element to our business, 
combined with the high proportion of sales 
that derive from end users’ maintenance 
and operating budgets, makes our business 
highly resilient, especially in the difficult 
market conditions we have seen in many 
markets this year. Importantly, our sales and 
service engineers generate solutions for 
customers’ problems and deliver benefits to 
end users in the shape of reduced energy 
usage and lower CO 2 emissions, water 
savings, increased productivity, improved 
quality, better reliability, reduced costs, 
reduced chemical use and enhanced 
regulatory compliance.
Strategy implementation
Effective implementation of our strategy 
for growth has been a priority through the 
year and in 2016, we will be reinvesting the 
benefits from our cost reduction actions into 
the execution of our strategy. Our strategic 
objective is to outperform our markets by 
delivering self-generated growth, which 
we achieve through focusing on our six 
strategic themes:
•  increase direct sales effectiveness 
through sector focus;
•  develop the knowledge and skills of our 
expert sales and service teams;
•  broaden our global presence;
•  leverage our R&D investments;
•  optimise supply chain effectiveness; and
•  operate sustainably and help improve our 
customers’ sustainability. 
Notable progress in implementing our 
strategy has been made in:
•  intensifying, expanding and accelerating 
the training and development of our 
sales engineers to ensure that we are 
even more effective in identifying and 
generating opportunities to improve 
customers’ steam systems and niche 
pumping systems. In particular, work 
commenced on the creation of a new 
Spirax Academy that in 2016 will be the 
centre for the global training, mentoring 
and development of our employees, 
commencing with our direct sales force;
•  the refinement and implementation of 
Customer Value Propositions to ensure 
that we adequately anticipate and meet 
the requirements of customers;
•  delivering a greater sector focus on 
selected target industries, particularly 
in Food & Beverage, Healthcare, Oil 
& Petrochemical, Chemical and OEM 
customers, with appropriate sectorisation 
that will be an on-going feature for 
many years;
•  increasing the focus on attractive 
product areas, including controls and 
thermal energy management;
•  continued innovative product  
developments
•  ensuring we have the correct structure, 
resources and skills to improve the 
effectiveness of our end-to-end 
supply chain;
•  continued geographic expansion, 
with six new direct sales companies  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

established in the year, including a major 
strategic investment in India; and
•  continuing to improve our sustainability 
practices, including reducing our global 
carbon emissions by 13% in 2015.
We have concentrated on the alignment 
of the entire organisation behind our 
strategic themes. Improvements have 
been made to our health and safety 
management processes, and our risk 
management processes have also been 
enhanced and integrated further into the 
everyday business.
Market environment 
Steam is used in a huge range of 
manufacturing processes for heating, 
curing, cooking, drying and cleaning, 
across a diverse range of different 
industries, including Food & Beverage, 
Pharmaceutical, Oil & Petrochemical, 
Chemical and Pulp & Paper. Steam is also 
used in hospitals and buildings for space 
heating, humidification and sterilisation, and 
to provide a reliable source of hot water at 
constant temperature. Likewise, peristaltic 
and niche pumps are also used across a 
wide range of similar industries to address 
difficult pumping problems. This wide 
spread of industry sectors and relatively 
large proportion of revenues that derive 
from end users’ maintenance and operating 
budgets, means that our markets tend to 
track the growth in industrial production, 
although generally with a small lag of one 
or two quarters. Our exposure to large 
capital projects is limited, accounting for 
approximately 15% of our revenues, with 
a higher concentration of these projects 
in emerging markets. Overall, there was 
a further small decline in this segment of 
the market due to delays in approval and 
delivery of projects, and generally fewer 
projects undertaken by customers.
As we have previously noted, the impact 
on our business from the sharp fall in the 
price of oil is relatively muted but we are not 
immune, having seen a negative impact in 
Korea and Canada in particular, as well as in 
Brazil and China for different local reasons. 
Overall, we estimate that the weaker Oil 
& Petrochemical sector and lower energy 
prices, reduced Group sales growth by 
around 1% in 2015.
Global industrial production growth rates 
started to ease from the middle of 2014 
and have progressively slowed through 
2015, ending the year at virtually a global 
standstill. This has happened across all 
geographic regions, with emerging markets 
seeing the sharpest deceleration in industrial 
production growth.
In EMEA, industrial production growth 
slowed only modestly in 2015 and has been 
relatively stable since the Spring, although 
at low levels of growth of less than 1% 
overall. This includes a sharp deterioration 
in economic conditions in Russia, a 
slowing trend to zero growth in the UK but 
increasing industrial production growth in 
France, Italy and Spain, albeit following at 
least two years of decline in each case.
Asia Pacific has experienced a marked 
slowdown in industrial production growth 
driven by a strong deceleration in China 
as well as an industrial recession in South 
Korea. Elsewhere, market conditions have 
been mixed but with good economic 
growth in India.
In the Americas, industrial production 
growth slowed markedly and unexpectedly 
in the USA and Canada from the healthy 
pace seen in 2014. South America remained 
in an industrial recession throughout the 
year, with a deteriorating position in the 
largest market in Brazil. We have strong, 
long-standing businesses across Latin 
America with local manufacturing that has 
helped to insulate us against the impact 
of currency weakness but we are not 
immune from the severe economic turmoil 
in the region.

Strategic Report
Group Chief Executive’s report continued
achieved continued modest sales growth in 
EMEA and we made a small advance in the 
Americas but organic sales were lower in 
Asia Pacific, mostly due to Korea, although 
China was marginally ahead.
Group sales at £667 .2 million were 
down 2% at reported exchange rates 
(2014: £678.3 million), with unfavourable 
currency movements reducing sales on 
translation by 4%, due to the weakness of 
the euro, again compounded by significant 
currency weakness in a number of 
emerging markets. This was mitigated by 
the benefit to sales on translation from the 
strength of the US dollar and Chinese RMB 
against sterling. Currency movements have 
been quite volatile for some time, making 
projections increasingly uncertain. However, 
if recent exchange rates prevail for the full 
year, sales in 2016 would be 3% higher 
on translation into sterling compared to 
2015, with the benefit from the weakness 
of sterling being mitigated by the further 
weakness in a number of emerging 
market currencies. Sales of the five small 
acquisitions during the year were partially 
offset by the disposal of M&M, leaving a 
small net contribution to sales of £3 million 
or around 0.5% of sales growth. The effect 
of these in 2016 would be a similar small net 
contribution to sales growth.
Watson-Marlow, which accounted for 
23% of Group revenues, grew sales by 
10% at reported exchange rates and by 
13% at constant currency, including a 4% 
contribution from the three acquisitions 
completed during the year. Growth was 
achieved across all geographic regions, with 
the strongest growth in EMEA followed by 
the Americas. We benefited from positive 
conditions in our key Biopharmaceutical 
market, our strongly sector focused sales 
approach, sales of innovative new products 
and good traction from the successful 
integration of acquisitions in recent years.
In our steam specialties business, which 
accounted for 77% of Group revenues, 
organic sales were flat overall. At reported 
exchange rates, sales were down 5% due 
to unfavourable currency movements that 
reduced sales by 4% and a small impact 
from the disposal of M&M. We again saw 
a small decline in large project sales but 
made gains in our strategic target industries 
and product groups. Our business remains 
very resilient, reflecting the high proportion 
of sales that are derived from our end 
users’ operating and maintenance spend. 
Geographically, in EMEA we achieved 
a modest organic sales increase, with 
widespread gains and strong progress in 
a number of our smaller markets but with 
a decline in Russia. In the Americas, the 
small sales advance was due to progress 
in Latin America, despite the economic 
difficulties, with a modest 2% decline in 
organic sales in North America, although 
with an improving trend in the USA in the 
second half-year. In Asia Pacific, organic 
sales were lower, mostly due to Korea 
where sales were down for the year against 
a very good performance in 2014; sales 
in China were marginally ahead, with 
industrial overcapacity reducing the level of 
project work.
Group adjusted operating profit of 
£152.4 million was 4% ahead of the prior 
year at constant currency. The operating 
profit at reported exchange rates was 
almost flat as the negative impact of the 
weakness of the euro and a number of 
emerging market currencies was only 
partially offset by the relative strength 
of the dollar. Watson-Marlow again 
performed strongly and in the steam 
specialties business, profits grew by 
double-digits at constant currency in EMEA, 
the Americas was flat and Asia Pacific 
registered an operating profit reduction at 
constant currency.
The Group operating profit margin 
expanded to a record 22.8% (2014: 22.5%). 
We continued to benefit from overall 
broadly flat material and component input 
costs, whilst increasing resources to

improve our purchasing processes and 
coordination across the Group. Actions to 
reduce costs in our steam specialties UK 
manufacturing plant were taken in Q1 
generating a modest net benefit to profit 
in 2015, with a full-year effect in 2016. 
We have continued to make investments 
to implement our strategic themes in the 
areas of sales force development, market 
development and product development 
but have exercised tight control over costs 
in the face of the progressive slowing in the 
rate of overall global industrial production 
growth. In addition, we have borne costs 
of approaching £2 million to establish our 
new wholly owned direct sales operation in 
India that commenced trading in July 2015. 
Our usual seasonal second half-year profit 
bias was accentuated by the cost reduction 
benefits coming through as the year 
progressed and the shipment of the normal 
backlog built up in the first half-year. In 2016, 
we will be increasing investment in the 
implementation of our strategy for growth, 
reinvesting the benefits from our cost saving 
actions in 2015.
Market outlook
We have made good progress in 
implementing our strategic themes across 
our two businesses, which we expect to 
enhance our growth prospects, facilitating 
self-generated growth and making us less 
reliant on external market conditions.
Global industrial production growth 
slowed progressively through the year, 
with successive projected improvements 
being continually pushed back. At the 
end of 2015, year-on-year global industrial 
production growth was around zero, with 
a decline overall in non-OECD markets. 
Prospects for global industrial production 
growth in 2016 are uncertain but we will 
be focusing on realising the benefits from 
the implementation of our strategy, with 
the emphasis on self-generated growth. 
We have a strong direct sales business 
model, which combined with a large 
proportion of our revenues being derived 
from end users’ maintenance and operating 
budgets, gives us a high degree of resilience 
in difficult economic conditions. We have 
continued to invest in our business for the 
long term and remain confident that the 
improvements we have made, and continue 
to make to our business, will enable us to 
outperform our markets and deliver benefits 
to all stakeholders.

Market overview
Overall industrial production growth in 
EMEA was lower in 2015 than in 2014, 
although it remained positive throughout 
the year at very low levels of growth. 
In our larger markets, industrial production 
growth slowed quite sharply in the UK 
and Germany but accelerated in France, 
Italy and Spain. Russia, which accounts 
for around 1% of steam business sales, 
was in an industrial recession throughout 
the year reﬂecting the impact of sanctions. 
Markets in Eastern Europe were more 
positive but in our smaller markets in the 
Nordic area and in Africa, conditions were 
mixed. Project business was again lower, 
due to a decline in larger projects, with 
delayed decision making by customers.
Progress in 2015
In EMEA, organic sales grew by over 2% 
to £219.4 million. Currency movements 
were very unfavourable impacting sales 
on translation by 8% reﬂecting the euro 
weakening by 10% against sterling and

2015 reduced sales by 1%, leaving reported 
sales down 7% from the £236.2 million 
in 2014. Sales were ahead in virtually all

in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, with 
good growth in South Africa, Turkey and 
our recently established operation in the 
Netherlands. The UK could not repeat the 
growth achieved over the two prior years 
and sales were modestly down as sales to 
the NHS declined sharply. Business levels 
were down in Russia, reflecting lower sales 
into the Food & Beverage and Chemical 
sectors in particular. Our new operation in 
Egypt made a very positive start.
Our businesses performed well in 2015 
and overall operating profit was ahead 
1 1% at constant currency to £42.7 million. 
We benefited from the higher sales, which 
included continued price management 
actions, and costs were closely controlled 
whilst continuing to invest in our strategic 
themes. Operating profits increased at 
constant currency in virtually all operations 
and were well ahead in South Africa, 
Turkey, Benelux and the Middle East. 
We took action early in the year to cut 
costs in our manufacturing operation in 
the UK. Headcount was reduced by 8% at 
a cost of £1.0 million, yielding annualised 
savings of £2.2 million from the start of 
the second quarter. The net benefit in 
2015 was therefore £0.6 million, which 
positively impacted profit in the second 
half-year, with a further year-on-year benefit 
in 2016. Overall, material costs were 
subdued and operational improvements 
resulted in increased efficiency and lower 
costs, including reduced energy costs 
from the Combined Heat and Power 
plant that came on stream at the start 
of the year. In addition, service levels 
increased and stock levels were reduced. 
Profits from our manufacturing operations 
in Europe were overall ahead, despite a 
fall in demand on our factories in Europe. 
Unfavourable currency movements reduced 
operating profit by 16%, including both 
translation and a significant exchange 
transaction effect in our European 
companies from purchases of product 
from our UK manufacturing plant. This was 
reflected in an overall decline of 7% in 
profit from the prior year’s £45.9 million at 
reported exchange rates. The operating 
profit margin for EMEA at 19.5% 
(2014: 19.4%) was slightly ahead, despite 
the significant currency impact, as a result of 
the many operational improvements.
Strategy update
We have been very active in EMEA 
progressing many aspects of strategy 
deployment. Our young operating 
companies in the Netherlands and the 
Middle East performed well, as did our 
new operation in Egypt, with further market 
developments at an advanced stage for 
2016. The development of the knowledge 
and skills of our direct sales force was 
a particular focus, in preparation for the 
introduction of the new Spirax Academy. 
Good progress was made in our strategic 
sectors of Food & Beverage, Healthcare, 
Chemical and OEM, as well as in the on-
going process of sectorisation of our sales 
teams. Improvements were made in the 
management of health and safety, with a 
resultant significant reduction in lost time 
accidents. Strategic developments in our 
supply chain included improvements to the 
process for the introduction of new products 
to reduce time to market, increased 
resources to drive improvements in 
purchasing, planning and supply chain, and 
better stock quality management leading to 
increased delivery performance and lower 
inventory levels. All these changes underpin 
our strategic drive to generate more of our 
own growth and to outperform our markets.
Outlook
Our markets remain challenging, with 
industrial production growth rates 
overall positive, although at very low 
levels of growth. We are not assuming 
any meaningful improvement in market 
conditions but remain well-placed to 
capitalise on any pick-up in market 
sentiment. We have a robust business 
model, a diverse spread of end markets 
and good exposure to some of the more 
resilient sectors such as Food & Beverage. 
We remain positive and are confident 
that our strategy will continue to identify 
opportunities for growth. 2016 will also 
benefit from the full-year effect of the cost 
savings in the UK from the headcount 
reductions and one-off costs in early 2015. 
We will continue to carefully balance the 
investment in strategic initiatives with close 
cost control.

Market overview
The slowdown in industrial production 
growth in the second half of 2014, 
continued through 2015. There were 
pockets of industrial production growth in 
some of our smaller markets but overall 
conditions were dominated by the industrial 
recession in Korea and the well-publicised 
slowdown in China, driven by excess 
capacity in many sectors. Project business 
in the region, especially large projects, was 
well down on the prior year with project 
postponements reﬂecting the more difﬁcult 
investment climate in many Asian markets, 
including in the Oil & Petrochemical and 
Palm Oil sectors, and also in Food & 
Beverage and in hospitals, many of which 
are state owned. Against this background, 
our focus switched, with good effect, to 
generally smaller self-generated projects 
and end user maintenance work, and we 
noted an encouraging stabilisation in overall 
demand in the second half of the year. 
Pricing was reasonable in most markets 
and there was no price increase in China.
Progress in 2015
Organic sales declined by 4% to 
£171.8 million reﬂecting some relative 
improvement in the second half-year, 
with a lower rate of decline than in the 
ﬁrst half-year. Sales were impacted by

project delays and we ﬁnished the year 
with a larger order book than at the end of 
2014. Exchange movements were overall 
positive, adding 1% to sales on translation 
due to the 6% strengthening of the RMB 
versus sterling, largely offset by currency 
weakness in most other smaller markets. 
Reported sales were therefore 3% below 
the prior year sales of £177 .7 million.
In China, sales and proﬁts were marginally 
ahead at constant currency. Project work, 
which historically comprised approaching 
50% of our business in China, was again 
down on the prior year but was successfully 
compensated by generating increased 
levels of smaller projects targeting process 
improvements, energy efﬁciency and 
maintenance savings for end users. 
Increasing localisation of manufacture, in line 
with our regional manufacturing strategy, 
has reduced costs and mitigated local 
wage inﬂation, also improving customer 
delivery performance which will be further 
enabled by the £13 million plant expansion 
project that is expected to be completed 
in early 2017 . We remain positive about the 
prospects for our business in China; the 
short-term economic indicators are not 
very encouraging but the move to a more 
consumer driven economic model will beneﬁt 
our key customer sectors in the longer term.
Sales were down and proﬁts somewhat 
lower in Korea, where we were unable to 
repeat the strong performance in 2014. 
As expected, the traditionally high level 
of projects in prior years, some destined 
for the oil reﬁning industry in the Middle 
East, were not sustained. This, combined 
with a small number of delayed project 
shipments, impacted sales for the year. 
The order book taken into the new year was 
consequently higher.
Elsewhere in Asia Paciﬁc, we were pleased 
with the further good progress in Japan, 
where we achieved higher sales and 
markedly improved proﬁts, despite currency 
headwinds increasing landed costs of 
imported product. This reﬂects the signiﬁcant 
investment in developing the knowledge 
and skills of our Japanese direct sales force 
over recent years. Sales and proﬁts were 
also ahead in Indonesia. In Australasia, we 
saw a decline in performance against a 
difﬁcult market background, reﬂecting lower 
government spending on hospitals and 
reduced investment in the Food & Beverage 
industry from the prolonged drought and 
global dairy prices.
Our strategically important investment in our 
new wholly owned direct sales operation 
in India took a signiﬁcant step forward and 
commenced trading from 1st July 2015, 
contributing a small amount to sales from a 
zero base. It has taken longer than expected 
to achieve all the regulatory approvals but 
good progress has been made and the 
£12 million project to create a new world 
class manufacturing plant, training centre 
and ofﬁces will be completed in April 2016. 
Pre-trading and start-up operating losses 
approaching £2 million were incurred and 
are included in the adjusted operating 
results for the Asia Paciﬁc region. 
Overall in Asia Paciﬁc, operating proﬁt 
reduced by 7% at constant currency to 
£44.7 million, with over a third of this decline 
caused by the start-up investment in India. 
As expected, the second half in Asia Paciﬁc 
showed a signiﬁcant improvement on 
the 17% proﬁt reduction in the ﬁrst half-
year, as strong cost controls enabled full 
gearing of the second half sales volumes. 
Excluding India, second half proﬁts were ﬂat 
on the prior year. Currency movements were 
overall favourable, increasing operating proﬁt 
by 4%, leaving operating proﬁt down nearly 
4% at reported exchange rates compared 
with operating proﬁts of £46.4 million in the 
prior year. The operating proﬁt margin at 
26.0% was just 10 bps lower (2014: 26. 1%), 
due to the much improved performance in 
the second half-year.
Strategy update
We continue to aggressively enter into new 
markets, with increased local sales resource 
in a number of markets including Myanmar 
and Cambodia, and a new operating 
company in Vietnam that commenced local 
direct sales on 1st January 2016. The on-
going and progressive sectorisation of sales 
teams was taken forward, with an increased 
focus on our strategic industry sectors. 
Signiﬁcant business system upgrades were 
completed during the year and supply chain 
resources added in the region, with the aim 
of increasing local product availability, cost 
effectiveness and ﬂexibility.
Outlook
Overall, industrial production growth in 
Asia Paciﬁc progressively slowed through 
2015 and the immediate future trajectory 
is uncertain, dependant in large part on 
the outlook in China, which directly and 
indirectly drives regional economic activity. 
However, we are clear that there are good 
medium and long-term opportunities that 
we are increasingly well placed to address 
through the further development of our 
direct sales business model, focus on key 
strategically important industry sectors, 
such as Food & Beverage and Healthcare, 
and improvements to our supply chain, 
combined with continued geographic 
market development.

Market overview
The healthy pace of industrial production 
growth in 2014 in North America, slowed 
markedly through 2015 reﬂecting the direct 
effects of the steep fall in oil prices, the six-
month strike in the reﬁneries and four-month 
strike in California ports, and the wider 
indirect effects on industrial conﬁdence 
in the USA and Canada of the slowdown 
in global growth. Economic conditions 
in South America were overall very 
difﬁcult for a second year, with our largest 
market in Brazil suffering a deepening 
industrial recession.
Progress in 2015
Sales in the Americas increased by 1% 
at constant currency to £123.4 million, 
with a modest 2% reduction in sales in 
North America and a 5% increase in Latin 
America. We achieved a good increase in 
our strategic focus sectors, in particular 
in Food & Beverage, largely offsetting 
weakness in our Oil & Petrochemical 
business. There were signiﬁcant currency 
ﬂuctuations in the region and an overall 
3% net reduction in sales on translation 
reﬂecting all currencies weakening 
against sterling except the US dollar, 
which appreciated 8%. In particular, the 
Brazilian real depreciated by nearly 25%

and although the average exchange rate 
for the Argentinian peso was 7% weaker 
for the year, the currency devalued by 25% 
in December 2015. At reported exchange 
rates, sales in the Americas were down 2% 
(2014: £126.2 million).
In North America, we continue to make 
good progress with the implementation of 
changes to our business that are aimed at 
strengthening our direct sales approach 
in the USA. Our more proactive sales 
resources are increasingly working with 
customers, on a sector basis, to grow the 
total market by unearthing and developing 
hitherto unrecognised opportunities to 
provide solutions for customers’ steam 
systems. We continue to support and 
develop our well-established distribution 
network, which will remain an important 
channel to the market. Sales were 2% lower, 
partly due to reduced metering business 
as part of the closure of our small EMCO 
metering manufacturing plant in Colorado 
and the reorganisation of our energy 
management and metering activities, 
where a focused, technically skilled, sales 
support and development team remains 
in place. The lower sales from distributor 
de-stocking were mitigated by success with 
key accounts. Operating profits in North 
America were modestly lower at constant 
currency, reflecting increased sales 
resources, largely offset by the metering 
unit cost savings and favourable mix.
In Latin America, our businesses performed 
well, growing sales by 5% in very difficult 
economic conditions, with all our operations 
increasing sales at constant currency 
except Brazil. As expected, the second 
half-year deteriorated in Brazil and sales 
were down mid-single digit for the year, as 
major customers froze capital expenditure, 
which we mitigated through increased 
sales in our target industries and growth in 
services. Our new operation in Colombia 
commenced trading in October, having 
acquired the steam specialties business 
of our former distributor. Our business 
in Mexico performed strongly and in 
Argentina, profits were ahead from higher 
sales into the domestic market, where 
there were a number of good project wins, 
and benefiting from dollar-based pricing. 
We completed an extension to our plant 
in Argentina and we are now well-placed 
to capitalise on our greater capacity for 
packaged solutions. Operating profits 
in Latin America were marginally ahead 
at constant currency, benefiting from 
the increased sales and close control of 
overheads in an inflationary environment.
Overall in the Americas, operating profit of 
£27 . 1 million was flat at constant currency, 
following the significant 31% profit increase 
in 2014. Currency movements were overall 
unfavourable, reducing operating profit 
by 3% at reported exchange rates versus 
£28.0 million in 2014. The operating profit 
margin was 22.0% (2014: 22.2%) reflecting 
our strategic investments and inflationary 
cost pressures in Latin America, mitigated 
by cost saving actions in the USA and Brazil 
in particular. One-off, mostly non-cash, 
closure costs of £3.8 million in respect of the 
metering unit were incurred that have been 
excluded from the adjusted operating profit 
but charged against profit in the statutory 
results for the Americas segment and 
the Group.
Strategy update
Geographic expansion has continued, with 
the creation of a new direct sales operating 
company in Peru that commenced trading 
during the year. Market development 
resources were added in Chile and also 
in Colombia, following the purchase of 
the steam specialties business of our 
former distributor. We invested significant 
time in training during the year in further 
developing solution selling and key account 
management, and in the creation of subject 
matter experts, as we focus increasingly 
sectorised sales teams on target markets 
in Food & Beverage, Buildings, Chemical, 
and Oil & Petrochemical. We have benefited 
from sharing best practice and workshops 
covering new products, including 
controls, meters and the boilerhouse. 
Improvements were made in health and 
safety processes, with a reduction in lost 
time accidents. Supply chain initiatives were 
also progressed, with an improvement in 
stock management.
Outlook
Industrial production growth in North 
America continues on a downward trend, 
as does Latin America where the industrial 
recession is deepening, especially in 
Brazil where the economy is suffering the 
fall-out from a toxic cocktail of political 
and economic events. Our focus, and the 
thrust of our strategy, is on outperforming 
our markets. We are confident that the 
significant changes being made in the 
USA and increased effectiveness of our 
direct sales approach in all markets, will 
generate additional sales growth. 2016 will 
benefit by £0.5 million from the non-repeat 
of EMCO metering losses in 2015 and 
also benefit from the many process and 
efficiency improvements. Following the 
devaluation in December 2015, Argentina 
may see a deterioration in short-term market 
conditions but could be more positive in the 
medium term.

Market overview
General economic conditions and industrial 
production growth in the various regions of 
the world were the same as for the steam 
specialties business. Our Watson-Marlow 
niche peristaltic pumps and associated ﬂuid 
path technologies business serves a diverse 
range of sectors, the largest of which is 
Biopharmaceutical that now accounts for 
almost 45% of sales. Biopharmaceutical has 
remained a good market, with continued 
investment by customers and new sales 
synergy opportunities as we have integrated 
the BioPure, Asepco and Flow Smart 
acquisitions. Food & Beverage markets 
have been positive and OEM activity 
has been strong, with a good number of 
projects won. General industrial markets 
were modestly lower, reﬂecting the slowing 
industrial production growth in most parts 
of the world. Water & Wastewater markets 
were more difﬁcult following the particularly 
strong growth in the prior year. Finally, 
Mining & Precious Metal Processing was 
also more difﬁcult against a background of 
uncertainty in the industry. Overall project 
work increased, largely through smaller 
and mid-sized projects, with a reduction in 
large project sales, particularly in Water & 
Wastewater.

Progress in 2015
Sales increased by nearly 13% at constant 
currency to £152.6 million. Organic sales 
increased by 9% and the acquisition of 
Asepco in April 2015, the Japanese PRIMIX 
business in July 2015 and Flow Smart in 
November 2015 contributed a further 4% 
to sales. Net currency movements were 
unfavourable, reducing sales by 2% on 
translation, with most currencies weakening 
against sterling, mitigated by gains from the 
stronger dollar. Sales at reported exchange 
rates were over 10% ahead of the prior year 
sales of £138.2 million. Growth was achieved 
across virtually the entire product range, 
supported by new product introductions 
over recent years. Strongest growth was 
in BioPure in its second full year in the 
Group, with expanded plant investment in 
Portsmouth installed and commissioned 
at the end of the year to increase capacity, 
followed by strong Alitea growth in the OEM 
sector and MasoSine in Food & Beverage. 
Tubing sales expanded double-digit. 
Asepco made a good first-time contribution, 
exceeding expectations, and the integration 
into the Group has progressed exceptionally 
well. The MasoSine manufacturing and 
distribution business in Japan, acquired in 
July 2015, performed well and forms the 
platform for future growth in what is an 
under-developed market for us. It is early 
days for Flow Smart, acquired in November, 
but early indications are very encouraging.
Sales growth was achieved in all geographic 
regions. Strongest growth was in EMEA 
with widespread improvements from our 
focused direct sales approach across our 
key industry sectors. Sales were well ahead 
in both developed markets, especially in 
Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, 
and in emerging markets, including Russia. 
In the Americas, our largest operation in 
the USA achieved steady growth across all 
core sectors, with the exception of general 
industrial where large projects in 2014 were 
not repeated. In Latin America, sales were 
well ahead at constant currency due to 
Mexico and Argentina; in Brazil, a decline 
in Mining and Water & Wastewater markets 
was compensated by growth in Food & 
Beverage. Organic sales in Asia Pacific were 
modestly ahead due to Korea, Malaysia and 
Singapore, and broadly flat in China due to 
fewer projects in Biopharmaceutical and 
Food & Beverage.
Watson-Marlow’s operating profit of 
£48.0 million (2014: £43.5 million), increased 
by 10% at both constant currency and at 
reported exchange rates, with exchange 
losses on translation being broadly 
matched by exchange transaction gains 
on the transfer of product manufactured 
predominantly in Europe to the USA and 
elsewhere. The operating profit margin 
edged 10 bps lower to 31.4% (2014: 31.5%), 
as we continue our strategy of investing 
in product development and market 
expansion for future growth. In addition, the 
dilutionary effect of acquisitions completed 
in 2015, as well as the expected non-repeat 
of the unusually favourable product mix 
that we saw in 2014, also contributed to the 
80 bps margin decline at constant currency. 
Strategy update
Our strategy has been consistently executed 
through the year, with progress across the 
range of strategic initiatives. The primary 
thrust of our actions is aimed at market 
development and product development, 
supported by our Global Excellence 
in Manufacturing (GEM) programme 
that is effective in delivering continuous 
improvement and cost reduction. 
Further small distributors were converted 
to direct sales across five product lines in 
six countries, increasing focus and growing 
our addressable market. Additional sales 
engineers were added to support growth 
and to develop emerging markets in 
Asia and Latin America in particular. 
New sales operations were established 
in Chile and Taiwan, and we completed 
preparations for further expansion in 
2016 in a number of other locations. 
We continue to drive a market sectorised 
approach to leverage skilled sales resources 
and detailed application knowledge. 
Product development remains a key driver 
of sales growth, as we apply carefully 
targeted and innovative products to grow 
the addressable market of our niche pumps 
and associated fluid path technologies 
and expand our market share. We very 
successfully extended the implementation 
of a global ERP solution and around 70% 
of our business is now being transacted 
through the new system. Significant effort 
has been invested in people development 
and in improving health and safety processes.
Outlook
Our markets reflect general levels of 
industrial production growth and the level 
of investment in our core focus sectors, 
in particular Biopharmaceutical, Food & 
Beverage and OEM that are expected 
to be more resilient; Mining & Precious 
Metal Processing is expected to remain 
difficult with low levels of project activity. 
We continue to generate our own 
opportunities for growth by the expansion of 
our addressable markets through product 
development, taking market share from 
other pump types, and market development, 
on a sector basis in both developed markets 
and in new markets, as we aggressively 
expand our geographic footprint.

Financial review
“A solid financial result was achieved in 2015, organic 
sales grew by 2% overall, with 9% organic growth in 
Watson-Marlow and organic sales flat in the steam 
specialties business.”
David Meredith 
Finance Director
Key points in this section:
 – The Board has proposed a 
final dividend of 48.2p per 
share, giving a total Ordinary 
dividend of 69.0p per share, 
an increase of 7%
 – Adjusted basic earnings per 
share increased by 6% at 
constant currency to 142.6p
 – Return on capital employed 
of 44. 1%
 – Robust cash generation, 95% 
cash conversion
including another strong performance 
in EMEA. Organic sales were flat in the 
steam specialties business, with a modest 
2% advance in EMEA and a small 1% 
gain in the Americas, being offset by a 
4% organic sales decline in Asia Pacific. 
There was a small net contribution to sales 
of 0.5% from five small acquisitions and 
one disposal, with a similar small full-year 
net benefit expected in 2016. Finally, the 
Group disposed of its 49.3% interest in 
our Associate company Spirax Marshall in 
India in March 2015 for £6.6 million, prior to 
establishing a wholly owned direct sales and 
manufacturing business that commenced 
trading on 1st July 2015.
Currency movements were volatile, with a 
net unfavourable translation impact on sales 
of 4%. The euro weakened 10% against 
sterling and a number of emerging market 
currencies weakened significantly, including 
the Russian rouble -32% and Brazilian real 
-24%, which were mitigated by the 8% 
strengthening of the dollar against sterling. 
In December, the Argentinian peso devalued 
by around 25%. Currency movements have 
started the new year on a more positive 
note and if recent exchange rates prevail for 
the full year, there would be a 3% exchange 
gain to sales on translation versus 2015.
Adjusted operating profit of £152.4 million 
(2014: £153.0 million) was marginally lower 
at reported exchange rates but 4% ahead 
at constant currency due to continued 
good profit growth in Watson-Marlow. 
Operating profit was marginally ahead at 
constant currency in the steam specialties 
business and 1% ahead excluding the 
impact of the disposal of M&M, with a 
strong improvement of 1 1% in EMEA, flat 
profit overall in the Americas and a decline 
of 7% in Asia Pacific. The Group benefited 
from the modest sales growth, the focus 
on price management, efficiency gains 
and cost savings actions, particularly in the 
UK and USA early in 2015, and a second 
year of broadly flat costs for materials. 
Business mix was generally favourable 
across the steam specialties business but 
in Watson-Marlow, the unusually favourable 
mix in 2014 was not repeated in 2015. 
Acquisitions contributed 4% to sales growth 
and 3% to profit growth in Watson-Marlow.
Currency movements were overall negative, 
reducing operating profit by over 4% on 
translation, with a similar pattern of impact 
as against sales. Exchange transaction 
effects broadly netted out. There were gains 
in Watson-Marlow of £1.6 million, primarily 
from the lower landed costs in the USA 
of product imported from Europe; Asia 
Pacific of £0.7 million, mainly from lower 
landed costs in China; and the Americas 
of £0.6 million, principally from gains in 
the USA and also Argentina where we 
benefit from dollar-denominated exports. 
These were offset by an unfavourable 
impact of £3.0 million in EMEA, primarily 
from the weaker euro increasing 
landed costs.
The adjusted operating profit margin 
improved to 22.8% from 22.5%.
The statutory operating profit was 
£142.8 million (2014: £148. 1 million). 
Interest
Net interest cost reduced from £3.0 million 
to £1.5 million. Net bank interest improved 
by £0.9 million, reflecting higher average 
cash balances and the benefit of a lower 
renegotiated interest margin on UK debt 
facilities. The profile of average net cash 
balances will fall in 2016 due to the full-year 
effect of the special dividend of £91 million 
paid in July 2015. Net finance costs under 
IAS19 in respect of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes reduced by 
£0.6 million to £2.3 million. It is expected 
The Group reports under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
and also uses adjusted figures where 
the Board believes that this gives a more 
representative indication of the underlying 
performance. Unless otherwise stated, 
adjusted figures are used throughout and 
exclude the amortisation and impairment 
of acquisition-related intangible assets, the 
costs of closing our metering manufacturing 
facility in the USA, acquisition and disposal 
costs and recycled exchange losses on 
the disposals of M&M and the Group’s 
49.3% interest in our Associate company 
Spirax Marshall in India, together with the 
tax effects of these items.
A solid financial result was achieved in 2015 
against the background of a progressive 
slowing in the rate of industrial production 
growth. Sales at reported exchange 
rates declined 2% to £667 .2 million 
(2014: £678.3 million). Organic sales 
grew by 2% overall, with Watson-Marlow 
registering unusually strong 9% organic 
growth, widely spread across the business,  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

that pension net finance costs in 2016 will 
be similar to those in 2015.
Associates
In March 2015, the Group disposed of its 
49.3% interest in Spirax Marshall in India, 
prior to establishing our own wholly owned 
manufacturing and direct sales company 
in India that commenced trading on 
1st July 2015. Spirax Marshall contributed 
£1.3 million profit after tax to the Group 
for the full year 2014, which reduced to 
£0.3 million for the final two months of 
trading in early 2015. We also have a 38.9% 
interest in Econotherm heat pipe technology 
business, where our share of losses 
reduced from £0.2 million to £0. 1 million, 
as we continue to make progress in 
commercialising this innovative technology. 
In total, the Group’s after tax share of 
the profits of Associates was £0.2 million 
(2014: £1.2 million).
Pre-tax profit
The adjusted profit before tax of 
£151. 1 million (2014: £151. 1 million) was 
fractionally ahead at reported exchange 
rates. Currency movements were again 
unfavourable, reducing pre-tax profit by 
£6.2 million or 4%; pre-tax profit therefore 
improved by 4% at constant currency. 
The statutory profit before tax was 
£139.7 million (2014: £144.8 million) and 
includes those non-operating items, listed 
below, that have been excluded from the 
adjusted profit:
•  a charge of £4.7 million 
(2014: £4. 1 million) for the amortisation of 
acquisition-related intangible assets;
•  acquisition and disposal costs of 
£0.8 million (2014: £0.8 million);
•  a charge of £3.8 million (2014: nil) in 
respect of the closure of our small 
metering manufacturing facility in 
Longmont, Colorado, USA; and
•  a charge of £0.3 million (2014: nil) related 
to the disposal of M&M in respect of 
exchange translation losses from prior 
years, reclassified from equity to the 
profit and loss account in the current 
period under IAS21.
Non-operating items in 2015 of a net 
£1.8 million for Associates, principally relates 
to Spirax Marshall in India, in respect of 
exchange translation losses from prior 
years, reclassified from equity to the profit 
and loss account in the current period 
under IAS21. In 2014, there was a charge 
of £1.5 million for Associates in respect 
of the amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangible assets and the impairment of 
goodwill and other assets, also in respect 
of Spirax Marshall, in India, ahead of the 
sale of the Group’s 49.3% holding in this 
Associate company in 2015.
Taxation
The tax charge on the adjusted profit before 
tax, excluding Associates’ profit (which is 
presented on an after-tax basis), edged 
lower to 29.8% (2014: 29.9%). The Group’s 
overall tax rate essentially reflects the 
blended average of the tax rates in over 40 
tax jurisdictions around the world in which 
our operations trade and generate profit. 
The Group comprises over 70, mainly small, 
operating units reflecting our local direct 
sales business model. I would anticipate 
a broadly similar tax rate in 2016 and 
future years.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased 
by 2% to 142.6p (2014: 140.4p) and by 6% 
at constant currency. Earnings per share 
benefited from a reduction of 3.6% in the 
number of shares in issue from 15th June 
2015, following the share consolidation of 
28 existing Ordinary shares into 27 new 
Ordinary shares, in conjunction with the 
120p per share special dividend paid in 
July 2015. This will have a full-year benefit 
to earnings per share in 2016. The statutory 
earnings per share was 129.9p 
(2014: 132.8p). The fully diluted earnings 
per share was not materially different in 
either year.
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 48.2p per share for 2015 (2014: 45.0p 
per share) payable on 27th May 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 29th April 
2016. Together with the interim dividend of 
20.8p per share (2014: 19.5p), total Ordinary 
dividends are therefore 69.0p per share, 
which is an increase of 7 .0% on Ordinary 
dividends of 64.5p in 2014. Our dividend 
record extends to 48 years, with a 
compound annual increase of 1 1% over 
that period; in line with the 1 1% per annum 
increase over the last 10 years.
The total dividends paid during the year 
were 185.8p or £140.3 million, including 
the special dividend of 120p per share or 
£91.0 million. This compares with 60.5p or 
£45.7 million paid in 2014.
Acquisitions and disposals
Acquisitions are an important 
complement to our strategy for growth. 
Dedicated resource is focused on identifying 
opportunities to add attractive businesses 
that closely match our strategic, industrial 
and commercial requirements. We have 
a strong balance sheet and considerable 
debt capacity, giving us significant flexibility. 
We have been active in 2015 and made 
five small acquisitions at a total cost of 
£25 million that each fulfil one or more of our 
three broad acquisition categories:
•  geographic expansion, typically through 
the acquisition of a distributor in a 
developing market;
•  products that can be integrated into our 
existing businesses; and,
•  related acquisitions that fit alongside  
our existing steam specialties and  
Watson-Marlow businesses.
On 9th April 2015, we announced the 
acquisition of Asepco Corporation for 
£7 .2 million. Asepco is a manufacturer of 
high purity aseptic valves and magnetic 
mixers for the Biopharmaceutical industry 
and advances Watson-Marlow’s fluid path 
strategy in the important Biopharmaceutical 
sector. The business is being integrated into 
the WMFTG business and has performed 
ahead of expectations since acquisition.
Valve and Control Engineering Limited 
(VCE) was acquired on 14th April 2015 for 
£0.8 million and was successfully integrated 
into our steam specialties sales business 
in the UK. Operating in Scotland, the 
business manages customers’ annual boiler 
inspections and recertifications, opening 
up a potentially interesting new stream of 
service opportunity.
On 5th July 2015, we announced 
the acquisition of the MasoSine 
manufacturing and distribution business 
from PRIMIX Corporation in Japan for 
£2.8 million. The acquisition adds new 
products, enables Watson-Marlow to initiate 
direct sales in this important market and 
provides a platform for future expansion  
in this under-developed market for  
Watson-Marlow. The business performed 
well in its first months within the Group.
On 25th September 2015, we acquired the 
distribution rights of the steam specialties 
business from Casaval S.A., in Colombia for 
£6.6 million and a further £1.9 million was 
paid for inventory. Direct sales operations 
throughout Colombia have been initiated. 
This geographic expansion of the steam 
specialties business also provides a hub 
for further developments in northern 
Latin America.
On 26th November 2015, we announced 
the acquisition of Flow Smart Inc. for  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc  
Annual Report 2015
52
Strategic Report
£5.7 million from the founding shareholder 
and partners. Flow Smart specialises in 
the design and manufacture of high purity 
sanitary gaskets, braided silicone transfer 
tubing and reinforced silicone hoses for 
the Bioprocessing and Pharmaceutical 
industries. This is a further extension of the 
WMFTG fluid path strategy and is being 
integrated into Watson-Marlow’s business.
As previously reported, on 1st March 
2015, we sold our 49.3% holding in 
Spirax Marshall, an Associate company, 
in India for £6.6 million. We subsequently 
established a wholly owned sales and 
manufacturing company in Chennai, 
India that commenced trading on 1st July 
2015 on a direct sales basis through our 
new team of sales and service engineers. 
The new purpose built manufacturing 
plant, warehouse, training centre and 
offices, representing an investment of over 
£12 million, will be completed in April 2016.
Also as previously reported, on 3rd August 
2015, we disposed of M&M International Srl 
to Rotork plc for £6.7 million. This solenoid 
and piston valve company lacked strategic 
fit with the steam specialties business.
Acquisitions in recent prior years have 
performed well, in particular BioPure 
Technology has achieved significant sales 
and profit growth following its successful 
integration into the Watson-Marlow Fluid 
Technology Group.
Research and development
The development of innovative new 
products, and getting those products to 
market faster and sold more effectively, 
is an important element of our strategy 
for growth. In our steam specialties 
business, the focus remains centred on 
developments in controls, energy monitoring 
and management, and thermal energy 
management. The development cycle is 
increasingly aligned with the priorities of our 
sales teams and larger application specific 
opportunities. We have been successful 
in securing major funding for a number of 
innovation developments through Innovate 
UK and European Horizon 2020 initiatives, 
including demonstrating a trilateral flash 
cycle for converting low temperature 
waste streams into valuable electricity, 
hollow micro-fibre heat exchangers 
and microwave-based sensors for 
steam applications.
In our Watson-Marlow niche peristaltic 
pump and associated fluid path 
technologies business, the drive is for truly 
innovative products that target attractive 
market opportunities and expand our 
addressable market by taking market share 
from other positive displacement pump 
types. Developments are being progressed 
across the product range, including tube 
and hose developments.
Overall the Group’s total investment in 
research and development was £9.9 million 
(2014: £9.6 million).
Capital employed
Total capital employed was virtually 
unchanged at £344 million. At constant 
exchange rates the increase was 3%.
Tangible fixed assets reduced by 1% at 
constant currency to £170 million due to net 
disposals during the year. Significant capital 
expenditure projects included the new plant 
at Chennai in India and the extension of 
our plant in Shanghai, China, where work 
commenced late in 2015 and is scheduled 
for completion in early 2017 .  
Watson-Marlow reached significant 
milestones, with multiple implementations 
of a global ERP solution and now 70% 
of business is being transacted through 
the new system. In the steam specialties 
UK plant in Cheltenham, a new clean 
unit to manufacture products for the 
Pharmaceutical and other clean industries 
to exacting standards is now operational. 
We generate significant cash flow and our 
first priority is to reinvest in the business, 
taking opportunities to generate good 
returns from increased efficiency, reduced 
costs and flexibility. The combined heat and 
power plant in Cheltenham, saving up to 
£1,000 per day in energy costs from early 
2015, contributed significantly to a reduction 
in our CO 2e emissions in 2015.
Total working capital increased by 8% 
at constant currency to £175 million. 
Trade receivables were 2% higher, with 
a repeat of the high level of project work 
shipped in the final two months of the year, 
particularly in Asia Pacific. Inventory levels 
were flat at constant currency as we 
continued to embed improved stock 
management techniques, optimising stock 
levels and improving customer service in 
support of sales growth. Creditors were 
lower and prepayments increased, related 
to leasehold property in China. The ratio of 
working capital to sales increased to 26.2% 
(2014: 25.0%) due mainly to the reduction in 
payables and the increase in prepayments.
Return on capital employed 
(ROCE)
This is one of our most important key 
performance indicators and forms a 
meaningful element of Executive Directors’ 
annual bonuses. ROCE encompasses 
effective management of fixed assets and 
working capital, and profitability of the 
business. ROCE edged lower to 44. 1% 
(2014: 44.3%) due to a 90 bps impact from 
the start-up of our new operation in India. 
Underlying ROCE improved by 70 bps 
reflecting our close control of the various 
components of capital employed and 
improvement in the operating profit margin.
Post-retirement benefits
The net post-retirement benefit liability under 
IAS19 was slightly lower at £73.7 million 
(2014: £75.8 million). The overall defined 
benefit obligation for all schemes in the 
Group reduced by 2%. This reflected 
small actuarial gains from changes in 
demographic assumptions and changes in 
financial assumptions, the latter essentially 
due to a slight increase in discount rates, 
which is driven by movements in AA

Corporate Bond yields, as mandated under 
IAS19. The value of assets held by the 
Group’s various defined benefit pension 
arrangements (89% of which are held in the 
main UK defined benefit pension schemes) 
declined by 1%, reflecting returns on assets 
below the scheme assumptions. The main 
UK schemes were closed to new members 
in 2001 but have remained open to future 
service accrual. These schemes continue 
to be managed under a dynamic de-risking 
strategy whereby asset and liability values 
are monitored on a daily basis by the asset 
manager and appropriate asset allocation 
decisions taken as the funding level 
improves against pre-agreed trigger points.
The last actuarial valuation of the UK 
schemes, as at 31st December 2013, was 
completed in September 2014 and showed 
those schemes to be broadly in balance. 
As a consequence, deficit reduction cash 
contributions by the Company ceased with 
effect from October 2014.
Cash flow and treasury
Cash generation in 2015 was very strong, 
driven by conversion of operating profit into 
cash, whilst continuing to invest in capital 
expenditure projects that generate good 
returns from improvements in efficiency 
and cost reduction, and in support of 
sales growth.
Cash from operations increased to 
£145.5 million (2014: £132.2 million) 
representing a 95% cash conversion. 
This good improvement reflects a small 
working capital outflow of £1.6 million 
versus an outflow of £14.5 million in 2014. 
Capital expenditure was £30.9 million 
(2014: £31.3 million) and we would expect 
capital expenditure in the current year 
to increase to around £35 million as we 
complete the new plant in India and 
progress the major expansion of our plant 
in China. Improvements to our end-to-end 
supply chain are an important element of 
our strategy and are aimed at under-pinning 
future continued strong cash generation. 
Taxation paid was £43.3 million 
(2014: £41.9 million) reflecting larger 
withholding taxes on an increased flow 
of dividends from subsidiary companies 
outside the UK. Tax paid was broadly 
in line with the tax charge in the profit 
and loss account and included tax paid 
in virtually every one of the 43 countries 
in which the Group has operating units. 
Free cash flow rose to £103.0 million 
(2014: £90.2 million), providing funds for 
dividends to shareholders and acquisitions.
Dividend payments were £140.5 million 
(2014: £45. 1 million) and reflect payment of 
the increased Ordinary dividend together 
with the special dividend of £91.0 million 
paid in July 2015. Provisions movements 
and pension deficit reduction cash 
contributions show a marked improved 
versus the prior year due to the cessation 
of pension deficit contributions to the main 
UK schemes following the triennial actuarial 
valuations completed in September 
2014. There was a net cash outflow of 
£10.2 million for acquisitions and disposals, 
comprising a cash cost of £23.6 million, 
net of an inflow of £13.3 million in respect 
of the two disposals. Shares issued under 
the Group’s various employee share 
schemes gave a cash inflow of £4.7 million 
(2014: £2.2 million).
The good free cash flow generated 
for the year, together with the opening 
net cash balance of £52.5 million, was 
therefore utilised to fund the special 
dividend and acquisitions, resulting in a 
closing net cash balance of £4.8 million 
at 31st December 2015.
The Group’s profit and loss account and 
balance sheet are exposed to movements 
in a wide range of different currencies. 
This stems from our direct sales business 
model, with a large number of local 
operating units. These currency exposures 
and risks are managed through a rigorously 
applied Treasury Policy, typically using 
centrally managed and approved simple 
forward contracts to mitigate exposures 
to known cash flows and avoiding the 
use of complex derivative transactions. 
The largest exposures are to the euro, 
US dollar, Chinese RMB and Korean 
won. Whilst currency effects can be 
significant, the structure of the Group 
provides mitigation through our regional 
manufacturing strategy, diverse spread 
of geographic locations and through the 
natural hedge of having a high proportion 
of our overhead costs in local currency in 
our direct sales operating units.
Capital structure
The Board keeps the capital requirements 
of the Group under regular review, 
maintaining a strong balance sheet to 
protect the business and provide flexibility of 
funding for growth. The Group earns a high 
return on capital, which is reflected in strong 
cash generation over time. Our first priority 
is to maximise investment in the business 
to generate further good returns in the 
future, aligned with our strategy for growth 
and targeting improvement in our key 
performance indicators. We also prioritise 
finding suitable acquisitions that can expand 
our addressable market through increasing 
our geographic reach, deepening our 
market penetration and broadening our 
product range. Acquisition targets need 
to exhibit good strategic fit and meet strict 
commercial, economic and return on 
investment criteria. Where cash resources 
exceed expected future requirements, we 
will seek to return capital to shareholders, 
as evidenced by the cash return of 
£91.0 million via the special dividend of 120p 
per share that was paid in July 2015.

“As we focus on improving the sustainability of our 
operations we reduce risk, increase resiliency and 
create opportunities for growth.”
Nicholas Anderson 
Group Chief Executive
Deﬁning sustainability
As an organisation, we believe that we have a responsibility to 
manage our social and environmental impacts, while helping our 
customers, end users and suppliers to do the same. We recognise 
that to ensure the success, and sustainability, of our business in the 
long term, we must:
 – manage our business for on-going ﬁnancial success;
 – govern our operations in accordance with all applicable laws 
and regulations;
 – take steps to minimise any negative social or environmental 
impacts of our operations;
 – strive wherever possible to have positive social and environmental 
impacts; and
 – operate ethically at all times. 
Our strategy for growth and the steps that we have taken to 
achieve on-going ﬁnancial success, are outlined throughout the 
Strategic Report, inside front cover to page 63, and our governance 
structures and operation are outlined in the Governance Report, 
pages 64 to 1 13. Throughout the Sustainability report, we review the 
actions that we have taken to manage our social and environmental 
impacts and ensure that our people act ethically. We also assess 
our performance against our sustainability strategic objectives.
Sustainability: core of our strategy for growth
Sustainability is one of the six strategic themes through which we 
are driving growth and achieving shareholder value. Sustainability is 
at the core of our business operations, driving our strategy to 
innovate and manufacture products that improve the sustainability 
and competitiveness of our customers’ operations, while managing 
our own social and environmental impacts.
A focus on sustainability drives behaviours that cut costs and 
increases operational efﬁciency, while creating new business 
opportunities and mitigating risk. Sustainability enhances our 
competitive edge and helps us to deliver shareholder value. 
Managing sustainability
We have a clear and well-deﬁned management structure to help us 
achieve our sustainability objectives.

Sustainability: 2015 strategy update
During 2015 we continued to invest management time into 
developing and furthering our sustainability agenda. We allocated 
an executive sponsor and project leader to each of our sustainability 
objectives, within our five core sustainability pillars (our workplaces, 
our supply chain, our environment, our customers and our 
communities). We undertook a performance benchmarking 
exercise and made good progress against each of our objectives. 
During 2015 we expanded our supply chain pillar to include an 
objective on product responsibility: “To incorporate sustainability 
factors into our product design process, including energy efficiency, 
emissions, serviceability, recyclability and the availability of 
compliant and ethically sourced materials”. For more information see 
page 60. Following our benchmarking exercise, we refined two of 
our objectives to broaden their scope. The our customers objective 
was widened to include a greater range of environmental impacts, 
and our supply chain objective to encompass the end-to-end 
supply chain.
In summary:
 – Executive sponsor allocated to each 
strategic objective
 – Project teams formed
 – Benchmarking exercise undertaken
 – Product responsibility objective added
 – Progress made across all areas

“ Through focusing on 
leading indicators we are 
driving down our accident 
rate and strengthening our 
H&S culture.”
Mark Wyatt 
Group Environment, Health  
and Safety Executive
Overview
Protecting the health and promoting the wellbeing of our employees is a key 
priority for the Group. We are striving for H&S excellence to ensure that our 
workplaces are safe for our employees, contractors and visitors. We actively 
promote a H&S culture through employee engagement, empowerment and 
the fostering of good behaviours. We have a well-deﬁned H&S management 
structure, with the Group Chief Executive and Board of Directors having 
overall responsibility for H&S performance, and appropriate management 
systems in place. All our operating companies are required to adhere to the 
Group H&S Policy and to have a more detailed local policy in place.
Performance in 2015
During 2015 our over seven days lost time accident rate fell by 38% to 3.3 
per 1,000 employees and the total number of over seven day accidents fell 
to 16 (2014: 26). We benchmarked our performance against the Labour 
Force Survey’s “Estimated rate of self-reported workplace non-fatal 
injuries with over seven days of absence, 2012/13–2014/15”, in the UK 
manufacturing sector, a rate of 7 .1 per 1,000 people.
1
 Our accident rate was, 
therefore, signiﬁcantly better than the industry average. Our total number of 
accidents resulting in over three days of lost time, which includes over seven 
day accidents, fell by 23% to 24 accidents for 2015 (2014: 31).
During 2015 we delivered 10,566 H&S training units across the Group and 
established a system for recording employee concerns. During the year 
1,644 employee concerns were raised, these were investigated appropriately 
and, where necessary, corrective action taken. We enhanced our near miss 
reporting, investigation and corrective action implementation procedures; 
213 near misses were recorded and investigated this year. Across the 
Group we now have 25 full time, qualiﬁed EHS professionals, as well as 
part time EHS employees, and during the year over 400 internal continuous 
improvement EHS inspections were conducted in our supply sites. 
During 2015, an additional four manufacturing sites became OHSAS 18001 
certiﬁed; 11 of our 18 manufacturing sites now hold the certiﬁcation  
(2014: eight). Four of our manufacturing sites have a Behavioural Based 
Safety (BBS) programme in place, with the remaining sites preparing to 
implement their programmes.
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we embedded a leading indicator programme across our 
manufacturing facilities and established bi-weekly H&S meetings, attended 
by H&S personnel from all manufacturing sites. In the meetings, details of 
accidents are presented, along with causes and corrective actions that have 
been implemented, allowing all manufacturing sites to review and implement 
actions to reduce their similar risks. Changes have been made to the way 
accidents are investigated; we now use an enhanced “5 why” approach 
and a “strengths of defences” template, identifying root causes and putting 
strong corrective actions in place.
We held a three-day EHS conference, in the UK, attended by all EHS 
supervisors from across the steam business and EHS representatives from 
Watson-Marlow. The event included performance reviews, best practice 
sharing, BBS training events and strategy discussions.
Focused “safety moments” have been established and are presented at 
monthly executive meetings, and shared across the Group, and we have 
formalised the agenda for reporting on H&S performance to the Board 
of Directors.
Appropriate EHS due diligence surveys were completed during corporate 
acquisitions. An on-site EHS assessment was completed and an EHS start-
up plan produced for our new operating company in India.
Next steps for 2016
 – Continue our BBS implementation programme
 – Enhance our leading indicators programme
 – Generate H&S risk “heat maps” and accompanying risk 
reduction plans for all manufacturing sites
 – Group-wide roll-out of our hand safety campaign
 – Implement a H&S training plan for manufacturing sites
 – Conduct an employee H&S survey and outline an 
improvement plan
 – All manufacturing sites to hold, or be working towards, 
certiﬁcation to OHSAS 18001 by the end of 2016*

employment practices
Objective: To promote diversity and equality through employment practices that are free from 
discrimination and in accordance with international human rights principles
Target: 25% women on our Board, as opportunities arise
“ Diversity is an inherent 
characteristic of our global 
operations, strengthening 
our competitive edge 
and enhancing our ability 
to operate effectively 
and ethically.”
Frank Richardson 
Group Human 
Resources Director 
Next steps for 2016
 – On-going assessment of employment practices that support 
our inclusion objectives
 – Establish an internal HR auditing process
 – Prepare to implement UK Gender Pay Gap Reporting
Overview
Our employment practices are founded upon our Core Values and, in 
particular, the value of “respect”. We recognise that if our employment 
decisions are based on the value of respect, our employment practices 
will be fair and equitable.
Diversity of gender, age, culture, experience and expertise enhance our 
ability to govern and operate our businesses effectively and ethically. 
All applicants and employees receive equal treatment during their 
recruitment, transfer, promotion, training and assessment of salary and 
beneﬁts, irrespective of sex, race, gender reassignment, disability, sexual 
orientation, age, religion, beliefs, pregnancy or maternity, marriage or 
civil partnership. 
We give full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by 
disabled persons, having regard to their aptitudes and abilities, and support 
the continuing employment of those who become disabled during their 
period of employment with the Company. Disabled persons are entitled 
to the same opportunities for training, professional development and 
promotion as other Company employees. 
Since 2011 we have used a global grading system to provide transparency 
within the organisation around promotion and career opportunities; 
standardise compensation and beneﬁts packages proportional to pay 
grade; facilitate the objective evaluation of roles and performance; and aid 
external benchmarking. 
We are fully supportive of the human rights principles set out in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the Core Conventions of the International 
Labour Organisation. Our Group Human Rights Policy recognises that all 
individuals have the right to lead a digniﬁed life, free from fear and want, 
and free to express independent beliefs. It also includes the right of all 
employees to equal opportunities and non-discriminatory treatment, 
security of person, a safe working environment and a fair wage. We respect 
the rights of children and reject the use of forced or compulsory labour, 
either directly or within our supply chain. 
Our employees have the right of association and collective bargaining, and 
we maintain workplaces free from victimisation, harassment or bullying.
We communicate regularly with employees through a variety of channels, 
to ensure that they are informed about and engaged in their part of the 
business locally, while having a wider understanding of the operations 
and performance of the Group. We also undertake conﬁdential employee 
surveys to assess our performance as an employer. Well-established 
grievance procedures allow employees to raise concerns and all employees 
have access to a multilingual whistle-blowing helpline.
Performance in 2015
Board gender diversity remains unchanged with 8 males and 1 female 
on the Board. Across the Group gender diversity remained relatively 
unchanged from the prior year with 3,821 males and 1,040 females across 
the whole workforce, and 386 male senior managers and 72 female senior 
managers. It is inherently difﬁcult to improve performance in the area of 
gender diversity in the short or medium term as entrenched global gender 
stereotypes and global labour force structural issues result in a shortage of 
female engineers. We are working to address this imbalance through fair 
and transparent recruitment processes and compensation packages and 
by seeking to recruit and appoint females into senior management positions 
within the Group.
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we undertook a benchmarking exercise to review our current 
performance against best practice, including the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, and have continued to promote diversity 
within the engineering sector through visiting schools and universities 
and attending graduate engineering shows, highlighting that careers in 
engineering are available irrespective of gender.
We have undertaken an internal review to prepare for disclosure under the 
forthcoming UK Gender Pay Gap Reporting requirements.

the standards that we expect everyone in the Group to meet, including 
compliance with laws, regulations and Group policies; the promotion of 
ethical business practices; the fair treatment of customers; the conﬁdentiality 
of information; and respect for people, communities and the environment.
It is Group policy to conduct business free from bribery and corruption 
and we will not enter into contractual relationships with third parties 
who are known to engage in corrupt practices. Our Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Policy is available on our intranet site in 15 languages, and has 
also been disseminated directly to employees. We operate in compliance 
with competition laws and follow international sanctions, embargoes and 
restrictions. We do not make political donations. 
Whistle-blowing facilities are in place globally to facilitate reporting of 
suspected breaches of ethical business practices. 
Performance in 2015
During 2015 we received a small number of calls to “safecall” our third-
party managed, conﬁdential, whistle-blowing helpline. All incidents were 
thoroughly and appropriately investigated. 
By the end of 2015, nearly 4,000 employees had completed anti-bribery 
and corruption training, which is available in all major languages across the 
Group. During 2015, 400 employees completed a biennial anti-bribery and 
corruption training refresher course, which was launched during the year.
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we completed the Group-wide roll-out of “safecall”, our whistle-
blowing helpline, with a local (toll-free) helpline number communicated to 
all employees. We undertook an ethical business practices benchmarking 
activity and, as a result, created a new “business ethics and values” 
page on our corporate website with links to core policy documents. 
Employee training continued, including “Doing the right thing” and anti-
bribery and corruption training.
Overview
We achieve our strategy for growth by staying close to our customers, 
understanding their needs, and applying sector expertise to create 
bespoke, value-added engineered solutions. Developing the knowledge 
and skills of our people, including sales, customer support, product 
development, supply, distribution and logistics, and leadership, ensures 
that we continue to identify and deliver value for our customers, growth that 
outperforms our markets, and shareholder value. 
We undertake extensive training of our employees in our 48 training centres, 
located worldwide, and have invested in a comprehensive e-learning 
library. Our sales engineers also undergo extensive on-the-job training 
and mentoring.
Performance in 2015
During 2015 we increased the average number of formal training days 
(excluding on-the-job training) for our customer facing employees to an 
average of 7 .9 days per employee (2014: 7 .4 days). We also added 40 new 
or improved e-learning courses to our online library. A further 15 senior 
managers attended a two-week Advanced Management Programme, 
run by the Ashridge Business School, taking the total number who have 
attended to 57 since the programme was launched in 2011. During 2015, 
80 managers participated in our “Aspire” leadership programme, taking the 
number who have participated to 144 since the programme was launched 
in 2013, and 11 team leaders participated in our Team Leader Development 
Programme, taking the number who have participated to 85 since the 
programme was launched in 2010.
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we announced the launch of a new Spirax Sarco Academy, 
with Simon O’Brien, the former Regional General Manager for South East 
Asia and Japan, appointed as Principal. The Academy, which will be guided 
by a Board of Governors, will be established early in 2016 and will initially 
focus on the customer facing workforce before widening the scope to 
include all aspects of learning and development for our staff.
We have also interviewed and selected 12 of our employees to participate 
in a pilot nine-month “Initiating High Performance Programme”.

our operational performance 
and sustainability.”
Ian Farnworth 
Group Supply Chain Director
 Our supply chain:

Objective: To focus on continuous improvement in our supply chain with particular emphasis 
on sustainability
Target: 90%, by spend, of Group direct suppliers to have signed our Supplier Sustainability Code  
by the end of 2016
Next steps for 2016
 – Extend the roll-out of our Supplier Sustainability Code and 
sustainable sourcing strategy 
 – Continue to execute our operational excellence programme
 – Establish a steam business-wide sourcing excellence KPI
Overview
Improving the sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness of our end-to-end 
supply chain is a key strategic objective for the Group. Our supply chain 
encompasses all the activities that transport and transform raw materials 
and components into a finished product that is delivered to a customer. 
We manufacture globally, across 18 manufacturing sites. Our regional 
manufacturing strategy improves customer service by reducing lead 
times and ensures that products meet local specifications. It also 
reduces transport requirements for finished products and provides local 
employment in the regions in which we operate. 
Embedding sustainability criteria into our purchasing processes is central to 
ensuring the sustainability of our supply chain. Our Supplier Sustainability 
Code outlines the expectations that we have of suppliers, particularly in 
relation to their employees and their environmental impacts. 
In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act, the Supplier Sustainability 
Code specifies that our suppliers must not use forced, bonded or non-
voluntary labour, should establish recognised employment relationships in 
accordance with national laws, and exercise clarity in relation to wage levels.
We expect our suppliers to ensure that their activities are safe and secure 
for the health of their employees, contractors, the local community and 
the users of their products. Suppliers should proactively prevent work-
related injuries and illnesses through identifying, evaluating and limiting or 
mitigating risks.
Suppliers must have a health and safety policy and an implemented health 
and safety management system. Suppliers’ facilities must be constructed 
and maintained in accordance with the standards set by applicable 
laws and regulations, and suppliers must avoid the use of substances 
dangerous to their employees’ health and safety; including but not limited to 
carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction substances. All products 
and services delivered by the supplier must meet the quality and safety 
standards required by applicable laws.
We expect our suppliers to operate within the laws of their country, conduct 
business free from bribery or corruption, and adhere to the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Core Conventions of 
the International Labour Organisation. We will not countenance the use of 
child labour. Our suppliers are also expected to take steps to mitigate their 
environmental impacts, improve product quality and source responsibly.
Performance in 2015
During 2015 our updated Supplier Sustainability Code was rolled out to over 
750 direct material suppliers. Our top 300 suppliers received on-site audits 
and we assessed a further 200 suppliers using desktop surveys. 
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we expanded the Group Supply Chain function to include a 
Group Supply Chain Sourcing Manager, a Group Supply Chain Operations 
Manager, and a Group Energy and Environmental Manager, who works 
with the Group EHS Executive. With the expansion of the Group Supply 
Chain function we are striving to optimise supply chain effectiveness and 
sustainability by ensuring that we have robust policies and procedures in 
place to support excellence in this area. 
We undertook an extensive review of our supply chain, with a particular 
focus on manufacturing and internal supply chain effectiveness, and 
identified efficiency improvement opportunities, including service 
performance, inventory optimisation, operations planning and purchasing 
co-ordination. Encouraging progress is being made as we target excellence 
in our supply chain. 
We commenced the roll-out of our new Supplier Sustainability Code 
to suppliers across the Group, and undertook routine supplier visits 
and audits.
We reviewed the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and 
undertook an internal review to ensure that we have the systems in 
place to enable full and accurate disclosure in an annual Modern Slavery 
Act statement.
Modern Slavery Act statement

Overview
Ensuring that our products are safe for our customers to use, are 
manufactured using ethically sourced raw materials and have limited 
negative and wherever possible beneﬁcial environmental impacts, begins 
with robust product development processes. Our R&D processes are 
well-structured and incorporate best practice in the areas of design-for-
manufacture and compliance with safety and environmental standards 
such as ISO 14001 and RoHS (Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous 
Substances). We apply eco-design principles, avoid the use of hazardous 
materials and place a strong emphasis on in-service performance and 
continuous improvement. 
Performance in 2015
During 2015 we reviewed our R&D project portfolio and completed a 
thorough review of our R&D processes. These reviews demonstrated 
exceptional standards of compliance with relevant regulations 
and standards.
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we reviewed our project portfolio for alignment with 
environmental legislation and sustainability standards; completed a gap 
analysis to evaluate our current performance in the area of product design 
processes for sustainability; and linked sustainability factors with relevant 
drivers from within our quality management system to further raise the 
importance of sustainability within new product design.
Overview
Water is a valuable resource that needs to be managed effectively. We take 
steps to manage water use across our businesses, for example utilising 
rainwater harvesting at some of our manufacturing sites and grey water use 
for irrigation purposes. 
Reducing the amount of waste generated by operations and the quantity of 
waste sent to landﬁll is an important mechanism by which we manage our 
environmental sustainability. Recycling schemes are widely used across 
the Group and we have dedicated contractors to manage waste. We also 
seek to prevent the creation of waste for ourselves and our customers, 
for example through reducing the quantity of packaging materials used 
and using sustainably sourced and recyclable packaging materials 
where possible. 
Performance in 2015
ISO 14001 is an international environmental management standard which 
demonstrates that the environmental impacts of a business are being 
managed and reduced. The certiﬁcation process is rigorous and requires 
external auditing against prescribed standards. By the end of 2015, 76% 
of our employees were working in operations covered by environmental 
management standard ISO 14001. During 2015, ﬁve operating companies 
achieved ISO 14001 certiﬁcation for the ﬁrst time, taking the total number 
of our operating units with certiﬁcation to 25. 
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we undertook an internal and external benchmarking exercise 
and best practice review of water and waste management and reporting 
practices. In preparation for commencing Group-wide waste generation and 
management and water use data collection during 2016, we established 
universal deﬁnitions for our waste streams and established systems for 
reporting on our waste and efﬂuent management and water use.

Actions taken in 2015
In compliance with the EU’s Energy Efﬁciency Directive, energy audits 
were completed within our European operating companies that meet the 
qualiﬁcation criteria, namely the UK, France, Italy and Germany. The energy 
audits, which were completed by accredited assessors, identiﬁed energy 
saving opportunities. We have begun to review these opportunities with the 
intent of implementing some of the recommendations in 2016. 
During 2015 several of our manufacturing units began to implement plans in 
preparation for accreditation to energy management standard ISO 50001. 
Our Watson-Marlow MasoSine operating company in Germany became 
our second manufacturing site, after Spirax Sarco Korea in 2014, to achieve 
accreditation to ISO 50001.
Installation of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS) and also 
a Combined Heat and Power plant were completed at our Cheltenham, 
UK manufacturing facility. We have begun generating electricity on 
site, and recovering the waste heat produced during power generation 
to raise steam, which is used in our production and testing facilities. 
Utilising the BEMS, we have begun to identify and implement energy saving 
opportunities, such as turning off compressors over the weekend, which is 
helping to improve on-site energy efﬁciency.

Overview
We recognise that we have a responsibility to address the threat of climate 
change by managing our energy consumption and reducing our CO 2e 
emissions. In accordance with national and international directives, we 
endeavour to continuously reduce the carbon intensity of our business and 
implement strategies to minimise our carbon footprint. 
We employ an “operational control” deﬁnition to outline our carbon footprint 
boundary. Included within that boundary are manufacturing facilities, 
administrative and sales ofﬁces where we have authority to implement 
our operating policies. For each of these entities we have measured and 
reported on our relevant Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. (Scope 1 refers 
to direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the Company; 
Scope 2 refers to indirect emissions resulting from the purchase of energy 
generated off site, including electricity.) Excluded from our footprint 
boundary are entities where we do not have operational control. In 2015 this 
included Spirax Marshall Private Ltd and Econotherm. Also excluded from 
the footprint boundary are emission sources from operating companies 
established during 2015 and from companies acquired during the year. 
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition) and emission factors from the UK Government’s 
GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2015 to calculate our total 
CO 2e emissions ﬁgures.
Performance in 2015
Our CO 2e 2015 emissions data have been audited by TÜV UK Ltd, part of 
TÜV NORD Group, who have provided limited assurance as follows:
“TÜV UK Ltd is acting as the independent veriﬁer of the carbon footprint 
of SPIRAX SARCO. Based on our checks and reviews, taking into 
consideration a materiality level of 10% and a limited level of assurance 
we have found no evidence suggesting that the calculated greenhouse 
gas emissions are materially misstated and, hence, they are not an 
unreasonable assertion of the greenhouse gas-related data and information. 
Further, no facts became evident, which led us to the assumption that the 
calculation was not carried out in accordance with the applied international 
norm for the quantiﬁcation, monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions 
(GHG-Protocol).
The emissions for the reporting period 1st January 2015 to 31st December 
2015 (inclusive) are: 16,659 tCO 2e for Scope 1 and 13,391 tCO 2e for 
Scope 2.

Qdos pumps from Watson-Marlow help packaging 
manufacturer halve chemical usage
Huhtamaki Molded Fiber, a business unit within the Huhtamaki Group, 
located in the Netherlands, manufactures packaging, such as egg 
trays, fruit trays and cup carriers, from recycled paper. Qdos pumps, 
from Watson-Marlow, have revolutionised the dosing of a chemical 
lubricant during egg tray production, halving chemical use and 
reducing costs by over £60,000 a year, for a single application. 
Farmers use automated machines to pack eggs into trays. If  
insufﬁcient chemical lubricant has been used during the manufacture 
of the trays they stick together, preventing a robot from picking 
them up and feeding them into the packaging machine, causing 
egg breakages. 
The chemical lubricant is only required on the surface of the trays, but 
the limitations of dosing pumps meant that Huhtamaki had to add the 
lubricating agent into the mixing tank, before the pulp was moulded 
into the carton structure. Following the installation of Qdos pumps, 
lubricant is now sprayed onto the surface of the trays, once they have 
been moulded, signiﬁcantly reducing the amount of lubricant used. 
The unique properties of the Qdos pump – its ability to deliver a low 
and very accurate pulse-free ﬂow at a relatively high pressure (7 bar) – 
make it the only pump on the market capable of handling the chemical 
in this spraying application. The application of Qdos pumps has 
reduced chemical lubricant usage from 240 tonnes per year in 2013, 
to 120 tonnes per year in 2015, despite increased production levels, 
a saving of 120,000 litres a year. At approximately £500/tonne, this 
equates to cost savings of over £60,000 per year.

 – Review our customer sustainability reporting metrics
 – Calculate annual end user water savings from the installed 
base of Bredel pumps from Watson-Marlow
 – Establish a ﬁeld test to evaluate the positive impact of Qdos 
pumps on end user energy use and CO 2 emissions
Overview
Helping our customers to reduce their environmental impacts and achieve 
their environmental targets through improving plant efﬁciency, reducing 
energy, water and chemical use, and maintaining product quality and hence 
avoiding waste, is central to our sustainability strategy and business model.
Reducing energy and, hence, CO 2e emissions is a key sustainability driver 
for our customers wanting to improve their operational sustainability and 
reduce their environmental impacts. We primarily help our end users to 
reduce their energy consumption and emissions by providing products and 
services that improve the efﬁciency of their steam systems and enable them 
to recover and reuse thermal energy. In addition, the design and unique 
action of our pumps can provide substantial energy savings over other 
pump types. For example, our MasoSine pumps, from Watson-Marlow, 
are designed to efﬁciently handle high viscosity ﬂuids which other pump 
types would require large electrical motors to pump. 
Our products and services frequently enable our end users to use water 
more efﬁciently and reduce total water consumption on site. For example, 
our steam products enable the efﬁcient return of condensate to the boiler 
feed tank, preventing it from being lost to the drain; facilitate the capturing 
and utilisation of ﬂash steam, which would otherwise be lost to atmosphere; 
and improve the quality of boiler feedwater, reducing the need for boiler 
“blow-down” and the loss of water that this entails. Our pumps can also 
provide our end users with substantial water savings. For example, within 
the mining industry the application of a peristaltic pump from Watson-
Marlow can result in an average water saving of over 70%, in comparison 
with common centrifugal pumps. This can equate to savings of as much as 
900,000m³ of water a year for each pump installed.
The pumping accuracy of peristaltic pumps provides considerable chemical 
savings for our customers, within the Water & Wastewater and other industries.
Performance in 2015
We estimate that a select range of energy management products sold 
during 2015 will reduce our end users’ CO 2e emissions by 4.4 million 
tonnes annually. The methodology used to determine these savings has 
been independently assessed with the assistance of Ricardo-AEA Ltd. 
The methodology remains unchanged but is reviewed annually by  
Ricardo-AEA Ltd taking revised emissions factors into account. The  
calculation is based on a selected range of energy saving products for 
which we can quantify savings with reasonable accuracy. Many other of 
our products, such as pressure and temperature controls, will also provide 
CO 2e savings but as these are not easily quantiﬁable they are excluded from 
our methodology. 
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we reviewed our objective in this area and broadened it so that 
it captures a wider range of the environmental impact beneﬁts that we offer 
our end users, including for example, reducing their chemical use. 
We also completed a review of data collection and identiﬁed areas for 
future focus.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Malaysian home building project 
During 2015, Spirax Sarco Malaysia engaged in a home building 
project for an underprivileged Orang Asli (local aborigine) family, Omis 
and Manah.
Omis, Manah and their three children are one of approximately 12,000 
Orang Asli families living in unsafe or inadequate housing conditions 
within Peninsula Malaysia. When Spirax Sarco arrived, the family was 
living in a dilapidated shack measuring just 20m² in the Orang Asli 
village of Kg Hulu Tamu, located on the edge of the rainforest in Batang 
Kali, Selangor. Working as a rubber trapper, with a monthly household 
income of less than MYR 900 (£138), Omis was unable to provide his 
family with a suitable home. 
Over a three day period, a team of 25 Spirax Sarco Malaysia 
employees worked with EPIC Homes, a non-proﬁt organisation, 
to build the family a new home. Building the home was no easy task, 
working in 32°C heat, with little shade, the team demonstrated great 
commitment to build a 40m² home, including three bedrooms, a 
kitchen and a living area. 
To prepare for the build, the team attended a “Builder Basics 
Workshop” to equip them with the essential skills, safety training and 
knowledge to build the home.
Andy Wells, General Manager of Spirax Sarco Malaysia, commented, 
“This was an extremely rewarding team building exercise for 
Spirax Sarco, while also giving something meaningful back to the 
local population. With safe shelter in place, Omis can now focus on 
providing his family with food and ensure that his children have the 
necessary equipment for school.” 
Spirax Sarco Singapore provides steam system 
expertise to train engineers in Myanmar
During 2015, Spirax Sarco Singapore partnered with the Myanmar 
Engineering Society (MES) to provide steam system training to 
engineering students in Yangon, Myanmar. 
The month long course, which included three weeks of self-study and 
a week of practical demonstrations and factory visits, was hosted 
by the Myanmar Engineering Society, with Spirax Sarco providing all 
training materials, stationery, time and expertise free of charge. 
The course is designed to build the steam systems knowledge base 
in Myanmar, which is currently very low, and will prepare students 
for careers in industry. The course also supports the MES’s energy 
management initiative by developing a core of steam engineers 
that will help to reduce steam losses, improve energy management 
and reduce CO 2 emissions within industry in Myanmar. Further, the 
knowledge gained by the engineers will help local factories to increase 
efﬁciency and improve production standards so that they become 
safer and more competitive for international trade. Lastly, the course 
will raise brand awareness and the reputation of Spirax Sarco in 
the country.
The ﬁrst course, attended by over 30 students, was a huge success; 
so much so that MES plans to run the course three to four times a year 
in Yangon and two to three times a year in Mandalay. 
Next steps for 2016
 – Establish a Group-wide community engagement framework
 – Update the Group Charitable Donations Policy
 – Facilitate sharing of best practice across the Group
Overview
We seek to have a positive impact within our local communities through 
making charitable donations to worthwhile causes and engaging with 
our local communities in a variety of ways, including contributing time, 
resources and expertise, where there is a local need. Our Group Charitable 
Donations Policy guides our community engagement activities and focuses 
donation in the following areas: education; social services for the less 
advantaged, disabled and abused; healthcare; the arts; the environment; 
and disaster relief.
Performance in 2015
During 2015 the Spirax Sarco Group Charitable Trust (Trust) made 41 
donations, ranging in value from £200 to £18,000 to a geographically 
widespread and diverse range of charities. For example, the Trust donated 
£6,000 to Young Gloucestershire, a charity that supports young people 
who are facing challenges in their lives. A further £58,000 was donated to 
charitable causes by our operating companies during 2015 (2014: £47 ,000).
Actions taken in 2015
During 2015 we reviewed our community engagement projects across 
the Group and completed a benchmarking exercise. We identiﬁed key 
areas of focus and the need for an improved reporting framework to drive 
performance and reporting in this area. We continued to engage with 
the local communities in which we operate, with a focus on educational 
provision, particularly within science and engineering. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Governance Report
What governance  
means to us
As a Board it is our responsibility to 
support management with meeting its 
strategic aims, enabling the Group to 
continue to perform successfully and 
sustainably for our shareholders and 
wider stakeholders. Underpinning this 
is the Board’s commitment to ensuring 
the business operates to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. I am 
pleased that an independent evaluation of 
the Board and our Committees, carried 
out during the year, confirmed that the 
Board operates effectively, in an open and 
collegiate manner. 
In this section of the Annual Report, we 
set out our approach to governance, using 
the five main principles of the Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (as per the diagram 
on page 67) and explain how the Board and 
its Committees are structured and what 
they have done during the year. 
Our Governance Report explains how 
the Group has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2014 (Code). We are fully compliant 
with the requirements of the Code, as 
set out in detail on the Group’s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, under 
the Governance section.
Regulatory disclosures required under the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules 7 .2.6 
can be found on page 1 12.
You will find the Remuneration Report on 
pages 86 to 100, where Krishnamurthy 
Rajagopal, the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman, summarises our three-year 
Remuneration Policy that was approved 
by 98.5% of shareholder votes at our 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May 
2014. The Annual report on remuneration 
2015 sets out the details of Executive 
compensation throughout 2015, which will 
be subject to the normal advisory vote at 
the 2016 AGM. 
Key actions during the year
During 2015 we continued our open 
dialogue with the investment community 
with a comprehensive schedule of visits, 
road shows and meetings undertaken by 
myself, the Group Chief Executive and 
the Finance Director. This included a visit 
to our Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology 
Group headquarters in Falmouth, UK, for 
a number of analysts, to assist with their 
understanding of our business model.
A key activity undertaken this year was an 
independent Board effectiveness review, 
carried out by Dr Long CBE of Boardroom 
Review Ltd. This ensures we are compliant 
with the requirement to undertake an 
external review every three years in 
accordance with the Code. A summary of 
the findings and recommendations are set 
out on pages 75 and 76 of this Report.
Succession planning has had increased 
emphasis during 2015 following the 
independent review undertaken by  
Dr Long CBE, with the need to ensure the 
Board is refreshed and remains compliant 
with the Code. We remain committed to 
achieving our target of at least 25% female 
representation on the Board, and firmly 
believe we will come close to achieving 
this in the near future. Further information 
is set out on page 74 in the Nomination 
Committee report. 
With David Meredith’s announcement of his 
wish to retire, Kevin Boyd was identified as 
a suitable successor. Further information 
on this appointment is set out in the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
reports. In addition, at our strategy review 
meeting in June we reviewed the skills and 
experience of the executive team to ensure 
that the organisation has a pipeline of strong 
and capable senior managers to meet the 
future needs of the business. 
The requirement for premium listed 
businesses to provide a Viability 
statement was introduced in 2014. 
The Risk Management Committee, 
working with the Directors, has reviewed 
the business model alongside the 
Chairman’s introduction
“The Board is collectively responsible for promoting 
the Group’s long-term success, for setting its 
strategic plans and ensuring a framework of 
prudent and effective controls.”

Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2014, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group over a three-year 
period, taking into account the Group’s 
current financial position, business 
strategy, the Board’s risk appetite and 
the potential impacts of the principal 
risks outlined on pages 32 to 33 of 
the Strategic Report. Based on this 
assessment, the Directors confirm that 
they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three- 
year period to 31st December 2018.
Our Viability statement can be found 
in full on page 1 1 1 of this Report.
principal risks and has satisfied itself that 
it will be viable for three years. A copy of 
our statement is set out on page 111.
With the introduction of the Modern Slavery 
Act 2015 we have taken reasonable steps 
to confirm that to the best of our knowledge 
there is no modern slavery or human 
trafficking within our supply chain and we 
will continue to monitor measures to protect 
workers from abuse or exploitation in our 
organisation or supply chain. A Modern 
Slavery Act statement is available on our 
website www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com.
Integrated management 
framework
As a Board, we have ultimate responsibility 
for overseeing the Group’s performance 
and for overseeing the management 
of risk within the Group. As a result of 
Code changes published in September 
2014, the Board, the Risk Management 
Committee and the Audit Committee 
have put in place new processes for the 
on-going monitoring of risk management 
and internal controls to ensure that there 
is a more robust and integrated approach. 
These changes include:
 – health and safety as a standing agenda 
item at every Board and executive 
management meeting
 – Non-Executive Directors have sight of the 
agendas and key papers considered by 
the Risk Management Committee
 – risk management and the review of 
internal controls is now carried out by the 
Risk Management Committee and the 
Audit Committee
 – the Chairman of the Audit Committee to 
attend the Risk Management Committee 
once a year
 – an on-going assessment of the 
effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit.
The Group’s culture  
and values
The Board takes seriously its responsibilities 
for promoting the Group’s Core Values and, 
in particular, for ensuring that all employees 
and everyone associated with the Group are 
aware of their responsibility to act lawfully 
and conduct themselves in accordance 
with high standards of business integrity. 
These values are embedded in our Group 
Management Code.
A strong anti-corruption culture is central 
to the Group’s values and all employees 
are required to undertake anti-bribery 
training. In June 2015 a biennial refresher 
examination programme was introduced 
into the business to ensure that we maintain 
this position. 
To ensure that our suppliers comply with 
human rights principles we expect them 
to adhere to our Supplier Sustainability 
Code which is in accordance with 
international standards such as the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the Core Conventions of the International 
Labour Organisation and the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
More information on this can be found in our 
Sustainability report on page 59 and in our 
Audit Committee report on page 80. 
I am pleased to report that good corporate 
governance is integrated into everyday life 
at Spirax Sarco.
I look forward to meeting you at our AGM 
on Tuesday, 10th May 2016.

Governance Report
The Board
The Board relies on executive management 
to run the business and monitor 
management activities and holds them 
accountable against targets and standards. 
The Board also approves long-term 
corporate and strategic plans after a full 
review and assessment of market and 
technology trends, business drivers and 
risks. Having a senior management team 
that is capable of executing the strategic 
plans is a key focus.
The formal schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board’s decision 
is available on the Group’s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, under 
the Governance section.
The Non-Executive Directors provide 
independent challenge and review, bringing 
wide experience, specific expertise and a 
fresh objective perspective.
The Board meets as often as is necessary 
to discharge its duties. In 2015 the Board 
met seven times. All Directors are expected 
to attend all Board meetings and relevant 
Committee meetings unless prevented by 
prior commitments, illness or a conflict of 
interest. Directors unable to attend specific 
Board or Committee meetings are sent 
the relevant papers and asked to provide 
comments in advance of the meeting to 
the Chairman of the Board or Committee. 
In addition, all Board and Committee 
members receive the minutes of meetings 
as a matter of course.
The Directors’ attendance record at Board 
and Committee meetings is set out on 
page 72. The Non-Executive Directors 
meet without the Executive Directors 
present to discuss the Executive Directors’ 
performance and other matters. The Senior 
Independent Director is available to 
discuss concerns with shareholders, in 
addition to the normal channels of the 
Chairman, Group Chief Executive or the 
Finance Director.
The Board has a conflicts of interest policy 
and has put in place procedures for the 
disclosure and review of any potential or 
actual conflicts.
Committee composition
The Non-Executive Directors play an 
important governance role in the detailed 
work they carry out on our Committees on 
behalf of the Board. All the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement, 
in compliance with the Code. The Chairman 
was independent on appointment.
The General Counsel and Company 
Secretary supports the Committee 
Chairmen in making sure members are 
equipped for informed decision-making 
and that they allocate their time to the 
right subjects.
The Board has satisfied itself that at least 
one member of the Audit Committee, 
namely Clive Watson, has recent and 
relevant financial experience and is 
confident that the collective experience 
of its members enables it to be effective. 
The Audit Committee also has access to the 
financial expertise of the Group, the external 
and internal auditors and can seek further 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, if required.

Board structure continued
Board activities in 2015
The Board ensures good governance 
practices are embedded throughout 
the Group so that they are an integral 
part of running a successful business. 
In the adjacent chart we have set out how 
the Board spent its time during 2015. 
The Board agendas are carefully planned 
to ensure focus on the Group’s strategic 
priorities and key monitoring activities, 
as well as reviews of signiﬁcant issues. 
During 2015 the Board devoted 35% of 
its time to the Spirax Sarco steam and 
Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group 
strategies, the Group 2020 plan and with 
reviewing implementation progress of the 
Group corporate strategy. With the new 
requirement for the Board to ensure that the 
risk management framework is integrated, 
as well as being robust and effective, 20% 
of time was allocated to this.
As new product development is key to 
the on-going success of the business, at 
the meeting held in June a presentation 
on Product Lifecycle Management was 
delivered. This included a proposal for a 
new technology platform for products in 
the steam business to reduce the time 
taken to get a new product to market, 
improve efﬁciencies and protect key data. 
Approval was given by the Board for this 
investment. At the same meeting the Board 
and executive team reviewed progress 
with the implementation of the strategy 
as approved by the Board in June 2014.
Health and safety is of fundamental 
importance to the business and is 
considered at each Board meeting.
At the June meeting the Board approved 
investment in a development programme 
enabling a number of employees across 
the globe to qualify in health and safety 
management to an international standard. 
The Board recognises that cyber-crime 
continues to be a threat to all businesses 
and has ensured that additional investment 
has been made during the year on the 
information security infrastructure to 
upgrade and strengthen our systems. 
In addition, an increased level of insurance 
cover has been put in place to mitigate 
the cost to the business in the event of 
an attack. Further information on the 
work undertaken in this area is shown on 
page 83.
During 2015 the Board regularly reviewed 
the Group’s performance and satisﬁed itself 
that, despite challenging trading conditions 
and foreign exchange headwinds, 
management was on track in delivering 
the strategic business plan. In addition, 
the Board concentrated its efforts on 
succession planning during its strategic 
review meeting in June. The Board also 
continued to engage with shareholders 
on governance, remuneration and trading 
during the period.

Review of 2015
This year we have reviewed the tenure of 
the Non-Executive Directors as part of 
the succession planning to ensure that a 
majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors continues to be maintained.
The need for enhanced succession planning 
was also a key recommendation following 
the external Board evaluation carried out 
by Dr Long CBE of Boardroom Review Ltd 
in 2015. Work has therefore started, and a 
plan has been developed, to ensure that 
succession for key Board roles is phased 
over the next few years to ensure adequate 
handover periods and a smooth transition. 
An independent external search agency 
has been instructed and will advise the 
Committee on the suitability of candidates 
against a job description approved by the 
Committee. The Committee is committed to 
appropriate engagement with shareholders 
throughout this process. As we progress 
this process we anticipate that the number 
of Directors may fluctuate temporarily 
between 9 and 10. We shall ensure that at 
all times, the number of independent Non-
Executive Directors is the same or more 
than the number of Executive Directors so 
that we remain compliant with the Code.
A recommendation from this review is that 
the Nomination Committee increases the 
number of scheduled meetings from 2016 
onwards. The findings of the review are set 
out on page 76. We have identified the skills 
and experience required on the Board to 
support the implementation of our strategy 
for growth, and used these to create job 
specifications to assist with recruitment. 
Following David Meredith’s announcement 
of his wish to retire from his position as 
Group Finance Director and Executive 
Director with effect from the end of the AGM 
on 10th May 2016, we appointed Korn Ferry 
Whitehead Mann, an independent executive 
recruitment firm, to assist with the search 
for a successor. On 27th October 2015 we 
announced the appointment of Kevin Boyd 
who will join the Group on 1 1th April 2016 
to ensure a smooth handover from David 
Meredith. Kevin Boyd will then be appointed 
to the Board on 1 1th May 2016 as Group 
Finance Director and Executive Director.
Korn Ferry Whitehead Mann provides no 
other services to the Group.
We encourage leadership development 
through robust succession planning and a 
strengthened performance management 
culture. We have a management 
development plan for those individuals 
demonstrating high potential. Training and 
professional development are delivered 
through our Leadership Academy in 
conjunction with Ashridge Business 
School and our “Aspire” programme for 
senior managers.
The Executive Directors meet frequently to 
review organisational staffing requirements 
against career planning of high-potential 
leaders. The most recent review of 
succession planning by the full Board and 
the executive and senior management team 
was undertaken as part of the strategic 
review meeting held in June 2015.
The Group seeks to have Directors who, 
in addition to relevant technical and 
commercial expertise, meet the highest 
standards of judgement, critical thinking 
and openness. Furthermore, the Group 
recognises the importance of diversity at 
all levels of the Company as well as on 
the Board.
We believe that the Board’s perspective and 
approach is greatly enhanced by gender, 
age and cultural diversity and it is our policy 
to consider overall Board balance and 
diversity when appointing new Directors. 
As shown on page 65, the diverse range of 
nationalities and experience of our Board 
is particularly relevant given the broad 
international reach of the Group.
We are committed to a target of a 
minimum of 25% women on our Board as 
opportunities arise. This is a key element 
of our Board succession plan and we are 
confident that we will be close to this target 
and exceed 20% in 2016. 
We also encourage the progress of 
women in senior positions throughout the 
Group and, during 2015, women were 
appointed as: Strategic Implementation 
Project Manager (EMEA), General Manager 
(Thailand), HR Manager (Italy), Group Energy 
and Environmental Manager, Senior HR 
Business Partner, and Operations Manager 
(Group Supply Chain), with a number of 
these being internal promotions.
We have continued to offer practical support 
for the Department for Business Innovation 
and Skills’ “Women on Boards – FTSE 
250” initiative by supporting two women 
from our senior management team to 
serve as Non-Executive Directors on other 
company Boards. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Evaluation cycle - three year
Effectiveness
Board evaluation
In the period August to October 2015, an 
independent evaluation of the Board and the 
Board Committees was externally facilitated 
by Dr Tracy Long CBE of Boardroom 
Review Ltd, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code. All Board members 
were interviewed, and the performance 
of the Board and its Committees was 
observed. In addition, the flow and quality of 
the Board and Committee information was 
reviewed. The objective of this evaluation 
was to provide insight into the effectiveness 
of the Board and to identify actions for 
improving performance. 
Boardroom Review Ltd provides no other 
services to Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc. 
The overall view of the Board’s performance 
was positive. In particular, the strength of the 
Board was noted and the review confirmed 
that there is a clear focus on priorities with 
a collaborative and open Board culture, 
supported by information of a high quality.
A number of recommendations were made 
to further improve the strength of the Board 
and to ensure that the business is prepared 
for the future. 
For further information see page 76
In accordance with the Code an annual review of the effectiveness of the Board is 
undertaken with input from an independent external adviser every three years. The process 
used for the external evaluation is set out in the diagram below.

Director development
Induction
On joining the Board, all new Directors 
receive a tailored and comprehensive 
induction programme, comprising a 
combination of briefings and meetings 
with the Directors, General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, corporate advisers 
and senior management. This covers 
Directors’ duties and the UK listing regime, 
an overview of the business, its operations, 
risks and regulatory matters, governance, 
finance and investor relations.
Training and development
The Board is regularly notified of changes 
to relevant laws and regulations, with a 
report at each Board meeting from the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary 
and an annual update from the corporate 
legal adviser.
All the Directors are members of the 
Deloitte Academy, giving them access to 
a comprehensive programme of training 
and technical support on a wide range of 
corporate governance matters to enable 
the Directors to update their knowledge 
and keep them informed of their duties. 
Non-Executive Directors are invited to 
attend Group conferences, which provide 
information on business strategy, new 
product development and sales and 
marketing initiatives. Business presentations 
are given at Board meetings to ensure the 
Directors are kept informed of new product 
development, regional operations, business 
strategies and employee development.
In June, the Board meeting was combined 
with a site visit to two of the Italian operating 
companies and a presentation by the 
management team.

Review of 2015
The Committee met three times in 2015.
Both John Senior (Group Financial 
Controller) as head of the internal audit 
team, and the external auditor attend 
the meetings and have direct access to 
the Committee Chairman. Following the 
external Board evaluation undertaken during 
2015 it was recommended that the Group 
Chief Executive be invited to attend the 
Audit Committee from time-to-time and this 
has now been implemented.
As a safeguard, the Committee holds 
separate meetings with the external and 
internal auditors without management 
present to discuss their respective areas 
and any issues arising from their audits.
During the year the Committee received 
reports from external and internal auditors 
on the major findings of their work and the 
progress of management follow-up by way 
of management reports.
The Committee received assurance on 
going concern, viability, pension valuation, 
material litigation and risk management. 
The Group has complied with the 
provisions of the Competition and Market 
Authority (CMA) Order issued by the CMA 
in September 2014, for “The Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities)”. 
Auditor
This is the second financial year in which 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
have been audited by Deloitte LLP following 
their appointment as the Company’s 
external auditor as of 20th May 2014. 
This appointment will be subject to on-going 
monitoring and will run for a maximum of 
10 years before being tendered.
One of the primary responsibilities of the 
Committee is to assess the robustness 
of the external audit process and make 
recommendations to the Board in relation to 
the appointment, re-appointment or removal 
of the external auditor. The Committee took 
a number of factors into account when 
evaluating the effectiveness of the external 
audit including:
 – the quality and scope of the planning of 
the audit (in October 2015, Deloitte LLP 
presented their plan for the 2015 audit to 
the Committee); and
 – feedback from all audited operating 
units, the Group Finance team, senior 
management and Directors on the audit 
process and the quality and experience of 
the audit partners engaged in the audit. 
The Financial Reporting Council’s Audit 
Quality Review team selected to review the 
audit of the December 2014 Spirax Sarco 
Group Financial Statements as part of 
their 2015 annual inspection of audit firms. 
The focus of the review and their reporting 
is on identifying areas where improvements 
are required rather than highlighting areas 
performed to or above the expected level. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
received a full copy of the findings of 
the Audit Quality Review team and has 
discussed these with Deloitte. The Audit 
Committee confirms that there were no 
significant areas for improvement identified 
within the report. The Audit Committee is 
also satisfied that there is nothing within the 
report which might have a bearing on the 
audit appointment.
During the year, the Committee reviewed 
and approved the proposed audit fees and 
terms of engagement for the 2015 audit and 
recommended to the Board that it proposes 
to shareholders that Deloitte LLP be  
re-appointed as the Group’s external auditor 
for 2016 at the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on 10th May 2016.
The Committee recognises that the 
independence of the external auditor is 
an essential part of the audit framework 
and has adopted a policy which sets out 
a framework for determining whether it is 
appropriate to engage the Group’s auditor 
for non-audit services. This policy states 
that any expenditure with the Group’s 
auditor on non-audit fees should not exceed 
70% of the average audit fees charged 
in the last three-year period. During the 
year, the Group spent £237 ,720 on non-
audit services provided by Deloitte LLP 
(being 22. 1% of the average of Group audit 
fees charged over the past three years). 
Further details can be found in Note 6 on 
page 133.
Internal audit
The Committee reviewed the schedule 
of planned internal audits undertaken in 
2015 and assessed the robustness of the 
control framework that is in place to track 
and monitor progress in remedying any 
identified deficiencies. This comprehensive 
review ensures that the Committee is able 
to give assurances that the Group has an 
effective and integrated risk management 
framework. The internal audit process is 
explained on page 83.
Significant issues in relation 
to the Financial Statements
During the year the Committee considered 
significant issues in relation to the Group’s 
Financial Statements and disclosures 
relating to:
(i) Revenue recognition
In view of the significant volume of trade 
in the final quarter of the year, the need 
to focus on any new contracts was 
highlighted to ensure the appropriate 
recognition of revenue for the year ending 
31st December 2015.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information
(ii) The carrying value of goodwill
The Committee focused on the carrying 
value of goodwill, including the sensitivity 
analysis and the key assumptions used 
by management, and agreed with the 
conclusion reached that no additional 
impairments were required. 
(iii) Inventories
There are judgements required in assessing 
the proportion and value of slow-moving 
inventory that should be written down 
in value. The value of inventory was 
considered by the Committee to ensure 
that the accounting policy had been 
consistently applied and the level of 
inventory provision was appropriate.
(iv) Pensions
There are judgements made in selecting 
appropriate assumptions in valuing the 
Group’s defined benefit pension obligations, 
including discount ratios, mortality, inflation 
and salary increases. The Committee 
considered reports by the Company, 
including those from independent external 
advisers, and is comfortable that the key 
assumptions are reasonable.
(v) Ensuring the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable
The Committee carried out a full 
assessment and review to ensure the 
standard was satisfied.
(vi) Other judgements in the 
Financial Statements
Provisions and acquisitions were addressed. 
After reviewing the presentations and 
reports from management and consulting 
with the auditor, the Committee is satisfied 
that the Financial Statements appropriately 
address the critical judgements and 
key estimates, both in respect of the 
amounts reported and the disclosures. 
The Committee is also satisfied that 
the significant assumptions used for 
determining the value of assets and liabilities 
have been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and are sufficiently robust. 
Review of Financial 
Statements
During 2015 the Committee considered 
many components of the business 
performance in order to ensure it has a 
full understanding of the operations of 
the Group.
Key considerations made by the 
Committee include:
 – determining the position adopted in key 
judgement areas including pensions, 
provisions, goodwill impairment 
and acquisitions;
 – risk areas set out in the Risk Management 
Committee report;
 – receipt of regular strategy reports from the 
Group Chief Executive and operational 
reports from the Divisional Directors;
 – requesting members of management to 
attend Committee meetings to provide 
updates on operational and strategic 
matters; and
 – reviews of the budget and 
operational plan.
Through these processes and its monitoring 
of the effectiveness of controls, internal 
audit and risk management, the Committee 
is able to maintain a good understanding 
of business performance, key areas of 
judgement and decision-making processes 
within the Group.
Committee evaluation
During the year the Committee undertook 
a self-assessment of its performance using 
an internal questionnaire. Having considered 
the findings of this review it was agreed to 
make available the Deloitte Academy to all 
Directors to ensure that a comprehensive 
programme of training and development is 
available throughout the year.
The results of the external Board evaluation 
undertaken during the year by Dr Long 
CBE of Boardroom Review Ltd highlighted 
the effectiveness of the Audit Committee. 
The review also recommended the need 
for the Nomination Committee to engage 
in succession planning for the Chairman 
of the Committee.
The review recommended that the Audit 
Committee agrees the scope for an 
independent benchmarking assessment 
of the internal audit function to ensure it 
is capable of supporting an increasingly 
complex and growing business. 
Fair, balanced and 
understandable
One of the key governance requirements 
is for the Annual Report to be fair, balanced 
and understandable. The co-ordination 
and review of the Group-wide input into 
the Annual Report is a significant exercise 
performed within an exacting time frame, 
which runs alongside the formal audit 
process undertaken by the external auditor.
To ensure the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable, the 
Committee adopted a process of 
assessing the consistency of the risks and 
judgements, reviewed the Board minutes 
to ensure issues of significance were 
given prominence and arrived at a position 
where initially the Committee and then the 
Board are satisfied with the overall fairness, 
balance and clarity of the document which 
is underpinned by the following:
 – comprehensive guidance for contributors 
at operational level;
 – a verification process dealing with the 
factual content of the reports;
 – comprehensive reviews undertaken 
at different levels in the Group that 
aim to ensure consistency and overall 
balance; and
 – comprehensive review by the senior 
management team.

balanced and understandable Annual 
Report is set out on page 66 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Governance Report
Human rights in the supply chain and the Modern Slavery Act 2015
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc maintains the highest ethical standards in our business 
operations, and strives to continually develop, implement, and uphold organisation-wide 
policies in keeping with those standards. 
In 2015, the Group made further progress with a review to check and satisfy itself that proper 
procedures for compliance with health and safety requirements and adherence to the Group’s 
Human Rights Policy are present in its supply chain. During the year, the Group Supply Chain 
function was expanded to ensure adequate resource for the management and monitoring of 
our suppliers. 
The Group Supply Chain Director has been tasked with working with the Group Environment, 
Health and Safety Executive and the Group Sourcing Manager to ensure compliance by 
suppliers with the Spirax Sarco Supplier Sustainability Code (reviewed and updated in 2015 
to include the provisions of the Modern Slavery Act 2015). This sets out the non-negotiable 
minimum standards that we expect our suppliers and their sub-tier suppliers to respect and 
to adhere to when conducting business with the Company. 
In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act, our Supplier Sustainability Code specifies that 
our suppliers must not use forced, bonded or non-voluntary labour. 
The Supplier Sustainability Code is in accordance with international standards such as the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
Core Convention of the International Labour Organisation and the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights.
The roll-out of the updated Supplier Sustainability Code commenced during 2015, in addition 
to routine supplier visits and audits. 
We have issued a Modern Slavery Act statement and a summary of this can be found on 
page 59. The full statement can be found on our website: www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com/
Sustainability/Pages/our-supply-chain.aspx 
Having robust policies in place to ensure that no modern slavery or human trafficking is present 
in our operations or within our global supply chains is a fundamental aspect of our commitment 
to upholding ethical standards with respect to human rights encapsulated in our existing 
Human Rights Policy. The Group has implemented and will continue to implement measures 
to protect workers from being abused or exploited in our organisation or supply chain.
Further information on the work undertaken during 2015 and targets for 2016 are set out on 
page 59 of this Report.

Responsibilities
To identify and understand 
the risks facing the Group
To assess and transfer or 
avoid those risks which are 
beyond our appetite for risk
To accept and manage 
within the business those 
risks which our employees 
have the skills and 
expertise to understand 
and leverage
To establish the authority 
levels within the Group, by 
consideration of materiality, 
at which decisions on 
acceptance and mitigation 
of risk are taken
Our approach and appetite 
for risk
Our aim is to continue to build a 
sustainable business through consistent, 
profitable growth and to provide value 
to our customers and shareholders. 
Creating shareholder value is the reward 
for taking acceptable risks. The effective 
understanding and management of risk is 
fundamental to the long-term success of 
the Group.
The Committee has developed a risk 
matrix with quantified thresholds that have 
been approved by the Board following 
input and consultation with Directors and 
management. The relative positions of 
the risks and the agreed thresholds are 
monitored on an on-going basis to take into 
account the changing environment within 
which the Group operates.
The risk review process
We have adopted an integrated approach 
to our risk management, independent 
assurance and internal controls to ensure 
greater linkage across our review and 
assessment of risk. Internal controls and 
risk management are designed to limit 
the chance of failure to achieve corporate 
objectives. Independent assurance is 
provided by the external auditor and 
internal audit.
The Committee has accountability for 
overseeing the risk management processes 
and procedures, works with the Audit 
Committee and reports to the Board on 
the risks facing the Group. The Committee 
also monitors the mitigating actions put in 
place by the relevant divisions and Group 
companies to address the identified risks.
At a local level, each operating company is 
required to undertake a formal review of the 
risks which impact, or have the potential to 
impact its business, at least once a year. 
The reviews are consolidated into Group-
wide risk reports which are maintained 
and reviewed by the Committee on a 
regular basis.
We have a robust risk management process 
in place through which we identify, evaluate 
and manage the principal risks that could 
impact the Group’s performance. 
To ensure that risk management is fully 
embedded into the Group culture, in 2015 
we reviewed our assessment of the principal 
risks using bottom-up involvement from 
management. Our principal risks and the 
product of the 2015 review are set out on 
pages 32 and 33.
The Group’s governance structure is set 
up so that there are three lines of defence 
within the risk management framework:
first line of defence – the business is 
responsible for the identification, control and 
management of its own risks
second line of defence – the Risk 
Management Committee, with the Audit 
Committee, ensures that the risk and 
compliance framework is effective so as to 
facilitate the monitoring of risk management 
with on-going challenge and review of the 
risk profile in the business
third line of defence – internal audits 
provide independent testing and verification 
of compliance with policies and procedures, 
and monitoring of follow up actions 
where required.
This approach ensures that senior 
management have full accountability for the 
management of risks in their specific areas. 
Internal controls
The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
the effective management of risk across 
the Group, determining risk appetite and 
tolerance. The Board also has overall 
responsibility for the system of internal 
controls and for reviewing its effectiveness, 
whilst the role of management is to 
implement Board policies on risk 
and control.
An on-going review process for identifying 
and managing risks faced by the Group 
has been in place since 2013. The review 
covers and assesses the effectiveness 
of all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and 
risk management systems. It ensures that 
proper accounting records have been 
maintained, that financial information used 
within the business is reliable and that 
the preparation of the consolidated and 
Company Financial Statements and the 
financial reporting process comply with all 
relevant regulatory reporting requirements. 
The system of internal controls is designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve the business objectives.
All operating companies are required 
annually to complete self-certification 
questionnaires regarding compliance with 
the policies, procedures and minimum 
requirements for an effective system of 
internal controls. Self-certification is given by 
both the General Manager and the Finance 
Manager of each operation.
From its annual reviews, the Board believes 
that the system of internal controls is 
embedded in the business and that regular 
review allows for assessment of new and 
changing risks in the Group’s business.
Internal controls can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the 
Group has complied throughout the year 
and up to the date of the publication of the 
Annual Report with the Code provisions on 
internal controls.

Important developments in the year
Our risk management approach is subject to continuous review and updating 
to take account of new and developing issues which might impact our business 
objectives. The following actions have been undertaken during the year to address 
significant developments:
Scenario testing
We undertook scenario 
testing for China with 
external facilitation
Modern Slavery Act
The Group has 
implemented and 
will continue to 
implement measures 
to protect workers 
from being abused 
or exploited in our 
organisation or supply 
chain, with standards 
set in our Supplier 
Sustainability Code
A statement has been 
prepared and is available 
on our website.
Our Global Excellence 
in Supply Chain Initiative 
provides a framework for 
on-going monitoring
Historical review
We carried out a review 
to determine if the 
principal risks on the 
register relate to the 
events that actually 
occurred in the last 
three years and if the 
mitigation mechanisms 
were effective
Crisis management 
training
Having implemented 
a Serious Incident 
Procedure last year 
the need for training to 
enable senior managers 
to be able to respond 
was identified and 
training scheduled
Principal risks
We undertook a bottom- 
up review of the principal 
risks and introduced 
monitoring throughout 
the year in accordance 
with changes to 
the Code
Regular updates
The executive 
committee reviews risk 
at each meeting and 
agendas/minutes of 
the Risk Management 
Committee are 
circulated to all 
Board Directors
Internal audit
The Board has an established internal audit 
function which allows each of the Group 
operating companies to be audited at 
least every three years and those judged 
to be in higher risk territories are audited 
more frequently. 
All businesses acquired by the Group are 
subject to internal audit within one year 
from the date of acquisition. Internal audit 
resource is supplemented by experienced, 
qualified accounting staff from principal 
Group operating companies and a 
professional auditing firm, BDO International. 
Reports are made to the Audit Committee 
and the Board as a whole. Whilst there 
were some areas for local improvement 
identified in the internal audit reports, no 
significant matters were raised in the reports 
on the operating companies audited during 
the year. 
Further work has been done to build on 
our strong anti-corruption culture and 
our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy. 
We have supplemented our “anti-bribery@
work” training programme, which includes 
testing, with biennial refresher training that 
is in the process of being rolled out to all 
employees. To date 4,000 employees 
have completed the initial training and 
400 employees have taken the refresher. 
The Group Legal function also makes 
face-to-face presentations throughout the 
Group on business ethics. In 2015, we 
also stepped-up our supplier compliance 
checks and ensured every company had in 
place a gifts and hospitality register. Finally, 
the introduction of an independent whistle-
blowing hotline further strengthened our 
commitment to ethical business practices. 
The Committee has ensured compliance 
with centrally documented control 
procedures on such matters as 
capital expenditure, information and 
technology security and legal and 
regulatory compliance. 
Cyber security
The Group recognises that cyber-crime 
is a growing threat to all businesses and 
is taking measures to remain secure. 
We continue to detect and prevent issues 
before they are able to affect the security 
of our systems, or impact us financially, 
through actions such as:
 – the identification of information assets 
that are at risk, to ensure relevant 
protection is in place;
 – the use of anti-virus and firewall controls, 
with regular updates applied;
 – the use of email filtering to reduce the risk 
of phishing and software attacks;
 – the use of third party experts for 
cyber-security testing to assess risks 
to our systems and to help to prevent 
future attack;
 – the use of a single third party, to provide, 
monitor and manage our global network; 
in line with industry best practice;
 – the use of Information security audits and 
an Information Systems risk register to 
manage, mitigate and prevent risks;
 – the operation of policies, processes and 
procedures to prevent incidents affecting 
our information systems;
 – a program of education for key business 
leaders and Information Systems staff 
in detection and prevention of cyber-
attacks.
We also attained the first level of the UK 
Governments “Cyber Essentials” scheme 
in the UK during 2015 and will roll this out 
across the Group in 2016. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Relations with shareholders
Governance structure
We maintain an active dialogue with our 
principal investors and the investment 
community. During 2015 we undertook 
a comprehensive calendar of events, as 
shown in the shareholder engagement 
calendar on page 85. By providing regular 
forums for meeting and communicating 
with shareholders and the investment 
community we ensure that we understand 
the views and opinions of our investors 
and are kept informed of any concerns that 
may arise. We are also able to give updates 
on our results and developments within 
our business.
We communicate using a variety of forums 
including interviews, investor and analyst 
calls, one-to-one meetings, roadshows, site 
tours and capital markets events. In March 
2015 we held a Capital Markets Day, buy-
side, at our Spirax Sarco manufacturing 
and R&D site in Cheltenham, UK and in 
October 2015 we held a Capital Markets 
Event, attended by sell-side analysts, at 
our Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology 
Group headquarters and manufacturing 
facilities in Falmouth, UK. During the year 
Nicholas Anderson, Group Chief Executive, 
and David Meredith, Finance Director, 
also attended shareholder roadshows, 
across several countries, including the UK, 
France, Germany, Switzerland, Canada and 
the USA. 
At the AGM in 2015, shareholders were able 
to hear from and put questions to the Board 
on a range of matters. 
Since the year end we have written to our 
shareholders giving them the option to 
receive documents such as our Annual 
Report electronically rather than in hard 
copy, helping us to reduce the impact we 
have on our environment and reduce costs.
Our forthcoming AGM will take place on 
10th May 2016 at our UK Head Office: 
Charlton House, Cheltenham when the 
Group Chief Executive will give a short 
presentation about the previous year and the 
Group’s strategic progress. The presentation 
will be available on the Group’s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com, on 
the shareholder notices page, after the 
meeting. Following the AGM, the Board will 
be available to answer questions and meet 
informally with shareholders. 
Capital markets event
 
During September 2015 we held a Capital 
Markets Event at our Watson-Marlow 
Fluid Technology Group (WMFTG) 
headquarters in Falmouth, Cornwall. 
The event was attended by 14 sell-side 
analysts and was designed to enhance 
their understanding of this important and 
growing business within the Group. 
The event included presentations by Jay 
Whalen, Executive Director of  
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc and 
President of WMFTG, and other senior 
managers from Watson-Marlow about 
the company, new product development, 
sales and geographical expansion, and 
the company’s manufacturing philosophy. 
The event also included a site tour of 
the Watson-Marlow pump factory, 
ISO 14644-1 Class 7 certified tubing 
extrusion clean room and R&D facilities. 
In addition, there were presentations 
about the Group’s supply chain and 
Spirax Sarco’s direct sales approach.

Governance Report
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Remuneration report for 2015. I am happy to confirm that the implementation of 
Executive Director remuneration in 2015 complied fully with our Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2014. 
We also comply with the Large and Medium Sized Companies and groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 on 
Directors’ Pay, introduced in October 2013. 
In this letter I will provide a summary of business performance during the year and the resulting awards made under our performance-
based incentive plans, along with details of the major decisions made by the Committee. The balance of this report is split into two 
sections: our 2015 Annual report on remuneration, which explains how the Remuneration Policy was implemented during the year ended 
31st December 2015 followed by a copy of the approved Remuneration Policy.
Business performance and pay outcomes
As noted in the Chairman’s statement on pages 2 and 3, the Company made further progress in 2015 with Group revenue up 2% and pre-
tax profit up 4%, both at constant currency, contributing to earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6% at constant currency, or 2% at reported 
exchange rates, and a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 45.3% (as determined under the annual bonus plan rules). Over the three-
year period ending in 2015, the Company delivered a total shareholder return (TSR) of 58.8%. The Board is recommending an increase in 
the final dividend of 7 . 1% to 48.2p per share for the year, extending our dividend record to 48 years. 
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to ensure that a significant percentage of Executive Director pay is based on the achievement of 
demanding performance targets and is, therefore, “at risk”. A maximum payout under the annual bonus plan and Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) is only available as a result of significant outperformance by the business. The Committee considers that the remuneration paid to 
Executive Directors in 2015 (given as a single figure for each Director on page 90) reflects the progress made by the Company during 2015, 
as well as over the last three years. 
Annual bonuses are based on adjusted operating profit and ROCE targets. The Group profit achievement of £152, 195,000 (as determined 
under the annual bonus plan rules) was 0.6% below the plan target and the ROCE achieved of 45.3% was 0.83 percentage points above 
the 44.5% plan target. These achievements resulted in a 61.39% bonus award for the Group Chief Executive and Finance Director. 
Other Executive Directors’ targets have an additional divisional profit element and details of their bonus targets and level of achievement can 
be found on pages 91 and 92.
Shares awarded in the PSP vest based on relative TSR and EPS growth over the three-year plan period. Performance on the EPS measure 
resulted in a vesting of 50.8%. Strong TSR of 58.8% in the three years to 31st December 2015 exceeded the majority of our peers and 
triggered a 100% award for the TSR element. As a result, the 2013 PSP awards vested at a rate of 80.33% of the total shares awarded. 
(Details of bonus and PSP awards can be found on pages 92 and 93).
Changes to the Group Chief Executive’s remuneration
On his promotion to Group Chief Executive, Nicholas Anderson’s overall remuneration package was consciously positioned below both 
that of his predecessor and levels observed in the market. The Committee has kept this under review with a view to better aligning his 
remuneration to market median over a period of time.
As disclosed in our report last year, in 2015 the Committee approved a salary increase of 4.2%, slightly above the average of the other 
Executive Directors (2.8%) and the average increase for our UK employees (2.0%). This reflected both excellent performance in the role, 
contribution to the Group and the Committee’s intention to better position salary relative to market norms. 
Following a further review in December 2015, the Committee has increased the Group Chief Executive’s salary to £515,000 (+4. 1% on 2015) 
and bonus opportunity to 125%, with effect from 1st January 2016. Similar to last year, these changes reflect both the strong performance 
in role and of the Group, and progression over time to market norms. This increase in bonus opportunity is permitted by the existing 
Remuneration Policy. 1 12.5% of this bonus opportunity will be measured against financial performance and 12.5% against individual 
strategic objectives linked to five of the Group’s key strategic themes. The other Executive Directors will also have a portion of their bonus 
based on individual strategic objectives, as explained on page 89. 
In addition, the Committee approved a commensurate increase in the minimum shareholding to 125% of salary (100% in 2015). 
The Committee was also cognisant of the Policy which requires the Group Chief Executive to use that part of his bonus over 60% of base 
salary (net of tax) to buy shares until the minimum shareholding requirement has been satisfied. 
Remuneration for the new Group Finance Director
During the year David Meredith announced his wish to retire from the Group with effect from 10th May 2016. On 1 1th May 2016 Kevin Boyd 
will take over as Group Finance Director and Executive Director. Kevin Boyd’s remuneration package will be composed of a market median 
salary of £335,000, a cash contribution in lieu of pension of 25% of salary, a bonus entitlement of up to a maximum of 100% of salary and 
a PSP award of 100% of salary. No sign-on or buy-out payments were provided in respect of this recruitment. Mr Boyd will offer himself for 
election to the Board by shareholders at the AGM in 2017 .

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information
Changes for 2016
The Committee has determined that from 2016, the payment of up to 10% of an Executive Director’s bonus will be based on individual 
strategic objectives, alongside the current financial measures. These strategic objectives will be tailored to an individual’s areas of 
responsibility and communicated at the start of each year. Each measure will be subject to three possible achievement levels: fully achieved, 
partially achieved and not achieved. 
Under the PSP , for awards made from 2016, the EPS element will be based on outperformance of global industrial production rates. 
This is the basis by which we forecast growth in our long-term strategic plan and aligns with the market dynamics of our global industry. 
Further information on these changes can be found on page 99.
It is within this context that during the course of 2016 the Committee will review the Remuneration Policy, which expires in 2017 and 
consider changes. We will take account of the Group’s long-term strategic plan, feedback from shareholders, market trends and the 
changing economic environment. Following our review, the Policy will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2017 . 
Thank you for your engagement and continued support. We were pleased that the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration received 
support of 97 .5% at our AGM in May 2015. As a Committee we remain focused on setting demanding incentive targets to ensure pay and 
performance are appropriately aligned, while fully disclosing details on performance and objectives each year. At this time the Committee 
is satisfied that the Remuneration Policy continues to reflect the interests of shareholders and aligns Executive Director remuneration with 
Company strategy, while allowing the Group to attract and retain motivated and talented individuals.

Strategic alignment
The Committee ensures that the remuneration paid to the Executive Directors is closely aligned to the Group strategy. In June 2015 at an 
off-site meeting the Board reviewed the Strategic Plan approved in 2014, to ensure it reflected the changing economic environment.
This Strategic Plan is used to set individual strategic objectives for the Executive Directors and, from this, bonus targets are agreed and 
approved by the Committee. This process forms part of the annual Board calendar, with the bonus targets approved in the early part of 
the financial year. The Group’s strategic themes are set out on page 22.

Increases for the Executive Directors were similar to the average increase for UK employees in 2015 but also took into account market 
positioning, Company and individual performance and returns to shareholders over the period. Higher salary increases were awarded for 
Nicholas Anderson and Jay Whalen in view of the excellent performance of both these individuals and their contribution to the Group, and 
in recognition of the fact that both salaries were below the market median for such roles in our sector. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Annual bonus
Executive Directors participate in the annual bonus plan, which rewards Executive Directors for financial performance both at Group level 
and, where appropriate, the division for which they are responsible. Targets are reviewed annually to ensure continuing alignment with 
strategy and are agreed at the start of the year. Resulting awards are determined following the end of the financial year by the Committee, 
based on performance against these targets.
Achievement of target performance results in a bonus of 60% of salary, increasing to 100% of salary for maximum performance. 
Bonus payments are subject to clawback for up to three years following payment. Circumstances that may result in a clawback include 
financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
The table below sets out the performance measures that each of the Executive Directors’ bonus awards were subject to:

Group operating profit (65%)
Group ROCE (35%)
N.H. Daws
J.L. Whalen
Group operating profit (35%)
Group ROCE (35%)
Divisional operating profit (30%)
The performance measures are adjusted to reflect certain non-operating items including the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible 
assets and exceptional reorganisational costs and to exclude any profit contribution and the impact of the start-up company in India.
2015 was a good year for the Group which delivered earnings growth, increased operating profit margin and dividend to shareholders. 
The annual bonus payments to Executive Directors ranged between 61.39% and 77 .40% of salary. The bonus is payable in cash where 
the relevant Executive Director has met the share ownership requirement, otherwise that part of the bonus over 60% of base salary (net of 
tax) must be used to buy shares until the shareholding requirement has been met. This is the case with the Group Chief Executive whose 
shareholding requirement has now been increased to 125% of base salary.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Committee makes an annual conditional award of shares to each Executive Director under the PSP . Prior to award, the Committee 
reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching. For financial measures this includes a 
review of analysts’ forecasts. PSP awards are subject to malus (reduction in the amount of deferred and as yet unpaid compensation) and 
clawback (reimbursement of compensation that has already been paid) for up to three years following the award, and can be applied during 
a holding period. Circumstances that may result in a clawback include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus 
payments or gross misconduct. 
In normal circumstances, the maximum award under the PSP is 100% of base salary but, in exceptional circumstances, this may be 
increased to 150% of base salary. Vesting is based on two performance conditions measured over a three year period, which have been 
chosen as they are aligned with our strategy:
 – TSR performance relative to a comparator group
 – Aggregate EPS relative to target aggregate EPS. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

No shares acquired under the ESOP are subject to performance measures as the aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding 
in the Company by all eligible UK employees. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

1.2 Pension (audited)
Jay Whalen is a member of the Spirax Sarco Inc. defined benefit plan. The benefit paid under normal retirement from the USA defined 
benefit plan is a single life annuity equal to the number of years of service multiplied by the sum of 1.0% of pensionable salary up to social 
security covered compensation, plus 1.45% of pensionable salary in excess of social security covered compensation. Final average salary 
is the average of the highest pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement up to a ceiling. Jay Whalen’s final average 
salary is higher than the salary ceiling as at 31st December 2015. 
Jay Whalen’s defined benefit plan arrangements are as follows:

  This year the value of pension has been calculated based on a factor of 20 in line with that required under the disclosure regulations. 
3
 This is a non-contributory plan so J.L. Whalen paid zero contributions into the defined benefit plan over the year.
The following additional information is provided:
 – Upon death in service: a spouse’s pension equal to one-half of the member’s pension, based on pensionable service to the date of 
death, is payable. After payment of the pension commences the accrued pension shown has no attaching spouse’s pension. However, 
at retirement there is an option to reduce the member’s pension to provide for a spouse’s pension after death. 
 – Early retirement rights: after leaving the service of the Company, Jay Whalen has the right to draw his accrued pension at any time 
after his 65th birthday with no reduction. In addition, he has the right to commence his pension earlier if he meets the age and service 
requirements, with the pension being reduced. The annual reductions for early retirement are 3% for each year from age 65 to age 60 
and 5% for each year from age 60 to earliest retirement age. 
 – Pension increases: the pension has no guaranteed increases. Spirax Sarco Inc. has the discretion to provide increases. 
 – Other discretionary benefits: additionally, Jay Whalen benefited from Company contributions to a USA defined contribution pension plan 
and to a 401k plan. The total amount contributed by the Group was $89,330. 
David Meredith became a deferred member of an HMRC registered, contributory defined benefit scheme, the Spirax-Sarco Executives 
Retirement Benefits Scheme on 27th February 2015 and, therefore stopped accruing any pension benefits within the defined benefit 
scheme at that date. The benefit paid under normal retirement is a pension based on 1/60th of final pensionable salary for each year of 
pensionable service to 31st March 201 1 and 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service after 31st March 201 1 to 
27th February 2015, with final pensionable salary defined as basic annual salary over the last 12 months of service. David Meredith accrued 
pro-rata additional service at a rate which would have given a further two and a half years of service at age 62½ based on 1/60th accrual if 
he had remained in service until age 62½.
David transferred his pension benefits out of the defined benefit scheme in April 2015, extinguishing his benefits under the defined benefit 
scheme, so his actual accrued pension at 31st December 2015 was zero. Below is shown the amount he would have had if he had stayed 
a deferred member until 31st December 2015.

  D.J. Meredith paid zero contributions into the defined benefit scheme over the year having elected in 2011 to reduce the accrual rate from 1/60th to 1/80th.
In lieu of pension benefits, David Meredith now receives 25% of his basic salary in cash, which in the period 1st March 2015 to 
31st December 2015 amounted to £68,021. 
Neil Daws became a deferred member of an HMRC registered, contributory defined benefit scheme, the Spirax-Sarco Executives 
Retirement Benefits Scheme, with effect from 31st December 2012, and is, therefore, no longer accruing any pension benefits within 
the defined benefit scheme. In lieu of pension benefits, Neil Daws now receives 25% of his basic salary in cash, which in the year ended

  The mid-market price of the shares on 6th March 2012 was 2006.0p. 33.06% of the PSP award vested on 2nd March 2015 as the performance measures applicable were partly met. During the 
performance period 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2014, the TSR performance of the Company resulted in 55.1% vesting of this element. However, the EPS performance fell below the required 
threshold resulting in 0.0% vesting of this element. The PSP award vested in the form of shares. The mid-market price of the shares on 2nd March 2015 was 3192.0p, and the actual price at vesting 
was 3199p. The 2012 awards vested in the form of whole shares. As noted in the previous two years, the 2010 awards that vested in 2013 and the 2011 awards that vested in 2014 took the form of

1.11 Changes for 2016
Executive Director Remuneration
With effect from 1st January 2016, the Executive Directors’ salaries have been increased by an average of 3.8%. Increases for the broader 
UK employee population were on average 2%, increasing in accordance with internal guidelines for top performers. The increases for 
Executive Directors, like those for the broader UK employee population, took account of both individual performance and market data, 
to ensure that salaries remain competitively positioned in the market.
Base salaries: 
– N.J. Anderson:  £515,000 (4. 1%)
– D.J. Meredith:  £336,500 (3. 1%)
– N.H. Daws:  £302,500 (3. 1%)
– J.L. Whalen:  £282,000 (5.0%)
As noted in the Chairman’s statement, the Group Chief Executive will receive an increase in his annual bonus opportunity, moving to 125% 
of base salary, with effect from 1st January 2016. This change, in combination with the increase in salary, reflects the strong individual 
performance demonstrated by Nicholas Anderson since his appointment two years ago and the performance of the Group as a whole. 
There are no changes to the bonus opportunity for the other Executive Directors.
Bonus targets for 2016 are not disclosed because they are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive. The targets will be 
retrospectively reported in the Annual report on remuneration next year.
From 2016, the payment of up to 10% of an Executive Director’s bonus opportunity will be based on individual strategic objectives, alongside 
the current financial measures. These individual strategic objectives will be tailored to an individual’s areas of responsibility and agreed at the 
start of the year. Each measure will be subject to three possible achievement levels: fully achieved, partially achieved and not achieved.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees 
Effective from 1st January 2016, the Non-Executive Director basic fee was increased in line with the average UK employee salary increase 
of 2%. The fee for Committee chairmanship was increased by £300 to £9,000 and the Senior Independent Director’s fee from from £2,000 
to £5,000. The Chairman’s fee was increased by 5%.
Spirax-Sarco Performance Share Plan (PSP)
EPS growth calculation
From 2016, the EPS element of the PSP will be based on growth in excess of global industrial production growth rates, often referred to in 
our industry as “Global IP” rather than UK RPI. Global IP* is a measure that the Board and management have used for some time as there 
is well documented evidence that it is the best predictor of the global and industrial markets within which Spirax Sarco operates. For these 
reasons, IP was used in the formulation of the long-term strategic plan and targets for EPS growth approved by the Board. As a result, 
the Committee is of the view it makes sense to incorporate Global IP into our Long-Term Incentive Plan, as a means of better aligning the 
assessment of performance against our long-term strategic plan and market dynamics within our industry. The Committee has reviewed 
the historical and projected data (2007-2020), including Spirax Sarco’s own performance, market benchmarks and analysts’ consensus 
to determine a performance range associated with this new benchmark growth rate that remains sufficiently challenging across various 
market environments. Accordingly, threshold vesting will occur for exceeding IP by 2% per annum, increasing on a straight line basis to full 
vesting for exceeding IP by 8% per annum.
* The IP data source will be the CHR Metals Global IP index providing data, incorporating over 90% of global industrial output.

1.12 Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
Operation of the Remuneration Committee in 2015
Membership and attendance
Each of the Committee members is an independent Non-Executive Director and thus bring independence to all aspects of Board 
remuneration and the application of professional advice to matters relating to remuneration.
During 2015, the Committee was chaired by Krishnamurthy Rajagopal, and the members comprised: Jamie Pike, Trudy Schoolenberg and 
Clive Watson, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.
In 2015 the Committee met four times and all members attended each meeting.
Advisers to the Committee
During 2015, the Committee sought advice and information from Bill Whiteley, the Chairman, Nicholas Anderson, the Group Chief 
Executive, and Frank Richardson, the Group Human Resources Director. None of the invitees participated in any discussions regarding their 
own remuneration or fees. The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee received external advice from Willis Towers Watson, who were appointed by the Committee and provided 
material advice to the Committee on various matters such as Executive remuneration levels and structure, performance updates in 
respect of the PSP , the Remuneration report and attendance at Committee meetings. Willis Towers Watson’s fees in respect of these 
services totalled £27 ,540 in 2015. In addition, Willis Towers Watson work with management on other matters relating to remuneration 
with the approval of the Committee. A separate advisory team within Willis Towers Watson provides support and advice to management 
on pensions and other employee benefit-related matters. The Committee is of the opinion that the advice received is objective and 
independent, given that Willis Towers Watson are a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, the manner in 
which advice is delivered and the separate teams that advise management more generally.
In 2015, Baker & McKenzie LLP provided legal advice to the Company (which was available to the Committee). Legal fees relate to advice 
provided to the Company and not the Committee, and are charged on a time-cost basis.

2.1 Remuneration Policy
The table below summarises the Remuneration Policy which will take effect, if approved, from the AGM to be held on 20th May 2014.
Element Purpose and link to 
strategy
Operation Performance 
measures
Maximum potential 
value
Fixed elements of Executive Director remuneration
Base salary To enable the 
Group to attract, 
retain and motivate 
high-performing 
Executive Directors 
of the calibre required 
to meet the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
 Reviewed annually by the Committee, taking into account:
–  Scale, scope and complexity of the role
–  Skills and experience of the individual
–  Wider workforce comparisons
–  Market benchmarking, within a defined external 
comparator group. The Committee uses this information 
with caution, given the limited number of direct 
comparators and to avoid remuneration inflation as a 
result of benchmarking exercises with no corresponding 
improvement in performance.
The Committee considers the impact of any base salary 
increase on the total remuneration package.
 Reviews take into 
account Company and 
individual performance.
Ordinarily, salary 
increases will not 
exceed the average 
increase awarded to 
other Group employees. 
The maximum value 
of any annual increase 
in Executive Director 
salaries will be capped 
at country of residence 
inflation plus 5%. 
The Committee may 
award increases above 
this level, subject to a 
maximum of country of 
residence inflation plus 
10%, in circumstances 
such as (i) where a new 
recruit or promoted 
Executive Director’s 
salary has been set 
lower than the market 
level for such a role, 
or (ii) where there is a 
significant increase in the 
size and responsibilities 
of the Executive 
Director’s role.
Pension To offer market 
competitive levels of 
pension and benefit.
To attract and retain 
individuals with the 
personal attributes, 
skills and experience 
required to deliver 
Group strategy.
For eligible Executive Directors who joined the UK Company 
before 2001 the Company provides a UK defined benefits 
pension scheme (DB scheme) or cash alternative allowance.
For UK nationals who joined the UK Company after 2001 
the Company provides a defined contribution pension 
arrangement (DC plan) and/or contributions to a private 
pension and/or a cash allowance.
Executive Directors who have transferred internally from 
overseas may continue to participate in home country 
pension arrangements and/or receive a cash allowance.
N/A For DB scheme as per 
actuarial value.
For all other 
arrangements the 
total contribution to all 
pension arrangements 
will comprise no more 
than 25% of base salary.
No element other 
than base salary is 
pensionable.
Common 
benefits
To provide market 
competitive benefits.
To enable the 
Executive Directors to 
undertake their roles 
through ensuring their 
wellbeing and security.
The Company provides common benefits including:
–  Company car and associated running costs or cash 
alternative allowance
– Private health insurance
– Telecommunications and computer equipment
– Life assurance
– Long-term disability insurance.
N/A The aggregate maximum 
cash value of providing 
all common benefits will 
not exceed 20% of  
base salary.

Mobility- 
related 
benefits
To ensure that 
Executive Directors 
who have relocated 
nationally or 
internationally are 
compensated for costs 
incurred.
The Company will pay all reasonable expenses for the Executive 
Director to relocate on appointment. Costs will primarily be 
dependent on geographical location and family size. 
The Company will pay all reasonable expenses for repatriation 
of the Executive Director and his/her family to the original home 
country at the end of their assignment and/or employment.
Executive Directors are personally responsible for all taxes 
and social charges incurred in the home and host locations 
as a result of their appointment. T o ensure that Executive 
Directors who relocate internationally are able to fulfil their tax 
obligations in the home and host countries the Company will 
pay for reasonable tax advice and filing support in relation to 
work-related income for international Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are reimbursed under a T ax T reaty 
Adjustment for any double tax they might be liable for as a result 
of being subject to home country and host country taxation 
typically for days worked in the home location. 
Executive Directors are not entitled to tax equalisation.
N/A Based on individual 
circumstances and 
subject to written 
agreement.
Maximum values will 
not exceed the normal 
market practice of 
companies of a similar 
size and nature at the 
time of relocation.
Annual 
bonus
To incentivise and 
reward performance 
against selected KPIs 
which are directly 
linked to business 
strategy.
To recognise 
performance through 
variable remuneration 
and enable the 
Company to flexibly 
control its cost base 
and react to events and 
market circumstances.
To ensure a significant 
proportion of Executive 
Director remuneration 
is directly linked to 
business performance.
Measures, targets and their relative weightings are reviewed 
regularly by the Committee to ensure continuing alignment 
with strategic objectives, and will be detailed in the relevant 
Annual report on remuneration. In 2012 and 2013, the target 
was 60% and the maximum was 100% of base salary.
Bonus is based largely or entirely on the achievement of 
challenging financial performance measures, which have 
been selected to ensure the Company is focused on its 
strategic objectives.
Bonus is delivered in cash. Executive Directors must use 
that part of the bonus over 60% of base salary (net of tax) to 
buy shares until the shareholding guidelines have been met. 
Purchase to be made within 12 months of bonus receipt.
Bonus is subject to clawback for up to three years following 
payment. Circumstances include financial misstatement, 
erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or 
gross misconduct. 
The Committee can adjust some performance targets to 
reflect certain non-operating items such as the amortisation 
of acquisition-related intangible assets and exceptional 
reorganisational costs, and to reflect the inclusion of 
Associate companies. These adjustments are mechanical 
rather than discretionary.
Subject to the 
Committee’s 
judgement, 
performance measures 
and their respective 
targets are set at a 
Group or divisional 
level depending on the 
Executive Director’s 
role.
Any measure can 
be incorporated at 
the Committee’s 
discretion provided 
it is clearly aligned to 
the Group’s strategic 
objectives, subject to 
the requirement that 
financial measures will 
account for a minimum 
of 90% of bonus 
opportunity, with up to 
10% being available for 
sustainability or other 
strategic measures. 
The weighting of each 
component will be 
chosen specifically to 
reflect the Executive 
Director’s role.
Threshold: 0% of salary.
T arget: 75% of salary (60% 
in 2014).
Maximum: 125% of salary 
(100% in 201 4).
Or such lower sum 
as determined by the 
Committee.

Governance Report
Remuneration: 
Remuneration Policy report 2015 continued
2.2 Notes to the policy table
2.2 (i) Outstanding incentive awards
Details of outstanding incentive awards granted to Executive Directors prior to the Policy coming into force, including awards granted 
in 2013, and details of the performance targets are set out on pages 84 to 87 of the Annual report on remuneration 2013.
All incentive awards granted prior to this Policy coming into force will continue on their existing terms including the exercise of discretion 
to amend such awards.
2.2 (ii) Remuneration Policy for other employees
The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level 
of experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels. The most senior managers in the business (approximately 
80 people globally) participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors. 
Target and maximum potential values are lower and determined by the grade of the manager’s role. Performance targets are based on an 
appropriate combination of Group, divisional and local operating company financial measures. Contractual terms and benefits for the wider 
workforce are subject to local employment legislation and best practice.
2.2 (iii) Measure selection and the target setting process
Measures are selected taking into account the key strategic priorities of the Company, shareholder expectations and factors that sit within 
an individual’s span of control.
Targets are set with reference to internal and external forecasts to ensure that they are realistic, yet sufficiently stretching. An appropriate mix 
of long and short-term targets will be used, informed by the nature of the measure.
2.3 External directorships
Directors are permitted to hold external directorships in order to broaden their experience, to the benefit of the Company. 
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the Director may retain any fees paid in respect of such directorships. 
The Board ensures compliance by Directors with Code provision B.3.
2.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration
When appointing external hires or when promoting executives, or an Executive Director, internally, the Committee will continue to act in the 
best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy. The main elements of the Remuneration Policy 
for Executive Director appointments are:
 – Base salary will be set on appointment taking into account the factors set out in the policy table, but also the individual’s experience. 
Depending on an individual’s prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned 
over time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role. In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the 
“normal” rate of annual salary increase set out in the policy table.
 – On-going annual incentive pay opportunity will not exceed 275% of salary, in line with the maximums stated in the policy table (up to 
125% of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 150% of salary under the PSP). In the year of appointment an off-cycle award 
under the PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
 – In addition to the standard elements of remuneration, on the appointment of an external candidate, the Committee reserves the right to 
buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate. The terms of such awards would 
be informed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms (for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were 
subject to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons). It is the intention of the Committee that on an “expected” basis, 
the value of the awards being made would not exceed those being forfeited. Awards would be made either through the existing share 
plans or in accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.
 – When an internal appointment to the Board is made, any pre-existing obligations may be honoured by the Committee and payment will 
be permitted under this Remuneration Policy. 
 – For Executive Director internal promotions, salary will be capped at that of the incumbent Group Chief Executive.
The Committee shall have discretion to grant one-off cash or share-based awards to Executive Directors pursuant to the Listing Rules. 
The Committee will exercise this discretion only in exceptional circumstances, where it determines that such an award is necessary 
to secure the recruitment or retention of an Executive Director and where the Committee determines that it is in the best interests of 
the Company to do so. Any one-off award will be subject to a maximum of 100% of salary and will be performance-related. In such 
circumstances, the Company will disclose a full explanation of the detail and rationale for the one-off award. The Committee does 
not expect to have to make any one-off awards as a matter of course, and this power has been included in the policy to cater for any 
exceptional and genuinely unforeseen circumstances, such as a grant to a key individual where it is vital to retain them in the business.
Details of the remuneration for any new Chairman or Executive Director appointed to the Board will be disclosed on a timely basis on 
the Group’s website, www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com.

2.5 Service agreements and termination policy
The Company’s policy on service agreements and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. Service agreements 
are designed to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned. Executive Directors’ service agreements are kept 
at the Company’s headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are 
terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months’ notice. In the event of termination or resignation, and subject 
to business reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period. All Directors are subject 
to election (if newly appointed in the year) or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the 
Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit/deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, 
in the 12 months following the cessation of employment. 
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 75 to 77 . There is no 
contractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP , until individual participation, level of award, 
measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an 
initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Appointments may be terminated by the Company or individual with 
one month’s notice. 
Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013
The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below. The Group 
Chief Executive’s service agreement has been updated to reflect latest best practice. In the event of a material change in role, function 
or responsibilities, Executive Directors’ agreements will be reviewed and will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements 
outlined below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company
Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain 
circumstances
No additional termination payment if notice worked
If notice only part worked/part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice
Otherwise 12 months’ base salary only 
Company discretion to pay in lieu of notice in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control, when a lump 
sum will be paid
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits, excluding long-term incentives, earned in new 
paid employment in that period 
No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or PSP . See page 80
Garden leave clause
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or 
suppliers
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, 
such as gross misconduct or financial misstatement
Clawback Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback for up to three years following award 
Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct
Executive Directors’ legacy agreements
Within the legacy agreements of Executive Directors, termination of agreements is subject to a 12 month notice period. Where payment 
is made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity (based on an average of 
the preceding three years’ bonus payments) is subject to the Committee’s discretion, with the power to reduce the amount to reflect 
performance on the part of the Executive Director which is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory. On termination of such 
an Executive Director’s service agreement, the Committee will take into account the departing Executive Director’s need to mitigate 
his or her loss when determining the amount of bonus. Payment will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into 
account individual performance in order to ensure that there will be no “payments for failure”. In any event, payments will be subject to 
clawback provisions. 
Executive Directors’ service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence 
of certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct or financial misstatement.

Governance Report
Remuneration: 
Remuneration Policy report 2015 continued
While the Executive Directors’ service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an 
offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not. The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for 
the Board and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors’ service agreements 
would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors. Executive Directors’ legacy agreements are summarised in the 
table below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company
Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain 
circumstances
No additional termination payment if notice worked 
If notice only part worked/part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice
Otherwise 12 months’ base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the period plus the 
average of the prior three years’ annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the amount of the bonus that would 
otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be 
below the required standards, provided that termination by the Company does not occur within 12 months of a change of control
Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump sum will be paid
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, earned in new 
paid employment in that period 
No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP . See below
Garden leave clause
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or 
suppliers 
Clawback Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback for up to three years following award
Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct
Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans
Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a “good leaver” (ie where the cessation of employment is 
due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he/she works being disposed of where the ending of 
employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause), payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets 
are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules. If the Executive Director is not a “good leaver” it is expected that no bonus will 
be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules. Any awards granted within 
six months prior to termination (or the giving or receiving of notice) will lapse. Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of 
employment (but prior to the end of the performance period) will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a “good leaver”.
In the case of a “good leaver” the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committee’s discretion. This is 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the 
shortening of the performance period. 
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a “good leaver” where the ending of employment is not for cause, 
the number of shares vested may be reduced (including to zero) by the Committee in its absolute discretion. 
If an Executive Director ceases employment (or notice is given) on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which 
the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a “good leaver”, his/her award will be 
preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his/her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a “good 
leaver”, his/her award will lapse on the earlier of his/her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
Change of control
Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to (i) a lump sum payment in lieu of 
notice and (ii) receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years’ bonus payments (without 
any reduction for performance).
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance 
targets are met at the date of the event. Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis. The Committee may, at its 
discretion, increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.

2.6 Illustrations of application of the Remuneration Policy
Under the Remuneration Policy, a significant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Company’s performance. Below we 
illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and 
below threshold. 
The scenarios, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are defined as follows:
Element
Fixed pay, benefits and ESOP Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises:
– Base salary effective 1st January 2014
 – Benefits value based on 2013 disclosure
– Pension value (DB 2013 as reported; cash allowance: rate applied to 2014 salary)
 – ESOP participation of up to £1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors
Percentage of base salary
Below threshold On target Maximum
Annual bonus (% of salary) 0% 60% 100%
PSP
1
 (% of salary at award) 0% 25% 100%
1
  A level of 25% vesting for “on target” performance is equivalent to threshold performance under the PSP, which the Committee believes to be a fair assumption for on target performance given the 
approach taken to setting performance targets.

Governance Report
2.7 Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
When determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay of employees across the Group. 
When conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across 
the Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration. The Remuneration Policy 
was drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Group’s senior managers. 
The responsibility for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group 
Chief Executive and the responsible Executive Director.
To ensure consistency in Remuneration Policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate 
in the PSP . The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to 
strengthen the development of the business.
2.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views
In developing and reviewing the Company’s Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks 
and takes into account the range of views of shareholders. The Committee Chairman actively engages with institutional shareholders when 
appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and implementing the Company’s Remuneration Policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative 
bodies more generally. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered 
as part of the Company’s annual review of Remuneration Policy. At the AGM in 2013, the advisory vote on the 2012 Directors’ remuneration 
report received 96.3% in favour. 
The views of shareholders have been helpful and constructive and assisted in the development of a pro-forma Executive Director service 
agreement which has been applied to Nicholas Anderson on his appointment as Group Chief Executive and which will apply to all new 
appointments. Specifically in relation to the termination arrangements, the revised service agreement restricts any termination payment to 
12 months’ base pay. This applies to the new Group Chief Executive service agreement and, in the event of a material change in the role, 
function or responsibilities, existing Executive Directors’ service agreements will be reviewed and changed to meet the new standard.
The Remuneration Policy report 2015 is reproduced exactly as published in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts and as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
Therefore, as the content remains the same the page numbers, examples and illustrations are necessarily historical.

companies and senior officers.
The Company has also provided each 
Director with an indemnity to the extent 
permitted by law in respect of the liabilities 
incurred as a result of their holding office as 
a Director of the Company.
Appointment and 
replacement of Directors
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Code, the 
Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. 
All Directors will seek re-election at the AGM 
other than David Meredith who retires at the 
end of the meeting. The Directors stand for 
re-election on an annual basis at each AGM, 
in accordance with the Code. The Board 
considers that all Directors standing for 
re-election continue to perform effectively 
and demonstrate commitment to their 
roles. In addition, the Board considers that 
all Directors have the necessary skills and 
experience, as set out in their biographies 
on pages 68 and 69.
Conflicts of interest
Under the Companies Act 2006 and 
the provisions of the Company’s Articles 
of Association, the Board is required to 
consider potential conflicts of interest. 
The Company has established formal 
procedures for the disclosure and review 
of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of 
interest which the Directors may have and 
for the authorisation of such matters of 
conflict by the Board. To this end the Board 
considers and, if appropriate, authorises 
any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of 
interest as they arise and reviews any such 
authorisation annually. New Directors are 
required to declare any conflicts, or potential 
conflicts, of interest to the Board at the first 
Board meeting after his or her appointment. 
The Board believes that the procedures 
established to deal with conflicts of interest 
are operating effectively.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association 
are available from Companies House 
in the UK or by writing to the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary at the 
Group’s registered office in Cheltenham. 
Amendments to the Articles of Association 
can only be made by means of a special 
resolution at a general meeting of the 
shareholders of the Company.
Share capital
As at 26th February 2016 there were no 
treasury shares held by the Company.

meetings of the Company. Except as set out 
in the Articles of Association or in applicable 
legislation, there are no restrictions on the 
transfer of shares in the Company and there 
are no restrictions on the voting rights in the 
Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any

the transfer of shares or the exercise of any 
voting rights attached to the shares.
Powers of the Directors and

Subject to the provisions of the Articles 
of Association, the Directors may 
exercise all the powers of the Company. 
A shareholder’s authority for the purchase

Significant contracts
The Company is not a party to any 
significant agreements that take effect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid.
There are provisions in the Executive 
Directors’ service agreements which 
state that following a takeover or change 
of control, if the Executive Director’s 
employment is terminated then both salary/
benefits and a sum in respect of lost future 
bonus opportunity become payable as a 
lump sum.
The Strategic Report contains all the

are no contractual arrangements that need 
to be disclosed which are essential to the 
business of the Group.

Report, as far as each Director is aware,

which the Company’s auditor is unaware.
Each Director has taken all such steps as he 
or she ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish

that information. 
This confirmation is given and should

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information
Research and development 
The Group continues to devote significant 
resources to the development and the 
updating and expansion of its range of 
products in order to remain at the forefront 
of its world markets. The Group steam 
specialties R&D function, which is based in 
Cheltenham, and the Watson-Marlow Fluid 
Technology Group R&D function, located 
in Falmouth, are tasked with improving 
the Group’s pipeline of new products, 
decreasing the time to launch, expanding 
the Group’s addressable market and 
realising additional sales. Further information 
on the expenditure on R&D is contained in 
Note 1 on page 126. The amount of R&D 
expenditure capitalised, and the amount 
amortised, in the year, are given in Note 12 
on page 137 .
Treasury and foreign 
exchange
The Group has in place appropriate 
treasury policies and procedures, which 
are approved by the Board. The treasury 
function manages interest rates for both 
borrowings and cash deposits for the 
Group and is also responsible for ensuring 
there is sufficient headroom against any 
banking covenants contained within its 
credit facilities, and for ensuring there are 
appropriate facilities available to meet the 
Group’s strategic plans.
In order to mitigate and manage exchange 
rate risk, the Group routinely enters into 
forward contracts and continues to monitor 
exchange rate risk in respect of foreign 
currency exposures.
All these treasury policies and procedures 
are regularly monitored and reviewed. 
It is the Group’s policy not to undertake 
speculative transactions which create 
additional exposures over and above those 
arising from normal trading activity.
Political donations
The Group has a policy of not making 
political donations and no political donations 
were made during the year (2014: nil).
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of our greenhouse gas emissions 
can be found on page 61 of the 
Sustainability report.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the main trends and factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance 
and position, and the financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities, are set 
out in the Financial review on pages 50 
to 53. In addition Note 28 on page 153 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital, its 
financial risk management objectives, its 
financial instruments and hedging activities, 
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources together with contracts with a 
diverse range of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and 
industries. No one customer accounts 
for more than 1% of Group turnover. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current 
uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence and 
that the Directors intend to do so, for at 
least one year from the date the Financial 
Statements were signed, and that therefore 
it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report.
Pages 109 to 1 12 form the Directors’ 
Report for the purposes of the Companies 
Act 2006.
The Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report were approved by the Board on 
2nd March 2016.
Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, 
the Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group over a three-year period, taking 
into account the Group’s current financial 
position, business strategy, the Board’s 
risk appetite and the potential impacts of 
the principal risks, outlined on pages 32 
and 33 of the Strategic Report. Based on 
this assessment, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the three-year period to 
31st December 2018. 
The Board believes that a three-year 
viability assessment period is appropriate 
as the timeframe is covered by the Group’s 
strategic plan; takes into account the nature 
of the Group’s principal risks, a number of 
which are external and have the potential 
to impact over short time periods; and is 
in alignment with the Group’s bank loan 
terms. While the Board has no reason to 
believe that the Group will not be viable 
over a longer period, given the inherent 
uncertainty involved, the Board believes that 
a three-year period presents readers of the 
Annual Report with a reasonable degree 
of confidence while still providing a longer-
term perspective. 
In making their assessment, the Directors 
completed a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity, and undertook sensitivity and 
stress testing to determine the potential 
impacts of the occurrence of one or more 
of the principal risks on sales, profit, margin 
and cash. In addition to completing an 
impact assessment of the principal risks, 
the Directors considered the probability 
of occurrence of the principal risks, the 
Company’s ability to control them and the 
effectiveness of mitigating actions. 
The Group’s resilient business model has 
proven strong and defensive in the long term 
and has enabled the business to prosper, 
even in challenging market conditions. 
The diversity of our end user markets and 
customers, broad product range, wide 
geographic spread, high replacement 
revenue streams and large base of installed 
equipment worldwide, together with our 
effective direct sales business model, 
enhances the viability of the Group in the 
face of adverse economic conditions and/
or political uncertainty, as does our ability to 
self-generate business through identifying 
solutions to our customers’ difficult process 
challenges and our ability to adjust our 
cost base.
Whilst no Board can ever fully foresee all 
possible risks facing the business in the 
future, the Directors are of the view that 
a robust assessment was undertaken of 
the severe but plausible scenarios that 
may feasibly impact upon the business 
over the next three years. Furthermore, 
the Board remains confident in the 
Group’s risk management process and 
the risk mitigation actions taken to address 
identified risks.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
“Our Annual Report 2015: a true and fair view of the Group.”
Board of Directors
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare consolidated Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each 
financial year in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law.
In addition, by law the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Parent Company and of their profit 
or loss for that period. In preparing these 
Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 – properly select and apply 
accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 – provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that its Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Group’s website, 
www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

implied by such forward-looking statements. 
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc and its 
Directors accept no liability to third parties in 
respect of this Report save as would arise 
under English law.
Any liability to a person who has 
demonstrated reliance on any untrue or 
misleading statement or omission shall be 
determined in accordance with schedule 
10A of the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000. Schedule 10A contains limits on 
the liability of the Directors of Spirax-Sarco 
Engineering plc and their liability is solely to 
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
 – the Financial Statements, prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 – the Annual Report 2015 taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model 
and strategy.

Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis 
of accounting contained within Note 1 to the Financial Statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the Governance Report on page 1 1 1.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
•  the Directors' confirmation on page 1 1 1 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
•  the disclosures on pages 32 to 33 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
•  the Directors’ statement in Note 1 to the Financial Statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over 
a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements;
•  the Director's explanation on page 1 1 1 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so 
and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of 
the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided 
any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards. 1 1 7

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
The Audit Committee has requested that while not required under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we include in 
our report any significant key observations in respect of these assessed risks of material misstatement.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
Revenue recognition
The risk in revenue recognition focuses on the 
recognition of revenue for product by reference 
to contracted shipping terms and the transfer 
of ownership for product despatch and delivery 
spanning the year-end. There is significant volume 
of trade in the final quarter of the year. There is 
also a focus on any significant new contracts to 
determine the appropriate recognition of revenue. 
Refer to Note 1 for the Group’s Revenue 
Recognition Policy.
We performed walkthroughs to understand the adequacy of the 
design and implementation of the controls relating to the revenue 
cycles and, at significant components, we produced revenue 
flow-charts to map out the end to end controls and processes in 
place. We reviewed the product despatch cycle across the year-
end period and sampled a selection of items confirming the date 
of transfer of ownership was in line with the revenue recognition 
date in accordance with the terms of trade with customers.
We performed testing on a sample of contracts, including 
new contracts, to determine the appropriateness of the 
revenue recognition.
We noted no 
material instances 
of inappropriate 
revenue recognition 
arising in 
our testing.
Inventory obsolescence
Inventory of £93 million at 31st December 2015 
(31st December 2014: £98 million) is a material 
balance for the Group. There is risk surrounding 
the obsolescence of inventory in niche markets 
and industries where local demand fluctuates 
over periods. There are judgements required in 
determining inventory provisions as they require 
assessment based on past and future product 
usage and whether the provision is adequate to 
cover any obsolescence.
Refer to Note 1 for the Group’s inventory policy 
and Note 15 for the financial disclosure.
We compared the methodology applied in calculating the 
inventory obsolescence provisions to the Group’s policy and we 
challenged management’s judgement of the adequacy of the 
policy by reviewing the level of provision held across the Group. 
We reviewed a sample of provision calculations by recalculating 
the provision and testing and verifying the accuracy of the usage 
data to underlying documentation to confirm the accuracy of the 
data used in the calculation. We investigated manual override to 
the mechanical application of the Group inventory obsolescence 
provisioning policy and where applicable obtained evidence such 
as the order book or post year-end orders or sales to support 
any significant adjustments. We also considered the historical 
accuracy of management’s provisioning for inventory through 
a retrospective review of the level of provision recorded in prior 
years compared to the actual levels of stock written off. 
We noted 
no material 
inconsistencies 
through our 
testing. We concur 
that the level of 
inventory provisions 
is appropriate.
Defined benefit pension plan assumptions
At 31st December 2015 the net retirement 
benefit liability recognised in the Statement of 
financial position was £7 4 million (31st December 
2014: £76 million). There is a risk relating to the 
judgements made by management in valuing the 
defined benefit pension liabilities including the 
use of key model input assumptions including the 
discount rate, mortality assumption and inflation 
level. These variables can have a material impact 
in calculating the quantum of the retirement 
benefit liability.
Refer to Note 1 for the Group’s policy on defined 
benefit plans and Note 24 for the financial 
disclosure including the key assumptions used 
in the defined benefit pension plan valuation.
We used our internal actuarial experts to assess the key 
assumptions applied in determining the pension obligations 
for the five main schemes, and determined whether the key 
assumptions are reasonable. Testing covered 98% of defined 
benefit pension liabilities. Key assumptions assessed included 
future mortality, discount rate and inflation. Our assessment 
included reviewing available yield curves and inflation data to 
recalculate a reasonable range for the key assumptions. We 
challenged management to understand the sensitivity of changes 
in key assumptions and quantify a range of reasonable rates that 
could be used in their calculation. We tested the controls around 
participant data. Additionally we benchmarked key assumptions 
against other listed companies to check for any outliers in the 
data used.
From the work 
performed above 
we are satisfied 
that the key 
assumptions 
applied in respect 
of the valuation 
of the scheme 
assets and liabilities 
are appropriate. 1 18

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
Goodwill impairment
At 31st December 2015 the carrying value 
of goodwill was £54 million (31st December 
2014: £48 million). There is a risk relating to 
the key assumptions and assertions used by 
management to support their assessment of 
the carrying value of goodwill. Goodwill is a 
material balance on the Consolidated statement 
of financial position and there are a number 
of judgements applied in determining the 
recoverable amounts. Key assumptions include 
discount rates applied, the level of aggregation 
of individual cash generating units (CGUs) and 
the growth rates applied to forecast trading 
performance based on management’s view of 
future business prospects.
Refer to Note 1 for the Group’s policy for 
intangible assets and Note 12 for the financial 
disclosures including the key assumptions used in 
management’s impairment calculations.
We challenged the adequacy and reasonableness of the key 
assumptions used in management’s impairment calculations. 
This included specific challenge over the forecasts underpinning 
the impairment assessment. In particular, our challenge focused 
on the discount rates and growth rates, the appropriateness 
of the level of aggregation of individual cash generating units 
(CGUs) and the methodology applied. We benchmarked the 
discount rates with published rates for an external peer group. In 
addition we used our valuation specialists within the audit team to 
calculate an acceptable range of discount rates and compared 
our range to that determined by management. We challenged the 
perpetuity growth rates by benchmarking against industry and 
GDP growth rates. There are 36 CGU groups and we checked 
the CGU groupings to cash inflows and information reviewed 
by management to make decisions about their business. We 
challenged the forecast cash flows used in the model against 
historical performance and assessed historical forecasting 
accuracy. 
We also challenged management’s sensitivity analysis to assess 
whether it reflected a reasonable worst case scenario.
Having audited the assumptions within management’s 
impairment model, we checked the arithmetic accuracy and 
integrity of the model.
We concluded that 
the assumptions 
applied in the 
impairment models 
were appropriate 
and no additional 
impairments 
were identified 
from the work 
performed above.
Last year our report included a taxation risk in relation to provisions for liabilities attributed to specific uncertain tax position, this risk is not 
included in our report this year. Whilst still a significant area of audit focus, the risk in relation to taxation provisions is no longer considered to 
be material to the Group Financial Statements. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on 
page 78.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £7 .0 million (2014: £7 .3 million), which is 5% (2014: 5%) of statutory profit before tax. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £139,000 (2014: £145,000), as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit 
work at 24 (2014: 25) components. 20 (2014: 21) of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining 4 (2014: 4) were subject to specified 
audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of 
the Group’s operations at those components. These components represent the principal business units and account for 88% (2014: 93%) 
of the Group’s total assets, 7 4% (2014: 80%) of the Group’s revenue and 75% (2014: 87%) of the Group’s profit before tax. They were also 
selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit 
work at the components was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and 
ranged from £0. 1 million to £3.5 million (2014: £0. 1 million to £3.6 million). 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or 
audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit 
team visits each of the key components where the Group audit scope was focused at least once every three years and the most significant 
of them at least once a year.

Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial Statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on 
Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood 
and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an Auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the Financial Statements. In addition, we read all the Financial and Non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the consolidated Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been 
adopted by the European Union (EU).
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experiences and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. As further explained 
below, the most significant effect on the Financial Statements from 
accounting policies requiring judgement are in the areas of inventory, 
goodwill and pensions.
The major judgement made in respect of inventory is assessing the 
proportion and value of slow-moving inventory that should be written 
down in value. The Group applies a consistent provisioning policy 
across all subsidiary companies.
The judgements made in respect of goodwill are those relating to 
the key assumptions used to assess the value in use in the annual 
impairment tests. More detail about these key assumptions is 
disclosed in Note 12.
The judgements made in respect of pensions are those in assessing 
the assumptions chosen to calculate the net obligation in respect 
of defined benefit pensions. More detail is given in the Employee 
Benefits accounting policy on page 127 below.
The key estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a 
diverse range of products and customers across wide geographic 
areas and industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Further information on the Group’s business activities, performance 
and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its 
capital structure and cash flow are included in the Strategic Report 
from the inside front cover to page 63. In addition, Note 28 to the 
Financial Statements discloses details of the Group’s financial risk 
management and credit facilities.
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency, rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
The Group's income statement includes an adjustment column 
where certain non-operational items are included. The definition of 
non-operational items includes the amortisation and impairment of 
acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition and disposal-related 
costs and exceptional restructuring costs. An analysis of non-
operational items is detailed in Note 2. In 2015 adjustments included 
a loss on closure of a USA metering unit. In 2014 adjustments 
included a write down to fair value of Spirax Marshall in India.
In the current year the group has applied a number of 
amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB). Their adoption has not had a material 
impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these 
Financial Statements. The following amendments were applied:  
•  IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans in relation to employee contributions; 
•  Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle including the 
amendments to existing requirements for IFRS 8 Operating 
Segments and IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures;
•  The clarifications amended under the Annual improvements to 
IFRSs 201 1-2013 Cycle. 
Otherwise the accounting policies set out below have been 
applied consistently to both years presented in these consolidated 
Financial Statements.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, The Group 
has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU): IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; IFRS 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers; IFRS 1 1 (amendments) Accounting 
for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations; IAS 1 (amendments) 
Disclosure Initiative, IAS16 and IAS 38 (amendments) Clarification 
of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation; IAS 27 
(amendments) Equity method in Separate Financial Statements; IFRS 
10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or Contribution of Assets between 
an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture; IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and 
IAS 28 (amendments) Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation 
Exemption and Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012-2014 Cycle.   
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed 
above will have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the 
Group in future periods except IFRS 15 for which we have not done 
a detailed assessment. 
Basis of accounting
(i) Subsidiaries 
  The Group Financial Statements include the results of the 
Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiaries are 
entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group 
has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. 
(ii) Associates 
  Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. The Financial Statements include the Group’s share of 
the total recognised income and expense of Associates on an 
equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence 
commenced until the date that significant influence ceases.  126

1 Accounting policies continued
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
  Intra Group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or 
income and expenses arising from intra Group transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the Group Financial Statements. 
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with Associates are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. 
Foreign currency
(i) On consolidation 
  The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated 
into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign operations are 
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during 
the year. Where the Notes to the Group Financial Statements 
include tables reconciling movements between opening 
and closing balances, assets and liabilities are translated at 
balance sheet rates and revenue and expenses are translated 
at average rates with the exchange differences arising being 
disclosed separately. 
  Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations are taken to a separate 
translation reserve within equity. They are recycled and 
recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the 
operation. In respect of all foreign operations, any differences 
that have arisen before 1st January 2004, the date of transition 
to IFRS, are not presented as a separate component of equity.
(ii) Foreign currency transactions 
  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities at 
the balance sheet date denominated in a currency other than 
the functional currency of the entity are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the dates fair value was determined. 
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge 
of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted 
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income 
and presented in the Cash flow hedges reserve. The associated 
gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income 
statement in the period in which the transaction to which it 
relates occurs.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed 
cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been 
revalued to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition 
to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the 
revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives. Land is not depreciated. 
The principal rates are as follows:
Freehold buildings 1.5%
Plant and machinery 10–12.5%
Office furniture and fittings 10%
Office equipment 12.5–33.3%
Motor vehicles 20%
Tooling and patterns 10%
The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill 
  All business combinations after 1st January 2004 are accounted 
for by applying the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the 
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value 
of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated 
to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested 
annually for impairment (see Note 12 for more detail). In respect 
of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill is included 
on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount 
recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (GAAP). 
(ii) R&D 
  Expenditure on R&D is charged to the income statement in 
the period in which it is incurred except that development 
expenditure is capitalised where the development costs relate to 
new or substantially improved products that are subsequently to 
be released for sale and will generate future economic benefits. 
The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs and related 
expenses. Capitalised development expenditure is stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and any 
impairment losses. 
(iii) Other intangible assets 
  Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the 
Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see 
below) and any impairment losses. Annual impairment tests 
are performed on acquired intangible assets by comparing the 
carrying value with the recoverable amount, being the higher 
of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use, discounted 
at an appropriate discount rate, of future cash flows in respect 
of intangible assets for the relevant cash generating unit. 
More detail is given in Note 12.

(iv) Amortisation 
  Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other 
than goodwill, from the date they are available for use. Goodwill is 
tested for impairment annually. The principal amortisation rates 
are as follows: 
Capitalised development costs 20%
ERP systems and software 12.5–20%
Brand names and trademarks 5–20%
Manufacturing designs and core technology 6–15%
Non compete undertakings 20–50%
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring 
the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in 
bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of 
manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an 
appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating 
capacity . Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gain or 
loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases 
of inventories.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call 
deposits with an original maturity usually of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
cash flow statements.
Going concern
The statement on the going concern assumption is included within 
the Governance Report on page 1 1 1.
Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans 
  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit plans 
  The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes 
are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified 
actuaries and spread over the period during which benefit 
is expected to be derived from the employees’ services. 
The Group’s net obligation or surplus in respect of defined 
benefit pensions is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. 
Past service costs are recognised straight away. That benefit 
is discounted at rates reflecting the yields on AA credit rated 
corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the 
terms of the Group’s obligations to determine its present value. 
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance 
sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses, differences between 
the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes 
in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year they arise. Any scheme 
surplus (to the extent it is considered recoverable) or deficit is 
recognised in full in the balance sheet. 
  The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in 
a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread 
over the period which benefit is expected to be derived from 
the employees’ services, in accordance with the advice of 
qualified actuaries. 
(iii) Employee share plans 
  Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees 
under share option and share award schemes. The fair value 
of these options and awards at their date of grant is charged 
to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods with 
a corresponding increase in equity. The value of the charge is 
adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options and 
share awards vesting. 
(iv) Long-term share incentive plans 
  The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant and the 
cost spread over the vesting period. The amount recognised 
as an expense is not adjusted to reflect market based 
performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based 
performance conditions. 
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business by subsidiary 
companies to external customers, net of discounts, VAT and other 
sales-related taxes. Revenue is reduced for customer returns, 
rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods, which represent the significant 
majority of Group revenue, is recognised in the income 
statement when:
• The significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer in accordance with the contracted terms 
of sale;
• The amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably;
• The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement nor 
effective control over the goods; and
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group.
This is typically on delivery of the products. 128
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc  
Annual Report 2015
Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies continued
Revenue from projects and service contracts is recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract based on the 
fair value of goods and services provided at the balance sheet date. 
Judgements can be required to assess the stage of completion, 
although in the vast majority of projects the position is relatively easy 
to identify. The stage of completion of the contract is determined 
as follows:
• Installation fees are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of the installation, determined as the proportion of 
the total time expected to install that has elapsed at the balance 
sheet date.
• Service fees included in the price of products sold are valued 
by taking a proportion of the sales price (based on the cost of 
providing the servicing) and only recognised in revenue when the 
service is provided; and
• Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at 
the contractual rates as labour hours are delivered and direct 
expenses incurred.
As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be 
estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the 
income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the 
project or service contract. Where it is probable that total contract 
costs exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss on a project 
or service is recognised immediately.
 Leases
(i) Operating leases 
  Payments made under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. 
(ii) Finance leases 
  Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if 
the asset had been purchased outright. Assets acquired under 
finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the 
capital and interest elements of the leasing commitments are 
shown as obligations in creditors. Depreciation is charged on a 
consistent basis with similar owned assets or over the lease term 
if shorter. The interest element of the lease payment is charged 
to the income statement on a basis which produces a consistent 
rate of charge over the period of the liability. 
Taxation
The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax 
expense is recognised in the income statement unless it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive 
income, when it is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive 
income respectively. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the 
profit for the year and any adjustments in respect of previous years 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date. Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences arising between the 
tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the 
Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided 
using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date or the date that the temporary differences 
are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share capital and repurchased shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount 
of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is 
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are 
classified as treasury shares or placed in an Employee Benefit Trust 
and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Share-based benefits granted to subsidiary employees
The Company grants share-based benefits over its own 
Ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies. 
These employees provide services to the subsidiary companies. 
The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value 
of the share options granted is recognised as a capital contribution 
to the subsidiary companies. This is accounted for as an increase 
in investments with a corresponding increase in a non-distributable 
component of equity.

* 2014 recategorised to be consistent with 2015
The Group’s tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising and the effective tax rates in the various 
territories in which the Group operates.
The UK corporation tax charge is calculated after deducting tax allowable deficit reduction cash contributions to the UK post-retirement 
benefit schemes of £nil (2014: £3,366,000) covering all employees in the UK defined benefit schemes.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% on 1st April 2015. Further reductions to 19% (effective from April 2017) and then 18% 
(effective from 1st April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26th October 2015. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge 
accordingly. The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31st December 2015 have been calculated based upon rates of 20%, 19% and 18% 
in respect of deferred tax expected to reverse before 1st April 2017 , 1st April 2020 and after this date respectively. 
No UK tax (after double tax relief for underlying tax) is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries. 
The effective tax rate is calculated as a percentage of profit before tax and share of profit of Associates.

forecast information for the next financial year and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed five year forecasts. This information has 
been approved by the Board; 
• The key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows;
• Pre-tax discount rates range from 10–17% (2014: 1 1–16%);
• Short-term growth rates vary between 2–30% depending on detailed forecasts (2014: 2–7%). The short-term is defined as not more than 
five years. The 30% rate is in respect of Spirax-Sarco Colombia SAS;
• Long-term growth rates are set using IMF forecasts and vary between 0.8–5.0% (2014: 1.0–6.0%); and
• No impairments were identified as a result of this exercise. 
The principal value in use assumptions for the three largest goodwill balances were as follows:
Cash-generating unit
Pre-tax 
discount rate
Short-term 
growth rate
Long-term 
growth rate
Spirax-Sarco Mexicana 14.1% 4.0% 2.8%
Flexicon A/S Denmark 10.4% 3.0% 2.0%
MasoSine 11.5% 2.5% 1.3%
Sensitivity analysis shows that if long-term revenue growth assumptions are lowered by 1% and pre-tax discount rates raised by 1%, no 
impairment would arise. The 1% sensitivity threshold is considered a reasonable estimate of possible change. 140

Product warranty
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business. These are 
expected to be incurred in the next three years.
Legal, contractual and other
Legal, contractual and other provisions mainly comprise amounts provided against open legal and contractual disputes arising from trade 
and employment. These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent management's best 
estimate of the likely outcome. The Company has taken action to enforce its rights and protect its intellectual property rights around the world. 
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the timing and amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the 
amount provided. Management does not expect that the outcome of such proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's financial condition or results of operations.

The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements 
of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses on net investment hedges. On disposal accumulated exchange differences are recycled to 
the Income Statement. In the current year recycled losses in relation to the disposal of M&M and Spirax Marshall in India were £2, 125,000.
Cash flow hedges reserve
The reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash 
flow hedge relationships.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve records the historical repurchase of the Group’s own shares.

24 Employee benefits
Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements, which are established in accordance with local conditions and 
practices within the countries concerned. These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements
The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the Group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer 
contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employee’s pay. Contributions made to 
defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled £7 ,997 ,000 (2014: £9,07 4,000). In the UK, following the closure 
of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a defined contribution scheme.
Defined benefit arrangements
The Group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service. 
Whilst the Group’s primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material benefit schemes in the US as well as less material schemes 
elsewhere. In funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds or similar 
structures in the countries concerned.
UK defined benefit arrangements
The defined benefit schemes in the UK account for approximately half of the Group’s net balance sheet liability for defined retirement benefit 
schemes. Spirax-Sarco operates three UK schemes: the Spirax-Sarco Employees Pension Fund, the Spirax-Sarco Executives' Retirement 
Benefits Scheme and the Watson-Marlow Pension Fund. These are all final salary pension schemes. The UK schemes are closed to new 
members but are open to future accrual. There is a mix of different inflation-dependent pension increases (in payment and deferment) which 
vary from member to member according to their membership history and which scheme they are a member of. All three schemes have 
been setup under UK Law and are governed by a Trustee committee, which is responsible for the scheme’s investments, administration 
and management. A funding valuation is carried out for the Trustees of each scheme every three years by an independent firm of actuaries. 
Depending on the outcome of that valuation a schedule of future contributions is negotiated with Spirax-Sarco. Further information on the 
contribution commitments is shown in the Financial review on pages 52 to 53.
US defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a pension scheme in the US which is open to new entrants and defines the pension in terms of the highest average 
pensionable pay for any five consecutive years prior to retirement. No pension increases (in payment and deferment) are offered by this 
scheme. It also operates a post-retirement medical plan in the US, which is unfunded, as is typical for these plans.
Principal risks
The pension schemes create a number of risk exposures. Annual increases on benefits are, to a varying extent from scheme to scheme, 
dependent on inflation so the main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable are future inflation levels (including the impact of 
inflation on future salary increases) and the actual longevity of the membership. Benefits payable will also be influenced by a range of other 
factors including member decisions on matters such as when to retire and the possibility to draw benefits in different forms. A key risk is that 
additional contributions are required if the investment returns fall short of those anticipated when setting the contributions to the pension 
schemes. All pension schemes are regulated by the relevant jurisdictions. These include extensive legislation and regulatory mechanisms that 
are subject to change and may impact on the Group’s pension schemes. The IAS 19 liability measurement (DBO) and the Service Cost are 
sensitive to the actuarial assumptions made on a range of demographic and financial matters that are used to project the expected benefit 
payments, the most important of these assumptions being the future inflation and salary growth levels and the assumptions made about life 
expectation. The DBO and Service Cost are also very sensitive to the IAS 19 discount rate, which determines the discounted value of the 
projected benefit payments. The discount rate depends on market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. Investment strategies are set with 
funding rather than IAS 19 considerations in mind and do not seek to provide a specific hedge against the IAS 19 measurement of DBO.  
As a result the difference between the market value of the assets and the IAS 19 DBO may be volatile.
Sensitivity analysis to changes in discount rate and inflation are included on page 148. 146

Share Option Scheme
The Group operates equity settled share option schemes for employees, although no grants have been made since 201 1 because awards 
have been made using the Group's Performance Share Plan instead. Awards were determined by the Remuneration Committee whose 
objective was to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value. 
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the 
date of grant. For options granted before 2007 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in 
the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant. From 2007 the performance 
condition needs to be met over the three-year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant. If the condition is not met at the end of 
the three year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured using the Present Economic Value (PEV) valuation methodology. The relevant disclosures in 
respect of the share option scheme grants are set out below.

Performance Share Plan
Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent 
rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target. To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in 
shares or an option over shares. The performance criteria is split into two separate parts. For awards granted up to 2013 60% of the award 
is based on a TSR measure where the performance target is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of 
other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest 
on a sliding scale. All shares within an award will vest if the Company’s TSR is at or above the upper quartile. 25% will vest if the TSR is at the 
median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Company’s 
TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile. No shares will vest if the Company’s TSR is below the median. For awards granted up 
to 2013 the second part, amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year 
performance period. 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% 
will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting 
for actual growth between these rates. From 2014 the Remuneration Committee have changed the weighting between the TSR and EPS 
elements to 40% TSR and 60% EPS. From 2015 a change has been made to measure EPS on a point to point basis over the three year 
performance period.
Shares awarded under the Performance Share Plan have been valued using the Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology. The relevant

Employee Share Ownership Plan
UK employees are eligible to participate in the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased 
shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions. Employees are invited to join the ESOP 
when an offer is made each year. Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the 
price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules. The Company provides a matching share for each share 
purchased by the individual.
Shares issued under the ESOP have been measured using the Present Economic Value (PEV) valuation methodology. The relevant 
disclosures in respect of the Employee Share Ownership Plans are set out below.

28 Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions. The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and 
short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various 
other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout 
the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained fundamentally 
unchanged since the beginning of 2000.
Credit risk
The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector. 
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers’ credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance 
leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of 
exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this 
structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies. Such exposures arise from 
sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. Net cash flows between any two currencies 
of less than £1.0 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover. Forward cover is not taken 
out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months’ and 60% of the following 12 months’ forecast exposure.

There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis for which fair value is disclosed.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Fair value of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on discounted 
cash flow analysis using appropriate market information for the duration of the instruments. 154

Financial instruments fair value disclosure
Fair value measurements are classified into three levels, depending on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from other observable inputs for the asset or liability; and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
We consider that the derivative financial instruments fall into level 2.

The £80 million bank facility maturing in 2017 is secured on the assets of various Group companies. Covenant tests are performed twice 
annually at 30th June and 31st December. The Directors have prepared an analysis and conclude that the covenants are met.
The weighted average interest rate paid during the year was 1. 1% (2014: 1.2%).

Group total 311,139 111,978 199,161
Financial assets on which no interest is earned comprise trade and other receivables and cash in hand.
Floating rate financial assets comprise cash at bank or placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates. The average 
rate of interest received on sterling deposits during the year was nil (2014: nil).
Currency exposures
As explained above, the Group’s objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas (in other words, its 
structural currency exposures) are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation. All gains and losses 
arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total comprehensive income.
Transactional (or non-structural) exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement. 
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating 
(or “functional”) currency of the operating unit involved. At 31st December 2015 the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net 
monetary asset of £2,337 ,000 (2014: £335,000 net monetary asset) and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of £5,478,000  
(2014: net monetary asset £422,000).
At 31st December 2015, the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was nil (2014: 0. 1%) for the euro and nil (2014: nil) for 
the US dollar. 156

Cash flow hedges
The Group uses forward currency contracts to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are 
designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship. At 31st December 2015 the Group had contracts outstanding to 
purchase £7 ,304,000 and €2,438,000 with US dollars, £1,020,000 with Danish Krone, £13, 134,000 with Euros and £706,000 with Japanese 
Yen. The fair values at the end of the reporting period were a liability of £245,000 (2014: £232,000 liability). The fair value of cash flow hedges 
falls into the Level 2 category of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7 .
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using readily available 
market data.
The contractual cash flows on forward currency contracts at the reporting date are shown below, classified by maturity. The cash flows 
shown are on a gross basis and are not discounted.

It is anticipated that the cash flows will take place at the same time the corresponding forward contract matures. At this time the amount 
deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss. 
All forecast transactions which have been subject to hedge accounting during the year have occurred or are still expected to occur. 
A loss on derivative financial instruments of £13,000 (2014: £232,000) was recognised in other comprehensive income during the period. 
No amount (2014: £nil) was removed from equity during the period and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of a non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability whose acquisition or incurrence was a hedged highly probable forecast transaction.
As at 31st December 2015 no ineffectiveness has been recognised in profit or loss arising from hedging foreign currency transactions. 
Borrowing facilities
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which 
all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows:
2015 
£000
2014 
£000
Expiring in one year or less 14,949 24,009

Expiring in more than two years but no more than three years – 64,644
Expiring in more than three years – –
Total Group undrawn committed facilities 44,949 88,653
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2015 are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact 
that they were at short-term rates of interest. Fair values have been assessed as follows:
• Derivatives  
Forward exchange contracts are marked to market by discounting the future contracted cash flows using readily available market data.
• Interest-bearing loans and borrowings  
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
• Finance lease liabilities  
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease 
agreements. The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
• Trade and other receivables/payables  
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.  158

Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. 
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated 
earnings. At the year end borrowings totalled £95,012,000 (2014: £89,925,000). At 31st December 2015, it is estimated that a general 
increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Group’s profit after tax and equity by approximately £600,000 
(2014: £50,000 reduction).
For the year ended 31st December 2015, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation 
to the Group’s profit and trading flows would have increased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £1,500,000 (2014: £2,400,000). 
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements. Forward exchange contracts have 
been included in this calculation.

Pension plans
The Company is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Company’s defined benefit obligations. Other plans operated by the Company were defined 
contribution plans.
The total expense relating to the Company’s defined contribution pension plans in the current year was £105,000 (2014: £150,000).
The post-retirement mortality assumptions in respect of the Company Defined Benefit Scheme follows the SAPS light tables, with

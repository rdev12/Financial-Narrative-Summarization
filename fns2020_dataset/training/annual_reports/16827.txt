Introduction
The Board’s overriding objective is to ensure that the Group delivers long-term capital appreciation for its shareholders. 
Compliance
Volga Gas plc seeks to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance albeit as an AIM-listed company it is not required to. 
The Board of Directors is committed to developing and applying high standards of corporate governance appropriate to the Company’s 
size and its future prospects.
This statement sets out measures taken by the Board to apply the principles of the Code to the year ended 31 December 2007 and to the 
date of the Directors’ Report.
Board of directors
Role of the Board
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership to the Group within a framework of prudent and effective controls which 
enables risk to be assessed and managed. The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims and ensures that the necessary financial and 
human resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives, and reviews management’s performance in meeting these objectives. 
The Board sets and monitors the Group’s values and standards and ensures that the Group’s obligations to shareholders and other 
stakeholders are understood and met.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval, including;
•	 Str ategic 	 and 	 polic y 	 consider ations
•	 Ann ual 	 budget, 	 including 	 ca pital 	 expenditur e
•	 Interim 	 and 	 final 	 financial 	 statements
•	 Mana gement 	 structur e 	 and 	 a ppointments
•	 Mer gers , 	 acquisitions , 	 disposals

•	 Appointment 	 or 	 r emo v al 	 of 	 Dir ectors 	 or 	 the 	 Compan y 	 Secr etary
Board composition
The Board is currently comprised of two executive directors and five non-executive directors, of whom three are deemed to be 
independent and two non-independent:
•	 Alexe y 	 Kalinin 	 – 	 Non-Executi v e 	 Chairman
•	 Mikhail 	 Iv ano v 	 – 	 Executi v e 	 Dir ector 	 and 	 CEO
•	 Alistair 	 Stobie 	 – 	 Executi v e 	 Dir ector , 	 CFO 	 and 	 Compan y 	 Secr etary

•	 Mic hael 	 Calv e y 	 – 	 Non-executi v e
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the executive and non-executive directors.
Board balance and independence
The board recognizes that Messrs Kalinin and Calvey are not independent by virtue of their direct management responsibilities for the 
limited partnerships comprising Baring Vostok Private Equity Fund III, the Company’s controlling shareholder (‘Controlling Shareholder’). 
However, in light of the value, experience and contacts which they afford to the Company at this stage of its development and by virtue 
of the Relationship Agreement, which, inter alia, ensures that the Controlling Shareholder does not exercise undue influence over the 
Company or prevent it from acting independently of the Controlling Shareholder, the Board believes that the continued presence of 
Messrs Kalinin and Calvey on the board is beneficial for the Company . Mr Kalinin also serves as Chairman of  
the Board and was not considered to be independent on his appointment. 19

Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Indemnification of directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the extent permitted by the law of England and Wales, directors are 
granted an indemnity from the Company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office. In respect of those matters for which 
the directors may not be indemnified, the Company maintained a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the 
financial year. This policy has been renewed for the next financial year.
Re-election of directors
The Company requires that all Directors stand for re-election at intervals of no more than three years. Accordingly Meesrs Freeman and 
Ogden will retire at the forthcoming AGM and will seek re-election by shareholders.
Internal controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the system of internal controls for the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness.  
Any system of internal control can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be 
detected or that the risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated.
The Group’s risk and controls framework covers all material risks and controls including those of an operational, financial, and 
compliance nature. Internal control procedures consist, inter alia, of formal delegations of expenditure authority by the Board to executive 
management, and controls relating to key stages of transactions including supplier approval, contract signature, and payment release.
The Directors consider that the frequency of Board meetings and level of detail presented to the Board for its consideration in relation to 
the operations of the Group provide an appropriate process to identify , evaluate and manage significant risks relevant to its operations on 
a continuous basis, and this process is considered to be in accordance with the revised guidance on internal control published in October 
2005 (‘T urnbull Guidance’). 
Investor relations
The Company places considerable importance on communication with shareholders and engages them on a wide range of issues.  
The Group has an ongoing programme of dialogue and meetings between the executive directors and institutional investors, fund 
managers and analysts. At these meetings a wide range of relevant issues including strategy , performance, management and governance 
are discussed within the constraints of the information already made public.
The Company is equally interested in the views and concerns of private shareholders and to this end ensures that the executive directors 
present the Company at forums where private investors are present.
Shareholders have the opportunity to meet and question the Board at the AGM which will be held on 17 June 2008, at which the 
Chairman, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and all Executive Directors will be available.

Principal activities, business review and future developments
Volga Gas was incorporated in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2006 and listed on AIM on 25 April 2007. Volga Gas operates primarily 
through subsidiary companies as set out in Note 2.2 to the accounts. The principal activity of the Group is the exploration, development 
and production of its gas, condensate and oil fields in the Volga Region of European Russia. The Group owns 100% of four licence areas 
in the Saratov and Volgograd regions: Karpenskiy, Vostochny-Makarovskoye, Pre-Caspian and Urozhainoye.
The Group’s business strategy is to bring the proven-undeveloped Vostochny-Makarovskoye field into production whilst at the same 
time exploring the potentially highly prospective sub-salt structures on the Karpenskiy and Pre-Caspian licence areas. The Group is also 
conducting an ancillary exploration and drilling programme on a number of identified supra-salt structures on the Karpenskiy Licence 
Area (‘KLA’). 
Highlights of the Group’s activities for the period ended 31 December 2007 are:

Locked-in shareholders
Subject to the terms of lock-up deeds with KBC Peel Hunt Ltd and Renaissance Securities (Cyprus) Ltd, Cavendish Nominees,

As of 31 December 2007 32,623,948 shares were subject to lock-up agreements representing 60.85% of the issued ordinary share capital.
Options granted
As of 31 December 2007 the Company had granted no options. The Company has entered into restricted share agreements with  
Messrs Ivanov and Stobie as described above.
Interests in contracts
There were no contracts or arrangements during the period in which a director of the Company was materially interested and which 
were significant in relation to the business of the Company .
Creditors payment policy and practice
The Group aims to pay all its creditors promptly . For trade creditors it is the Group’s policy to:
(i) agree the terms of the payment at the start of the business with that supplier;
(ii) ensure that suppliers are aware of the terms of the payment; and
(iii) pay in accordance with contractual and other obligations
Impact of the credit crunch
The Group is not directly impacted by the credit crunch as it has no outstanding borrowings at balance sheet date and its operations 
are limited. Furthermore, many of its suppliers and contractors do not themselves have access to borrowing facilities. The Group’s 
Russian subsidiaries operate in a cash-based economy. However, the Group is investigating the possibility of entering into a borrowing 
facility in order to provide a greater cash cushion. In the event that the Group does enter into such a facility it is likely that the borrowing 
conditions will be more expensive and onerous than previously envisioned. There can be no guarantee that the Group will be able to 
borrow at terms which it finds acceptable. 23

All executive director employment agreements can be terminated either by the director concerned or by the Company on giving  
6 months notice during the first 24 months of service and thereafter by giving 3 months notice.
The executive directors do not participate in any Group pension scheme and their remuneration is not pensionable.
The executive directors are eligible for payment of cash bonuses and participation in any share-based incentive plan the  
Board implements.
Basic salaries
The basic salary of each executive director is established by reference to their responsibilities and individual performance.
Non-Executive Directors’ Terms, Conditions and Fees
The non-executive directors have been engaged under the terms of their letters of appointment. These engagements are for two 
years and can be terminated upon one month’s notice by either party. Re-appointment is subject to the Company’s Articles of 
Association which provide that one third of the directors shall be required to retire each year.
Fees
The fees paid to non-executive directors are determined by the Board and reviewed periodically to reflect current rates and 
practice commensurate with the size of the Company and their roles.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. In the 
event of the appointment of an independent non-executive Chairman his remuneration would be a matter for the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive Officer.
Fees paid to non-executive directors were satisfied partially in cash and partially through the issuance of restricted shares. 
Mr Freeman received US$ 15,000 in respect of his Chairmanship of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees. Mr Ogden 
received US$ 15,000 in respect of his Chairmanship of the Audit Committee. No other members of these committees received any 
additional compensation for their committee roles. 26

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) 27
Volga Gas plc
Annual Report And Accounts 2007
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements of Volga Gas plc the year ended 31 December 2007  
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statements, 
the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and the related notes. These financial statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have 
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Operational and Financial Review and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.  
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

Volga Gas plc
Annual Report And Accounts 2007
1. General information
Volga Gas plc (the ‘Company’ or ‘Volga’) is a public liability company registered in England and Wales with registered number 
5886534. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) are the acquisition, exploration and 
development of hydrocarbon assets and production of hydrocarbons in the Volga Region of the Russian Federation. Its registered 
office is at 7th floor, Phoenix House 18 King William Street, London, EC4N 7HE. 
The Company has its primary listing on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 31 March 2008. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.  
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Volga Gas plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards, as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC interpretations, the Companies Act 1985 
applicable to Companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair 
value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements are disclosed in Note 4.
No income statement is presented for Volga Gas plc as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 2005.
(a) Standards, amendment and interpretations effective in 2007
•	 I F R S	7 ,	‘ F i n a n c i a l	i n s t r u m e n t s :	D i s c l o s u r e s ’ ,	a n d	t h e	c om p l e m e n t a r y	a m e n d m e n t	t o	I A S	1 ,	‘ P r e s e n t a t i on	o f	f i n a n c i a l	
statements – Capital disclosures’, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact 
on the classification and valuation of the Group’s financial instruments, or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and 
other payables.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 but not relevant
 The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2007 but they are not relevant to the Group’s operations:
•	 I F R I C	7 ,	‘ A p p l y i n g	t h e	r e s t a t e m e n t	a p p r o a c h	u n d e r	I A S	2 9 ,	F i n a n c i a l	r e p o r t i n g	i n	h y p e r i n f l a t i on a r y	e c on om i e s ’ ;
•	 I F R I C	8 ,	‘S c o p e	o f	I F R S	2 ’ ;
•	 I F R I C	9 ,	‘ R e - a s s e s s m e n t	o f	e m b e d d e d	d e r iv a t iv e s ’ ;	a n d
•	 I F R I C	1 0 ,	‘ I n t e r i m	f i n a n c i a l	r e p o r t i n g	a n d	i m p a i r m e n t ’ .
(c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early 
adopted by the group:
 The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for 
the group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods, but the group has not early adopted them. 
With the exception of IFRIC 11, the following have not yet been adopted by the European Union:
•	 I A S	2 3	( A m e n d m e n t ) ,	‘ B o r r o w i n g	c o s t s ’	( e f f e c t iv e	f r om	1	J a n u a r y	2 0 0 9 ) .	T h e	a m e n d m e n t	t o	t h e	s t a n d a r d	i s	s t i l l	s u b j e c t	 
to endorsement by the European Union. It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for  
use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset. The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. 
The group will apply IAS 23 (Amended) from 1 January 2009. The group is currently assessing the impact of IAS 23 
(Amended) on its financial statements, 
•	 I F R S	8 ,	‘ O p e r a t i n g	s e g m e n t s ’	( e f f e c t iv e	f r om	1	J a n u a r y	2 0 0 9 ) .	I F R S	8	r e p l a c e s	I A S	1 4	a n d	a l i g n s	s e g m e n t	r e p o r t i n g	w i t h	t h e	
requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, ‘Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information’. The new 
standard requires a ‘management approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used 
for internal reporting purposes The group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on 
the group’s accounts.
•	 I F R I C	1 4,	‘ I A S	1 9	–	T h e	l i m i t	on	a	d e f i n e d	b e n e f i t	a s s e t ,	m i n i m u m	f u n d i n g	r e q u i r e m e n t s	a n d	t h e i r	i n t e r a c t i on ’	( e f f e c t iv e	 
from 1 January 2008). IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be 
recognised as an asset. It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual 
minimum funding requirement. The group will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact 
on the group’s accounts.

Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
2.1. Basis of preparation (continued)
(c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early 
adopted by the group (continued):
• 	 I A S 	 1 , 	 ‘ P r e s e n t a t i o n 	 o f 	 F i n a n c i a l 	 S t a t e m e n t s ’ 	 ( r e v i s e d 	 S e p t e m b e r 	 2 0 0 7 ; 	 e f f e c t i ve 	 f o r 	 a n n u a l 	 p e r i o d s 	 b e g i n n i n g 	 o n 	 o r 	 a f t e r	 
1 January 2009). The main change in IAS 1 is the replacement of the income statement by a statement of comprehensive 
income which will also include all non-owner changes in equity, such as the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets. 
Alternatively, entities will be allowed to present two statements: a separate income statement and a statement of 
comprehensive income. The revised IAS 1 also introduces a requirement to present a statement of financial position (balance 
sheet) at the beginning of the earliest comparative period whenever the entity restates comparatives due to reclassifications, 
changes in accounting policies, or corrections of errors. The Group expects the revised IAS 1 to affect the presentation of its 
financial statements but to have no impact on the recognition or measurement of specific transactions and balances.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IAS 27, ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (revised January 2008; 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009), IFRS 3, Business Combinations (revised January 2008; effective 
for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009), Vesting Conditions and Cancellations—Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment (issued 
in January 2008; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008). IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share 
transactions’ and IAS 32 and IAS 1 Amendment (effective from 1 January 2009) ‘Puttable financial instruments and obligations 
arising on liquidation’ (effective from 1 January 2009) on its financial statements.
(d) Interpretations to existing standards those are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group’s operations:
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting  
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the group’s operations:
•	 I F R I C	1 2 ,	‘S e r v i c e	c on c e s s i on	a r r a n g e m e n t s ’	( e f f e c t iv e	f r om	1	J a n u a r y	2 0 0 8 ) .	I F R I C	1 2	a p p l i e s	t o	c on t r a c t u a l	a r r a n g e m e n t s	
whereby a private sector operator participate in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure 
for public sector services. IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the group’s operations because none of the group’s companies provide 
for public sector services.
•	 I F R I C	1 3 ,	‘ C u s t om e r	l o y a l t y	p r o g r a m m e s ’	( e f f e c t iv e	f r om	1	J u l y	2 0 0 8 ) .	I F R I C	1 3	c l a r i f i e s	t h a t	w h e r e	g o o d s	o r	s e r v i c e s	a r e	 
sold together with a customer loyalty incentive (for example loyalty points or free products), the arrangement is a multiple-
element arrangement and the consideration receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the 
arrangement in using fair values. IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the group’s operations because none of the group’s companies 
operate any loyalty programmes.
2.2. Consolidation
(a)  Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are 
all entities in which the Group directly or indirectly owns more than 50 percent of the voting stock or otherwise has the power 
govern the financial and operating policies. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to 
the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for business combinations rules by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed  
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.  
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 
recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated; 
unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the cost cannot be recovered. 
The Company and its subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation maintain their financial statements in accordance with IFRS. 
The Russian subsidiaries of the Group maintain their statutory accounting records in accordance with the Regulations on 
Accounting and Reporting of the Russian Federation. The consolidated financial statements are based on these statutory 
accounting records, appropriately adjusted and reclassified for fair presentation in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards. 
A list of the Company’s subsidiaries is provided in Note 22.
(b) Segment reporting
A reportable segment is a business segment or a geographical segment identified based on the foregoing definitions for which 
segment information is required to be disclosed.
The operations of the Group comprise one class of business, being oil and gas exploration, development and production and in 
only one geographic area: the Russian Federation. 37

Annual Report And Accounts 2007
2.3. Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in US dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
The functional currency of the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated in the Russian Federation is the Russian ruble (‘RUR’). It is the 
Group’s management view that Russian ruble best displays the financial results of its Cyprus subsidiary Woodhurst Holdings 
Ltd (‘Woodhurst’) and as a result the functional currency of Woodhurst was changed from the US dollar to the Russian ruble. 
Woodhurst applied the change of its functional currency on a prospective basis as of 1 July 2007. The Russian ruble was also 
determined to be the functional currency for Group’s Cyprus subsidiaries established in 2007. 
The closing rates used as at 31 December 2007 were:
•	 1	U S	d o l l a r :	R U R 2 4. 5 5	( a t	3 1	D e c e m b e r	2 0 0 6	1 U S	d o l l a r :	R U R 2 6 . 3 3 )	
•	 1	U S	d o l l a r :	G B P 0 . 5 0	( a t	3 1	D e c e m b e r	1	U S	d o l l a r :	G B P 0 . 5 1 )
•	 a v e r a g e	r a t e	f o r	2 0 0 7	1	U S	d o l l a r :	R U R 2 5 . 5 8	( a v e r a g e	r a t e	f o r	2 0 0 6	1	U S	d o l l a r :	R U R 27 . 1 9 ) .
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
(c)  Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that 
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income 
and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
 
2.4. Exploration & evaluation
The Company applies the ‘successful efforts’ method of accounting for Exploration and Evaluation (‘E&E’) costs, in accordance 
with IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. E&E expenditure is capitalised when it is considered probable 
that future economic benefits will be recoverable. Until such time, E&E expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
E&E expenditure capitalized as intangible assets include license acquisition costs, geological and geophysical studies, seismic data 
acquisition and interpretation, exploration drilling. Exploration and evaluation expenditure which is not sufficiently closely 
related to a specific mineral resource to support capitalisation is expensed as incurred.
E&E assets are carried forward, until the existence, or otherwise, of commercial reserves have been determined subject to certain 
limitations including review for indications of impairment. 
Once commercial reserves have been discovered, the carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets is 
transferred to development tangible and intangible fixed assets. No depreciation and or amortization is charged during the 
exploration and development phase. If however, commercial reserves have not been discovered, the capitalised costs are charged 
to expense after the conclusion of appraisal activities.
(a) Development tangible and intangible assets
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the 
drilling of commercially proven development wells, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
according to nature. When development is completed on a specific field, it is transferred to production assets. No depreciation 
or amortization is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.
(b) Oil and gas production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field by field basis and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves discovered and bringing them in to production together with E&E expenditures incurred in finding 
commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined in accounting policy above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly 
attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Where major and identifiable parts of the production assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items of property, plant and equipment. Costs of minor repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 38

Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
2.4. Exploration & evaluation (continued)
(c) Depreciation/amortisation
Oil and gas properties and intangible assets are depreciated or amortised using the unit-of-production method. Unit-of-
production rates are based on proved and probable reserves, which are oil, gas and other mineral reserves estimated to be 
recovered from existing facilities using current operating methods. Oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they 
have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the field storage tank.
(d) Impairment – exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment when reclassified to development tangible or intangible assets,  
or whenever facts and circumstances indicate impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
exploration and evaluation assets’ carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of the exploration and evaluation assets’ fair value less costs to sell and their value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, the exploration and evaluation assets subject to testing are grouped with existing cash-generating units of 
production fields that are located in the same geographical region.
(e) Impairment – proved oil and gas production properties and intangible assets
Proven oil and gas properties and intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount  
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The carrying value is compared against the expected 
recoverable amount of the asset, generally by future value of the future net cash flows, expected to be derived from 
production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, 
except that a number of field interests may be grouped together where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
2.5. Property , plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment not associated with exploration and production activities are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. These assets are also evaluated for impairment.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated on a straight line basis as follows:
Machinery and equipment 6 – 10 years
Office equipment in excess of $5,000 3 – 4 years
Vehicles and other 2 – 7 years
2.6. Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. This category comprises derivatives 
unless they are effective hedging instruments.
(b)  Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. This category comprises trade and other receivables and cash.
2.7. Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are financial instruments whose value changes in response to an underlying 
variable, require little or no initial investment and are settled in the future. The Company uses derivatives such as foreign 
exchange forward contracts to minimize risks of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group does not apply hedge accounting in 
respect of forward foreign exchange contracts as the management believes that existing derivative does not qualify for hedge 
accounting. Consequently, movements in the fair value of derivative instruments are immediately recognized in the income 
statement.
2.8. Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the purchase method where the business meets the definition of a 
business combination.
Transactions involving the purchases of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not qualify as a business 
combination are treated as assets purchases, irrespective of whether the specific transactions involved the transfer of the field 
interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill, no deferred tax gross up arises, and the 
consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production assets 
disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement. 39
Volga Gas plc
Annual Report And Accounts 2007
2.9. Inventories
Crude oil inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Materials and supplies inventories are recorded at 
average cost and are carried at amounts which do not exceed their respective amounts recoverable in the normal course of business.
2.10. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are presented at recoverable amounts. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
2.11. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at hand, and deposits held on call with banks.
2.12. Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.
2.13. Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.14. Borrowings
All borrowings are initially recorded at fair value. Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received,  
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where borrowings are made at 
rates of interest below the normal commercial rate, borrowings are discounted to fair value based on market rates of interest for 
similar arrangements. Differences arising on the discounting of loans from owners are recorded as separate component of equity.
2.15. Current and deferred income tax
Current tax is the amount expected to be paid in respect of taxable profits for the current and prior periods. The current income 
tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries 
where the Group’s subsidiaries and operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method for tax loss carry forward and temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the 
deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax 
is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
2.16. Employee benefits
(a) Share-based compensation
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total 
amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
The Company measures the equity instruments granted to employees at the fair value at grant date. Fair value of fully-vested 
shares is expensed immediately. Fair value of shares with vesting requirements is estimated using Black-Scholes option pricing 
model. This value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
(b) Social obligation
Wages, salaries, contributions to the Russian Federation state pension and social insurance funds, paid annual leave and sick 
leave and bonuses are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group. 40

Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
2.17. Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of oil in the ordinary course of the group’s 
activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group.
(a) Sales of goods
Revenue from the sale oil is recognised when goods are delivered to customers and title has transferred. Revenue is stated net 
of value-added tax.
(b) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
3. Financial risk management
3.1. Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, price risk, and cash flow 
interest rate risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability 
of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Russian 
Ruble. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities.
The following table shows the currency structure of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2007:
      Rubles US Dollars Sterling Total 
      US$ 000 US$ 000 US$ 000 US$ 000

Long term liabilities       – 13,012 – 13,012
Total financial liabilities     112 14,089 372 14,573
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk (see note 9). 
At 31 December 2007, if the US dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the Russian ruble with all other variables 
held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been US$ 367,000 (2006: US$ 0) higher/lower, mainly as a result of 
foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of Russian ruble denominated trade payables and financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss.
(ii)  Price risk 
The Group is not exposed to price risk as it does not have financial instruments of which the fair values or future cash 
flows will be affected by changes in market prices.
(iii)  Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities, the group’s income and operating cash flows are 
substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. 41
Volga Gas plc
Annual Report And Accounts 2007
(b)  Credit risk
The Group’s maximum credit risk exposure is the fair value of each class of assets, presented in note 3.1a (i) of US$ 100,400,000 
and US$ 3,328,000 as at 31 December 2007 and 2006 respectively.
The Group’s principal financial asset is cash and credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial 
instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. It is the Group’s policy to monitor the financial standing of 
these assets on an on going basis. Bank balances are held with reputable and established financial institutions.

(c)  Liquidity risk
The Group believes it has sufficient capital to fund the exploration of the Karpenskiy Licence Area and development of the 
Vostochny-Makarovskoye Licence Area until such stage as the Group is operating cash flow positive. Should the Group’s 
exploration activities on the sub-salt structures on the Karpenskiy and Pre-Caspian Licence Areas be successful the Group  
will require significant additional funding to develop these licence areas.
The Group expects to fund its exploration and development programme, as well as its administrative and operating expenses, 
through calendar year 2008 using a combination of existing working capital, proceeds from the placing on admission to AIM 
and expected proceeds from the sale of future oil and gas production.
If the Group is unsuccessful in generating enough liquidity to fund its expenditures, the Group’s ability to execute its long-term 
growth strategy could be significantly affected.

3.2. Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce  
the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,  
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 42 
Volga Gas plc
Annual Report And Accounts 2007
Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
3.2. Capital risk management (continued)
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net 
debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated 
as equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt. 
        2007 2006 
        US$ 000 US$ 000
Total borrowings        – 13,426
Less: cash and cash equivalents       (97,539) (3,328)
Net debt        – 10,098
Total equity        144,806 15,607
Total capital and debt        144,806 25,705
Gearing ratio        0% 39%
The decrease in the gearing ratio during 2007 was due to issuance of the new shares and settlement of debt obligations. 
3.3. Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.  
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate their  
fair values.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a)  Fair value of derivatives 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by using valuation techniques. The group uses its judgment to 
select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
 
(b)  Income taxes
Significant judgment is frequently required in estimating provisions for deferred taxes. This process involves an assessment of 
temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the balance sheet. 
(c)  Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
The Group applies a range of useful lives to assets, which are classified as property, plant and equipment. Significant judgment 
is required in estimating the useful life of such assets.
5. Intangible assets – Group

32. Contingencies and commitments 
32.1. Capital commitments
(a) Pre-Caspian Gas Company 
(i) Karpenskiy Licence Area
In accordance with the amended Karpenskiy Licence Agreement (‘Amended KLA’) PGK is required to;
a. Complete 400km
2
 of 3D seismic by end-2008. At balance sheet date the Company had acquired approximately 336km
2
 
and was contracted to acquire a further 64 km
2
. This acquisition was ongoing at balance sheet date.
b. Drill 14 wells. At balance sheet date five of these wells have been drilled. Management currently estimates that 
expenditure to drill the balance will be approximately US$ 15,000,000. 
(ii) Pre-Caspian Licence Area
In accordance with the licence agreement for the Pre-Caspian license area, PGK is required to acquire 500 km of 2D seismic 
in 2007/2008 and 500 km in 2008/2009. At balance sheet date the company had acquired 500km. The cost of seismic 
acquisition between 2007 and 2009 is expected to be US$ 5,100,000 of which US$ 1,700,000 has been pre-paid.
(iii) Urozhainoye Licence Area
There are no capital commitments in respect of the Urozhainoye Licence Agreement for 2008.
(b) Gaznefteservice
(i) Vostochny-Makarovskoye Licence Area
In accordance with the Vostochny Makarovskoye licence agreement, GNS must drill at least one well by July 2008.  
This well has been completed. As of balance Sheet date approximately US$ 138,000 remained to be paid under the  
contract with BK Eurasia.
As of balance sheet date the Group had entered in to a number of contracts for the construction of gas processing and 
surface facilities for the Vostochny-Makarovskoye Licence Area. The balance of commitments under these contracts was 
approximately US$ 7,400,000.
32.2. Taxation 
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by  
the relevant regional and federal authorities. Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities may be 
taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and 
activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged. As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and 
interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years 
preceding the year of review, but under certain circumstances, reviews may cover longer periods.
As at 31 December 2007, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and the Group’s tax, 
currency and customs positions will be sustained.
Restoration, rehabilitation, and environmental costs
The Group operates in the upstream oil industry in the Russian Federation and its activities may have an impact on the 
environment. The enforcement of environmental regulations in the Russian Federation is evolving and the enforcement posture  
of government authorities is continually being reconsidered. The Group periodically evaluates its obligation related thereto.  
The outcome of environmental liabilities under proposed or future legislation, or as a result of stricter interpretation and 
enforcement of existing legislation, cannot reasonably be estimated at present, but could be material.
Under the current levels of enforcement of existing legislation, management believes there are no significant liabilities in addition 
to amounts which are already accrued and which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Notes to the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 55
Volga Gas plc
Annual Report And Accounts 2007
32.3. Oilfield licences
The Group is subject to periodic reviews of its activities by governmental authorities with respect to the requirements of its 
oilfield licences. Management of the Group correspond with governmental authorities to agree on remedial actions, if necessary, 
to resolve any findings resulting from these reviews. Failure to comply with the terms of a licence could result in fines, penalties, 
licence limitation, suspension or revocation. The Group’s management believes any issues of non-compliance will be resolved 
through negotiations or corrective actions without any materially adverse effect on the financial position or the operating results 
of the Group.
Post-balance sheet date the Company was issued with an amendment to its Karpenskiy Licence Agreement. The amendments to 
the KLA remove the historical licence breaches.
The principal licences of the Group and their expiry dates are:
 
Field  Licence Holder      Licence expiry date
Karpenskiy  OOO Pre-Caspian Gas Company      2021
Pre-Caspian  OOO Pre-Caspian Gas Company      2031
Urozhainoye-2  OOO Pre-Caspian Gas Company      2032
Vostochny-Makarovskoye  OOO Gaznefteservice       2026
Management believes that in practice the relevant authorities rarely suspend or restrict the licences, especially at the exploration 
stage, and tend to terminate licences only in the event of continuous non-compliance and the failure of the licence holder to 
remedy breaches. The Group is attempting to comply with its licence requirements and has not received any official warnings or 
notifications about continuous non-compliance or any risk of suspension, restriction or termination.
33. Post-balance sheet events
5 February 2008 the Company received amended terms to the Karpenskiy Licence Agreement. The amended work programme is 
described in Note 31.1. 56

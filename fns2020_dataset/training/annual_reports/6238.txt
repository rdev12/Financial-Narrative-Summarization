WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS - BOILER ROOM SCAMS
Over the last year, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically 
from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often 
turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are com-
monly known as ‘boiler rooms’. These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely persua-
sive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported that the average 
amount lost by investors is around £20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of the victims had been 
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolic-
ited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you receive 
any unsolicited investment advice:
 by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register
 or visiting www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk
 If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online 
form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Dear Shareholders,
It is a privilege to report that Fresnillo plc has delivered another year of 
strong performance. As we stated at the time of the Group’s initial public 
offering in 2008, we are committed to maintaining our position as the 
world’s largest primary silver producer, with the goal of producing 65 mil-
lion ounces of silver and 400,000 ounces of gold per year by 2018. Results 
in 2009 indicate we are ﬁrmly on track, with strong operational perfor-
mance, quality and sustainable growth across our operations.
The Group more than delivered on its commitments during the past year. 
Silver production reached record levels, planned cost reduction and efﬁcien-
cy projects were completed, and progress at exploration and development 
sites was on target, with the start-up of Soledad-Dipolos ahead of schedule 
and within budget. Indicators of future performance remained strong, with 
double-digit mine life and a signiﬁcant increase in total ore resources. These 
results further underscore the Group’s strong competitive advantages:

The rise in Fresnillo plc’s share price accompanied a rally in pre-
cious metal prices. Nonetheless, we believe that our ranking as 
the top performer in 2009 among gold and silver miners in the 
FTSE350 Index, and number three among all mining compa-
nies in that Index, are evidence of the market’s recognition of 
our operational performance and the quality of our asset base. 
The Company has the fundamental ingredients for long-
term sustainable growth. The Board utilises a number of 
indicators, as set out in this report, to monitor the imple-
mentation of the Group’s value-creation strategy and to 
measure its effectiveness in delivering against objectives.
We enter 2010 well-positioned to deliver continued 
growth. As of today, gold and silver prices are signiﬁcantly 
higher than they were one year ago, buoyed by momen-
tum in investment demand and signs of a global economic 
recovery. The start up of Soledad-Dipolos as an operat-
ing mine will boost attributable gold production by an ex-
pected 20%. Major construction on the ﬁrst stage of the 
Saucito mine will near completion during the coming year, 
and ore from the project is already being processed in the 
Fresnillo mill and contributing to silver production. 
We have authorised a 58% increase in the 2010 explora-
tion budget to US$77.6 million, which is commensurate 
with our expectations of ﬁnancial performance. Our fo-
cus remains on consolidating mining districts, expanding 
the growth platform and ensuring that our reserve and 
resource base are of the highest quality. To that end, the 
Group will pursue acquisition opportunities that may arise 
if they are value accretive to our shareholders and comply 
with our strategic and ﬁnancial return criteria. (See Strat-
egy and KPIs on pages 10 to 15)
I would like to extend my appreciation to my fellow Board 
members for their dedication and invaluable advice. This 
diverse group of professionals combine a wealth of experi-
ence and perspectives to enhance the strategy and gover-
nance of the organisation. I would also like to commend 
the Group’s executives and employees for their impressive 
execution against objectives this year, demonstrating the 
strength of their commitment and teamwork.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to report a year of signiﬁcant operational progress: record attrib-
utable silver production, the completion of development works and start-up 
of operations at Soledad-Dipolos, advances at the Saucito project, substantial 
increase in total resources, and mineralisation extended at our major explora-
tion prospects. We enter 2010 with a strong cash position and no debt.
These results are the outcome of a strategy designed to create value across 
precious metals cycles: a focus both on operational excellence in maximis-
ing current assets, and on delivering long-term growth through ore reserve 
replacement and expansion into new projects.
We have a strong foundation upon which to deliver on this commitment 
to stakeholders:
 Leadership: The Fresnillo Group is the world’s leading primary silver 
producer and Mexico’s second largest gold producer. Among our global 
precious metals peers, we are ranked in the lowest quartile on the cash 
cost curve. Leadership is also an attribute exempliﬁed on the ground 
through our people. The Group’s professionals make a substantial differ-
ence in where we choose to explore, how prospects are evaluated, the 
pace at which projects are developed, the efﬁciency with which we oper-
ate our assets, and the effectiveness of our administrative processes.
 Quality: We have world-class, low-cost precious metal assets, including 
the largest silver mine in the world. At 31 December 2009 we had double- LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. Chief Executive’s statement
5
digit reserve life at all our mines and attributable reserves 
of 374.0 million ounces of silver and 4.3 million ounces of 
gold. This is an indication of the quality of our mine devel-
opment and exploration efforts. 
 Sustainable growth: We have an extensive portfolio of 
high quality exploration projects and prospects, along with the 
largest land position for precious metals exploration and min-
ing in Mexico. In 2009 we once again extended mineralisation 
at all advanced exploration prospects and further consolidated 
our mining districts. At 31 December 2009, total attributable 
resources included 1,289.0 million ounces of silver (2008: 1,115.9 
Moz) and 13.9 million ounces of gold (2008: 12.0 Moz). Our aim 
is to deliver one new mine or mine expansion a year for the next 
four years, starting with Soledad-Dipolos. 
These attributes are backed up by our commitment to sustain-
able development. We have developed a comprehensive health, 
safety and environmental management system that integrates 
personnel training and development. In addition, we invest in 
conservation and biodiversity efforts and closely collaborate with 
communities to ensure that our growth is truly sustainable. 
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
In 2009 we delivered strong performance and made progress 
across all our KPIs (see KPIs on pages 12 to 15). Attribut-
able silver production achieved a new record, rising 8.8% over 
2008 to 37.9 million ounces. This was largely as a result of 
an increase in ore volumes milled at Fresnillo, higher metal 
contents extracted from the development works at Saucito, 
and higher silver ore grade at Ciénega. 
Attributable gold production surpassed our expectations, rising 
4.9% to 276,584 ounces. Greater throughput at Herradura and 
Fresnillo helped compensate for the lower average gold ore 
grade at Ciénega. Total gold production at Herradura reached 
an all-time record with 259,839 ounces. Production at Ciénega 
has now been stabilised at approximately 100,000 ounces per 
year; furthermore, a capacity expansion project was approved 
for 2010 with higher production expected in 2011.
Lead and zinc production, by-products of the Fresnillo and 
Ciénega mines, declined 3.0% and 13.3% against 2008, re-
spectively, due to lower grades at Ciénega.
Market conditions and metals prices evolved favourably 
over the course of the year. By the second half of 2009, gold 
staged a remarkable rally and rose to new historic levels, 
while silver largely recovered the ground it had lost at year-
end 2008. For 2009 as a whole, the market price for gold 
averaged US$972.98 per ounce, compared to US$871.71 
per ounce in 2008, while the average market silver price 
was US$14.67 per ounce, compared to US$14.97 per ounce 
in 2008.
Focused on increasing productivity, reducing costs, expanding the 
resource and reserve base, and strengthening our growth pipeline.

A number of input costs were higher in the year when compared 
to 2008, particularly drilling steel, sodium cyanide and tyres, but 
the average 21.4% devaluation of the Mexican peso against the 
US dollar meant that costs denominated in pesos, representing 
approximately 70% of total production costs, were signiﬁcantly re-
duced when converted to US dollars. Combined with greater ore 
throughput, this served to decrease costs per tonne at all three 
operating mines. We also worked more efﬁciently this year, as 
measured in total equivalent silver ounces produced per person. 
 higher average metal prices, excellent operational results 
and lower costs per tonne. Adjusted revenues, which exclude 
treatment and reﬁning charges and hedging results, rose 
12.4% in the year. Total revenues increased to US$849.9 mil-
lion, 18.0% higher than at 31 December 2008. EBITDA rose to 
US$496.6 million, with a signiﬁcant expansion in the margin 
from 46.8% in 2008 to 58.4% in 2009. Net proﬁt attributable 
to shareholders, prior to Silverstream revaluation effects, 
was US$308.0 million, 140.8% higher than in 2008.
There was a 65-day labour strike at the lead-silver reﬁnery of our 
customer Met-Mex Peñoles
2
, where all products from our mines 
are shipped under contract. During this strike we managed to 
export part of our concentrates, precipitates and dore at similar 
terms with no major ﬁnancial impact.
Fresnillo plc has no bank debt, and as at 31 December 2009 a cash 
position of US$312.2 million, 47.3% above the 2008 ﬁgure, which 
shows continued strengthening of our balance sheet.
INVESTING IN PRODUCTIVITY AND COST CONTROLS
At Fresnillo, we constructed a water treatment plant to treat 
sewage from the city of Fresnillo. Instead of utilising fresh water 
 use treated water, which brings environmental beneﬁts to the 
community and reduces our fresh water consumption costs. 
Construction was completed in 2009 and the plant is now fully 
operational. We are also constructing a new shaft to extract 
mineral from the western zone of the San Carlos vein and re-
duce haulage costs. The ﬁrst stage of the project, expected to 
be completed in 1H 2011, is progressing according to schedule. 
At Ciénega, we completed the optimisation of the leaching circuit 
by the year end. We have already begun to see an improvement 
in recoveries, which were further enhanced with the Knelson 
gravimetric concentrator that started operations in Septem-
ber. The sinking of the shaft at Ciénega a further 300 metres is 
progressing according to schedule and should be concluded in 2H 
2011; this project will enable us to gain access to deeper ore re-
serves. In addition, an increase in milling capacity from 755,000tpy 
to 930,000tpy was approved at an investment of US$24.9 million, 
which will increase average production to 110,000 ounces of gold 
per year; this project will commence in 1H 2011. 
At Herradura, the expansion of the beneﬁciation plant to in-
 3
 to 1,600 m
3
 per hour was com-
pleted at year end, allowing us to maintain production above 
250,000 ounces of gold per year. In addition, the laboratory 
was expanded to receive samples from Soledad-Dipolos and 
included the installation of an automated sampler system. 
We concluded construction of the seventh leaching pad in 
2009 and began work on the eighth, and acquired new mobile 
equipment to enhance productivity. 
DELIVERING GROWTH
Our pipeline of organic growth includes two development projects 
and a number of advanced and long-term exploration prospects.  
Construction was completed at Soledad-Dipolos in December 
2009, ahead of schedule and within budget. This project will be 
an operating mine in 2010, with commercial production having 
started in January 2010. Total annual gold production is expect-
ed to be 100,000 ounces, increasing to approximately 130,000 
ounces in the following years with an investment of US$34.0 
million in mobile equipment and leaching pads. 
At Saucito, the pre-feasibility study for the ﬁrst phase of 
the project was approved in August 2009 with total capital 
expenditure of US$309.0 million. Mining operations at this 
world-class silver deposit are scheduled to begin in 2011, with 
expected ﬁrst year production levels of 4.7 million ounces of 
silver and 22,500 ounces of gold gradually ramping up by the 
third year of operations to approximately 9.0 million ounces 
of silver and 45,000 ounces of gold. In 2009, 735,744 ounces of 
silver and 2,880 ounces of gold were obtained from the devel-
opment works at Saucito and processed at the Fresnillo mill.
Results from exploration activities during the year were 
very encouraging:


Of particular note was the preliminary conﬁrmation of ore 
resources at Noche Buena. We have accelerated the explo-
ration programme in 2010 in order to determine whether a 
pre-feasibility study should be conducted. 
In addition to organic growth, we also evaluate potential ac-
quisitions on an ongoing basis. These targets must meet strict 
operational requirements and value creation criteria. In 2009 
we evaluated a number of acquisitions, none of which were 
considered to be in the best interest of shareholders. 
Nonetheless, we are optimistic about new opportunities for

that may arise if they are value accretive to our shareholders 
and comply with our strategic and ﬁnancial return criteria. We 
will commence exploration activities in Peru, which has a rich 
mining tradition and signiﬁcant potential for precious metals, 
having incorporated Fresnillo Perú in 2009.
COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Health, safety, environment and community relations pro-
grammes are an integral part of the Group’s activities. I am 
pleased to report another improvement in safety performance: 
once again zero fatalities, and an improvement in safety indices.

Since 2006 the primary products from the Group’s mines, silver- and gold-rich lead and zinc concentrates and dore have been sold to the Peñoles Group’s reﬁning and smelt-
ing facility at Torreón, operated by Met-Mex Penõles S.A. de C.V. (Met-Mex) under a series of supply agreements. See Customer Relationships in the Directors’ Report, page 83.

Our adherence to domestic and international standards of 
environmental performance is evidenced by ISO 14001 certi-
ﬁcation at all mines and exploration ofﬁces. In addition, Her-
radura completed the certiﬁcation process for adherence to 
the International Cyanide Management Code, and we initi-
ated the process at Ciénega.
We continue to enjoy excellent relations with our personnel. 
Annual labour negotiations concluded with the agreement 
of a 6% wage increase, 1% increase in fringe beneﬁts and a 
one-time bonus of 1% of base salary for 2009. Community 
investments this year included education programmes and 
sponsorship of athletic teams, arts and culture. 
Efforts to protect biodiversity are considered within our op-
erations’ planning process, including investments in nursery 
management, reforestation and conservation efforts. In 2009 
Fresnillo plc became a founding member of the Corporate 
Commitment to Wilderness. This is an initiative of the WILD 
Foundation, an international non-proﬁt organisation dedicated 
to wilderness protection around the world. The Company also 
endorsed the Copenhagen Communiqué, an initiative of the 
Prince of Wales’ Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change.
A full description of the Group’s sustainability programmes, 
objectives and performance may be found in the Sustainable 
Development Report on pages 46 to 59.
OUTLOOK
While we are not insulated from continued volatility in the 
global economy, I am conﬁdent that the Group is well-po-
sitioned to consolidate its leadership in the global precious 
metal industry. We remain focused on increasing productivity, 
reducing costs, expanding the resource and reserve base, and 
strengthening our growth pipeline in support of our strategy 
to create ongoing and sustainable value to all our stakeholders. 
Speciﬁcally, we expect:

 -
tribution from the recently completed Soledad-Dipolos mine
 -
structure at Saucito 

 Noche Buena


Our 2010 priorities and targets are included in full in the 
Strategy section on pages 10 to 11.
In closing, I would like to extend my gratitude to our Chairman 
and Board members for their continued support and oversight 
this year. As the Group enhances its international proﬁle, their 
guidance is vital. To my fellow executives and employees, thank 
you for your dedication to quality and sustainable growth. I am 
proud to be a member of the Fresnillo plc team.

THE SILVER MARKET
The silver price started 2009 at US$11.08 per ounce and 
rose steadily throughout the year to peak at US$19.18 
in early December and closed the year at US$16.99. The 
rising price was driven by an increase in investor demand 
as investors sought refuge in precious metals in response 
to global uncertainty about the economic outlook. Inves-
tor demand in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and coins 
increased substantially (see Demand section below) over 
the year giving rise to higher prices. Nonetheless, the av-
erage price of silver in 2009 was US$14.67, a 2% decrease 
from the 2008 average.
The silver price remained closely correlated with gold and 
to a lesser extent copper as it acts as both an investment 
and as a base metal for industrial uses. The correlation with 
gold strengthened over the year from 58.4 in 2008 to 64.1 
in 2009, slightly above the average of 62.1 since 2001, as 
gold reassumed its traditional position as a classic risk hedge 
in volatile markets. Gold was also subject to increased de-
mand as a result of heavy buying by central banks including 
those of Russia, China and India in particular.
SILVER DEMAND
Demand for silver can broadly be split into two categories 
– fabrication demand, which includes industrial applica-
tions, photography, jewellery/silverware and coins, and 
investment demand, which includes Exchange Traded 
Funds (ETFs).
Total fabrication demand in 2009 fell about 11% from 2008 
to 2009 as a result of the decline in economic growth. For 
example, shipments of semi-conductors, in which silver is 
the key material of a number of components, fell in 2009. 
The demand for silver from the photographic industry 
continued its secular decline as digital technology contin-
ued to grow. Photography as a percent of total silver de-
mand fell from 12% in 2008 to 10% in 2009. Demand from 
the jewellery and silverware markets remained similar to 
that in 2008 although demand for the minting of silver 
coins increased as investors purchased coins as the global 
recession continued.
SILVER INVESTMENT
Since the launch of Exchange Traded Funds in silver in 
2006, there has been a steady increase in demand for 
these investment products as an asset class. In 2009 
there was a very strong increase in the demand for silver 
investment products as the crisis in the credit markets 
and weakness of the US dollar continued. Net silver in-
vestment as a percent of total silver demand went from 
5% in 2008 to 16% in 2009.

SILVER SUPPLY
There are very few primary silver producers as over 70% of 
mine production is as a by-product or co-product credit to 
base metal or gold mining. The Fresnillo Group is the larg-
est primary silver producer in the world.  
Total supply increased modestly to 889 million ounces in 
2009 from 874 million ounces in 2008. By far the major-
ity of supply – around 78% – came from mine production, 
which contributed 695 million ounces in 2009 compared 
with 674 million in 2008. This 2% increase in supply from 
the mines was due to a number of new projects that be-
gan operation while others increased capacity, particularly 
in Latin America. These activities more than offset lower 
production from the disruptions at base metals opera-
tions in Canada, Chile and Australia.
The increases in production also outweighed lower supply from 
silver scrap, which fell by around 6 million ounces to 171 million 
ounces, and by a reduction in government sales of silver, which 
reduced supply on the market. The fall in scrap was driven by 
the structural declines in the photographic use of silver .
THE GOLD MARKET
The gold price rose for the ninth consecutive year to end the 
year at US$1,087.50 per ounce, up 25% during 2009. The price 
rallied from its January low of US$810.00 per ounce to set suc-
cessive record highs throughout the fourth quarter. Its ascent 
to the end of the year was driven by a number of factors that 
 “safe haven” status was reafﬁrmed in 2009 as geo-political 
volatility saw more investors turn to gold as a store of value.  
The average gold price for 2009 was US$972.98 per ounce.
Furthermore, on 7 August 2009, a group of 19 European 
central banks agreed to renew a pact to limit gold sales, 
the Central Bank Gold Agreement (CBGA3). Annual sales 
under the agreement are limited to 400 tonnes, down 
from 500 tonnes in the second agreement, which expired 
in late September. Other central banks, such as those in 
Russia, China and India chose to increase their gold re-
serves by buying in the open market.
GOLD DEMAND
Demand for gold is mostly driven by jewellery fabrication and 
to a lesser extent applications in dentistry, electronics and 
coinage. Jewellery accounts for three quarters of the gold 
demand. Gold also remains a key component for reserves 
of Central Banks, which currently hold almost 30,000 tonnes 
of gold worth around US$800 billion. Investment demand is 
driven by ETF’s, and retail investment in coins and gold bars.

FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT MARKET REVIEW
19
High gold prices and the impact of the global reces-
sion reduced gold demand for jewellery by 30% from 
2008 to 2009. The decline in gold demand was univer-
sal with demand from the Middle East particularly hit. 
The region is one of the key customers for gold jewel-
lery and demand fell by more than 100 tonnes, with 
that in India, another traditional customer, falling by 
around 80 tonnes.  
GOLD INVESTMENT
Growth in investment demand has been the key 
driver of higher prices throughout 2009. Although 
the global economy began to show signs of recovery 
in the latter half of the year, the pace of the recov-
ery remained uncertain. Large sums of money sup-
ply that reached the global market in 2008 caused 
concern over eventual inflation or in some cases the 
future of the US dollar. 
Investor demand for gold within exchange traded funds 
continued to be strong, although their maturity in com-
parison to silver ETFs, which were introduced several years 
earlier, meant their rate of growth was more modest. 
Investors bought 573 tonnes of gold in the form of ETFs 
over the year and net long positions in the physical metal 
increased sharply throughout the year.  
Hoarding of gold bars remained strong in 2009 with a 
 investment demand in non-western gold markets such as 
China and India. 
GOLD SUPPLY
The supply of gold comes from mine production, Central 
Bank sales and scrap. Gold mine production increased by 
just 6% year on year to 2,500 tonnes as mine output in-
creased from Indonesia, China and Russia. This increase 
more than offset weakness in traditional gold heartlands 
such as South Africa. The other source of supply from pro-
ducers is de-hedging which increased over the year as a 
few producers completed hedge book restructuring. Gold 
supply from scrap sources also increased, as high prices 
and high margins brought more supply gold onto the 
scrap market, although this source is very small as a per-
cent of the total supply.
Sales under the third Central Bank Gold Agreement contin-
ued to decline over the year whilst banks and ofﬁcial sector 
institutions outside of the agreement continued to pur-
chase gold. In September, the IMF announced the sale of 
403 tonnes of gold to be conducted in such a way as to not 
disturb the market. Thus, these off market transactions 
had no impact on the net supply of or demand for gold.

Mexico provides a favourable 
environment for mining: 
flexible and well-structured 
mining and environmental 
legislation; political support; 
strong mining tradition 
and expertise; a skilled 
workforce; and ample access 
to good infrastructure.
COUNTRY OVERVIEW: MEXICO 
Mexico is a federal republic with a stable democratic po-
litical environment. The mining industry is an important 
contributor to the country’s economy, and beneﬁts from 
a well-structured and supportive regulatory framework. 
Local mining expertise is signiﬁcant and the geological po-
tential for silver and gold remains strong. There is ample 
access to infrastructure such as energy, water and roads 
throughout the country. Mexico was the second largest 
silver producer in the world in 2009. The country’s silver is 
produced by mines where silver is the primary product, as 
well as a by-product of base metal and gold operations.
The concession system
The Mexican Constitution establishes that all mineral rights 
belong to the State, which in turn provides concessions to 
private companies. Concessions are required to explore for 
and exploit mineral potential, and they may specify required 
levels of capital expenditure and minimum environmental, 
health and safety standards. In order to maintain these 
concessions in good standing, companies are required to 
pay yearly fees based on hectares under claim and to dem-
onstrate continued work in progress. No royalty payments 
are required in Mexico for extracting metals.
Mining concessions grant rights to mine; concession 
holders are required to negotiate access to the land un-
der which the concession is located with the surface land 
owner. Companies holding concessions must be incorpo-
rated under the laws of Mexico, although they may be 
wholly owned by foreign investors.
The ﬁscal regime
There are no taxes or levies imposed speciﬁcally on the 
mining industry. Companies are subject to standard cor-
porate income tax rates, which are determined by the 
Federal Government. That rate for 2009 was 28%. Based 
on the Tax Reform Bill approved by the Mexican Govern-
ment in December 2009, this rate will temporarily increase 
to 30% for the years 2010-2012, then decrease to 29% in 
2013 and revert to 28% in 2014.  LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. MARKET REVIEW

Environmental laws
The development of mining activities is subject to obtain-
ing several environmental permits from different ofﬁces 
within the Federal Ministry of Environment and Natural 
Resources (Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Na-
turales or SEMARNAT), including water extraction, waste-
water discharge and tailings disposal. Mining companies 
must also obtain environmental impact permits prior to 
any mining and exploration activities. There are ofﬁcial 
standards for building and managing tailings dams. Mexi-
can environmental regulations have become increasingly 
stringent over the last decade as a result of international 
agreements that Mexico has ratiﬁed, including the North 
American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (par-
allel to the North American Free Trade Agreement), the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the Convention on Biological Diversity, among others. 
Workforce
Mexico’s long history of mining and an extensive natural 
resources sector provide a skilled workforce, although the 
growth of the mining industry in recent years has led to 
some scarcity of trained workers. There have been a num-
ber of instances in recent years of mining companies fac-
ing industrial action and work stoppages; under Mexican 
law, it is permissible for employees to engage in industrial 
action in sympathy with unionised employees of other 
companies who are engaged in a dispute, despite the ab-
sence of any dispute with their own employer. Fresnillo 
Group workers did not support any such actions in 2009.

Fresnillo is the world’s largest primary silver mine. It has 
been in near continuous operation since 1550. Total an-
nual silver production in 2009 reached a new record high 
of 35.4 million ounces as a result of the increase in ore 
milled. Lead production increased mainly as a result of 
higher ore grade, while zinc production remained stable. 
The preparation of additional stopes at Fresnillo has led 
 Production ﬁgures for the Fresnillo mine do not include 
ore from the development works at Saucito processed 
at the Fresnillo mill. Metal contents from Saucito in 2009 
totalled 735,744 silver ounces, 2,880 gold ounces, 88 
tonnes of lead and 65 tonnes of zinc, all of which are 
included in the total production ﬁgures but not in those 
of the Fresnillo mine.
Over the course of the year, 105,263 metres of diamond 
drilling was conducted, resulting in a 55.0% increase in 
the mine’s total resources, from 34.0 million tonnes at 
538 g/t of silver to 52.7 million tonnes at 374 g/t. Promis-
ing potential remains in the western zone of the mine. 
Based on proven and probable reserves, the expected life 
of the mine is 12.8 years, compared to 12.5 years in 2008.
MINES IN OPERATION
During 2009 the Fresnillo Group had three producing mines, all located in Mexico. Attributable silver production in the 
year reached a new record of 37.9 million ounces, 8.8% higher than in 2008. In addition to silver produced from Fres-
nillo’s operating mines, the equivalent of 3.0 million ounces of payable silver (2008: 2.5 Moz) was realised through the 
Silverstream Contract between Fresnillo and Peñoles. Attributable gold production for 2009 of 276,584 ounces surpassed 
expectations, rising 4.9%, as a result of strong performance at Herradura and the stabilisation of gold grade at Ciénega.   LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. OPERATING REVIEW

Productivity and cost reduction initiatives
A new water treatment plant became fully operational 
in November, following an investment of US$4.3 million. 
This project allows sewage water from the Fresnillo mu-
nicipality to be obtained at no cost, and once treated, it 
is used in the milling process instead of fresh water. This 
preserves local aquifers, reduces the Group’s fresh wa-
ter costs and lowers the municipality’s water treatment 
costs. The plant has capacity to treat 150 litres per sec-
ond; and cost savings from the reduction of fresh water 
consumption will be fully realised in 2010 onwards.
Construction of a new shaft to extract mineral from the 
western zone of the San Carlos vein is underway, with 
the structure of the concrete head frame completed in 
December. Sinking advanced 342 metres of a planned to-
tal 557 metres. This US$19.1 million project, which will 
reduce haulage costs, is expected to be concluded by 1H 
2011. The second stage of the project will be developed 
six or seven years after the shaft is operational, to access 
ore resources at deeper levels.
In 2009 implementation of Six Sigma quality control 
methodology was initiated at the beneﬁciation plant to 
increase milling capacity and recoveries.
LEADERSHIP:
World’s largest primary silver mine.
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH:

Annual gold production decreased by an expected 11.5% as 
a result of the decline in ore grade in the early part of the 
year. The average gold grade in 2009 decreased from 5.1g/t 
in 2008 to 4.3g/t where it has currently stabilised with the 
ongoing investment in efﬁciency projects and preparation 
of new stopes; no further declines are expected in 2010.
An expansion of the milling capacity at the Ciénega mine 
from 755,000tpy to 930,000tpy was approved in October 
and is currently in the engineering phase. This expansion 
will further compensate for the lower ore grade and help 
stabilise gold production at around 110,000 ounces per 
year, while maintaining the mine life at over 10 years. The 
project will become operational in 1H 2011, with an initial 
cost of US$24.9 million plus further sustaining capital ex-
penditure of US$0.5 million per annum from 2012 to 2019.
Silver production for the full year increased due to the 
higher ore grade and ore milled. Lead and zinc production 
decreased as a result of lower ore grades.
Surface and in-mine diamond drilling totalled 56,712 metres 
in 2009. Based on proven and probable reserves, the expected 
life of the mine at current milling capacity is 13.5 years, com-
pared to 13.2 years in 2008. Exploration was also conducted

achieve a 2.2% and 0.8% increase in gold and silver recovery 
rates, respectively, once ﬁnal adjustments are made and 
the project becomes fully operational in the ﬁrst quarter 
of 2010. Total investment was US$4.2 million, coming in 
below budget. An additional 0.3% gold recovery is expected 
to be achieved with the new Knelson gravimetric concen-
trator that became operational in September, following a 
US$1.2 million investment. 
The project to sink the shaft a further 300 metres to gain 
access to deeper ore reserves remains on track, with the 
US$13.3 million project scheduled for completion in the sec-
ond half of 2011. In 2009, the sinking advanced 117 metres.
In 2009 we initiated implementation of Six Sigma quality

Avg ore grade in reserves: 0.64 g/t of gold
Total reserves: 1.8 million ounces of gold
Attributable gold production at Herradura achieved new 
record levels in 2009, rising 18.6% due to the increase of 
ore deposited in the leaching pads from the Centauro pit, 
including the new adjacent Valles pit, and better recovery 
as a result of the expansion of the beneﬁciation plant. 
Higher ore grade and a better recovery rate drove silver 
production up by 38.5%.
The seventh leaching pad was completed in November 
and the construction of the eighth leaching pad began, 
with the preparation of ﬁltering material, levelling of land 
and the receipt of liners completed by the end of 2009. 
The new eighth leaching pad will be completed in the third 
quarter of 2010.
We conducted ongoing drilling of 102,877 metres in the 
year. Based on proven and probable reserves, the expected 
life of the mine is 11.9 years, compared to 12 years in 2008.
At the Centauro Deep target, which is located below the 
main pit at the Herradura mine, 16 diamond drill holes 
totalling 7,530 metres were completed. A potential of 
three million ounces is under exploration; construction of 
a ramp to facilitate exploration and metallurgical work will 
begin in 2010 in order to estimate a resource for deﬁning a 
possible underground mine.

22,500 ounces of gold gradually ramping up to approximate-
ly 9.0 million ounces of silver and 45,000 ounces of gold from 
the third year of operations onwards
The Saucito geology is a system of epithermal veins contain-
ing silver, lead and zinc. The ﬁrst stage of the project includes 
the Saucito and Jarillas veins. The Mezquite, Santa Natalia and 
Valdecañas East veins will continue to be explored as prospects 
for inclusion in the second stage of the Saucito project.
The capital cost of the project is expected to be US$309.0 million of 
which US$50.0 million was incurred in 2009. Capitalised costs in the 
year were offset by US$9.9 million realised from the sale of metal 
content in ore extracted as part of development works.
Construction of the Saucito project was on track in 2009. All per-
mits are in place; engineering of the concentrator plant is advanc-
ing according to schedule and orders for the main equipment 
have been placed; construction of the access road was concluded 
at year-end and the construction of the ramps advanced by 2,795 
metres, while the drifts and cross-cuts increased by 3,750 and 
2,170 metres respectively. Mining works were completed at the 
Saucito shaft, which will start up operations in 1Q 2010. Progress 
on sinking the 750-metre Jarillas shaft continued on schedule for 
start-up in 2013.
During the year 735,744 silver ounces and 2,880 gold ounces were 
recovered from the development works at Saucito and processed 
at the Fresnillo mill. Ore from the Saucito project will continue to 
be processed at Fresnillo as it is accumulated until the beneﬁciation 
plant is concluded at Saucito, which is expected to be in the 1H 2011.

Exploration continues to be the key growth 
driver for the Fresnillo Group, in both 
greenﬁeld and brownﬁeld regions. The 
Company focuses on projects and proper-
ties with large tonnage and low-cost po-
tential in Mexico and Latin America. Our 
strategy is to consolidate mining districts 
with world class potential via acquisition, 
using a disciplined approach to evaluate 
potential new prospects, joint ventures or 
selective acquisitions. Exploration invest-
ment in 2009 totalled US$49.1 million.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Fresnillo plc are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This review is intended to convey the 
main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the ﬁnancial 
results in order to facilitate understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. Manage-

their accompanying notes on pages 90 to 134.
COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Despite the global economic crisis, the volatility in commodity prices and signiﬁcant cost 
pressures experienced in 2009, Fresnillo plc generated strong ﬁnancial results. 
The effective execution of our strategy, including cost control efforts, combined with 
favourable external factors such as higher metal prices and a weakening Mexican peso 
against US dollar helped drive the increase in total revenues, gross proﬁt, EBITDA and op-
erating proﬁt in 2009. These positive factors were partially offset by higher average unit 
costs from a number of key mining inputs such as reagents, tyres and steel for drilling, 
which contrary to expectations, did not decline until late in the year. Key line items of the 
Income Statement are shown below:

Fresnillo’s ﬁnancial results are highly dependent on the performance of our operating as-
sets and thus management’s decision-making and execution capabilities. However, there 
are certain variables which are beyond the Group’s control that have a material impact 
on its ﬁnancial statements. A description of these external factors and their impact on 
results is provided below. 
Precious metal prices
Silver and gold prices are the most signiﬁcant variable impacting the ﬁnancial statements, 
as approximately 94% of Fresnillo’s revenues come from these metals. The average re-
alised price of silver in 2009 was US$15.27 per ounce, an increase of 3.8% year-over-year. 
The average realised gold price increased by 12.5% year-on-year to US$988.94 per ounce. 
These increases beneﬁted the Group’s annual ﬁnancial results. The Group remains fully 
exposed to movements in the underlying metals prices as a result of our strategy of not 
hedging silver and gold production.
Foreign exchange rates
The average spot exchange rate for 2009 was MXN13.52 per US dollar, compared with 
MXN11.14 per US dollar in 2008, representing an average devaluation of 21.4%. As a result,  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT
36
the Group’s production costs decreased when compared to 2008, as costs denomi-
nated in Mexican pesos (approximately 70% of total costs) were lower when converted 
to US dollars. 
The Mexican peso-US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2009 was MXN13.06 
per US dollar, compared to the exchange rate at the beginning of the year of MXN13.54 
per US dollar, a revaluation of 3.5% that had an aggregate adverse effect on peso-
denominated monetary assets and liabilities which are valued at the year-end spot 
rate. Additionally, the US dollar devalued against sterling by 9.1%, generating a foreign 
exchange gain from our cash position in sterling. The net foreign exchange gain in the 
year compared favourably against the signiﬁcant foreign exchange loss incurred in 2008, 
which was generated as a result of the strengthening of the US dollar against both MXN 
and sterling. 
Under Mexican tax legislation, Fresnillo pays taxes on the basis of results prepared in ac-
cordance with Mexican accounting standards (GAAS) which are denominated in Mexican 
pesos. This results in different exchange effects for tax purposes to those reported un-
der IFRS and can therefore cause signiﬁcant differences between the effective tax rate 
under IFRS and the statutory Mexican tax rate.
Inﬂation of key operating materials
The average unit price of key operating materials remained high throughout the year, 
limiting proﬁt margin growth. The unit prices for some key inputs such as steel balls for 
milling and explosives decreased slightly in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009 following record lev-
els in the second half of 2008. However, the average unit prices of these inputs in 2009 
continued to be at higher levels than in the previous year and it was not until the last 
two months of 2009 when input prices began to decline year-on-year. As a result, the net 
increase in the weighted average input cost over the year was 1.0%. 
YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE
Steel balls for milling (14.7%)
Steel for drilling 4.8%
Explosives (5.8%)
Tyres 6.2%
Reagents 10.6%
Weighted Average 1.0%
Electricity 
The Group’s average cost of electricity decreased by 14.9% when compared to 2008. The 
 -
tricity prices are expected to increase as economic conditions improve during 2010. 
Treatment and reﬁning charges
Treatment and reﬁning charges are determined annually using international benchmarks. 
The treatment charge per tonne of lead and zinc concentrates, including the escalator, 
decreased by 29.7% and 20.8% respectively when compared to 2008. However, these re-
ductions were partially offset by a 23.5% increase in the reﬁning charges per ounce of 
silver, which represented 52.2% of total treatment and reﬁning charges. As a result, treat-
ment and reﬁning charges, which are deducted from adjusted revenues for the purposes 
of revenues as disclosed in the income statement, decreased by 5.8% in 2009 compared 
to 2008. LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCE REVIEW

Prior to the IPO in 2008, the Fresnillo Group had used derivatives to reduce commodity 
price risks arising from changes in silver and gold prices. These precious metals derivative  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

ﬁnancial instruments were terminated in 2007. However, in accordance with Interna-
tional Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39), the Group has deferred in equity, hedging losses 
that arose on these hedging instruments prior to termination, and recycles them to the 
income statement in line with the occurrence of the transactions to which they related. 
In 2009, a ﬁnal non-cash charge of US$25.0 million was deducted from revenues, decreas-
ing hedging losses from the previous year by 45.1%, and as at 31 December 2009 there are 
no remaining deferred losses related to the terminated gold and silver derivatives.
The Group has not entered into any new silver or gold hedging contracts and does not 
intend to do so. However, it has entered derivative contracts related to the price of lead 
and zinc to mitigate the risks associated with the sale of these by-products. In 2009, a gain 
 entered into in 2008 and 2009. All derivative instruments related to the price of by-products 
matured in 2009 and no further contracts have been entered into for subsequent years.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales increased by 7.2% compared to 2008, while adjusted production costs, cal-
culated as total production costs less depreciation, proﬁt sharing and the effects of ex-
change rate hedging, decreased by 6.1%.

Cost of sales 321.63 299.87 21.76 7.2
The increase in cost of sales is explained as follows:
 higher average spot exchange rate which beneﬁtted costs denominated in Mexican pesos 
when converted to US dollars. The exchange-related decrease in adjusted production costs 
was equivalent to US$25.5 million. By factoring out the impact of the exchange rate on 
the peso-denominated components for each cost category, the changes explained below 
 Other positive aspects were:
 Operating efﬁciencies offset the small increase in the average unit cost of key operat-
ing materials, which resulted in a US$1.4 million beneﬁt; and
 The cost of energy decreased by US$0.5 million, due to a 14.9% reduction in the unit 
cost of electricity, which more than offset the 9.5% increase in consumption at the 
mines related to production increases and the higher cost of diesel. 
The beneﬁt of the peso devaluation, operating efﬁciencies and decrease in energy costs 
was partially offset by the following factors:
 The cost of contractors increased by US$5.1 million mainly due to: i) an increase in devel-
opment works at our operating mines, which is a key factor to ensure future production; 
ii) additional civil works; iii) increased volumes of ore and waste hauled; iv) rock bolting and 
shotcreting activities carried out with the aim of ensuring our workers’ safety; and v) an 
average wage increase of 6.0%, in line with the increase given to union workers.
 Personnel costs, excluding proﬁt sharing, increased by US$4.4 million as a result of an 
increase of 8.0% in salaries at our three mines, productivity bonuses, training, and an 
increase in the number of workers at Ciénega.
 Maintenance and repair costs increased by US$2.8 million primarily due to higher 
utilisation of equipment and the consumption of additional spare parts to service the 
increase in equipment.
 Other costs increased by US$1.4 million, which resulted from the combination of in-
creases in insurance, security, maintenance of workers camps and mining rights, and 
the reduction in freight costs.  LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCE REVIEW

 exchange rate was MXN10.64 per dollar. Given the high volatility environment prevail-
ing at that time, the Group entered into exchange rate derivative instruments as part 
of a programme to meet its commitments contracted in Mexican pesos, such as the 
payment of wages and taxes, and to guarantee a ﬁxed exchange rate should the US 
dollar weaken. As a result, Fresnillo plc sold forward US$60.0 million at an average rate 
of MXN11.17 per US dollar. However, the average spot exchange rate at maturity dates 
was MXN13.25 per US dollar, thus generating an exchange rate hedging loss of US$9.5 
million. In 2009, the Group sold forward an additional US$16.0 million at an average 
rate of MXN14.68 per US dollar, which matured throughout 2009 and generated an 
exchange rate hedging gain of US$2.4 million as the average spot exchange rate was 
MXN12.81 per US dollar. The combination of the aforementioned positions resulted in 
a ﬁnal exchange rate loss of US$7.1 million. Additionally, in 2009, the Group sold for-
ward US$29.0 million at an average rate of MXN13.70 per US dollar with maturity dates 
throughout 2010. In order to assure a minimum exchange rate and at the same time 
beneﬁt from a possible devaluation of the peso against the US dollar, four put options 
were purchased totalling US$10.0 million, at an average strike of MXN11.75 per US dol-
lar with maturity dates in 2010. 
COST PER TONNE AND CASH COST PER OUNCE
A key measure to evaluate the performance at our mines is the adjusted production cost 
per tonne.
In 2009, cost per tonne milled at Fresnillo and Ciénega decreased by 11.4% and 6.8% re-
spectively, whilst at Herradura cost per tonne deposited, excluding ore deposited from the 
Valles area, decreased by 9.8% when compared to 2008.

Herradura US$/tonne deposited 5.44 6.03 (9.8%)
* Cost per tonne is calculated as total production costs less depreciation, proﬁt sharing and exchange rate hedging effects
The principal driver of cost reduction across the Group was the higher MXN/US$ exchange 
rate, which beneﬁted costs denominated in Mexican pesos when converted to US dollars 
and, to a lesser extent, the increase in volumes milled/deposited at the mines. Notwith-
standing, these aspects were partially offset by increases in personnel, contractor and 
maintenance costs, as further described below.
Cost per tonne at the Fresnillo mine, excluding the effects of foreign exchange was 
negatively impacted by: i) higher contractor costs due mainly to a 14% increase in me-
tres developed in order to prepare a larger number of production stopes, higher vol-
umes (approximately 7%) of ore hauled through longer distances, and a 126.6% increase 
in shotcreting activities for safety purposes; ii) an 8.0% increase in wages and fringe 
beneﬁts as a result of the negotiations with the union; iii) increase in maintenance and 
repair costs derived principally from the intensive use of equipment; and iv) a 17.0% 
increase in insurance fees and mining concessions. These increases were offset by the 
devaluation effect, higher ore milled and the lower cost of electricity and operating 
materials, which resulted from the decrease in the unit price of steel balls for the mill 
and explosives. Fresnillo’s cash cost

Cost per tonne at Ciénega, excluding the effects of foreign exchange was affected by: i) 
higher personnel costs due to a 6.4% increase in the number of workers and the 8.0% in-
crease in wages and fringe beneﬁts; ii) increased maintenance costs of scoops and loaders, 
as a result of the intensive use of equipment that supported the increase in production; 
iii) higher contractor costs due to an increase of 67.5% in development (10,000 additional 
metres), aiming to prepare a larger number of production stopes, and civil works carried 
out at the plant and mining village.
These increases were offset by the devaluation effect and the increased ore milled. Ciéne-
ga’s cash cost
3
 decreased by 28.1% (US$190.6 per gold ounce in 2009 vs US$264.9 per gold 
ounce in 2008), which was achieved as a result of the increased silver revenues credited to 
the total cash cost. The higher revenues of this by-product were obtained due to both the 
increased price of silver and volume sold during 2009. 
Cost per tonne at Herradura, excluding the effects of foreign exchange was impacted 
by the following factors: i) an 8.0% increase in wages and fringe beneﬁts and training; ii) 
higher costs of operating materials principally resulting from the increase in unit price and 
consumption of sodium cyanide used to improve recovery rates, and the increased con-
sumption of tyres at higher unit costs derived from the more intensive use of equipment 
and the acquisition of bigger trucks; and iii) increase in maintenance costs as a result of 
additional equipment and purchase of spare parts. These increases were offset mainly 
by the devaluation effect and the higher ore deposited. In 2009, Herradura’s cash cost
3
 
decreased from US$397.5 per gold ounce in 2008 to US$358.9 per gold ounce in 2009, a 
reduction of 9.8%. 
GROSS PROFIT 
Gross proﬁt, before hedging gains and losses for each mine, is an important ﬁnancial 
indicator continuously monitored by management to measure the performance of each 
business unit and the Group as a whole. In 2009, gross proﬁt, adjusted to exclude hedging 
gains and losses, increased by 20.2% compared to the previous year mainly due to steady 
results obtained at Ciénega and record proﬁts achieved at Fresnillo and Herradura.
Speciﬁcally, the Ciénega mine maintained its contribution to the Group’s gross proﬁt exclud-
ing hedging effects as a result of the higher ore milled and the signiﬁcant increase in silver ore 
grade, which compensated for the lower gold ore grade extracted. Although in 2009 the Fres-
nillo mine reduced its contribution to the gross proﬁt excluding hedging effects, it remained 
the largest contributor to the increase in the year. Finally, Herradura’s contribution increased 
from 18.9% in 2008 to 22.9% in 2009 due to higher production of gold resulting from the in-
crease in ore deposited and better recovery rates, which led to a record gross proﬁt.

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Until May 2008, administrative expenses included a trademark royalty paid by the Fres-
nillo Group to Peñoles which is no longer payable. Between 1 May 2008 and 31 October 
2009, administrative fees were paid to Servicios Industriales Peñoles, S.A. de C.V. under 
the Transitional Services Agreement (TSA) which has subsequently been replaced by the 
New Services Agreement. Under this new agreement, an annual fee of US$27.6 million 
is payable, a reduction as compared to the annual fee of US$34.0 million that was pay-
able under the TSA. The combined effect of these changes was the main reason for the

reduction in administrative expenses of US$31.8 million. The aforementioned decrease 
was partially offset by the increase in legal and advisory fees related to evaluations of 
potential acquisitions.
EXPLORATION EXPENSES
Exploration expenses for 2009 totalled US$49.1 million, which were mainly incurred in 
exploration programmes aimed at increasing resources and reserves at our three operat-
ing mines, conﬁrming and increasing resource estimates at the Soledad-Dipolos, Noche 
Buena and Saucito projects, and continuing drilling at the San Julián and Orisyvo pros-
pects. However, exploration expenses decreased by 8.3% compared to the US$53.5 million 
incurred in 2008 mainly due to the more intensive exploration phase which took place at 
the Soledad-Dipolos project in the previous year.

SILVERSTREAM REVALUATION EFFECTS
The Silverstream Contract is accounted for as a derivative ﬁnancial instrument, which is 
carried at fair value. In 2009, the fair value of this instrument increased by US$19.4 mil-
lion, with a corresponding non-cash gain recognised in the income statement. Further 
information related to the Silverstream Contract is provided in the Balance Sheet and in 
the note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 117.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The foreign exchange result is caused by the conversion of monetary assets and liabili-
ties denominated in foreign currencies. A foreign exchange gain of US$9.5 million was 
recognised in the income statement mainly as a result of the weakening of the US dollar 
against the UK pound sterling, which affected the cash position denominated in sterling. 
In contrast, a loss of US$14.6 million was recorded during 2008 mainly as a result of the 
devaluation of the sterling against the US dollar.  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

TAXATION
Income tax expense for 2009 was US$99.1 million, 13.5% lower compared to the previ-
ous year. The effective tax rate was 21.7%. A signiﬁcant factor in the reduction from 
2008 was that Minera Fresnillo purchased the San Julián project from the subsidiary 
exploration company Exploraciones Minera Parreña at market value. In accordance with 
Mexican tax legislation, the acquisition of a project can be deducted from the com-
pany’s income, which thus signiﬁcantly decreased the taxable proﬁt of Minera Fresnillo, 
whilst Exploraciones Minera Parreña was able to utilise tax losses brought forward from 
previous years which were previously not recognised as a deferred asset. Other factors 
 and certain tax credits. In addition, a foreign exchange loss was recorded in the income 
statement under Mexican GAAS as set out above, which lowered the Group’s taxable 
proﬁts. This loss was caused by the 3.5% revaluation of the Mexican peso-US dollar ex-
change rate which affected the Group’s cash and other monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in US dollars, the most signiﬁcant of which being the Silverstream Con-
tract, cash and cash equivalents. 
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
Proﬁt for the year increased signiﬁcantly from US$152.8 million to US$358.3 million, 
a 134.5% increase year-on-year. Despite the 46.0% increase in minority interest, proﬁt 
attributable to the shareholders of the Group increased by 151.7% from US$128.0 to 
US$322.0 million in 2009.
Adjusted proﬁt for the year, being proﬁt for the year adjusted to exclude the effects of 
the revaluation of the Silverstream Contract, increased by 125.4% from US$152.8 in 2008 
to US$344.3 million in 2009.

million increase in working capital due to higher prices and volumes sold, which increased 
 from operating activities after changes in working capital, to US$390.7 million. Another 
important source of funds was the US$39.0 million received in proceeds under the Sil-
verstream Contract. The use of these funds included the purchase of property, plant and 
equipment (US$250.4 million). Investments in these items are further described below: LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCE REVIEW

responded to the ﬁnal dividend of 2008, and the remaining US$37.8 million to the pay-
ment of the 2009 interim dividend.
After considering all the sources and uses of funds, there was a net increase of US$92.6 million 
in cash and cash equivalents during the year which, when combined with the US$212.0 million 
balance at the beginning of the year and the favourable effect of the exchange rate of US$7.6 
million, resulted in a net cash position of US$312.2 million as at 31 December 2009.
BALANCE SHEET
The Group has a strong balance sheet with no bank debt. 
Cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 2009 increased by 47.3% compared to the cash po-

The increase in trade and other receivables was mainly caused by the rise in metal prices 
during the last months of the year, and recoverable taxes.

ber 2009, an increase of 38.3% when compared to 2008. The main additions underlying 
this increase were development works including the construction of the Soledad-Dipolos 
project, acquisition of new equipment at the mines, purchase of land and several leaching 
circuit optimisation projects carried out at the Ciénega and Herradura mines.

Fresnillo plc’s long-term operating performance and ability 
to create value for all stakeholders require an ongoing disci-
plined approach. We implement this through occupational 
safety and health, environmental stewardship, mutually 
beneﬁcial relationships with our communities, and robust 
governance practices. Indeed, our very licence to operate is 
dependent upon the ability to meet our responsibilities as a 
corporate citizen. Thus, for the Fresnillo Group sustainability 
efforts are core to the business strategy. 
Our core values support this – trust, responsibility, integrity 
and loyalty – as does our Code of Conduct that must be 
reafﬁrmed annually by every employee. Furthermore, as a 
signatory to the UN Global Compact, the Group has publicly 
committed to best practices in sustainable development. In 
2009, we sent our ﬁrst Communication on Progress (CoP)  
as a signatory. We also follow the Framework for Sustain-
able Development of the International Council on Mining 
and Metals (ICMM) and the framework guidelines set out 
by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In Mexico, we follow 
the Decalogue of the Socially Responsible Companies estab-
lished by the Mexican Centre for Philanthropy.
As a signatory to the Global Compact of the United Na-
tions, the Fresnillo Group promotes gender equality and 
opportunity, freedom of thought and association, respect

We received distinction as a “Socially Responsible 
Company” from the Mexican Centre for Philan-
thropy (CEMEFI) for the fulﬁlment of standards in 
"quality of life in the company," "business ethics", 
"connection with the community" and "care and 
environmental preservation”. Also, our Ethics and 
Values Award from the Federation of Industrial 
Chambers (CONCAMIN) recognises our compliance 
and asset management in areas such as human 
rights, labour relations, environmental protection, 
illicit business prevention, ethics and corporate citi-
zenship for the implementation and dissemination 
of CSR practices.
for human rights, the prohibition of slavery and the ex-
ploitation of child labour, and combats actions that violate 
respect for customs and traditions.
We have long integrated sustainable development prac-
tices into our operations and monitored our performance 
across a number of variables. Since the IPO, we have 
worked to formalise and consolidate our policies and pro-
grammes in this area. 
The Group’s sustainable development strategy and prac-
tices are monitored at the Board level through the Health, 
Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) 
Committee, which is chaired by a Non-executive Director 
and includes an Independent Non-executive Director and 
the Group’s Chief Executive.
The responsibilities of the Committee are to:
 Group’s policy for HSECR issues, including the international 
and industry standards to which the Group should adhere
 -
cidents that may occur in order to assess whether policy 
improvements are required
 -
mance audits and any resulting action plans
At the operating level, HSECR efforts are managed through 
the Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations 
System. Known as SSSMARC (acronym for Sistema de Salud, 
Seguridad, Medio Ambiente y Relaciones con la Comunidad), 
this is a comprehensive management system that inte-
grates the technical, social and economic variables involved 
in workplace and stakeholder engagement, as well as envi-
ronmental and quality of life concerns. 
We utilise SSSMARC to identify sustainability risks; devel-
op and execute mitigation programmes; and ensure 
regulatory compliance and voluntary adherence to 
the standards determined by the HSECR Committee. 
SSSMARC performance is to be evaluated at least 
once per year by the SSSMARC Committee, which is 
comprised of senior executives and operations man-
agers of each mine.

At Herradura we installed an INMERSIVE simula-
tor in 2009 to train operators for open pit off-road 
trucks. This simulator virtually exposes workers to 
difﬁcult operational situations such as equipment 
failure or special atmospheric conditions.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Fresnillo has adopted the occupational health and safety 
guidelines of the International Labour Organisation and 
the World Health Organisation to develop our workplace 
policies and programmes. We comply with all regulations 
put forth by the Mexican Ministry of Labour. 
In accordance with these guidelines, each mine has a 
health and safety commission (known as Comisión de 
Seguridad e Higiene) comprised of executives and union 
and non-union employees who monitor and review per-
formance. These commissions are also responsible for the 
implementation of training and safety programmes.
Certiﬁcations
OHSAS 18001:2008
We are seeking OHSAS 18001:2008 certification at each 
of our mines, which requires specific procedures for 
measuring, monitoring and training. We have start-
ed implementing these procedures and are now 20% 
through the certification programme at Fresnillo. Once 
this is complete we will begin at Herradura and Ciénega. 
2010 target: Advance 80% towards OHSAS certifica-
tion at Fresnillo and initiate the process towards certifi-
cation at Herradura and Ciénega.
Safe Industry Certiﬁcation
In 2009 we initiated the process to obtain Safe Industry 
Certiﬁcation from the Mexican Ministry of Labour. This 
process measures compliance with national safety regu-
lations and the effectiveness of safety management sys-
tems through voluntary audits conducted by the Com-
pany, unions and Government. 2010 target: Complete 
the ﬁrst level of the certiﬁcation programme at all mines, 
including at the Saucito project.
The Group’s main health and safety initiatives are:
Safety
Objective – Eliminate unsafe working conditions, and 
train employees and contractors to eliminate unsafe 
acts, resulting in zero fatalities.
Workplace safety measures are speciﬁc to each area of the 
business: for example, in underground mines we install 
ground anchors and reinforce mine works with shotcrete; 
at the open pit operation we maintain mobile equipment 
in optimal condition to ensure driver safety; and explosives 
and hazardous materials are contained, stored and labelled 
consistently at every worksite. As part of the safety facilities 
and infrastructure in our underground mines we have 21 
refuge stations and train and equip 13 rescue teams.

In 2009, 3D ultrasound and X-ray equipment was 
installed at Fresnillo and Ciénega, and an ambulance 
was purchased at Herradura.
Safety training is an ongoing requirement for all employ-
ees and contractors, and encompasses a broad range of 
job-related topics: from scaling and electrical work to op-
erational procedures and interpersonal behaviours. A spe-
cial 180-hour course for commission members took place 
at the three mines in 2009. 
Health
Objective – Eliminate occupational illnesses and im-
prove general health through preventive care and 
wellness programmes.
We provide a range of medical services for union and non-
union employees as well as contractors. These include an-
nual exams for all employees at our onsite clinics, compre-
hensive medical care for those in need, and routine and 
 vaccines. At Fresnillo and Herradura, we provide major 
medical insurance coverage for families, and at Ciénega, 
the onsite clinic treats all personnel and dependents.
We screen for and treat occupational illnesses such as 
silicosis, hearing loss and elevated blood lead levels as evi-
dence of these may imply unhealthy work conditions that 
require additional preventive measures. We also monitor 
general health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension 
and obesity due to their potential impact on productiv-
ity and mortality. 2010 target: Complete 100% of annual 
medical exams; zero cases of elevated blood lead levels.
Measuring safety and health performance
Fresnillo plc has achieved two consecutive years with zero 
fatal accidents and improved safety performance year 
over year. The Soledad-Dipolos project was constructed 
without major accidents. 2010 target: Maintain zero fa-
tal accidents and improve other safety indices by 20.0%.

 Compensation, beneﬁts and quality of life
Total wages and salaries paid in 2009 were US$17.7 million, 
 increases and new hires. A variable compensation scheme 
for managers and executives was established, which takes 
into account continuous improvement and business indica-
tors. Revisions to union labour contracts resulting from the 
annual review were completed on a mutually satisfactory 
basis, with a 6% increase to salary, 1% increase to fringe ben-
eﬁts and 1% as a one-time bonus. Contracts at Herradura 
were revised in March, Fresnillo in April and Ciénega in May.
 
We recognise the extraordinary commitment that em-
ployees make to the Group, especially mine workers living 
in isolated communities. Aside from compensation, we 
believe we have a responsibility to enhance the quality of 
life of our employees, including education, personal and 
professional development opportunities, and in some ar-
eas of the operation, housing, transportation and access 
to communications.
Training and education
The Group invested US$220,865 in training in 2009, fo-
cused primarily on creating a result-oriented culture of 
teamwork and integration, with workshops and courses 
in leadership, teamwork, process improvement, produc-
Teamwork and innovation
The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare grants annual recognition to teams that generate innovation practices or improve produc-
tion or organisational processes. The Fresnillo and Herradura teams were recognised with the ﬁrst prize in the large industrial sector 
category in the area of process innovation. The prize was delivered in February 2009 by President Felipe Calderón.
The Fresnillo “Visionaries” team project reduced fresh water consumption by 25% in the mineral concentration process while 
increasing tonnage by 4%. The Herradura “Analytical Force” team project increased the physical availability of the 992G loader 
from 75.0% to 84.7% to cover production schedules. LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Our beneﬁts extend to employees’ families. At Fresnillo, we run a tuition-free elementary school for the children of employees. 
At Ciénega, in coordination with the municipality, the company ﬁnancially sponsors elementary and middle school education 
for its employees’ families, and will underwrite the opening of a new high school in 2010. At Herradura, the company provides 
ﬁnancial support to area technical schools.
At all three mines, training workshops in self-esteem, small business entrepreneurship, and family and workplace values are 
provided for spouses, and for school teachers to impart to students.
tivity and management skills. We believe that teamwork 
drives operational improvements, workplace satisfaction 
and the innovation potential of the Company. In 2009, 29 
working teams were constituted to develop speciﬁc efﬁ-
ciency improvement projects.
Transparency and accountability
As part of our commitment to transparent governance 
and strong stakeholder relations, we rely on the Fresnillo 
“Plays Fair” programme to enforce our Code of Conduct. 
This programme includes an anonymous whistleblower 
hotline that provides employees, contractors and suppliers 
with an institutional path for reporting ethical violations, 
unfair treatment of suppliers, workplace discrimination, 
 Complaints are taken to the Fresnillo Honour Commission, 
which is comprised of the Chief Executive, Chief Operating 
Ofﬁcer and the Human Resources Manager. The progress 
of each investigation can be monitored through an access 
code and password assigned to each case. In 2009, we re-
ceived one complaint classiﬁed under “unfair treatment of 
a supplier” which was satisfactorily resolved. FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

Fresnillo plc signed the Copenhagen Communiqué in 
November 2009 in recognition of our commitment 
to climate change mitigation. This is an initiative 
of the Prince of Wales’ Corporate Leaders Group 
on Climate Change that promotes climate impact 
mitigation initiatives.
In 2009 the Fresnillo mine installed an industrial dis-
patcher that reduced electrical consumption by 3.0%, 
as well as solar panels to heat water in restrooms and 
sanitary facilities, with a savings of 70.0%.
ENVIRONMENT
To comply with legal and regulatory requirements and align 
our operations with international standards, environmental 
considerations must be factored into all areas of the opera-
tion. These span the life cycle of a mine, from pre-feasibility 
studies in the exploration phase, to mine development and 
operation, to closure and restoration plans. 
There were no reportable environmental incidents in 2009. 
This category includes tailing dam leakages, leaching pad 
contamination, ﬁres within mines and facilities, and spillage 
of hazardous materials.
We utilise the guidelines and recommendations of the In-
ternational Council on Mining and Metals to develop our en-
vironmental policies and programmes. Our compliance with 
these standards in 2009 is evidenced by:
 Exploration Division 
 environmental authority
 -
tion process at Herradura
 -
gramme for self-reporting emissions
2010 target: Maintain all existing certiﬁcations, obtain the 
Cyanide Code Certiﬁcation at Herradura and complete the 
process at Ciénega.
While these certiﬁcations validate the efﬁcacy of our envi-
ronmental programmes, our philosophy is “to produce more 
with less.” Thus we evaluate our performance on the basis 
of eco-efﬁciency indicators that measure consumption of 
non-renewable resources per tonne of production. In 2009 
 -
crease in operating activities that had no production out-
put, speciﬁcally the development works at Soledad-Dipolos 
and Saucito. As these projects become producing mines, the 
Group’s eco-efﬁciency performance is expected to level off 
and gradually improve. 
Our operations primarily impact the following ﬁve categories:
Energy: 
Objective – Reduce unit consumption of energy.
In 2009 we consumed 3.1 million Gigajoules (28.4% electric-
ity, 69.3% diesel, 1.4% petrol, 0.9% LP Gas). To the extent 
possible, we seek renewable sources of electric energy; 
nonetheless, the majority of our consumption will remain 
in fossil fuels as necessitated by our usage of mobile equip-
ment. A number of energy efﬁciency projects saved approx-
imately 19,250 GJ in the year, equivalent to 0.6% of total 
consumption. 2010 target: Reduce consumption by 10,000 
GJ through energy efﬁcient projects.

At the 9
th
 World Wilderness Congress (WILD9) held 
in Merida, Yucatan in November 2009, Fresnillo plc 
became a founding member of the Corporate Com-
mitment to Wilderness. This programme will foster 
cooperation among participating companies.
Our conservation efforts include the Ciénega Sus-
tainable Forest, conservation of the Sonoran prong-
horn at Herradura, and wildlife protection at the 
Environmental Management Unit at Fresnillo. 
We recycle materials such as spent oil, tyres, copper, 
paper and cardboard. 
At Herradura, spent oil from equipment mainte-
nance is used for blasting at the open pit, which re-
duces diesel consumption.
Water: 
Objective – Reduce unit consumption of fresh water 
through the recirculation of water. 
The minimal residual water that the Company discharges 
fully complies with government quality standards. Fresh wa-
ter is sourced from within the mines at Fresnillo and Ciéne-
ga, and through wells at Herradura. Consumption is limited 
to replacement of evaporated water from tailing dams and 
is used primarily in the beneﬁciation plants, ofﬁces and facili-
ties, and for dust control at open pit mines.
Total water consumption was 3.5 million m

 in 2009, com-
pared to 2.3 m

 -
put at Fresnillo and Ciénega and development works at the 
open pit Soledad-Dipolos project. The start up of the new 
water treatment plant at Fresnillo will replace fresh water 
used in the operation with treated water sourced from the 
nearby municipality of Fresnillo. 2010 target: 20.0% reduc-
tion in fresh water consumption per tonne of production.
Emissions: 
Objective – Contain fugitive dust and minimise unit CO
2
 
emissions from indirect sources of energy.
Fugitive dust is caused at open pit operations by vehicle traf-
ﬁc on the mine’s roads. To prevent this, roads are constantly 
wetted down.
 
Fresnillo plc, like other mining companies, is not a signiﬁcant 
emitter of carbon dioxide. However we participate in the Mex-
ico Greenhouse Gas Programme, a public-private initiative 
through which companies voluntarily report their GHG emis-
sions. In 2009, the Group emitted less than 0.017 tonnes of 
CO
2
 per tonne of mineral production from both direct sources 
(diesel equipment and vehicles) and indirect sources (electric-
ity generated by third parties). 2010 target: Decrease GHG 
emission by 5.0% per tonne. 
Waste and hazardous materials: 
Objective – Maximise the rate of reuse of hazardous ma-
terials and ensure their proper containment. 
We employ a range of initiatives to recycle operating mate-
rials. In 2009, 78.7% of the hazardous waste produced by the 
Group was reused in other processes, compared to 80.3% in 
2008. In addition, 7,250 tonnes of industrial waste was sold 
to third parties, an increase of 5.0% over the previous year.
One of the Company’s main waste products is tailings gen-
 -
agement of our tailings dams fully comply with internation-
al and Mexican standards. 2010 target: Increase the reuse 
of hazardous waste 5.0%.
Biodiversity: 
Objective – Minimise disruptions to endemic ﬂora and 
fauna on our land; mitigate any impact through conser-
vation efforts, relocation and reforestation. 
Nurseries at our mines have an annual capacity of 110,000 
trees, including the new facility built in 2009 by the Explora-
tion Division to facilitate restoration in prospecting areas. 
We donated 88,000 trees in 2009 to schools and communi-
ties to promote environmental culture. We relocated 93,200 
plant specimens in 2009, with an overall survival rate of 
86.7%. 2010 target: Double capacity at the Ciénega nursery 
to 100,000 trees; replant 115 hectares at Ciénega and Fres-
nillo; relocate endemic species at 80 hectares at Herradura. FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

Third Iberoamerican Silversmith Summit
With the objective of adding value to the extraction 
of silver and promoting the use of silver in jewellery 
and craftsmanship, Fresnillo plc, along with the Silver 
Institute sponsored the Third Iberoamerican Summit 
organised in November in the city of Zacatecas. 
This event was created in 2001 by initiative of the 
Peruvian Silver Trust and neighbouring countries to 
exchange expertise and creativity in silversmithing 
through lectures, exhibitions and workshops. Fol-
lowing the ﬁrst two summits in Cuzco and Lima 
(Peru), the Zacatecas meeting brought together 
over 300 participants from 16 countries. The Gover-
nor of Zacatecas, Ms. Amalia Garcia Medina, was an 
active participant. 
Through United Way, Group employees contributed 
US$13,000 to community philanthropic efforts.
COMMUNITIES
Fresnillo’s relationships with the communities where we 
operate are critical to the continuity of operations. We 
share resources such as land, water, infrastructure and of-
ten municipal services. As good corporate citizens, our goal 
is to develop harmonious and mutually beneﬁcial relation-
ships across the lifecycle of our mines, and to strengthen the 
community’s long-term self-sustaining capabilities. 
By nature it is difﬁcult to measure performance in this area. We 
contract with an independent third party to conduct bi-annual 
perception studies in the communities where we operate, and 
rely on the feedback and recommendations of these reports to 
guide our engagement programmes and investments. 
A key effort is to promote local enterprises by providing 
training, ﬁnancing and preferential procurement opportuni-
ties in areas such as transportation, maintenance and mine 
work and consumable supplies.
Working in conjunction with local governments and NGOs, 
our community engagement is focused on ﬁve areas, with 
US$2.9 million spent in 2009:
 Environmental awareness: sponsoring and promoting 
activities such as water conservation, recycling efforts, re-
forestation and clean public areas. Objective: to go beyond 
our environmental mitigation efforts and have impact on 
a wider scale, and to enhance the perception of a respon-
sible mining company.
 Education: building, equipping and funding local schools 
and promoting the study of sciences through teacher 
training. Objective: to promote local development.
 Social integration: extending corporate health, athlet-
ics and recreation activities to the community. Objective: 
to bring together employees, families and community 
members in positive interactions.
 Self-sustaining capacity: training and development in 
alternative sources of income. Objective: to ensure the 
community’s long-term well-being.
 Social infrastructure: ensuring that communities have 
access to basic services such as electricity, sewage, hous-
ing, paved roads, telecommunications and healthcare. 
Objective: to satisfy the basic needs of our communities.
We begin community outreach efforts at the exploration 
phase of our work. We are committed to fair and open 
negotiations, and respect the customs and culture of local 
communities and cooperative landowner groups (ejidos). 
Agreements with landowners often include guaranteed in-
vestments in the development of basic infrastructure.
At our mines in operation, our efforts depend upon the type 
of community and its speciﬁc needs, distance to the opera-
tion and available services and infrastructure.
Fresnillo
The mine is located 60 kilometres northwest of Zacatecas 
City in the state of Zacatecas, which has a long tradition of 
silver mining. The local municipality of Fresnillo is an estab-
lished town of 110,000 (2005 census) with solid infrastruc-
ture and decent basic services.
Our community engagement efforts include the 40-hect-
are Sustainability Complex that includes a recreational park,  LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

small zoo with 184 animal species, a mesquite and cactus 
conservation and research facility, and a tourist mine and 
mining museum. The Complex serves to educate tourists 
and residents about our mining and conservation activities 
and welcomed 29,000 visitors in 2009.
In 2009, we completed construction of the water treatment 
plant that will treat 50% of the city’s sewage for reuse in the 
Fresnillo mine’s processes, bringing environmental beneﬁts 
to the town while reducing our fresh water consumption.
Other investments this year included the remodelling of the 
elementary school for the children of Fresnillo’s employees, 
and sponsorship of various athletic activities.
Herradura
The mine is located 80 kilometres from the nearest large 
town of Caborca, population 70,000 (2005 census) in the 
State of Sonora. Workers from area villages are provided 
daily transportation to the mine site. 
We work in partnership with the Ecology and Sustainable 
Development Commission of Sonora State (CEDES) to pro-
tect the Sonoran pronghorn, an endangered species. Since 
1997, we have monitored and protected their habitat and 
measure the effectiveness of the programme through a 
regular aerial and terrestrial census. We also sponsor educa-
tional programmes in the community.
 -
dura because it is an open pit mine. For example, we re-
locate thousands of cactuses each year. In 2009 we began 
construction of a nursery that will open in 2010.
In 2009, in conjunction with the Borquez Schwarzbeck Foun-
dation we provided materials and funding for the construc-
tion of a new community centre in a village near the mine. 
The facility, which includes a computer lab and meeting 
space, aims to build educational capacity through work-
shops. Separately, we funded a technical school in Caborca.
Ciénega
The mine is supported by the small, isolated community of 
Nuestra Señora de la Ciénega, population 2,500. The nearest 
town is Santiago Papasquiaro, population 47,000 (2005 census), 
153 kilometres away, which itself is 172 kilometres from Du-
rango City. Because the immediate community is entirely de-
pendent on the mine, we provide or facilitate all basic services 
including housing, food, sanitation, healthcare and education. 
Based on feedback received in the community survey, we 
prioritised certain projects in 2009 such as the paving of the 
main road in the village, of which 900 metres was completed 
in conjunction with the municipality. We also constructed 30 
houses for employees’ families this year and installed a new 
cell phone tower to facilitate mobile communications. 
At Ciénega we operate the Sustainable Forest reforestation pro-
gramme, which started in 2003 in partnership with the National 
Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research. Covering 
almost 300 hectares, the forest is planted with evergreen and de-
ciduous trees, and includes endangered species in the mushroom 
family. In 2009 we planted 60,000 saplings, the majority of which 
came from our own nurseries, and continued to enhance the 
water collection systems with the addition of 182 small cisterns.

MANAGING OUR RISKS
An intensive exploration programme helps replenish reserves LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. MANAGING OUR RISKS
61
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that risk is effectively 
managed across the Fresnillo Group, while the efﬁcacy of the internal 
control system is monitored by the Audit Committee. The day-to-day 
responsibility for managing risk and maintaining the Group’s system of 
internal control lies with the Executive Committee, which is supported in 
this task by the Internal Audit department.
Fresnillo’s risk assessment process is dynamic and ongoing: as the mac-
ro environment changes, country- and industry-speciﬁc circumstances 
evolve, and our own internal processes become more institutionalised, 
new risks may arise and others recede. Similarly, the ranking of these risks 
 For the 2009 assessment, the Company’s executives and operations 
managers identiﬁed a universe of more than 100 risks through a survey 
conducted by the Internal Audit team. From these, senior management 
 since the IPO, changes in the impact and/or likelihood of existing risks, 
and those risks requiring careful monitoring and reinforced controls.
Management will continue to reﬁne the processes for monitoring, measur-
ing and reporting risk over the course of 2010.
Further information on the Fresnillo Group’s risk management process-
es and internal controls are found in the Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 72 to 77.
Risk management is vital to meeting our objectives
and creating sustainable value.

Depletion of reserves at existing 
mines and development projects, 
combined with no new mineral 
deposits identiﬁed, which would 
impact the Company’s growth 
projections and production 
capabilities.
Delays in obtaining access 
to the land for performing 
exploration/mining activities, 
caused by complex or unsuccessful 
negotiations with ejidos 
(cooperative landowners). 
Difﬁculty in ﬁnding and/or retaining 
personnel with the requisite 
knowledge, skills and experiences 
for key positions, particularly when 
competition for such personnel is 
greater during periods of expansion in 
the mining industry .
Internal union conﬂicts at 
the national level may cause 
temporary stoppages or discontinue 
operations, even when the source

working conditions at Fresnillo plc.
Security related risks such as 
drug cartels, kidnapping, thefts, 
etc., which have increased markedly 
in Mexico over the past year, could 
cause business interruptions resulting 
from their impact on personnel and 
property. While the Company, its 
employees, contractors and facilities 
are not necessarily speciﬁc targets, 
security issues have become pervasive 
in many parts of the country.
Lower ore grade extracted compared 
to planning stage estimates that 
could impact cash cost projections and 
production programmes.
Difﬁculty in sourcing critical 
equipment and strategic spare 
parts to meet operational needs, 
due to long production and delivery 
timeframes, as well as shortages 
caused by competition for such parts. 
Continued upward trend in the price 
of key operating materials due to 
competitive demand and reliance on 
third party suppliers.
Expensive or insufﬁcient energy 
to meet demands of mining 
operations, due to reliance on CFE, 
the state-run electric utility.
Accidents or irresponsible 
actions caused by the Company in 
the communities where it operates 
that may disrupt operations from a 
civil or legal perspective.
Difﬁculties in obtaining permission 
from the Mexican Ministry of Defence 
for the use of explosives, due to 
the aforementioned security risks 
that have increased the military’s

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) establishes, in Section 1, 17 main principles of 
good governance in four areas: Directors, Directors’ Remuneration, Accountability and Audit, and Relations 
with Shareholders. The following sections explain how these principles were applied (a detailed report on Di-
rectors’ remuneration can be found on pages 78 to 81). For the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2009, the 
Company has complied with Section 1 of the Code, save in the following two respects:
 Code Provision A.2.2: The Code states that the chairman should on appointment meet the independence 
criteria set out within the Code. The Chairman was not independent at the time of his appointment. Alberto 
Baillères has been a board member of Industrias Peñoles, S.A.B. de C.V. (Peñoles) since 1962 and its chairman 
since 1967. Peñoles retains a 77.1% holding the Company. Mr Baillères has been responsible for overseeing the 
successful development of Fresnillo over many years and, therefore, the Board considers that Mr Baillères’ con-
tinued involvement as Chairman is very important to the Company at the present stage of its development;
 Code Provision B.2.1: The Code provides that the Board should establish a remuneration committee of 
at least three Independent Non-executive Directors. The composition of the Fresnillo Remuneration Com-
mittee is made up of three members including two independent Non-executive Directors one of whom, 
Lord Cairns, is the chairman of the Committee. The Chairman of the Company, Mr Baillères, who was 
not independent at the time of his appointment, is also a member. The Board believes that Mr Baillères 
experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the 
Remuneration Committee’s deliberations justiﬁes his membership of the Remuneration Committee. Mr 
Baillères is not involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.
THE BOARD STRUCTURE
The structure and business of the Board is designed to ensure that the Board focuses on strategy, manage-
ment, governance and control issues. Certain aspects of the Board’s responsibilities have been delegated to ap-
propriate committees to ensure compliance with the UK Companies Act, London Stock Exchange Listing Rules 
and the Code. It is the responsibility of the Chief Executive and the members of the Executive Committee to 
manage the day-to-day running of the Group. The Board has delegated authority to the following committees 
to facilitate the routine business of the Company:
The Audit Committee: which has responsibility for, among other things, monitoring the integrity of the Fresnillo 
Group’s ﬁnancial statements. It oversees the Group’s relationship with the external auditors and reviews the effec-
tiveness of the external audit process. It also reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
risk management systems. 
The Remuneration Committee: which has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Fres-
nillo Group’s policy on the remuneration of senior management (being the Executive Director and the other mem-
bers of the Executive Committee) and for the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of the remunera-
tion of the Chairman and of speciﬁc remuneration packages for the Executive Director and the members of the 
Executive Committee, including pension rights and any compensation packages. Full details of the composition and 
role of the Remuneration Committee and the Company’s compliance with the Code Provisions relating to remu-
neration are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 81. 
The Nominations Committee: which has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the 
composition of the Board and its committees and succession planning for the Directors and other senior execu-
tives. Before making appointments of new Directors the Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of 
skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates.
Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations Committee: which is responsible for formulating and rec-
ommending to the Board the Fresnillo Group’s policy on health and safety as well as environmental and local communi-
ty issues. Full details of the role of this Committee are set out in the Sustainable Development Report on pages 46 to 59.
The Executive Committee: The Executive Committee is led by the Chief Executive and is responsible for the manage-
ment of the Company’s businesses including the implementation of decisions agreed in principle by the Board and all ex-
ecutive management of the operations of the Group within the strategy approved and budget approved by the Board. 
The terms of reference for each of the Audit, Remuneration Nominations and Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Relations Committee are available on the Company’s website.

THE BOARD
The Board meets at least four times a year and has an established programme of meetings. At these meetings 
the Board takes responsibility for the Group’s long-term objectives and commercial strategy and monitors the 
management of the Group’s activities. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s decision 
which includes approvals of major expenditure and investments and key policies.

executives present in April 2009. The Independent Non-executive Directors met to evaluate the performance of 
the Chairman in October 2009.
BOARD MEMBERSHIP (BOARD BALANCE & INDEPENDENCE)
At the year end the Board consisted of the Chairman, Alberto Baillères, one Executive Director, Jaime Lomelín, 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and eight Non-executive Directors. Biographical details of each of the Directors can be 
found on pages 66 to 69 of this Annual Report. 
The separate roles of Chairman and of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are recognised and the requirements for these 
roles have been speciﬁed in writing and agreed by the Board. There have been no changes to these roles since 
they were agreed by the Board. 
Mr Hector Rangel resigned on 30 January 2009 and Mr Fernando Solana was appointed as an Independent Non-
executive Director on 18 February 2009.
As Senior Independent Director, Lord Cairns is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer or Head of Investor Relations. 
The composition of the Board and the roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive Director and the Senior Inde-
pendent Director have been structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate the decision-making 
processes of the Board. The Board has considered the independence of all of the Directors and its assessment 
of the independence of the Non-executive Directors is set out below:

Alberto Baillères, Rafael MacGregor, Juan Bordes and Arturo Fernández are each directors of Peñoles and have 
been appointed to the Board by Peñoles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement. Further information con-
cerning the Relationship Agreement is set out in the Directors’ Report on page 83. 
As indicated above, the Chairman was not independent at the time of his appointment. However, Mr Baillères has 
been responsible for overseeing the successful development of the Fresnillo Group over many years and therefore the 
Board considers that his continued involvement as its non-executive chairman is vitally important to the Company. 
Fernando Ruiz is a retired partner and consultant in the ﬁrm Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C., a ﬁrm providing 
professional services to the Company. Mr Ruiz is not involved in providing any services to the Company on behalf 
of Chevez, Ruiz, Zamarripa y Cia., S.C. (the value of those services is not material to either party). 
Guy Wilson was appointed to the Board on 1 July 2008 having retired as a partner of Ernst & Young LLP, the 
Company’s auditors and reporting accountants on 30 June 2008. Mr Wilson was not involved in the provision of 
audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to his retirement. 
As required by the Code, the Board has considered the independence of Fernando Ruiz and Guy Wilson and has 
concluded that they are both independent in character and judgement. 
The Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment for periods of three years and the time commitment 
required from each Non-executive Director is set out in their letter of appointment. The fees payable to each 
Non-executive Director are set by the Board in accordance with its Schedule of Reserved Matters. None of the 
Directors holds any appointments to the board of any other FTSE100 quoted company. 
The Executive Director has a service contract of no ﬁxed term. Further details concerning the Executive Direc-
tor’s service agreement are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 79. Copies of the Directors’ 
letters of appointment and service agreement are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce. In 
accordance with the Articles of Association each Director shall retire at the Annual General Meeting held in the 
third calendar year following the year in which he was elected or last re-elected by the Company. At the annual 
general meeting held in 2009 all the Directors offered themselves for election having been appointed during the 
year. None of the Directors will be standing for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

 BOARD PROCESS 
It is the Chairman’s responsibility to provide timely information to the Board supported by the Company Sec-
retary. Board papers are circulated in a timely manner and all proposals presented to the Board for its consid-
eration under the Schedule of Reserved Matters are ﬁrst considered and approved by the Executive Committee. 
In so doing, the Executive Committee aims to ensure that any such proposals take into consideration those 
factors set out in section 172, Companies Act 2006. Matters that purely require Executive Committee approval 
are reported to the Board and matters that require approval under the Schedule of Reserved Matters, are con-
sidered by the Executive Committee and then presented to the Board for deliberation and approval.
All Directors have received brieﬁngs from the Company’s advisers, including presentations to familiarise them 
with their duties and responsibilities as Directors of a UK listed company. The Chairman ensures that the induc-
tion and training processes for new Directors continues to be developed. Mr Solana was presented with a brief-
ing pack and an induction on his appointment to the Board in February 2009. 
The Directors may raise concerns at meetings of the Board and, if necessary, ask for such concerns to be re-
corded in the Board minutes. Directors also have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
(whose appointment and removal is a matter reserved to the Board). A procedure has been established to en-
able Directors to obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in relevant circumstances.  LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

During the year an evaluation of performance of the individual Directors and the Board was carried out by 
way of anonymous questionnaires that were collated by the Company Secretary and then reviewed and 
discussed by the Board in October 2009. The responses to all questions relating to the performance of the 
Board were very positive. Suggestions for improvement included that the Board should spend more time on 
strategy and also focus more on monitoring risk on an ongoing basis. These suggestions will be considered 
further during 2010.
Directors and Ofﬁcers Liability Insurance cover is in place and a review of the cover, particularly by reference to 
the mining peer group among the London-listed companies, was carried out in July 2009. 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
The members of the Nominations Committee are Alberto Baillères (Chairman of the Committee), Javier 
Fernández and Fernando Ruiz. The majority of the members of the Nominations Committee are, therefore, 
Independent Non-executive Directors. 
The role of the Nominations Committee is to identify and nominate for approval of the Board, candidates to 
ﬁll Board vacancies as and when they arise. When making an appointment, the Committee is required by its 
terms of reference to evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. 
The Nominations Committee is also responsible for reviewing the structure, size and composition, including 
skills knowledge and experience, of the Board and make recommendations to the Board with regards to any 
changes. Such a review was carried out at the time of Mr Solana’s appointment. The Nominations Commit-
tee considers succession planning for Directors and other senior executives from time to time. 
The Nominations Committee has met once in the year to consider the appointment of Mr Solana and other 
matters in accordance with the terms of reference. The Terms of Reference of the Nominations Committee 
were reviewed during the year.
The Nominations Committee has not retained any external consultants to assist it in its work. In considering 
future appointments to the Board, the Nominations Committee will consider the balance and structure of 
the Board and the commitments made by the Board under the Relationship Agreement.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The members of the Audit Committee, at 31 December 2009, were Guy Wilson (Chairman of the Commit-
tee), Fernando Ruiz and Fernando Solana. Guy Wilson was a partner at Ernst & Young prior to his retirement 
on 30 June 2008. He is therefore considered to have recent and relevant ﬁnancial, auditing and accounting 
experience. The role of the Audit Committee, among other things, is to monitor the integrity of the ﬁnancial 
statements of the Company, including its annual and interim reports, preliminary results announcements 
and any other formal announcement relating to its ﬁnancial performance. The Audit Committee met ﬁve 
times in the year to carry out its responsibilities as described in its terms of reference. 
Accordingly the Audit Committee has reviewed the 2009 Annual Report and Accounts including the prelimi-
nary results announcement before recommending their approval by the Board. As part of this review, the 
Audit Committee reviewed the accounting policies, the clarity of disclosure, compliance with the rules of 
the London Stock Exchange, the Listing Rules and other legal and regulatory requirements and all material 
information presented in the Financial Statements. The Audit Committee considered the re-appointment 
of the Company’s auditors before making a recommendation to the Board to be put to shareholders. The 
Audit Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditors and reviewed the terms of engage-
ment of the external auditors at its meeting in August 2009. The effectiveness of the external auditor was 
reviewed by the Audit Committee in April 2009. In addition as part of this responsibility, the Audit Committee 
has reviewed the ﬁndings of the external auditor, reviewed management representation letters, approved 
audit plans and timescales and reviewed policies on the independence of the external auditor. Prior to recom-
mending the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP at the forthcoming AGM to the Board, the Audit Committee 
conducted a review of the independence of Ernst & Young LLP. Details of the fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP 
during the year are shown at note 29 to the Financial Statements. The Audit Committee has a policy in place 
in respect of the provision of non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor. The engage-
ment of the external auditor to provide statutory audit, assurance, taxation and certain advisory services is 
pre-approved. Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services above US$150,000 is 
subject to the speciﬁc approval of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee has received presentations and updates from the Group Internal Audit Department 
throughout the year concerning their workplan during the year. A workplan for 2010 has also been presented 
and approved by the Audit Committee. Regular update reports on the internal audit reviews conducted by 
the Internal Audit Department are also received by the Audit Committee. Where necessary the Audit Com-
mittee will seek assurance that any serious weaknesses have been addressed. During the year the Audit  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT
76
Committee has been briefed on internal audits conducted during that period but none have required any 
further action on the part of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviewed the arrangements by 
which employees may raise concerns about improprieties concerning ﬁnancial or other matters at its meet-
ing in December 2009 and it is satisﬁed with the adequacy of those arrangements.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control which includes risk man-
agement and reviewing its effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to identify, evaluate 
and manage signiﬁcant risks associated with the achievement of the Group’s objectives. Because of the 
limitations inherent in any system of internal control, this system is designed to meet the Company’s 
particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed. It is designed to manage risk rather than eliminate 
risk altogether. Consequently it can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee its responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of these 
controls. The Audit Committee reviews these systems on an annual basis. The day to-day responsibility for 
managing risk and the maintenance of the Group’s system of internal control is collectively assumed by the 
Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is supported in this task by the Internal Audit Department. 
On behalf of the Board and the Executive Committee, the Internal Audit Department has established a pro-
cess for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group in accordance with the 
Turnbull Guidance. The Group has also adopted a risk-based approach in establishing the Group’s system of 
internal control and in reviewing its effectiveness. Risks have been classiﬁed into a number of categories for 
management purposes. Based on these risk categories the Audit Committee has sought assurance from the 
Executive Committee and the Internal Audit Department on the Group’s system of internal control.
The basis upon which assurance has been sought includes:
 -
ment. 
 Plan adopted at the time of the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange.
 The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management, internal 
control systems and the half year and annual ﬁnancial statements before their submission to the Board. It 
also reviews the scope and results of the audit with the external auditors and the schedule of work for the 
Internal Audit Department for the year. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the arrangements whereby staff may, in conﬁdence, 
raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters.
There are a number of components to the system of internal controls within the Company and these are 
detailed as follows:

The Board have, through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal controls taking account of the matters summarised above. On the basis of 
this review, the Board considers that the measures that have been implemented over the past 18 months 
to create an appropriate risk management framework are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances. The 
Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and 
maintaining best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies 
listed on the London Stock Exchange. LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company has an ofﬁce in London and a Head of Investor Relations who is based in London. The Group 
has implemented a strong investor relations programme and aims to meet major shareholders and analysts 
at least twice a year to discuss the results of the Group and to respond to any queries the shareholders may 
have. The Head of Investor Relations in London is the ﬁrst point of contact with investors maintaining ongoing 
relations with analysts and major shareholders through telephone calls and meetings. The Company also uses a 
full programme of mining conferences to meet with current and prospective investors. Contact with investors 
in Mexico is maintained through the Investor Relations Ofﬁce in Mexico City. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief 
Financial Ofﬁcer, the Director of Exploration and the Director of Operations participate in the major roadshows 
to meet with analysts and shareholders. The Head of Investor Relations, supported by the Chief Executive Of-
ﬁcer, gives a report at each Board meeting on communications and shareholder activity.
The Company’s second annual general meeting will be held on 28 May 2010. The business of the Annual General 
Meeting will be conducted in accordance with the provisions D.2.1 and D.2.2 of the Code. The Chairman of the 
Board and the chairmen of each of the board committees will be available to answer questions put forward 
to them by shareholders of the Company. The Annual Report and Accounts and Notice of the Annual General

PART I – UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
INTRODUCTION
The board of directors of Fresnillo plc is pleased to present their Directors Remuneration Report for 2009.
This Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) and sets out information about the remu-
neration of the Directors and senior management of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009. Part 
2 of this report has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations.
As required by the Regulations, this report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Company’s 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Board established the Remuneration Committee on 15 April 2008 and it has met three times during the 
year. The Remuneration Committee consists of three Directors, two of which are Independent Non-executive 
Directors - Lord Cairns, who is the chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and Mr Fernando Ruiz. Mr Alber-
to Baillères, who was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee on 18 February 2009, was not 
independent at the time of his appointment. The Board believes that Mr Baillères’ experience and knowledge 
of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee’s 
deliberations justiﬁes his membership of the Remuneration Committee. Mr Baillères is not involved in matters 
concerning his own remuneration.
Attendance at meetings of the Remuneration Committee by individual members is detailed in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 73.
Terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee have been approved by the Board and its duties include 
the determination of the framework policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and other mem-
bers of the Executive Committee, as well as their speciﬁc remuneration packages, including pension rights and, 
where applicable, any compensation payments. In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee is 
expected to take into account all factors which it deems necessary to ensure that the senior executive man-
agement of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong performance and are, 
in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company. 
It will approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by 
the Company and approve the total annual payments made under such schemes. The terms of reference of 
the Remuneration Committee are available for inspection on the Company’s website at www.fresnilloplc.com. 
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer usually attends meetings of the Remuneration Committee at the invitation of the 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to this committee. No 
Director is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
The Non-executive Directors’ fees are set by the Board under the Schedule of Matters reserved for its approval.
ADVISERS
In setting executive salaries, benchmarking information is supplied annually to the Company by Mercer, Hay 
Group and Data Compensation. Mercer supplies comparative information on 330 companies in Mexico and Hay 
Group produces comparative information for 22 companies in the mining sector. Such information is used when 
setting salaries for all employees, not just the senior executive thus ensuring consistency between Group pay 
and executive pay structures. Benchmark information for international mining companies is provided to ensure 
that remuneration is competitive compared to the peer group.
Towards the end of the year, the Remuneration Committee agreed that Mercer should be asked to meet with 
the Remuneration Committee from time to time to present its data on executive remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Remuneration Committee has agreed a remuneration policy to ensure that the Company is able to at-
tract, retain, and motivate its executives and senior management. The retention of key management and the 
alignment of management incentives with the creation of shareholder value are key objectives of this policy.

DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT

In setting the basic levels of pay for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that 
salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and in the international context for gold and 
silver producers. Total compensation is set around the median level. Salaries are benchmarked annually and 
total remuneration is benchmarked biennially.
The variable component of remuneration is embodied within the short term incentive plan which is available to 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the Vice President of Operations and the Vice President of 
Exploration as well as other corporate managers. The achievement of annual performance targets is, therefore, 
rewarded through an annual performance-related bonus. The performance targets upon which bonuses are 
based include a mix of ﬁnancial and operational performance measures.
It is the Company’s policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. 
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are 
paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incen-
tive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman nor any of 
the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company; however each has entered into a letter 
of appointment with the Company.
LONG TERM INCENTIVES
Fresnillo does not offer any share- or cash-based long term incentives to management. 
SHORT TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (STIP)
At the beginning of the year a STIP was put in place for the members of the Executive Committee, including the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer who is the sole Executive Director. A number of Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) were ap-
proved by the Remuneration Committee for each member of the Executive Committee and KPI targets were set 
at which payments equivalent to 0% to 50% of annual salary could be earned. A scoring system is used whereby 
each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated a points-rating which represents a 
median performance target for that objective. Upper and lower points thresholds are set to allow for outstanding 
performance and ensure that underperformance is not rewarded. For each member of the Executive Committee 
(including the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer), bonus is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 
points. Bonus payments are paid for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points as follows:
POINTS VARIABLE PAY (MONTHS SALARY) VARIABLE PAY (PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL SALARY)
100-104 Two months 16.67%
105-109 Four months 33.33%
110-114 Five months 41.67%

The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer achieved in excess of 115 points for the year to 31 December 2009. 
The Objectives, Measure and Weighting applied to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s short term incentive payment 
is as follows:
OBJECTIVE  MEASURE WEIGHTING
Production  Equivalent ounces produced 27.0
Exploration  % increase in reserves/resources 31.5
Financial  Net proﬁt adjusted* 18.0
Stakeholder  Fatalities, lost days, LTIFR, Strikes 13.5
Teamwork  No measure 10.0
Total  100.0
* Adjusted to eliminate currency ﬂuctuations, the effect of year-on-year changes in metals prices and to exclude any revaluation of the 
Silverstream Contract.

Supply Relationships: On 31 December 2007, the Fresnillo Group entered into long-term arrangements with 
the Peñoles Group (the Silverstream Contract) in relation to the by-product silver output from the Peñoles-
owned polymetallic mine at Sabinas in Zacatecas, Mexico. Under the Silverstream Contract, Fresnillo is en-
titled to all of the proceeds (before deduction of any treatment and reﬁning charges) in respect of Payable 
Silver produced from the zinc and lead concentrates produced by the Peñoles Group’s Sabinas mine during 
its life. Further information concerning the Silverstream Contract can be found in note 15 of the Financial 
Statements on page 117.
At the time of the IPO, the Company entered into a Transitional Services Agreement with Servicios Industriales 
Peñoles, S.A. de C.V. (SIPSA) for the provision of administrative and other services in return for arm’s length fees 
for an initial period of 12 months (the SIPSA Agreement). The SIPSA Agreement was extended for a further 
period of six months and terminated on 31 October 2009. Fresnillo and SIPSA entered into a new services agree-
ment which commenced on 1 November 2009 (the NSA). To ensure that the NSA was entered on arm’s length 
normal commercial terms, KPMG conducted a benchmarking exercise in relation to the fee paid in respect of 
the services under the agreement, determining that such fee was in fact on normal commercial terms. On 21 
December 2009, pursuant to an internal corporate restructure within Peñoles, SIPSA’s interest in the NSA was 
acquired by Dolorey, S.A. de C.V., a wholly-owned Peñoles subsidiary.
Further information concerning the NSA can be found in the Finance Review on page 40 and note 6 of the 
Financial Statements on page 109.
Customer Relationships: During the period substantially all of the primary products from the Group’s mines, 
silver- and gold-rich lead and zinc concentrates and dore were sold to the Peñoles Group’s reﬁning and smelting 
facility at Torreón, operated by Met-Mex Penõles, S.A. de C.V. (Met-Mex) under a series of supply agreements 
(the Met-Mex Arrangements). This arrangement enables the Group to beneﬁt from relatively low transport 
costs. The terms of the supply agreements with Met-Mex are set on an “arm’s length” basis with revenue being 
determined by the amount of metal contained in the ores and the average market prices over a certain period 
net of certain deductions. 
Government Relationships: Under Mexican law, mining concessions from the Federal government are required 
to explore for and exploit mineral potential. The Fresnillo Group holds such concessions in respect of its opera-
tions in return for which it pays maintenance fees to the Government and has to meet capital expenditure 
commitments. The Fresnillo Group is required by law to operate in accordance with environmental and health 
& safety standards.
Employee Relationships: Approximately two thirds of the Group’s workforce is employed and one third are 
contractors. Further details can be found in the Sustainable Development Report on page 54. The Group has 
contracts with a large number of different service and personnel providers. Details of the service agreement 
with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 79.
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
On 8 May 2008, Peñoles and the Company entered into a relationship agreement to regulate the ongoing rela-
tionship between the Company and Peñoles. The principal purpose of the relationship agreement is to ensure 
that the Company and its subsidiaries are capable of carrying on their business independently of the Peñoles 
Group, and that transactions and relationships with the Peñoles Group (including any transactions and relation-
ships with any member of the Fresnillo Group) are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. Under this 
relationship agreement, Peñoles has undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Memorandum 
and Articles of Association in a way which would be inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement. It has 
also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a “related party transaction” (as deﬁned in 
paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Peñoles Group.
DIRECTORS
The names and biographies of the current Directors of the Company are set out on pages 66 to 69. Directors 
may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the Board. If appointed by the Board, a Director 
holds ofﬁce until the next annual general meeting. All of the Directors retired and offered themselves for elec-
tion at the annual general meeting in 2009. Each Director shall retire at the annual general meeting held in the 
third year following the year in which he was elected or last re-elected by the Company.
Directors’ Indemnities and Insurance
The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity with each Director in respect of proceedings bought by 
third parties and pension scheme liabilities subject to the conditions set out in the Companies Act 2006. The 
Company has purchased Directors & Ofﬁcers Liability insurance. All of these arrangements remain in place at 
the date of this report. FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS – CHANGE OF CONTROL
The Penmont (Herradura) and MAG Silver (Juanicipio) agreements each contain provisions ensuring that the 
respective interests of the shareholders in these respective companies may be transferred in accordance with 
their respective bye-laws subject to preferential rights of existing shareholders.

wish if there was a change of control of Fresnillo plc.
There are no formal “change of control” provisions within the Silverstream Contract or Met-Mex Arrangements.
The Group’s mining concessions are held by various of its Mexican subsidiary companies. As long as the com-
panies holding the mining concessions remain Mexican resident companies, there are no provisions within the 
concession agreements which would be triggered by a change of control of the Company.
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of the Company’s share capital are set out in note 20 to the Financial Statements on pages 119 to 121. 
The Company has two classes of share capital 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of US$0.50 (Ordinary Shares) and 
50,000 deferred shares of £1.00 each (Sterling Deferred Shares). The Ordinary Shares are listed on the London

ent by a duly authorised representative) shall have one vote, and on a poll every shareholder who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder. The Notice of AGM speciﬁes

 -
ployees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Ordinary Shares.

custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred 
Shares. Except at the option of the Company, the Sterling Deferred Shares are not transferrable.
AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE OWN SHARES CHANGE
The Company was authorised by a shareholders resolution passed at the annual general meeting held in May 
2009 to purchase up to 10% of its issued Ordinary Share capital. Any shares which have been bought back may 
be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, 
thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued and authorised share capital. This authority will expire 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and a resolution to renew the authority for a further year will be 
proposed. No shares were purchased by the Company during the year.
EMPLOYEES
Information relating to employees is given in note 8 to the Financial Statements on page 110 and in the Sus-
tainable Development Report on page 54.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY 
At 31 December 2009 the Company had no trade creditors (2008: nil). It is the Company’s policy to agree terms 
of trading, including payments terms, with all suppliers. Provided suppliers perform in accordance with the 
agreed terms, payment will be made in accordance with the terms.
MARKET VALUE OF LAND AND BUILDINGS

1 January 2005 as part of the Group’s transition to reporting under IFRS. Land and buildings acquired since 1 
January 2005 are recorded at cost. It is not practical to estimate the market value of land and buildings at each 
balance sheet date.

table donations of US$0.6 million during the year. Further information concerning the community initiatives within

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
(b) Changes in accounting policies and presentation rules
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2008 except for the adoption of certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards. Those that are applicable 

 IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amended standard requires 
additional disclosure about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. Fair value measurements are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a 
three level hierarchy for each class of ﬁnancial instrument. In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for Level 3 
fair value measurements is now required, as well as signiﬁcant transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. The 
amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity man-
agement. The fair value measurement disclosures are presented in note 31 and the liquidity risk disclosures are presented in note 32.
 IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. This standard introduces the “management 
approach” to segment reporting. IFRS 8, requires the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the 
 The adoption of this standard has given rise to additional disclosures set out in note 3, including the related comparative information.
 IAS 1 (Revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’, is effective for ﬁnancial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard separates 
owner and non-owner changes in equity. The statement of changes in equity now includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-
owner changes in equity presented as a single line. In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents 
 linked statements.
 IAS 23 Amendment, ‘Borrowing Costs (revised in March 2007)’, is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. IAS 23 
(Revised) has removed the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period 
of time to get ready for use or sale. An entity is, therefore, required to capitalise borrowing costs as part of the cost of such assets. The revised 
standard applies to borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 


 IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ and IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’, issued in January 2008. IFRS 3R 
introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date that will impact the amount of goodwill 
recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs, and future reported results. IAS 27R requires that a change in the owner-
ship interest of a subsidiary (without loss of control) is accounted for as an equity transaction. Therefore, such transactions will no longer give rise 
to goodwill, nor will it give rise to gain or loss. Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by partially-owned 
subsidiaries as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary. Other consequential amendments were made to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’, IAS 12 
‘Income Taxes’, IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’, IAS 28 ‘Investment in Associates’ and IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’. 
The changes introduced by IFRS 3R and IAS 27R will affect future acquisitions or loss of control and transactions with Minority interests. 
Improvements to IFRS
 In May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB issued omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarify-
ing wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. All applicable and effective amendments were adopted, the majority of 
 -
 IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’: Replaces the term “net selling price” with “fair value less costs to sell”.
 IAS 19 ‘Employee beneﬁts’: Amendments have been made to curtailments and negative past service costs, plan administration costs, additional 
guidance has been given on contingent liabilities and the replacement of the term “fall due” with “ that are due to be settled”.
 
 IAS 23 ‘Borrowing costs’: The deﬁnition of borrowing costs is revised to consolidate the two types of items that are considered components of 
“borrowing costs” into one – the interest expense calculated using the effective interest rate method calculated in accordance with IAS 39.

(c) Signiﬁcant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions   
 
Many of the amounts included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results 
may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in 
the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Judgements 
 
Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial information are: 
 

 The determination of functional currency requires management judgment, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transac-
tions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
 
Estimates and assumptions 
 
Signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial information include: 
 

 Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the unit-of–production 
method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine speciﬁc assets. This results in a 
depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life of mine production. Each item’s life, which is 
assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine 
property at which the asset is located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable 
reserves. Changes are accounted for prospectively.
 
 estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualiﬁed persons relating to the geological 
data on the size, depth and shape of the ore body, and requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recov-
erable reserves is based upon factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, future capital requirements, and produc-
tion costs along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body. Changes in the reserve 
estimates may impact upon the carrying value of mine properties, property, plant & equipment, the provision for rehabilitation, recognition of 
deferred tax assets, and depreciation and amortisation charges.
 
 impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. These assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, 
future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained 
from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Fair value for mineral assets is generally 
determined as the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows arising from the continued use of the asset, which includes estimates such 
as eventual disposal and using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account. Cash ﬂows are discounted by an 
appropriate discount rate to determine the net present value. Management has assessed its cash generating units as being an individual mine 
site, which is the lowest level for which cash ﬂows are largely independent of other assets.
 declines, management assesses the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in proﬁt or loss. At 31 

 

 mine rehabilitation as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent 
and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine life, recoverable reserves and changes in 
discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision at the 
balance sheet date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future rehabilitation costs required. Changes to esti-
mated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the rehabilitation asset and liability. If, for mature mines, the revised mine 
assets net of rehabilitation provisions exceeds the carrying value, that portion of the increase is charged directly to expense. For closed sites, 
changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
 
 For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, management is required to make assumptions regarding the future returns on plan assets, future remuneration 
structures, employee turnover, inﬂation rates and exchange rates. Changes to these assumptions may change the accounting treatment and 
the amounts charged to the income statement.

 Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, including those 
 in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash ﬂows from operations and the 
application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash ﬂows and taxable income differ signiﬁcantly from estimates, 


 The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative ﬁnancial instrument requires signiﬁcant estimation by management. The derivative 
has a term of over 20 years and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the reserves and resources 
and future production proﬁle of the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and 
the discount rate used to discount future cash ﬂows. The fair value of this contract is $298.6 million as at 31 December 2009 (2008: US$318.3 
million) and changes in these assumptions may change this value. For further detail of this arrangement, see note 15. For further detail on the 
inputs that have a signiﬁcant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 31. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, inﬂation 
and the discount rate is included in note 32.  
 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies applicable to the speciﬁc type of derivative instrument.
    

 By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of contingencies 
inherently involves the exercise of signiﬁcant judgment and estimates of the outcome of future events.

 using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and proﬁts and losses, including unrealised proﬁts 
arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains 
except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

(e) Foreign currency translation 
 
 is US dollars. During 2008 the functional currency of the Company changed to US dollars as a result of changes in the transactions undertaken by 
the Company following the IPO.  
 
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated into dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined. 
For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars, as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency 
 year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in equity. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumula-
tive amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.
 
(f) Property, plant and equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value. Cost comprises its purchase 
price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost 
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCIALS
99
The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s estimated useful life has 
been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine 
property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equip-
ment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings 
and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual 
asset when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for 
prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated. 
The expected useful lives are as follows: 
 
   Years
 Buildings 5-12 

 Mining properties and development costs 3-9 
 Other assets 2-7 
 
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts are expected from its use or disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised. 
  
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered prin-
cipally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classiﬁed as held for sale. 
 
Disposal of assets   
 
 -
ferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed. 
 
Mining properties and development costs 
Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project 
when incurred. 
Purchased mineral reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a busi-
ness combination. 
 
Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which beneﬁts are expected to be obtained 
from that speciﬁc concession.
 
Expenditure on mine development is capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once there is suf-
ﬁcient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the speciﬁc project. Revenues 
from metals recovered from ore mined in the development phase, prior to commercial production, is credited to development costs. Upon com-
mencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically proven 
and probable reserves to which they relate.
Construction in progress 
 
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construc-
tion is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. Construction in progress is not depreciated. 
 
Subsequent expenditures 
 
All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those 
parts that are replaced is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditures are recognised in the income state-
ment as incurred. 
 
Stripping costs 
 
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste in order to access the ore body. During development and pre-
production phases, these costs are capitalised as part of the initial mine investment and they are depreciated based on the mine’s production once 
commercial operations begin. 
 
Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping and commences at the time 
that saleable material begins to be extracted from the mine. The costs of production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs. 
Further development of a mine may occur following initial extraction of saleable material and during the production phase. Stripping costs associated 
with such development activities are capitalised and depreciated based on the related production. FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

(g) Determination of ore reserves 
 
 Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code. Reports to support these estimates are prepared each year. An independent competent person has veri-
ﬁed the reasonableness of these reports as at 31 December 2009. 
 
Reserves are used in the unit-of-production calculation for depreciation, the determination of the timing of mine closure and for determining value 
in use for any impairment analysis. 
 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves. Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change signiﬁcantly 
when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may 
change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves being restated. 
 
(h) Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets 
 
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be re-
coverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of 
impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken 
on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash ﬂows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and 
then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level. 
 
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reﬂect the asset at the 
recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
The recoverable amount of an asset
 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is based on an estimate of the amount 
 their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the as-
set. For an asset that does not generate cash inﬂows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount 
 assets that generate cash inﬂows that are largely independent of the cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets. 
Reversal of impairment 
 
An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist 
 loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was 
recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment 
loss reversal is recognised in the income statement. 
 
(i) Financial assets 
 
 -
mines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When ﬁnancial assets 
are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of ﬁnancial assets not at fair value through proﬁt or loss, directly attributable 
transaction costs. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss 
 
Financial assets classiﬁed as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value through proﬁt or loss on inception are included in this category. 
Financial assets are classiﬁed as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. Derivatives are also classiﬁed as held-for-trading unless 
they are designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with 
gains or losses recognised in the income statement. 
Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify 
as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through proﬁt and loss or available-for-sale. 
 
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. 
 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCIALS
101
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Long-term receivables 
are stated at amortised cost. 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets 
 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are those non-derivative ﬁnancial assets that are designated as such or are not classiﬁed in any of the preceding 
categories and are not held to maturity investments. 
 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets represent investments that have a quoted market price in an active market, therefore a fair value can be reliably 
measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a 
separate component of equity. 
 
Fair value 
 
In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices. When quoted prices on 
an active market are not available (and for listed non-actively traded securities), fair value is determined using a valuation technique. Valuation tech-
niques include using a recent arm’s length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the 
same, discounted cash ﬂow analysis and option pricing models. If the range of reasonable fair value is signiﬁcant and the probabilities of the various 
estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value.
(j) Impairment of ﬁnancial assets 
 
 
Assets carried at amortised cost 
 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is 
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows (excluding future expected credit 
losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss. 
 -
ally or collectively for ﬁnancial assets that are not individually signiﬁcant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an 
individually assessed ﬁnancial asset, whether signiﬁcant or not, the asset is included in a group of ﬁnancial assets with similar credit risk characteris-
tics and that group of ﬁnancial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an 
impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. 
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or signiﬁcant 
 amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are de-recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible. 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial investments 
 
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its 
current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement. In as-
 the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classiﬁed as available-for-sale are not 
recognised in the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase 
in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement. 
 
(k) Inventories 
 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. The cost of work 
in progress and ﬁnished goods (ore inventories) is based on cost of production and excludes borrowing costs. 
For this purpose, the costs of production include: 
 
 and processing of ore; 
 
 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT
102
(l) Cash and cash equivalents 
 
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest 
at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. 
 
For the purposes of the cash ﬂow statement, cash and cash equivalents as deﬁned above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
 
(m) Provisions 
 
 of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a ﬁnance cost. 
Mine closure cost 
 
A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation 
costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on 
a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of 
the discount is included in ﬁnance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future 
economic beneﬁt and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the 
  
Other

ment. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings 
 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
 losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.  
  
(o) Employee beneﬁts 
 
 
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan 
 
This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico and it is denominated in 
Mexican Pesos. This plan was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. For members as at 30 June 2007, beneﬁts were frozen at that date subject to 
indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). 
 
The cost of providing beneﬁts under the deﬁned beneﬁt plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and pre-
pared by an independent actuarial ﬁrm as at each year end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on mxAAA (Standard & Poors) and 
 in the same currency in which the beneﬁts are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense in the period 
in which they occur. 
 
Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested. If the beneﬁts have 
already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately. 
The deﬁned beneﬁt asset or liability comprises the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the 
obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic beneﬁts available in the form of refunds 
from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.

Deﬁned contribution pension plan 
 
 or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee 
beneﬁt expense in proﬁt or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee’s salary. 
 
This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme. 
 
Seniority premium for voluntary separation 
 
This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for 
those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a 
payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary. 
 
The cost of providing beneﬁts for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation 
method and prepared by an independent actuarial ﬁrm as at each year end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income 
or expense in the period in which they occur. 
 
Other 
 
Beneﬁts for death and disability are covered through insurance policies. 
 
Termination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred. 
 
(p) Employee proﬁt sharing 
 
In accordance with local legislation, companies in Mexico must provide for employee proﬁt sharing equivalent to ten percent of the taxable income 
of each year. This amount is charged to the income statement and is considered deductible for income tax purposes. 
(q) Leases 
 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including 
whether the fulﬁlment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a speciﬁc asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: 
 
a. There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; 
 
b. A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; 
 
c. There is a change in the determination of whether fulﬁlment is dependent on a speciﬁed asset; or 
 
d. There is a substantial change to the asset. 
 
Group as a lessee 
 
 inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are 
apportioned between the ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability. Finance charges are reﬂected in the income statement.

 direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on 
the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned. 
 
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassess-

 (r) Contingencies 
 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated ﬁnancial information and are disclosed in notes unless their occurrence is remote. 
 
Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated ﬁnancial information, but they are disclosed in notes if they are deemed probable. 
 
(s) Revenue recognition 
 
 Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. 
 
Sale of goods 
 
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when 
title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.

content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined. 
 each month, are “provisionally priced” subject to a ﬁnal adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery to the customer, 
 are ﬁnally priced in the month of delivery. 
 
For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the 
provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract. At each reporting date 
the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotation 
period ends. The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluing of provi-
sionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. 
Royalties 
 
Income derived from royalties is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received. Cur-
 rented to a third party. 
 
Rental income 
 
Rental income arising from operating leases on a small scale mine rented to a third party is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Interest income 
 
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e., the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument to the net carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset). Interest income is included as ﬁnance 
income in the income statement.
 
Dividend income  
 (t) Exploration expenses 
 
Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability 
of an identiﬁed resource. 
 
Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: 
 
(i) Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life, and 
 
(ii)  Exploration expenses: 
 
a. Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves, and 
 
b. Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identiﬁed 
by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufﬁcient probability of the existence of economically recover-
able minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the speciﬁc project.

(u) Finance income and costs 
 
Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested and the unwinding of the discount on provisions. 
 
Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability. 
(v) Income tax 
 
Current income tax 
 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxa-
tion authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred income tax 
 
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. 
 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: 
 
(i) where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a busi-
ness combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt loss; and 
 
(ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: 
 
(i) where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a trans-
action that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt or loss; and 
 
(ii) in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred 
income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable proﬁt will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against cur-
rent income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.  
(w) De-recognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
 
A ﬁnancial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
 
Where an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new li-
ability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in proﬁt or loss. 
 
The difference between the carrying amount of a ﬁnancial liability (or part of a ﬁnancial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the 
consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
(x) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging 
 
 derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT
106
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to 
the income statement. 
 
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the speciﬁc type of 
derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for 
contracts with similar maturity proﬁles. The Silverstream contract is valued using a net present value valuation approach.
 
 hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation includes identiﬁcation of the 
hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s 
effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash ﬂows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are 
expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash ﬂows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they 
 for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: 
 Cash ﬂow hedges 
 
For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are 
recorded as a component of equity and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects proﬁt or loss, such as when a 
forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains and losses related to the hedging of revenues, these are included as part of revenues and for those related 
to the hedging of foreign exchange risk, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reﬂected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-ﬁnancial 
asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability. The ineffective por-
tion of changes in the fair value of cash ﬂow hedges is recognised in the income statement of the related period. 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any 
cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in equity from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain 
or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
 
Embedded derivatives 
 
 only if there is a change to the contract that signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the cash ﬂows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to 
the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand alone derivatives. 
 (y) Dividend distribution 
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders or Board as 
appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s subsidiaries.
(z) Value added tax 
 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax 
 
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. 
 
(za) Borrowing costs 
 
Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the ﬁnancing of construction or development of qualifying assets requir-
ing a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use. 
 
In the case of such qualifying assets, ﬁnance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use. The amount of ﬁnance 
costs capitalised (before the effects of income tax) for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings 
outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period.

Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable 
segments are accounted for on an arm’s length basis similar to transactions with third parties.
In 2009 all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico, the Company’s country of domicile, except for approximately 3.3% of revenue as per 
the consolidated income statement which was sold to a third party customer based in the Netherlands. This revenue is shown within the Fresnillo and

Business Flat Tax (“Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica” or “IETU”) 
Effective 1 January 2008 a new alternative minimum corporate income tax called the Flat Rate Business Tax was introduced in Mexico to replace the 
existing business asset tax. From this date companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or 
their liability to IETU. 
 
IETU is calculated at the rate of 16.5% for the calendar year 2008, 17% for 2009 and 17.5% for subsequent years and applies to the sale of goods, rendering 
of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred 
in generating income. 
 
 that is recognised in 2009, since the mainstream corporate income tax liability for each group company is forecast to be greater than the future potential 
IETU charge. Accordingly, no IETU liability should arise in the foreseeable future.

There have been no signiﬁcant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements.
Silverstream contract:
The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model (for further information relating to Silverstream contract see note 15). 
This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the 
nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a signiﬁcant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that 
will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican Peso 
and US Dollar, future inﬂation and the discount rate used to discount future cash ﬂows.

The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inﬂation and the discount rate is 
disclosed in note 32.
The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and re-
sources, the related production proﬁle based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs 
is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the op-
erator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production proﬁle and estimated payable silver that will recovered 
from ore mined is based on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production 
over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.
Embedded derivatives within sales contracts:
 best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to ﬁnal price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (s)). 
This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and is separated from the sales contract. 
At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the 
relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated 
metal content is a non observable input to this valuation. 
 embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenue.

 1 CORPORATE INFORMATION   
 
Fresnillo plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries 
detailed in note 6.  
 Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V. (“Peñoles”) currently owns 77 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the 
Baillères family, whose beneﬁcial interest is held through Peñoles. The country of incorporation of Peñoles is Mexico. Copies of Peñoles’ accounts can be 
obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. 
 precious metals mining business of Peñoles were reorganised under the Company (the “Pre-IPO Reorganisation”). As such, prior to 18 April 2008, the 
Company did not control the entities it acquired pursuant to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation.

The ﬁnancial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc 
on 1 March 2010.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
(a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance 
The ﬁnancial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union as they apply to the ﬁnancial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009, and in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s ﬁnancial statements are also consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The ﬁnancial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative ﬁnancial instruments and 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial instruments which have been valued at fair value.  
The ﬁnancial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the ﬁnancial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
(b) Standards, interpretations and amendment
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2008 except for the adoption of certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards. Those that are applicable to the 
Company are as follows:
 IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. This standard introduces the “management 
approach” to segment reporting. IFRS 8, which is mandatory for the Company’s 2009 ﬁnancial information, requires the disclosure of segment 
information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, as deﬁned in IFRS 8, in order to 
assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. The adoption of this standard does not impact the Company’s ﬁnancial 
statements as segmental information is provided in the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
 IAS 1 (Revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ is effective for ﬁnancial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard separates 
owner and non-owner changes in equity. The statement of changes in equity now includes only details of transactions with owners, with non-
owner changes in equity presented as a single line. In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all 
items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements. The Company has taken the exemption 

 IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amended standard requires 
additional disclosure about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. Fair value measurements are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a 
three level hierarchy for each class of ﬁnancial instrument. In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for Level 3 fair 
value measurements is now required, as well as signiﬁcant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. The amendments 
also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCIALS
 IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’- certain amendments are effective for ﬁnancial years beginning on or after 1 January 
2009. The amendments require that all dividends from subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities or associates are recognised in the income state-
ment. Accordingly, all dividends received from subsidiaries have been recognised in the income statement.
Improvements to IFRSs
In May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB issued an omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying 
wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. None of the amendments that are effective for the year ended 31 December 2009 
had any impact on the accounting policies, ﬁnancial position or performance of the Company. None of the amendments that are effective for the year 
beginning 1 January 2010 are expected to have any impact on the accounting policies, ﬁnancial position or performance of the Company.
(c) Signiﬁcant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions   
Many of the amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and estimates are based 
on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the 
amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements. 
Information about such judgements and estimation is in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the ﬁnancial statements. 
Judgements 
 
Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial state-
ments are: 
 
 The determination of functional currency requires management judgment, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transac-
tions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
 
Estimates and assumptions 
 
Signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial information include: 
 
 Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, including those aris-
ing from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate taxable earnings in future periods, 
in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash ﬂows from operations and the 
application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash ﬂows and taxable income differ signiﬁcantly from estimates, 
the ability of the Company to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
 The Company classiﬁes certain ﬁnancial assets as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity. When the fair value 
declines, management assesses the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in proﬁt or loss. At 31 
 The Company assesses the investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator 
of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs 
to sell and the value in use. A value in use assessment requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, 
discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. Fair value is determined as the amount that 
would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Where an impairment 
charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the im-
pairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that 
investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2009 an impairment 
 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subse-
quently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies applicable to the speciﬁc type of deriva-
tive instrument.
 
 By nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of contingencies inherently 
involves the exercise of signiﬁcant judgement and estimates of the outcome of future events.
(d) Foreign currency translation 
 
The Company’s ﬁnancial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Com-
pany is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.  
  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT
 Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated into dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined. 
(e) Investments in subsidiaries
 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and ﬁnancial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.  In-
vestments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. 
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value 
less costs to sell and the value in use. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in an arm’s 
length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision 
is recorded in the income statement to reﬂect the investment at the recoverable amount. 
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indi-
cation that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is 
made. An impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does 
not exceed that that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
(f) Financial assets 
 
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial assets at fair 
value through proﬁt or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, as appropriate. The Company 
determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When ﬁnancial 
assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of ﬁnancial assets not at fair value through proﬁt or loss, directly 
attributable transaction costs. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss 
 
Financial assets classiﬁed as held-for-trading and other assets designated as fair value transactions through proﬁt and loss on inception are included 
in this category. Financial assets are classiﬁed as held-for-trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. Derivatives are also classiﬁed as held-
for-trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are carried in the balance sheet at 
fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify 
as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through proﬁt and loss or available-for-sale. 
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for 
 amortisation process. 
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. Long-term receivables 
are stated at amortised cost. 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets 
 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are those non-derivative ﬁnancial assets that are designated as such or are not classiﬁed in any of the preceding 
categories and are not held-to-maturity investments. 
 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets represent investments that have a quoted market price in an active market, therefore a fair value can be reliably 
measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a 
separate component of equity. 
 
Fair value 
 
In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices. When quoted prices on 
an active market are not available (and for listed non-actively traded securities), fair value is determined using a valuation technique. Valuation tech-
niques include using a recent arm’s length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the 
same, discounted cash ﬂow analysis and option pricing models. If the range of reasonable fair value is signiﬁcant and the probabilities of the various 
estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value.
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCIALS
 (g) Impairment of ﬁnancial assets 
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired. 
Assets carried at amortised cost 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is 
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows (excluding future expected credit 
losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss. 
The Company ﬁrst assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for ﬁnancial assets that are individually signiﬁcant, and in-
dividually or collectively for ﬁnancial assets that are not individually signiﬁcant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for 
an individually assessed ﬁnancial asset, whether signiﬁcant or not, the asset is included in a group of ﬁnancial assets with similar credit risk charac-
teristics and that group of ﬁnancial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which 
an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. 
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the 
invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired receivables are derecognised when they 
are assessed as uncollectible. 
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial investments 
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) 
and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income 
 considering the size of the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classi-
ﬁed as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through 
the income statement if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised in the income statement. 
(h) Cash and cash equivalents 
 
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest 
at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. 
 
For the purposes of the cash ﬂow statement, cash and cash equivalents as deﬁned above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(i) Share Capital
Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that 
are incurred in connection with the share issue.  The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is 
recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
   
(j) Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outﬂow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a ﬁnance cost. 
 (k) Financial liabilities 
 
The Company recognises ﬁnancial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instru-
ment. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT
 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 
 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
 losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.  
  
 (l) Contingencies 
 
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the ﬁnancial information and are disclosed in notes unless their occurrence is remote. 
 
Contingent assets are not recognised in the ﬁnancial information, but they are disclosed in notes if they are deemed probable. 
 (m) Revenue recognition 
 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.
 
Trademark Royalties 
 
Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received. 
 
Interest income 
 
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument to the net carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset). 
 
Dividend income  
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established. 
(n) Finance income and costs 
 
Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested, gains and losses from the change in fair 
value of derivative instruments and the unwinding of the discount on provisions. 
 
Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability. 
 
(o) Income tax 
 
Current income tax 
 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxa-
tion authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred income tax 
 
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. 
 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: 
 
 (i) where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a busi-
ness combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt loss; and 
 
 (ii) in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: 
 
 (i) where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt or 
loss; and 
 
 (ii) in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred 
income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
 
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCIALS
 The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable proﬁt will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against cur-
rent income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.  
(p) De-recognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
A ﬁnancial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new li-
ability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in proﬁt or loss. 
The difference between the carrying amount of a ﬁnancial liability (or part of a ﬁnancial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the 
consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
(q) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging 
 
The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in prices of base metals and foreign 
exchange which impact the ﬁnancial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets 
when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
 
 Company’s stand alone ﬁnancial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash ﬂow hedges. Any 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to 
the income statement.
 
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the speciﬁc type of 
derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for 
contracts with similar maturity proﬁles.
 
Embedded derivatives 
 
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company ﬁrst becomes party to the contract, with reas-
sessment only if there is a change to the contract that signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the cash ﬂows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely 
related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives. 
 (r) Dividend Distribution
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders.
(s) Value added tax 
 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax. 
 
The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. 
 
(t) Borrowing costs 
 
Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the ﬁnancing of construction or development of qualifying assets requir-
ing a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use. 
 
In the case of such qualifying assets, ﬁnance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use. The amount of ﬁnance 
costs capitalised (before the effects of income tax) for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings 
outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period.

4 SEGMENT REPORTING
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ introduces the management approach to segment reporting, which requires the disclosure of segment information based 
on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources 
to them.
Segmental information is not presented in the Company’s stand-alone ﬁnancial statements as this is presented in the Company’s consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.

Business Flat Tax (“Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica” or “IETU”) 
Effective 1 January 2008 a new alternative minimum corporate income tax called the Flat Rate Business Tax was introduced in Mexico to replace the 
existing business asset tax. From this date companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or 
their liability to IETU. 
 
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   LEADERSHIP . QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. FINANCIALS
 IETU is calculated at the rate of 16.5% for the calendar year 2008, 17% for 2009 and 17.5% for subsequent years and applies to the sale of goods, rendering 
of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods. In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred 
in generating income. 
 
In respect of the Company, management has undertaken calculations to determine the impact of the new IETU provisions on the Company. As a result of 
such analysis, management has concluded that there should be no material impact on the Company, other than a US$6.1 million tax credit arising under 
IETU that is recognised in 2009 since the mainstream corporate income tax liability of the Company is forecast to be greater than the future potential 
IETU charge. Accordingly, no IETU liability should arise in the foreseeable future.

13 CONTINGENCIES 
 
As at 31 December 2009 the Company has the following contingencies: 
(a) The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. 
  
(b) Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for ﬁve years following the date of the ﬁling of the 
corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. 
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. 
 
 In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related 
party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in 
the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest. It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the 
 the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. 
(c) On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the "Separation Agreement").  This agreement relates to the 
 between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) 
 claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the ag-
gregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.

18 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
Overview 
 
The Company’s principal ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets and trade 
payables. 
 
The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing base metals commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk arising 
on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries. 
 
The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of ﬁnancial instruments: 
 
a) Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate and equity price risks
 
b) Credit risk 
 
c) Liquidity risk 
 
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for assess-
ing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the ﬁnancial statements. 

 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework. 
 
The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in market 
conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and 
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. 
 
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies 
and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is as-
sisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results 
of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 
(a) Market risk 
 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Company income 
or the value of its ﬁnancial instruments. 
 
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return 
on risk. 
 
Foreign currency risk 
 
The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar (primarily the 
Mexican peso and UK pound sterling). Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchases of services and other items. As a result, the Company has 
ﬁnancial liabilities denominated in Mexican pesos. The Company also holds cash and cash equivalents in both the Mexican peso and UK pound sterling.
  
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate 
compared to the Mexican peso, reﬂecting the impact on the Company’s proﬁt before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the 
same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable exchange rates for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to deriva-
tive ﬁnancial instruments.

instruments. The Company’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any ﬂoating element of the Company’s interest bearing loans and 
borrowings. As at 31 December 2009 and 2008 there were no ﬂoating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a 
full year from the balance sheet date.

 (b) Credit risk 
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Company’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all ﬁnancial assets. These ﬁnancial 
assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets.  
The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. Individual exposures are monitored 
with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not signiﬁcant. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is 
inﬂuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s ﬁnancial assets are with counterparties with what the Company 
considers to have an appropriate credit rating. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s ﬁnancial assets were neither impaired nor past due. 
 cash-pooling facility for investment management. Following the IPO the Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, 
S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of ﬁnancial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the 
 above, and only for periods of less than 30 days.
The maximum credit exposure at reporting date of each category of ﬁnancial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See 

(c) Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage 
of funds using projected cash ﬂows and by monitoring the maturity of both its ﬁnancial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity proﬁle of the Company ﬁnancial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current 
liabilities and non-current liabilities. 
Capital management 
 

Subsequent to the IPO, the primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capi-
tal ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value.  Management considers capital to consist only of equity as disclosed in the balance 
sheet. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital invested in the Company,  management thoroughly evaluates all material proj-
ects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT

 Mineral resources are reported inclusive of mineral reserves. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded 
to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal equivalent 
cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions as follows: Gold: US$819.22 per oz; Silver: US$14.09 per oz; Lead: US$0.95 per lb; and Zinc: US$1.08 per lb and appropriate 
metallurgical recoveries.

The mineral resources of the Soledad-Dipolos deposits have not been audited by SRK.
* Cut-off grade calculations assume 100% metal recovery, except for Minera Parreña disseminated where gold recovery of 68% and 45% were considered for oxide and sulfide mate-
rial, respectively.

WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS - BOILER ROOM SCAMS
Over the last year, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically 
from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often 
turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are com-
monly known as ‘boiler rooms’. These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely persua-
sive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported that the average 
amount lost by investors is around £20,000.
It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of the victims had been 
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolic-
ited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. If you receive 
any unsolicited investment advice:
 by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register
 or visiting www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk
 If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online 
form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found on the FSA website

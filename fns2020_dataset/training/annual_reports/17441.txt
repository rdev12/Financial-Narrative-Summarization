throughout Wales, the West Midlands, Lancashire and Yorkshire.
Our Retail Division covers the supply of specialist agricultural and retail products to customers throughout 
Wales and the Midlands.
Agriculture
Specialist Retail
FEED DIVISION 
The Feed Division, which operates two compound feed mills and one blending plant, offers a full range 
of animal nutrition products to the agricultural market. The location of the mills allows for logistically 
efficient delivery of our products throughout our trading area, third party mills are also used to satisfy 
additional seasonal and geographic requirements. Both mills are multi species allowing the business 
to provide a broad range of products to service the requirements of ruminant and monogastric animals.
WYNNSTAY STORES 
The rural retail outlets are well established and provide a comprehensive range of products for farmers 
and rural dwellers. The stores, which now number 31 operating in North and Mid Wales and the West 
Midlands, supply a wide range of specialist products to farmers, smallholders and pet owners. Our 
dedicated team are happy to help customers with technical advice on all aspects of the wide range of 
products available. Our increased diversity complements our core agricultural business, acting as an 
important route to market for pharmaceutical companies with whom the Group works with closely to 
provide specialist professional advice to livestock farmers.
ARABLE DIVISION 
The Arable Division supplies a wide range of products to arable and grassland farmers throughout the 
trading area. The Group is recognised as a significant supplier of fertiliser, acting as a principle supplier 
of GrowHow products together with our own Top Crop brand of fertiliser. Seed is processed in Shropshire 
at the arable base as well as at Woodheads Seeds in Yorkshire. Agrochemicals are supplied to complete 
the range of products.
JUST FOR PETS 
Just for Pets which is based in Hartlebury in Worcestershire currently has 21 specialist pet product stores 
operating on busy retail sites throughout the West Midlands, extending east to Cambridge and south to 
Bristol. All stores offer a wide range of pet related products and are recognised as convenient one stop 
shops for all pet owners. Our staff have considerable experience within the pet sector and a significant 
proportion are qualified to offer specialist advice to pet owners. Two stores have an easipetcare concession 
offering veterinary clinic advice and services to customers; this is further complimented by vaccination 
clinics in six of our other stores.

OVERVIEW
In my first statement since my appointment as Chairman of the Group in April 
2012, I would like to begin by acknowledging the considerable achievements 
of my predecessor, John Davies, who relinquished the role ahead of his 
forthcoming retirement at the Group’s AGM in March 2013. Having chaired 
Wynnstay for the last 23 years, he has made a tremendous contribution to 
the Group and we are all indebted to John for his work in helping to establish 
Wynnstay as a significant presence in UK agriculture over this time. It is fitting 
that in his final year on the Board, the Group has achieved record results in 
both sales and profitability.  
The 13% increase in annual Group pre-tax profits to £7.82m on revenues of 
£375.78m reflects the benefits of our strategy to grow the business both 
organically and via acquisition, and also continues to demonstrate the strength 
of the Group’s broad spread of activities within the agricultural sector.  
The agricultural division delivered a 23% increase in operating profit to £4.71m, 
helped both by a full 12 month contribution from GrainLink, our grain trading 
business which we rebranded after acquiring Wrekin Grain in May 2011, and 
improved returns, particularly in feed. Volumes across our market sectors 
varied so whilst demand for animal feed rose, we saw reduced volumes in 
fertiliser and traded raw materials.  
Our specialist retailing activities performed robustly over the period. The 
division delivered a 5% uplift in operating profit to £3.90m and we continue to 
develop both our Wynnstay Stores and Just for Pets formats. We acquired three 
farm supplies businesses during the year and one after the year end, and our 
chain of Wynnstay Stores now stands at 31.  We also opened two new Just for 
Pets stores over the period, increasing the total  number to 21 by the year end.  
Over the last few years we have extended Wynnstay’s trading presence outside 
its traditional heartland.  The establishment of FertLink, the joint venture 
fertiliser activity we set up in November 2011, together with the expansion 
of our Wynnstay Stores network, are further steps in the gradual widening of 
Wynnstay’s farming customer base.   
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenues for the year to 31 October 2012 increased by 9% to £375.78m 
(2011: £346.18m), with agricultural supplies sales contributing £295.19m 
(2011: £274.57m) and specialist retailing contributing £80.47m (2011: 
£71.32m). The Group’s pre-tax profit (including the Group’s share of  
pre-tax profits from joint ventures and associate investments) rose by 13%  
year-on-year to £7.82m (2011: £6.94m). The operating profit contribution 
from agricultural supplies including joint venture results increased by 23% 
to £4.71m (2011: £3.82m) and specialist retailing activities contributed a 
5% increase to £3.90m (2011: £3.70m). Other activities showed a loss of 
£0.33m (2011: loss of £0.19m). Net finance charges amounted to £0.46m 
(2011: £0.39m). After a Group taxation charge of £1.99m (2011: £1.94m), net 
earnings were 17% higher at £5.83m (2011: £5.00m).  This equates to 34.99p 
per share (2011: 30.23p) representing a rise of 16% over the preceding year.
Net assets at the year end were 10% higher at £56.83m (2011: £51.70m). 
Net debt stood at £13.79m (2011: £6.67m), with the increase reflecting 
higher working capital utilisation resulting from the expansion of activities 
and certain weather related changes to some trading patterns. However 
gearing remains conservative at 24% (2011: 13%) of net assets. Return on 
net assets remained constant at 14.2% (2011: 14.2%).
Chairman’s Statement
The outlook for the  
UK Agricultural Industry  
is very positive 7 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
DIVIDEND
The Board is pleased to propose the payment of a final dividend of 5.65p per 
share, which together with the interim dividend of 2.85p per share, paid on 
31 October 2013, takes the total dividend for the year to 8.50p, an increase 
of 9% on last year (2011: 7.80p). The final dividend will be paid on 30 April 
2013 to shareholders on the register on 2 April 2012. A scrip dividend 
alternative will continue to be available as in previous years.  The last date 
for election for the scrip dividend will be 16 April 2013.
BOARD CHANGES
With the impending retirement of Non-executive Director, John Davies, from 
the Board in March 2013, the process is now underway to appoint a new 
Non-executive Director and we expect to make a further announcement on 
this in the spring. As previously reported, when I stepped up to the role 
of Chairman in April 2012, the role of Vice Chairman was vacated and 
Jim McCarthy, Non-executive Director, was appointed to this position.      
OUTLOOK
The outlook for the UK agricultural industry is very positive, with long term 
macro economic trends, including the increasing requirement for food to feed 
a growing world population, providing structural support.  The Government 
has recognised the importance of the agricultural industry and instigated 
a number of initiatives to encourage UK self-sufficiency in food products. 
A number of retailers are also actively promoting British food products. 
However pricing pressures remain, driving the need for efficiency throughout 
the food chain, which will ultimately lead to further consolidation within the 
agricultural supply industry. 
Wynnstay has for sometime been an active participant in agricultural 
consolidation and is recognised as an acquisitive business. As part of our 
growth plan, we will continue to acquire businesses which fit our model 
whilst also developing Wynnstay organically. The Group has a strong 
financial base from which to grow, with low gearing and good cash flow.  Our 
broad base continues to be a major factor in providing sustainable returns 
for all stakeholders in the business and I have confidence that our Group will 
continue to develop over the coming years.

Datganiad y Cadeirydd
Mae’r rhagolwg i 
Ddiwydiant Amaethyddol  
y DU yn gadarnhaol iawn
TROSOLWG
Yn fy natganiad cyntaf ers i mi gael fy mhenodi’n Gadeirydd y Grw ^p ym 
mis Ebrill 2012, hoffwn ddechrau drwy gydnabod cyflawniadau sylweddol 
fy rhagflaenydd, John Davies, a ymadawodd â’r rôl cyn ei ymddeoliad yng 
Nghyfarfod Cyffredinol Blynyddol y Grw ^p ym mis Mawrth 2013. Mae John, 
sydd wedi cadeirio Wynnstay am y 23 o flynyddoedd diwethaf, wedi gwneud 
cyfraniad aruthrol i’r  Grw ^p ac mae ein dyled ni oll iddo yn fawr am ei waith 
yn helpu i sefydlu Wynnstay fel presenoldeb o bwys ym maes amaethyddiaeth 
y DU dros y cyfnod hwn. Mae’n addas bod y Grw ^p wedi cyflawni canlyniadau 
digynsail o ran gwerthiannau a phroffidioldeb yn ystod ei flwyddyn olaf ar y 
Bwrdd.
Mae’r cynnydd o 13% mewn elw cyn treth y Grw ^p i £7.82m ar refeniw o 
£375.78m yn adlewyrchu manteision ein strategaeth i dyfu’r busnes yn 
organig a thrwy gaffael, ac mae hefyd yn parhau i ddangos cryfder ystod eang 
o weithgareddau’r Grw ^p yn y sector amaethyddol.
Cyflawnodd yr is-adran amaethyddiaeth gynnydd o 23% mewn elw gweithredu 
i £4.71m, gyda chymorth cyfraniad 12 mis llawn gan GrainLink, ein busnes 
masnachu grawn a ailfrandiwyd gennym ar ôl caffael Wrekin Grain ym mis 
Mai 2011, gan wella elw, yn arbennig o ran porthiant. Roedd symiau ar draws 
ein sectorau marchnad yn amrywio felly er i’r galw am borthiant anifeiliaid 
gynyddu, gwelwyd gostyngiad yn symiau’r gwrtaith a deunyddiau crai wedi’u 
masnachu.
Perfformiodd ein gweithgareddau manwerthu arbenigol yn gadarn dros y 
cyfnod. Cyflawnodd yr is-adran gynnydd o 5% mewn elw gweithredu i £3.90m 
ac rydym yn parhau i ddatblygu ein fformatau Wynnstay Stores a Just for Pets. 
Caffaelwyd tri busnes cyflenwadau fferm gennym yn ystod y flwyddyn ac un 
ar ôl diwedd y flwyddyn, a bellach mae 31 o Wynnstay Stores yn rhan o’n 
cadwyn. Gwnaethom hefyd agor dwy siop Just for Pets newydd dros y cyfnod, 
gan gynyddu’r cyfanswm i 21 erbyn diwedd y flwyddyn.
Dros yr ychydig flynyddoedd diwethaf rydym wedi ymestyn presenoldeb 
masnachu Wynnstay y tu hwnt i’w berfeddwlad draddodiadol. Mae sefydlu 
FertLink, y fenter gwrtaith ar y cyd a sefydlwyd gennym ym mis Tachwedd 
2011, ynghyd ag ehangu ein rhwydwaith o Wynnstay Stores, yn gamau pellach 
yn y broses raddol o ehangu sail cwsmeriaid ffermio Wynnstay.
CANLYNIADAU ARIANNOL
Cynyddodd refeniw ar gyfer y flwyddyn hyd at 31 Hydref 2012 9% i £375.78m 
(2011: £346.18m), gyda gwerthiannau cyflenwadau amaethyddol yn cyfrannu 
£295.19m (2011: £274.57m) a manwerthu arbenigol yn cyfrannu £80.47m 
(2011: £71.32m). Cynyddodd elw cyn treth y Grw ^p (gan gynnwys cyfran y 
Grw ^p o elw cyn treth o fentrau ar y cyd a buddsoddiadau cysylltiedig) 13% 
o flwyddyn i flwyddyn i £7.82m (2011: £6.94m). Cynyddodd y cyfraniad elw 
gweithredu o gyflenwadau amaethyddol yn cynnwys canlyniadau mentrau 
ar y cyd 23% i £4.71m (2011: £3.82m) a chyfrannodd gweithgareddau 
manwerthu arbenigol gynnydd o 5% i £3.90m (2011: £3.70m). Dangosodd 
gweithgareddau eraill golled o £0.33m (2011: colled o £0.19m). Cyfanswm 
y taliadau cyllid net oedd £0.46m (2011: £0.39m). Ar ôl trethiant y Grw ^p o 
£1.99m (2011: £1.94m), roedd enillion net 17% yn uwch, sef £5.83m (2011: 
£5.00m). Mae hyn yn cyfateb i 34.99c fesul cyfranddaliad (2011: 30.23c) sy’n 
gynnydd o 16% o gymharu â’r flwyddyn flaenorol.  9 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

DIFIDEND
Mae’r Bwrdd yn falch o gynnig talu difidend terfynol o 5.65c fesul 
cyfranddaliad, sydd, gyda’r difidend interim o 2.85c fesul cyfranddaliad, a 
dalwyd ar 31 Hydref 2013, yn creu cyfanswm difidend o 8.50c ar gyfer y 
flwyddyn, sy’n gynnydd o 9% ers y llynedd (2011: 7.80c). Telir y difidend 
terfynol ar 30 Ebrill 2013 i gyfranddalwyr sydd ar y gofrestr ar 2 Ebrill 2012. 
Bydd difidend sgrip amgen ar gael o hyd, fel yn y blynyddoedd blaenorol. Y 
dyddiad olaf ar gyfer dewis cael difidend sgrip fydd 16 Ebrill 2013.
NEWIDIADAU I’R BWRDD 
Gydag ymddeoliad y Cyfarwyddwr Anweithredol, John Davies, o’r Bwrdd ym 
mis Mawrth 2013 ar y gweill, mae’r broses bellach yn mynd rhagddi i benodi 
Cyfarwyddwr Anweithredol newydd a disgwyliwn wneud cyhoeddiad arall ar 
hyn yn ystod y gwanwyn. Fel y nodwyd yn flaenorol, pan gefais fy mhenodi’n 
Gadeirydd ym mis Ebrill 2012, roedd rôl yr Is-gadeirydd yn wag a phenodwyd 
Jim McCarthy, Cyfarwyddwr Anweithredol, i’r swydd hon.
RHAGOLWG
Mae’r rhagolwg i ddiwydiant amaethyddol y DU yn gadarnhaol iawn, gyda 
thueddiadau economaidd macro hirdymor, yn cynnwys y gofyniad cynyddol 
am fwyd i fwydo poblogaeth fyd-eang sy’n cynyddu, gan roi cymorth 
strwythurol. Mae’r Llywodraeth wedi cydnabod pwysigrwydd y diwydiant 
amaethyddol ac wedi sbarduno nifer o fentrau i annog hunangynhaliaeth yn 
y DU o ran cynhyrchion bwyd. Mae nifer o fanwerthwyr hefyd yn hyrwyddo 
cynhyrchion bwyd Prydain. Fodd bynnag, erys pwysau o ran prisiau o hyd, 
gan ysgogi’r angen am effeithlonrwydd drwy’r gadwyn fwyd gyfan, a fydd 
yn y pen draw yn arwain at gyfuno pellach o fewn y diwydiant cyflenwi 
amaethyddol. 
Mae Wynnstay ers peth amser wedi chwarae rhan weithredol mewn gwaith 
cyfuno amaethyddol ac fe’i cydnabyddir yn fusnes caffaelgar. Fel rhan o’n 
cynllun tyfu, byddwn yn parhau i gaffael busnesau sy’n addas ar gyfer ein 
model tra’n datblygu Wynnstay yn organig hefyd. Mae gan y Grw ^p sail 
ariannol gadarn i dyfu ohoni, gyda gerio isel a llif arian parod da. Mae ein 
sail eang yn parhau i fod yn ffactor pwysig i ddarparu elw cynaliadwy i’r 
holl randdeiliaid yn y busnes ac rwy’n hyderus y bydd ein Grw ^p yn parhau i 
ddatblygu dros y blynyddoedd i ddod.

INTRODUCTION 
The Group continues to perform well and Group pre-tax profits and revenues 
for the year stand at record levels. This has been achieved against a backdrop 
of ongoing price inflation in agricultural products and overall difficult 
economic conditions in the UK. Our robust business model continues to 
provide us with the opportunity to further develop the Group, and the UK 
agricultural market remains well positioned to benefit from increasing world 
demand for food and renewable energy. 
Group revenue increased by 9% to £375.78m over the year, supporting a 
13% rise in Group pre-tax profit to £7.82m. Product volumes varied by sector 
over the period, in line with industry trends, with increased animal feed 
volumes but decreased fertiliser volumes. Traded raw material volumes also 
decreased although this was offset by higher grain volumes, which benefited 
from a full year contribution from GrainLink, our grain trading business 
established following the acquisition of Wrekin Grain Ltd in May 2011.
Over the twelve months under review, we completed a number of small 
acquisitions of agricultural supplies businesses, further expanded our Just 
for Pets chain and established FertLink, a joint venture fertiliser business, 
operated by our Glasson Grain subsidiary. These moves will help to support 
ongoing growth across all our activities and also extend Wynnstay’s 
geographic reach into Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.
REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES
Agriculture
The agricultural division performed extremely well in a market dominated 
by inflation and adverse weather conditions worldwide. The operating profit 
from our agricultural activities as a whole increased by 23% year-on-year to 
£4.71m on revenues of £295.19m, helped by a full 12 month contribution 
from GrainLink and more realistic margins in feed products. The increased 
revenues reflect variation in product volumes and continuing inflation. The 
feed market was buoyant during the summer, whereas demand for fertiliser 
reduced, in line with industry trends, as the inclement weather and poor 
harvest conditions tempered customers’ confidence to purchase ahead of 
anticipated usage. 
Chief Executive’s Review
Our robust model  
continues to provide us  
with opportunities 11 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Feed Products
Demand for feed was strong in the second half, reversing the trend in the first 
half, as farmers relied on purchased feeds to balance the poor grazing and 
harvest conditions, a consequence of the poor weather experienced throughout 
the summer. This meant that like-for-like volumes for the year as a whole 
increased by 2% while margins also continued to strengthen. 
As ever, the broad portfolio of feed products we supply, catering for both the 
monogastric and ruminant markets, helped to minimise the effect of any 
individual sector volatility. Increased costs challenged the profitability of 
the dairy farming sector, however many of our customers committed to feed 
contracts during the autumn, mitigating some of the effect of poor milk prices. 
There has been some positive movement in farm gate prices for dairy farmers, 
although input costs have also continued to increase. 
Bibby Agriculture, our joint venture business, performed well, with sales 
increasing year-on-year. 
Glasson
The Glasson business continues to make an excellent contribution to the 
Group. The business supplies raw materials to the feed compound industry as 
well as added-value lines, including wild bird feeds and feeds for smallholder 
farmers, to animal feed outlets. The volume of raw materials traded was lower 
than the previous year (which benefited from a high usage of maize gluten), 
however demand in the second half was strong and forward contracts are very 
encouraging. Glasson’s fertiliser sales increased, primarily as a result of the 
additional throughput generated by Fertlink, the new fertiliser blending activity 
we established as a joint venture at Birkenhead in November 2011. FertLink has 
also enabled Glasson to gain market share beyond its traditional trading area. 
Arable Products
We have expanded the arable division significantly over recent years as part of 
our strategy to balance our presence across the livestock and arable markets.   
Grain volumes increased by over 35% as we benefited from a full year’s trading 
contribution from GrainLink and further volume increases at Woodheads 
Seeds. The very poor weather during the summer had a devastating effect 
on the quality of grain and yields were reduced compared with the harvest of 
2011. This had a small effect on traded volumes towards the year end and we 
expect a further reduction in volume through to the 2013 harvest.  
Seed sales remained resilient, despite the effect of the adverse weather, 
however difficult field conditions have restricted cultivation opportunities and 
many customers will resort to spring varieties if conditions do not improve. 
Demand for these products is at record levels and we anticipate a good spring 
season.
Demand for fertiliser was subdued in the second half, in line with industry 
trends, as poor weather conditions reduced usage on grassland crops. 
Currently forward orders for spring usage are lower than normal as customers 
have been reluctant to commit to early purchases. However we anticipate 
demand recovering as we move towards the spring and the business is well 
placed to meet this demand, with the extended production facilities available 
at FertLink.

Specialist Retail
The retail division, which comprises Wynnstay Stores, Just for Pets and 
Youngs Animal Feeds, continues to grow, supported by a combination of 
acquisitions, new store openings and refurbishments. Revenues for the year 
increased by 13% to £80.47m with operating profit up by 5% to £3.90m.  
Wynnstay Stores
Wynnstay Stores comprises a network of rural retail centres providing 
essential supplies for the farming community together with a strong offering 
to smallholders and country dwellers. Total revenues increased by 15% year-
on-year, reflecting the increased number of stores, changes in product mix 
and inflation, with non-discretionary spend by farmers remaining high. The 
importance of our stores within their local rural communities was illustrated 
in October 2012 when the Group was named as the “Powys Business of 
the Year” in an annual regional awards event. Our stores network is also 
recognised by suppliers as an important route to market for their agricultural 
ranges. 
We are continuing to invest in our stores, including personnel, to ensure 
that we offer both relevant range and a professional and reliable service 
to our expanding customer base. Over the course of the second half, we 
acquired two further farm supply outlets, in Tetbury in Gloucestershire and 
in Whitchurch in Shropshire.  After the year ended we purchased another 
outlet in Banbury in Oxfordshire, taking the number of our stores to 31 and 
further expanding the geographic reach of the Group. The new acquisitions 
are performing in line with budget and we look forward to a full year’s 
contribution in 2013. The store refurbishment programme continues and in 
2013 the outlet at Llanfair Caereinion, in Mid Wales, will be relocated to a 
new site we have already acquired.
The division benefited from a significant demand for solar energy products 
during the year and although we do not expect this to be repeated, we 
continue to explore community friendly renewable initiatives to reduce 
energy costs for our agricultural customers.
Just for Pets
The pet products division continues to develop and revenues for the year 
including new store openings increased by 9%. Like-for-like sales rose 
by 2.9%, assisted by increased promotional activity in the first half.  As 
indicated in the half year report, margins were affected in the first half and 
the profitability of the division for the year was lower than the prior year 
although sales improved in the second half. We continue to focus on tight 
cost control and remain proactive with our marketing initiatives to promote 
continuing growth in footfall.
In line with our growth plans, we opened new Just for Pets outlets at Yardley, 
Birmingham in February 2012 and in Coventry in August 2012 and are 
considering further sites for 2013. 
We were delighted to achieve an award from the Pet Care Trade Association 
for the third consecutive year, when our new store at Yardley was voted 
“Favourite pet care retailer” by its customers. The award reflects customer 
care at the store and we believe it typifies the level of service provided 
throughout the chain. 
Youngs Animal Feeds
Youngs Animal Feeds, which manufactures and distributes equine products 
to specialist outlets within the UK, made a good contribution to results.

Joint Ventures and Associate
Our joint ventures, comprising Bibby Agriculture, FertLink, Wynnstay Fuels, 
and Wyro, continued to perform in line with expectations over the year.
STAFF 
The year has been one of challenges and opportunities, and I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all staff for their contribution to the record 
results we achieved this year. Our personnel continue to be a key factor in 
the ongoing expansion of the Group and I look forward to the Group’s further 
success.
OUTLOOK
There has been significant pressure on our farming customers during the 
season, as a result of adverse weather and rising input costs. While some 
farm gate prices have improved, there is scope for further price rises to 
mitigate the increasing costs. 
The new financial year has started well, specialist retail sales are encouraging, 
feed demand has been strong and we expect a recovery in the demand for 
fertiliser as we move towards the usage period. With the poor grain harvest 
of 2012 and the poor planting conditions for the 2013 crop, we are not 
expecting volumes of traded grain to be buoyant.  Nonetheless, our balanced 
business leaves us well placed to accommodate expected sector variation 
and the new financial year will also benefit from the growth initiatives we 
have put in place over recent years.  
I remain confident about the forthcoming year for the Group and look forward 
to updating all stakeholders at our AGM in March.

TRADING RESULTS
Continued growth for the business has again resulted in record levels of 
revenues, profitability and earnings per share, which have all benefited 
from a full year contribution of the GrainLink business established part way 
through last year, following the acquisition of Wrekin Grain. Results from 
other smaller acquisitions have also produced positive contributions to the 
Group’s performance during the year and are set to continue as benefits from 
closer integration materialise. 
Group revenue was £375.78m (2011: £346.18m), of which £295.19m 
(2011: £274.57m) came from agricultural supplies, which included the full 
year contribution from GrainLink, but which also experienced the volume 
reductions in traded commodities and fertiliser products referred to in the 
Chief Executive’s Review. Our retail operations produced revenue of £80.47m 
(2011: £71.32m) which included contributions from two additional Just for 
Pets stores opened during the year, and also from the additional Country 
Stores acquired in Tetbury in May and Whitchurch in September. 
The Group’s operating profit before contributions from our Joint Venture and 
Associate Company activities and non-cash charges relating to goodwill 
impairment and share based payments was up 10% at £8.30m (2011: 
£7.51m). After reduced goodwill impairment and share based payments 
of £0.25m (2011: £0.42m) operating profit was up 14% at £8.05m (2011: 
£7.09m). With a gross contribution from our Joint Venture and Associate 
Company activities of £0.23m (2011: £0.24m), Group pre-tax Profit before 
finance costs increased by 13% to £8.28m (2011: £7.33m), with the 
agricultural supplies businesses contributing £4.71m (2011: £3.82m) and the 
retail operations £3.90m (2011: £3.70m). Other activities contributed a loss 
of £0.33m (2011: loss of £0.19m). After net finance costs of £0.46m (2011: 
£0.39m), Group pre-tax Profit was £7.82m (2011: £6.94m)
Group Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation (EBITDA) 
rose by 9% to £10.97m (2011: £10.07m), made up as follows:
                                                  £millions 2012 2011

(Profit) on disposal of fixed assets (0.04) (0.23)
Share based payments 0.20 0.16
EBITDA 10.97 10.07
TAXATION
The Group’s tax charge of £1.99m (2011: £1.94m) represented 25.4% 
(2010: 27.9%) of the Group pre-tax profit, and benefited from the reduction 
in general corporation tax rates and the related reduction in deferred tax 
provisions. However it remained above the pro-rata standard rate for the 
period of 24.8% as a continuing result of depreciation charges on the 
Group’s freehold property not being eligible for capital allowances. Actual 
tax cash payments in the year amounted to £2.64m, as some of the Group’s 
trading subsidiaries moved to quarterly payments on account in the current 
year, for the first time.  
Finance Director’s Statement
The proposed final 
dividend makes a total 
of 8.50p for the year, an 
increase of 9% and continues 
the Boards progressive 
dividend policy 15 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDEND 
Basic earnings per share was 34.99p (2011: 30.23p), based on a weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year of 16.669m (2011: 16.545m). 
The Board proposes to recommend the payment of a final dividend of 5.65p 
per share on the 30 April 2013, which when added to the interim dividend of 
2.85p per share paid on the 31 October 2012, makes a total of 8.50p for the 
year (2011: 7.80p), an increase of 9%. The total dividend is expected to be 
covered 4.10 times (2011: 3.85 times) by earnings, and continues the Board’s 
progressive dividend policy. 
SHARE CAPITAL 
During the year a total of 127,668 (2011: 106,263) new ordinary shares 
were issued for a total equivalent cash amount of £0.435m (2011: £0.368m) 
with 90,786 (2011: 106,263) shares being issued to existing shareholders 
exercising their right to receive dividends in the form of new shares under 
the Company’s scrip dividend scheme. The other allotments were generally 
related to the exercise of employee share options. 
BALANCE SHEET
Balance Sheet net assets, inclusive of goodwill, at the year end amounted 
to £56.83m (2011: £51.70m), and based on the weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the year of 16.669 million, this represented a net asset 
value per share of £3.41 (2011: £3.12). During the financial year the share 
price traded in a range between a low of £3.38 in December 2011 and a high 
of £4.01 in October 2012. 
Capital investment in fixed assets amounted to £2.77m (2011: £3.36m) and 
during the year, expenditure on new acquisitions, inclusive of acquired net 
cash / (debt), was £0.92m (2011: £2.60m). Additionally a further £1.48m 
(2011: £0.45m) was invested during the year in the Pwllheli redevelopment 
scheme which is now complete and available for sale.
The Group’s working capital requirements have been impacted by the general 
expansion of activities and continuing commodity inflation pressures, together 
with certain adverse trading patterns such as delayed fertiliser purchasing, 
which have caused higher inventory balances at the year end. Higher levels 
of proportionate feed activities have also adversely effected working capital 
utilisation, through a comparative reduction in trade payables as much of the 
Group’s feed raw material supply has to be paid for before collection. Total 
inventory values increased by 15% to £27.21m (2011: £23.69m), while trade 
and other receivables increased to £46.98m (2011: £45.58m). The additional 
funding requirement was exacerbated by a reduction in trade and other 
payables which stood at £43.74m (2011: £48.16m) at the year end.  
£56.83m
Group net assets for the  
year to 31 October 2012 16 www.wynnstay.co.uk
CASHFLOW AND NET DEBT
The considerable working capital outflow mentioned above, which amounted 
to £9.12m (2011: £4.34m), saw net cash absorbed by operating activities 
reach £1.24m (2011: £3.72m generated). Total net cash investment, 
including acquisitions, but excluding assets acquired under finance leases 
amounted to £4.15m (2011: £5.43m), and new equity finance of £0.44m 
(2011: £0.37m) was raised. After the payment of £1.34m (2011: £1.21m) in 
dividends to shareholders, debt repayments of £2.48m (2011: £2.50m), and 
new loans drawn of £3.10m (2011: £4.03m) there was a net decrease in cash 
and cash equivalents in the business of £5.67m (2011: £1.02m decrease). 
When added to the net reduction in term and other existing non liquid debts 
of £1.65m (2011: £1.85m) and accounting for the new expansion loans of 
£3.10m (2011: £4.03m) the total increase in net debt in the year was £7.12m 
(2011: £3.20m). 
This net cash outflow in the year has increased the Group’s year end net 
debt position to £13.79m (2011: £6.67m), producing a gearing level of 
24.3% (2011: 12.9%) of shareholders total equity at the year end. Whilst 
some of the weather related trading issues impacting on inventory aspects 
of working capital at the year end were unexpected, the Board is confident 
that these will reverse as more normal trading patterns return in the Spring. 
The Group continues to receive strong support from its main bankers and the 
Board believes current overall debt is at a manageable level, which is well 
within existing facilities which continue to provide headroom to absorb the 
usual further expansion of working capital requirements during the seasonal 
Spring peak.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
Risks and uncertainties for the business are classified into two main 
categories, Financial and Operational. The Board monitor such risks and 
have developed policies for managing the uncertainties they bring. The main 
elements of these controls operate in the following areas:
Financial Risk Management:
The Group policies for managing treasury risks are developed and approved 
by the Board and are designed to minimise exposure to market volatility 
and include : 
Interest Rate - While currently most of the Group’s term debt is floating 
base rate linked, the Board constantly reviews its option to fix the rates 
attached to this debt through the use of interest rate swap derivatives. Fixed 
rate term finance is used for the acquisition of vehicles.
Foreign Currency - The main currency related risk to the Group comes from 
the forward purchasing of imported raw materials for our Glasson business. 
This risk is mainly managed by entering into currency purchase agreements 
at the time the underlying transaction is completed. The fair value of these 
contracts is not material. As at the year end the principal amounts relating 
to forward purchased currency amounted to £2,026,000 (2011: £3,279,000).
Commodity Price - While the Group does not engage in the taking of 
speculative commodity positions, it does have to make significant forward 
purchases of certain raw materials, particularly for use in its animal feed 
manufacturing activities. Position reporting systems are in place to ensure 
the Board is appraised of the exposure level on a regular basis, and where 
possible hedging tools, primarily wheat futures contracts on the London 
LIFFE market are used to manage price decisions.
Finance Director’s Statement (continued)
Credit - A significant proportion of the Group’s trade is conducted on credit 
terms and as such a risk of non payment is always present. Detailed systems 
of credit approval before initial supply, the operation of credit limits and 
an active credit control policy act to minimise this risk and historically 
the incidence of bad debts is low. The recent growth of the grain trading 
business has exposed the Group to certain new substantial customer credit 
balances, and to assist in mitigating this perceived additional risk, a credit 
insurance policy has been purchased to provide partial cover against default 
by certain customers. 
Operational Risk Management:
Trading concerns are regularly reviewed in monthly Divisional Management 
meetings, with conclusions reported to the Board. Existing issues include:
Customer Loss and Competition - There is a constant  risk of customer loss 
from both industry contraction, particularly in the dairy sector, and through 
enhanced competition. The Group’s continuing strategy for overcoming this 
issue is market share growth through geographic expansion and acquisitions. 
A specific strategy of expanding the multi species feed activities of the 
business has been successfully implemented which will help minimise 
dependence on any particular livestock sector. Significant recent investment 
has also been made in the Company’s direct sales force, both in terms of 
numbers and training.    
Manufacturing Productivity - Much of the Group’s feed business is 
conducted on a customer “made to order” basis. This requires sophisticated 
order processing, manufacturing and delivery systems, as low lead times can 
provide a competitive advantage. The breakdown of any of these systems, 
through mechanical fault, weather and traffic disruption, or computer 
malfunctions and errors can create the risk of order fulfilment failure. The 
Group protects against this through the operation of multiple supply points, 
with third party manufacturing arrangements in place, and the back up of all 
IT systems supported with a disaster recovery plan.   
Supply Chain Efficiency - The Group’s considerable inventories both in 
the retail businesses and as raw materials for the manufacturing activities 
are vital to the success of the organisation, and disruption to this supply 
would damage revenue streams. To minimise this risk, the Group operates 
partnership relationships with as many suppliers as possible which endeavour 
to ensure that optimum stock levels are maintained in Group warehouses, in 
wholesaler locations or within committed supplier facilities.
Reputation - The Group’s trading philosophy is to seek to be the “supplier 
of choice” to its customers. To achieve this, a reputation for quality products, 
service and value for money must be maintained. Through a comprehensive 
employee Information and Consultation policy, all members of staff and 
local management are tasked with enhancing the Group’s reputation in the 
eyes of customers and all other stakeholders of the business.  
Fraud - More difficult general economic circumstances may increase the 
risk of fraud being perpetrated on the Company. The Board has recognised 
this increased risk, and continually reviews internal systems and controls, 
addressing areas of identified weaknesses including any matters raised as 
part of the Group audit process.    17 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The performance of the business is regularly monitored against Key 
Performance Indicators (KPI’s), the comparative results for which are 
reported in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 6 & 7. These indicators are 
defined as follows:
Revenue - The invoiced value of sales from the Group’s activities, measured 
at a fair value net of all rebates and excluding value added tax.
EBITDA - Group pre-tax profit, including share of pre-tax profits of joint 
ventures and associates, including profit on fixed asset disposals, before 
interest, taxation, depreciation, fixed asset impairment charges and share 
based payments.
Earnings per share - Profit  for  the year after taxation divided by the 
weighted average  number  of shares in issue during the year excluding any 
shares held by the Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust.
Return on Net Assets - Group  pre-tax  profit,  including  share  of  pre-tax 
profits of joint ventures and associates before any goodwill impairment or 
share based payment charges, divided by the balance sheet net asset value.
Net Asset per share - The balance sheet net asset value, divided by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding any 
shares held by the Group’s Employee Share Ownership Trust.

the Directors’ Report are listed on page 2. Having made enquires of fellow 
Directors each of these Directors, at the date of this report, confirms that:
•  to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the  Group’s auditors are unaware; and
•  each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be 
expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they have elected 
to prepare both the Group and the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under Company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other  irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The 
adoption and maintenance of good governance is the responsibility of 
the Board as a whole, who have considered the twelve principles of good 
practice published in the QCA Corporate Governance Guidelines for Smaller 
Companies issued in September 2010. The Board believes that it has 
incorporated these principles in formulating a Corporate Governance policy 
appropriate to the size of the Company, and which can provide comfort for 
the Company’s numerous and widespread shareholder base who have the 
right to expect the highest possible level of standards. The Directors  are 
pleased to provide the following information:
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board currently comprises eight directors, three of whom are executive 
and five non-executives. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are 
separated. The Chairman is non-executive and is elected by the whole 
Board on an annual basis. The executive directors all have considerable 
experience in the agricultural supply industry and have a total of over 56 
years service with the Group. The non-executives bring a range of business 
and commercial expertise to the Board, including direct agriculture, 
specialist retail, transport and logistics experience and legal and political 
skills. Primarily due to their length of service three of the non-executive 
directors are not deemed independent under the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance. James McCarthy, having been appointed in July 2011 
is deemed the senior independent non-executive, and Lord Carlile CBE QC, 
although having served on the Board for over twelve years, is still deemed 
independent through the integrity provided from his other roles, which 
amongst other activities include, acting as a circuit judge and a government 
advisor on various sensitive matters. A formal schedule of matters requiring 
Board approval is maintained, and covers such areas as Group strategy, 
approval of financial budgets and results, Board appointments, approval of 
major capital expenditure and dividend policy. The Board normally meets 
once a month with additional meetings as necessary. Directors are able, if 
necessary, to take independent professional advice in furtherance of their 
duties, at the Company’s expense. All directors and some senior members of 
staff have adopted a set of guidelines in regard to their responsibilities for 
the management and conduct of the Company. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
Audit Committee
This Committee consists of three non-executive directors Mr J C Kendrick 
(Committee Chairman), Mr E G Owen and Mr J J McCarthy. The Committee 
meets at least four times a year with additional meetings as required. The 
Committee has standard terms of reference in place, which have been 
formally approved by the Board, and which include the supervision of 
the external audit process and the effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls. The terms of reference further task the Committee with identifying 
and evaluating significant internal and external risks faced by the Company, 
and then making recommendations to the Board on appropriate strategies 
for effectively managing these risks. Such risks include:
• The reliability of internal and external reporting systems;
• The safeguarding of assets from inappropriate use, loss and fraud;
• Identifying and properly managing liabilities; and 
•  Ensuring the business operates within all applicable legislation and 
uses best practice wherever possible. 
The Audit Committee met four times during the year and all committee 
members attended. The Committee agreed the nature and scope of the audit 
with the auditors and monitored the findings of the auditors. The Committee 
organise internal audit assignments to test the operating effectiveness of 
internal systems and controls. These assignments are not completed by 
specific internal audit employees, but appropriate members of staff. The 
Committee has procedures in place to enable it to meet with the auditors 
without the presence of the Company’s management and it formulates 
and oversees the Company policy on maintaining auditor objectivity and 
independence in relation to non-audit services. The policy is to ensure that 
the nature of the non-audit services performed or the fee income relative to 
the audit does not compromise the auditors’ independence, objectivity or 
integrity and complies with ethical standards.
Remuneration Committee
This Committee of the Board consists of three non-executive directors, Mr E G 
Owen, Mr J C Kendrick and is chaired by Lord Carlile CBE QC. The Committee 
meets at least once a year and has standard terms of reference in place 
which have been formally approved by the Board. These terms of reference 
include the formulation of remuneration policies for executive directors 
and senior managers, and the supervision of employee benefit structures 
throughout the Company. The Remuneration Committee met once during 
the year and all committee members attended.
Nomination Committee
This Committee of the Board currently consists of Mr E G Owen, Mr K R 
Greetham and is chaired by Mr J E Davies. The Committee meets at least 
once a year and has standard terms of reference in place which have been 
formally approved by the Board. The Committee is tasked with reviewing the 
leadership needs of the Company and making recommendations to ensure 
the continuity of such leadership through the identification, evaluation and 
appointment of both executive and non-executive directors.
The Nomination Committee met three times during the year and all 
committee members attended.
BOARD REMUNERATION
As a Company listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London 
Stock Exchange, the Company is exempt from the s420 obligation of the 
Companies Act 2006 to prepare a director’s remuneration report, but is 
pleased to provide the following information, and to refer to the details 
provided in the shareholding section of the Directors report. Details of the 
director’s remuneration received during the year can be found in Note 7 to 
the Accounts.  
All matters relating to remuneration of the Directors of the Company are 
determined by the Remuneration Committee whose decisions are made 
with a view to rewarding individuals for the nature of their work and the 
contribution they make towards the Group achieving its strategic aims. 
Proper regard is given to the need to attract and retain high quality and 
motivated staff at all levels and to ensure the effective management of the 
business. The Committee will be cognisant of comparative pay levels after 
taking into account geographic location and the operations of the business. 
Executive Director Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee have concluded that an effective executive 
remuneration package should consist of five elements :
•  Basic Salary which is reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis 
with effect from the beginning of October, consistent with annual 
Corporate Governance
for the year ended 31 October 2012 21 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
reviews conducted for all other employees. The current values of 
these individual approved salaries effective from the 1 October 2012, 
together with the amounts actually being received are shown in the 
table below.
•  Annual Performance Bonuses for which there are currently two 
schemes in operation for executive directors. The contractual schemes 
for K R Greetham and B P Roberts are based on a fixed percentage of the 
Group pre-tax Profit, which includes the Group’s share of pre-tax profits 
from joint ventures and associate investments. The scheme for D A T 
Evans is based on a fixed percentage of the Retail segment operating 
contribution adjusted for administrative costs. The respective bonus 
percentages are shown in the table below. The Executive Directors 
also participate in the Company Profit Related Pay Scheme, which is 
a scheme for employees of Wynnstay Group plc and Grainlink Limited 
and which pays an annual bonus based on a formula which produces 
a percentile result which is then applied to the relevant individual’s 
prior year earnings. The formula calculation is the aggregate of the 
pre-tax profit of Wynnstay Group plc and Grainlink Limited divided by 
the aggregate of the combined revenues of those companies excluding 
inter-company turnover, expressed as a percentage and multiplied by 
a factor of two. The relevant anticipated rate for the bonus which will 
be paid in February 2013 relating to the last financial year is 3.3% of 
relevant earnings.
•  Long Term Incentives which are designed to align executive rewards 
with returns for shareholders and encourage executive retention and 
strategic consistency. The scheme currently in place is structured as 
a Long Term Performance Related Unapproved Share Option Scheme 
and was granted in October 2008 as a five year scheme with options 
exercisable within a six month period commencing on the fifth 
anniversary of the grant date, providing the performance conditions 
have been satisfied. The performance conditions relate to the earnings 
per share and market capitalisation of the Group as at October 2013, 
with the size of the award, as a percentage of the maximum available, 
based on the matrix shown opposite. The number of share options 
actually exercisable will depend on the market share price on the day 
of exercise, with the holder paying an option price of 25p per share.

  The maximum market value of shares as at the date of option (the 
100% award) that can be exercised by each Executive Director is shown 
in the table below as the LTIP Maximum. The Executive Directors also 
participate in the discretionary Approved Company Share Option Plan 
(CSOP) and were each granted 8,000 options on 17 April 2012 at an 
exercise price of £3.75, being the market price on the day of grant. 
These options, which do not have any performance criteria attached to 
them, are exercisable between 18 April 2015 and 18 April 2022 and 
are reported in the Director’s Report on page 18, and in Note 26 to the 
accounts.
•  Benefits in kind which are provided to assist the Directors in the 
completion of their duties, and which are limited to the provision of a 
company car and private medical insurance.
•  Pension and death in service life cover which is based on the value of 
the Executive Directors basic salary only. The annual defined Company 
contributions to a personal pension scheme held in the individual’s 
name expressed as a percentage of current salary is shown in the 
table below. The death in service cover provides for four times current 
annual salary paid into trust where death occurs during the term of the 
director’s employment contract.

Corporate Governance (continued)
for the year ended 31 October 2012
Non-Executive Director Remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors has been set so as to 
reflect the factors pertinent to their respective positions, taking into account 
the anticipated amount of time commitment, and comparative rates paid 
by other companies of a similar size. The Non-Executive Directors do 
not participate in share option awards, performance bonuses or pension 
arrangements, but do receive re-imbursement of travelling expenses which 
are wholly attributable to their attendance at board meetings. Certain 
Directors who do not have alternative arrangements also participate in the 
Group’s private medical insurance scheme with premiums being paid for by 
the Company and treated as a benefit in kind. Current values of the total 
annualised remuneration for each Non-Executive Director is given in the 
table below.

 E G Owen  48 1
 J J McCarthy 33 -
 J E Davies 37 1
 J C Kendrick  33 -
 Lord Carlile CBE, QC  33 1
During the year, the fee rates were reviewed to recognise that a previously 
conceived performance related scheme was not going to be implemented 
as this was deemed inappropriate for Non-Executive Directors.  As a result 
fees were increased in May 2012 by an annualised amount of £10,000 per 
director, with an equivalent retrospective payment being made in respect of 
the previous financial year, with these payments being reflected in Note 7 
to the accounts.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board recognises the importance of communicating with its shareholders 
and maintains dialogue with institutional shareholders and analysts, and 
presentations are made when financial results are announced. Lord Carlile 
CBE QC is the nominated independent non-executive Director who makes 
himself available to shareholders who may require an independent contact.
The Annual General Meeting is the principal forum for dialogue with 
private shareholders who are given the opportunity to raise questions at 
the meeting.  The Company aims to send out notice of the Annual General 
meeting at least 21 working days before the meeting.  Shareholders also 
have access to the Company’s website at www.wynnstay.co.uk.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern 
basis, having satisfied themselves from a review of internal budgets and 
forecasts and current bank facilities that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Further detail 
is provided on page 28.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the system of internal 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance, operated by the 
Group and for its effectiveness.  Such a system can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, as it is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the failure to achieve business 
objectives.  
The key procedures within the control structure include:
•  Managers at all levels in the Group have clear lines of reporting 
responsibility within a clearly defined organisational structure;
•  Comprehensive financial reporting procedures exist with budgets 
covering profits, cash flows and capital expenditure being prepared and 
adopted by the Board annually. Actual results are reported monthly to 
the Board and results compared with budgets and last year’s actual. 
Revised forecasts are prepared as appropriate; and 
•  There is a structural process for appraising and authorising capital 
projects with clearly defined authorisation levels.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
The Board is satisfied that KPMG Audit Plc has adequate policies and 
safeguards in place to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence 
is maintained.   The Company meets its obligations for maintaining the 
appropriate relationship with the external auditors through the Audit 
Committee whose terms of reference include an obligation to consider and 
keep under review the degree of work undertaken by the external auditors, 
other than the statutory audit, to ensure such objectivity and independence 
is safeguarded.

Principal Accounting Policies
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group’s principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European 
Union (‘IFRS’), International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee 
(‘IFRIC’) interpretations and those provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group financial 
statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention other 
than certain assets which are at deemed cost under the transition rules, 
share based payments which are included at fair value and certain financial 
instruments which are explained in the relevant section below. A summary 
of the material Group accounting policies are set out below. The preparation 
of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of 
the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those 
estimates.
Going Concern
As highlighted in note 22 to the financial statements, the Group meets its 
day to day working capital requirements through overdraft facilities which 
are  due for renewal on an annual basis. The current economic conditions 
create uncertainty, particularly over: (a) the level of demand for the Group’s 
products; (b) the exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar which 
has consequences for the cost of the Group’s raw materials; and (c) the 
availability of bank finance in the foreseeable future.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to 
operate within the level of its current facilities. The Group will open renewal 
negotiations with its banks in due course and has at this stage not sought 
any written commitment that the facilities will be renewed. However, the 
Group has held discussions with its bankers about its future borrowing needs 
and no matters have been drawn to its attention to suggest that renewal 
may not be forthcoming on acceptable terms.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of Wynnstay Group Plc (‘the Company’) and entities controlled 
by Wynnstay Group Plc (its ‘subsidiaries’) together with the Group’s share 
of the results of its associates and joint ventures. Group inter-company 
transactions are eliminated in full. Results of subsidiary undertakings 
acquired are included in the financial statements from the effective date of 
control. The net assets, both tangible and intangible, of acquired subsidiary 
undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of 
their fair value as at the effective date of control. All business combinations 
are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Subsidiaries are 
entities where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies, generally accompanied by a share of more than 50% of the voting 
rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is 
assumed by the Group and are included until the date the Group ceases to 
control them. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant 
influence but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 
20% and 50% of the voting rights.  Joint ventures are entities over which 
the Group has joint control. Investments in associates and joint ventures are 
accounted for using the equity method. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the invoiced value of sales which fall within Wynnstay 
Group’s ordinary activities. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
contract net of rebates excluding value added tax and after eliminating sales 
within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised either at the point of sale 
through the till or when the Group has transferred the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership of goods to the buyer, when the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items that are material by size and/or by nature, are disclosed 
on the face on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and 
within a note to the financial statements. Management consider that the 
separate disclosure of non-recurring items helps provide a better indication 
of the Group’s underlying business performance.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company and Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet when the Company and/or Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The main categories of 
financial instruments are: 
Trade receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent 
to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment losses. 
Investments 
Investments are initially measured at cost.  They are classified as either 
‘available-for-sale’, ‘fair value’, or ‘held to maturity’.  Where securities are 
designated as at ‘fair value’, gains or losses arising from changes in fair value 
are included in the net profit or loss for the period.  For ‘available-for-sale’ 
investments, gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be 
impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. Equity investments 
that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair 
value cannot be reliably measured by other means are held at cost. 
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, 
net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference 
between proceeds and redemption value being recognised in the Group 
Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest 
basis.
Trade payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to 
initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 29 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Group and/or Company are recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. An equity instrument is any 
contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group and/or 
Company after deducting all of its liabilities.   
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to 
foreign exchange, and commodity risks arising from day to day activities. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading 
purposes, however, if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they 
are accounted for as such.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. 
Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses 
on re-measurement are immediately recognised in the Group Income 
Statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of 
any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship 
and the item being hedged. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the 
Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the 
item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required 
to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between 
the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge 
will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is 
performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly 
effective. 
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more than one year 
from the balance sheet date are disclosed as non-current.
Fair value hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when 
they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated 
and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases at inception where substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group.  
Assets classified as finance leases are capitalised on the balance sheet 
and are depreciated over the expected useful life of the asset. The 
interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income over the period of the lease. Rentals 
paid under operating leases are charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Leasehold land is normally classified as an operating lease. Payments made 
to acquire leasehold land are included in prepayments at cost and are 
amortised over the life of the lease.  Any incentives to enter into operating 
leases are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term 
on a straight-line basis.  
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment losses. Depreciation is 
provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual 
value of fixed assets over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold property 2.5%-5% per annum straight line
Lease premium over the period of the lease
Leasehold land and buildings  over the period of the lease
Plant and machinery/office equipment 10%-33% per annum straight line
Motor vehicles 20%-30% per annum straight line
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquired entity at the date of the acquisition. At the date of acquisition, 
goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing.  Goodwill is recognised as an asset and assessed for impairment 
annually.  Any impairment is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.  Once recognised, an impairment of goodwill is not 
reversed.  
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication 
that an asset may be impaired.  Where an indicator of impairment exists, 
the Group makes an estimate of recoverable amount.  Where the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down 
to its recoverable amount.  Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use, and is considered for each individual 
asset.  If the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.  Discount 
rates reflecting the asset specific risks and the time value of money are used 
for the value in use calculation.  
Employment benefit costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to 
this scheme are charged to the statement of comprehensive income as they 
are incurred, in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition.  Where appropriate, cost is calculated 
on a specific identification basis.  Otherwise inventories are valued using 
the first-in-first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred 
in marketing, selling and distribution.  
Taxation including deferred taxation
The income tax expense represents the sum of the current income tax and 
deferred income tax. Current income tax is based on the taxable profits for 
the year. Taxable profit differs from the profit as reported in the statement 
of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income and expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the Group financial statements. However, 
deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition  30 www.wynnstay.co.uk
Principal Accounting Policies (continued)
of an asset or liability other than a business combination. Deferred income 
tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income 
tax liability settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Dividends
Final equity dividends to the shareholders of the Company are recognised 
in the period that they are approved by the shareholders. Interim equity 
dividends are recognised in the period that they are paid.  
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.  
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date 
of the grant.  The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
Fair value is measured by use of a valuation model.  The expected life used 
in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. The movements in respect of equity settled share based 
payments are recognised in other reserves.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are shown at cost less provisions for their 
permanent impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow 
statement, comprise cash at bank and in hand, money market deposits 
and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are presented in 
borrowings within current liabilities in the balance sheet.  
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the 
rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Exchange gains and losses are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  
Employee share ownership trust
The Company operates an employee share ownership trust. The assets, 
liabilities, income and cost of the ESOP are incorporated into the financial 
statements of the Group.   
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates
Application of certain Group accounting policies requires management 
to make judgments, assumptions and estimates concerning the future as 
detailed below:
Application of the “own use” exemption
Forward contracts are entered into by the Group to purchase and/or sell 
grain and other agricultural commodities, and management judge that these 
forward commodity contracts are entered into for the Group’s “own use” 
rather than as trading instruments when they are entered into. They continue 
to be held in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale and/or 
usage requirements.
Valuation of share-based payments
The fair value of share-based payments is determined using valuation models 
and is charged to the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting 
period. Estimations of vesting and satisfaction of performance criteria are 
required to determine fair value. 
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment annually.  
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units 
to which goodwill is allocated.  Value in use is dependent on estimations of 
future cash flows from the cash generating unit and the use of an appropriate 
discount rate to discount those cash flows to their present value. 
Provision for impairment of trade receivables 
The financial statements include a provision for impairment of trade 
receivables that is based on management’s estimation of recoverability.  
There is a risk that the provision will not match the trade receivables that 
ultimately prove to be irrecoverable. 
Provision for impairment of inventories
The financial statements include a provision for impairment of inventories 
that is based on management’s estimation of recoverability. There is a risk 
that the provision will not match the inventories that ultimately prove to 
be impaired.  31 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

1.  The Company has taken advantage of the exemption, under s408 of the Companies Act 2006, from presenting its own income statement. The profit after 
tax for the period dealt with in the financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU of the company was £2,577,000 (2011: £3,896,000).
2.   SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
  IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal financial information about the components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) to allocate resources to the segments and to access their performance.
  The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board of Directors (‘the Board’). The Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order to 
assess performance and allocate resources. The Board has determined that the operating segments, based on these reports are Agriculture, Specialist Retail 
and Other.
  The Board considers the business from a product/service perspective. In the Board’s opinion, all of the Group’s operations are carried out in the same 
geographical segment namely the United Kingdom.
 Agriculture -  Manufacturing and supply of animal feeds, fertiliser, seeds and associated agricultural products.
 Specialist Retail -  Supplies of a wide range of specialist products to farmers, smallholders, and pet owners.
 Other -  Miscellaneous operations not classified as agriculture or specialist retail.
  The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit. Finance income and costs are not included in 
the segment result that is assessed by the Board. Other information provided to the Board is measured in a manner consistent with that in the financial 
statements.
 Inter - segmental transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties.  
 The segment results for the year ended 31 October 2012 are as follows:

  2012  2011
  £000  £000
 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 7,760  6,852

 Total tax charge for year 1,927  1,851
 
 Factors that may affect future tax charges
  The 2012 Budget on 23 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 22% by 2014. A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% 
(effective from 1 April 2012) was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012) and 23% (effective from 
1 April 2013) were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.
  This will reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability at 31 October 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 
23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 1% rate 
reduction, although this will further reduce the company’s future current tax charge and reduce the company’s deferred tax liability accordingly. 37 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

 Final dividend paid for prior year 865  776
 Interim dividend paid for current year 476  431
  1,341  1,207
    
  Subsequent to the year end it has been recommended in the Directors’ Report that a final dividend of 5.65p net per ordinary share (2011: 5.20p) be paid 
on 30 April 2013. Together with the interim dividend already paid on 31 October 2012, of 2.85p net per ordinary share (2011: 2.60p) this would result in a 
total dividend for the financial year of 8.50p net per ordinary share (2011: 7.80p).

 Earnings per ordinary 25p share (pence) 34.99 30.23 34.05  29.47
  Basic earnings per 25p ordinary share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of  
ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust (note 32) which are treated as cancelled. 
  For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares 
(share options and warrants) taking into account their exercise price in comparison with the actual average share price during the year.

 Goodwill Impairment 
 Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications  
 that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units according to the level at   
 which management monitor that goodwill.
  Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated from cash 
flow projections for the next 10 years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
 
  The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins. Management 
estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash- 
generating units. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
  Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts of goodwill.
  In October 2012 and 2011 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
  The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 6% to 12% (2011: 2% to 9%) in respect of Agriculture and 9% to 15% (2011: 6% to 12%) 
in respect of Specialist Retail. These discount rates are derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating 
to each operating segment.
 
 The forecasts are extrapolated based on estimated long-term average growth rates of 0% to 6% (2011: 0%).
 Management have identified a number of cash generating units within these two operating segments.

15. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
   During the year the Group completed three acquisitions, one of which was structured as an asset purchase and two as share purchases. 
  The asset transaction was the purchase of goodwill and certain assets from Whitchurch Animal Health Limited on 4 September 2012, for a consideration of 
£227,613, consisting of goodwill of £120,001 and stock and certain net assets of £107,612.
  On 16 March 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of C & M Transport Limited for a total consideration of £186,215. The 
trading activities and net tangible assets of £136,215 were immediately transferred to the parent company and, as the assets inclusive of net cash of 
£72,000 are no longer distinguishable, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of £50,000 included in the consideration has been expensed in the period.
  On 31 May 2012 the Group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of PSB (Country Supplies) Limited, an independent agricultural inputs 
supplier based in Tetbury, Gloucestershire.
  Details of the trade, asset values acquired and the consideration are given below, together with details, subject to the comments below, of revenues and 
operating profits generated in the period:

  The acquisition of the business extends the Group’s geographic trading area and farmer customer base, as well as adding an additional outlet to the Group’s 
Country Store chain. 
 The directors have considered whether any specific intangibles can be identified within the values of goodwill and do not consider any readily identifiable.
  On 1 June 2012 the trade and assets of PSB (Country Supplies) Limited were hived up into Wynnstay Group Plc, and the respective results generated from 
the acquired business for the period to 31 October 2012 and included in the results of Wynnstay Group plc were, revenue of £1,227,000 and operating profit 
of £17,500.

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
 Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
 The fair value of current asset and current liabilities are assumed to approximate to book value due to the short-term maturity of their instruments. 
  Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash 
flows at prevailing interest rates. The fair value of current assets and current liabilities are assumed to approximate to the book value due to the short term 
maturity of the instruments. The fair value of the non-current borrowings have been assessed and are not deemed to differ materially from book value.
  49 Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
 Fair values of derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
  Derivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks, and those that are held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 
39. Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and the Group’s hedging policies are further described below:
 Fair value hedges
  The Group maintains futures based commodity contracts to hedge against the open long or short physical positions on its forward purchase and sales 
books. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss on the hedging  
instrument and hedged item is recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
the adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is amortised to the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income under the effective interest rate 
method.
  The Group’s derivative financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 October 2012, have been considered against the following  
hierarchical criteria to assess their classification level:
 • quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
 •  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that 
is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
 • inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
 All derivative financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 instruments as they are valued at quoted market prices. 
 Risks associated with financial instruments
 The main risks to which the Group is exposed are as follows: 
 Market Risk
  Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices that will affect the Group’s income or 
the value of its holdings of financial instruments
 Interest rate risk
  While currently most of the Group’s term debt is floating base rate linked, the Board constantly review their option to fix the rates attached to this debt 
through the use of Interest rate swap derivatives. Fixed rate term finance is used for the acquisition of vehicles.
 Foreign currency risk
  The main currency related risk to the Group comes from the forward purchasing of imported raw materials for our Glasson Grain business. This risk is mainly 
managed by entering into currency purchase agreements at the time the underlying transaction is completed. The fair value of these contracts is not  
material.
 As at the year end the principal amounts relating to forward purchased currency amounted to £2,026,000 (2011: £3,279,000)
 Commodity price risk
  While the Group does not engage in the taking of speculative commodity positions, it does have to make significant forward purchases of certain raw 
materials, particularly for use in its animal feed manufacturing activities. Position reporting systems are in place to ensure the Board is appraised of the 
exposure level on a regular basis, and where possible hedging tools, primarily wheat futures contracts on the London LIFFE market are used to manage price 
decisions.
 Credit risk
  Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises 
principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
 A significant proportion of the Group’s trade is conducted on credit terms and as such a risk of non-payment is always present.  50 www.wynnstay.co.uk
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
 23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued) 
 
  Detailed systems of credit approval before initial supply, the operations of credit limits and an active credit control policy act to minimise this risk and 
historically the incidence of bad debts is low. The recent growth of the Group’s grain trading activities has exposed it to certain new substantial customer  
credit balances, and to assist in mitigating this perceived additional risk, a credit insurance policy has been purchased to provide partial cover against 
default by certain customers.
 The overdue accounts are reviewed monthly at divisional management meetings to mitigate exposure to credit risk and make provisions accordingly.
  Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. Due to this,  
management believes that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables. Included within the 
Company Trade receivables are £490,295 (2011: £296,387) of intercompany trade debtors.
 At 31 October 2012 trade receivables of £6,148,000 (2011: £6,275,000), (Company £4,230,000 (2011: £4,684,000)) were past due but were not impaired.
 These related to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
 The aging analysis is as follows:
  Group Company
  2012  2011  2012  2011
  £000  £000  £000  £000
 Up to 3 Months  5,180  5,068  3,562  3,796
 Over three months   968  1,207  668  888
 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
 The Group has appropriate overdraft facilities in place to allow flexibility in managing liquidity.  
 The effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 
  Group Company
  2012  2011  2012  2011
 Bank overdraft  2.1%  2%  1.8%  2%

26. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS (continued)  
 Fair Value of Options after 7 November 2002
  During the year, the Group charged £203,426 (2011: £158,474) of share based remuneration cost to its Statement of Comprehensive Income based on a 
movement in the fair value of outstanding options granted after November 2002. The weighted average fair value of these options were estimated by using 
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following  assumptions.  
 Weighted average assumptions  2012  2011

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
1.  Appointment of proxies
  A member of the Company is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all 
or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote at the Meeting. A form 
of proxy accompanies this document and if it is to be used, it must be 
deposited at the Companies Head Office not less than 24 hours before 
the meeting.  A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company 
but must attend the Meeting to represent you. 
2. Adoption of share option schemes
  Ordinary resolution 6 is put forward because the rules of both the 
existing Company Share Option Plan and the existing Savings Related 
Share Option Schemes are due to lapse in March 2013. The Directors 
consider it appropriate for these schemes to be renewed on the same 
terms as the previous schemes and they are intended to take effect 
from the end of the existing schemes by which time provisional 
approval is anticipated to have been received from HM Revenue & 
Customs for both schemes. Copies of the rules for both schemes are 
available for inspection without charge at the Registered Office of the 
Company during normal business hours and will be available at the 
Meeting. 
3. Authority to allot shares
  Special resolutions 7 & 8 are put forward to give the directors authority 
to allot new shares (including to those shareholders exercising their 
preference to receive dividends in the form of Scrip shares). The 
resolutions limit the requested authority to the stated maximum as an 
added shareholder protection. These authorities give the directors the 
flexibility in financing possible business opportunities and are normal 
practise for a company of this size.  
4. Authority to purchase shares
  Special resolution 9 is put forward to give the directors the ability to 
buy back and cancel existing shares if they feel that such action would 
benefit all remaining shareholders.
5.  Documents on display
  Copies of necessary documents will be available for at least 15 
minutes prior to the Meeting and during the Meeting.

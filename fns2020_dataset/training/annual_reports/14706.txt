CONTENTS “2012/13 was a record-breaking year for the group 
and for british sport. we are pleased that both 
have continued to be successful this year and that 
our strategy of being the consumers’ champion 
continues to reap rewards.
“our colleagues have worked hard throughout the year and, as a result,  
we have exceeded the second underlying ebitda target of £250m set 
under the 2011 employee bonus share scheme and the stretch target of 
£270m. this means the group has successfully met the first two targets 
while there remain two more years to go under the 2011 employee bonus 
share scheme. 
“there is no doubt that the group’s record-breaking results were in the 
large part down to our colleagues and their hard work. the employee 
bonus share schemes have continued to drive this performance and  
we are pleased that eligible employees will be rewarded in august as the 
second and final part of the 2009 employee bonus share scheme vests.
“trading since the period end has remained strong and is ahead of 
management’s expectations for the first quarter. whilst 2013 is a  
non-tournament year, there is no doubt that our compelling offer of 
exceptional quality and unbeatable value continues to resonate well  
with our customers.”

KEY HIGHLIGHTS WHO WE ARE
sports direct is the uk’s leading sports retailer by revenue and 
operating profit, and the owner of a significant number of  
world-famous sport, fashion and lifestyle brands.
w e provide a full multi-channel approach to the uk and european r etail markets. our strategy includes identifying 
opportunities for improvement through in-store specialist collaborations and acquisitions, developing 
online opportunities and leveraging the sportsdirect .com fascia. 
the group continues to enhance its store portfolio and now operates 
out of over 500 stores in the uk and internationally. the group operates through four strategic business segments: uk sports retail, 
international retail, premium lifestyle and brands.
SPORTS DIRECT AT A GLANCE
UK SPORTS RETAIL
£1,575m 75% of total revenue
the group’s uk stores (other than field & t rek) supply a wide range of competitively priced sports and 
leisure equipment, clothing, footwear and accessories under a mix of brands. w e stock third-party 
brands including adidas, nike, r eebok and puma. group-owned brands include dunlop, slazenger and 
lonsdale. w e also sell licensed-in brands.
as at 28 april 2013 uk sports r etail operated out of 396 stores in the united kingdom (excluding 
northern ireland). the majority of stores trade under the sportsdirect .com fascia, although field & 
trek stores trade under their own fascia.
w e have continued to develop our specialised in-store areas with a substantial unitary rollout for our 
dunlop and everlast brands. our sherunsheruns areas also benefited from a rollout of the karrimor 
running footwear zone, featuring an integrated product information and selection panel.
INTERNATIONAL RETAIL
£185m  
9% of total revenue
the group’s extensive interests outside the uk include wholly 
owned retail outlets, joint ventures with other retailers and 
stores within another retailer’s store. during the year, as 
part of the accelerated growth programme in our european 
subsidiary, we opened 19 new stores in europe and entered 
four new countries, including a new store in iceland with a 
joint venture partner and wholly owned stores in slovakia, 
hungary and the czech r epublic. our strategy remains to 
identify partners in new territories while continuing to expand 
our operations in the countries where we currently trade.
PREMIUM LIFESTYLE
£128m  
6% of total revenue
during the year we have continued our expansion of the 
premium lifestyle division. in July 2012 we purchased the 
flannels group, and in february 2013, 114 stores and certain 
assets were acquired from the administrators of the fashion 
retailer r epublic. both acquisitions expand the breadth of our 
premium offering. post year end we have also acquired the 
remaining 20% stake in cruise clothing limited.
BRANDS
£209m  
10% of total revenue
the group’s portfolio includes a wide variety of world-famous 
sport, fashion and lifestyle brands. the group’s r etail division 
sells products under these group brands in its stores, and the 
brands division exploits the brands through its wholesale  
and licensing businesses.
the brands division continues to sponsor a variety of 
prestigious events and retains a base of globally-recognised, 
high-profile sportsmen and women.

KEY PRINCIPLES:
OUR BUSINESS MODEL
our business model is focused on long-term sustainable growth. whilst the central focus remains on growing and developing the 
core uk r etail business, development of our brands and international r etail are also key priorities. our offering has developed further 
in specialist sports categories and more fashion-based retailing. w e are constantly refurbishing and upgrading our stores, in order 
to provide our customers with a compelling consumer experience. the continued development of our dedicated specialist areas and 
on-going collaboration with nike, adidas and p uma on in-store concepts are further examples of this.
acquisitions and strategic investments in related businesses are an important 
part of our strategy. opportunities to develop into new product categories or 
markets, or to strengthen our position in existing areas, will continue to be 
considered on a case by case basis.
w e aim to maintain our position as the market leader in the uk sports r etail 
sector. the business model provides guidance for the group to implement an 
effective growth strategy to maintain and develop the success achieved so far. 
it compares our recent successes with our future ambitions in order that we can 
assess how to progress in the future.
the group has significant momentum and we must ensure that our product 
offering and customer proposition continue to grow and develop in order to retain 
our current customer base and to attract more customers in the future. 
developing brand awareness is a key factor in ensuring a sustainable future, and 
the appropriate level of investment in advertising and technology is an important 
component towards achieving this. 
our international presence continues to grow through over 300 brand licensing 
partners, our online presence and on-going european store openings. the group’s 
appointment of internationally recognised celebrities and sporting professionals 
as key ambassadors also promotes our brands endorsement on a global basis.

i am pleased to announce that the group has continued to perform strongly, both operationally and financially.  
the rate of growth has increased across the business with revenue and ebitda growing impressively. 
the group has delivered strong cash generation and our balance sheet remains 
solid. our position as the consumers’ champion, offering an unmatched range 
of products at the best available prices, is now reaching more countries as we 
continue to expand internationally.
w e are constantly looking for new ways of improving our business. w e invest 
heavily in staff training to help them achieve their full potential. our in-house 
programmes have continued in conjunction with our key partners nike, adidas 
and puma. w e focus on both shop floor-based and classroom activities. 
they include key elements of professionalism such as product knowledge, 
communication, leadership and decision making. the integration of a bespoke 
online training platform, to provide new starters with a thorough induction to the 
business, is one example of innovative training techniques deployed throughout 
the group.
w e are pleased that construction and integration of the phase 2 extension to 
the shirebrook distribution centre has been completed, and the extension to 
the sportsdirect.com store at shirebrook is now underway and completion is 
scheduled for later in 2013. 
our p remium lifestyle division is continuing to grow through acquisitions  
such as the flannels group in July 2012 and r epublic in february 2013.  
w e continue to nurture this division and are already seeing increases in sales 
from earlier acquisitions.
the board’s aim to expand further into europe has been a key strategic driver  
for a number of years which has proved extremely successful. since the start  
of fy13, we have organically grown our store portfolio in europe by 19 new 
stores, and entered four new countries. in conjunction with the acquisitions 
recently announced in austria and the baltics, we are now active in 19  
european countries.
international r etail revenue grew 20.1% in the year and we have continued 
our international growth by opening stores in poland and spain during the first 
quarter of fy14.
the introduction of the sportsdirect.com website platform in 2006 provided the 
group with another route to market and means of serving our customers. w e 
have continued to invest in this platform and the benefits are now clearly being 
recognised. online sales have increased from 11.6% of our total sports r etail 
revenue in fy12 to 15.0% in fy13.
our online offering provides an excellent opportunity to expand the range and 
value of products available to our customers, reinforcing our position as the 
consumers’ champion by delivering exceptional quality at unbeatable value.  
w e have a dedicated web team who run the website, marketing to our 
customers with promotions and campaigns to encourage sales. promotions  
such as daily deals have proved successful and we will continue to invest time 
and resources in further developing our multi-channel offering.
Employee Bonus Share Scheme 
i am delighted to report that the second and final part of the 2009 employee 
bonus share scheme will vest to our valued employees in august 2013. 
i hope that all the employees who have contributed towards the group’s 
performance will enjoy their well-earned bonuses. due to their hard work and 
dedication, the group continues to perform so strongly. the financial rewards 
have already made a huge difference to so many employees. with over 2,000 
colleagues eligible for the second award, it remains a key part of our employee 
incentivisation and remuneration strategy.
the group is well on its way to achieving the targets set under the 2011 
employee bonus share scheme with the fy12 and fy13 underlying ebitda 
targets successfully achieved. although there are a further two targets to be 
met, i am delighted by the progress to date.
the 2011 employee bonus share scheme has the following targets for group 
underlying ebitda (before scheme costs):
fy12: fy13: fy14: fy15: 
£215m £250m £260m £300m
ACHIEVED ACHIEVED
i have no doubt this scheme will run as successfully as the 2009 employee 
bonus share scheme ensuring that our staff remain incentivised.
Super Stretch Internal Targets 
the board has decided not to propose the super- stretch executive bonus share 
scheme (“super- stretch scheme”) for mike ashley, the company’s executive 
deputy chairman, at the upcoming annual general meeting. the board will 
continue to focus on the super-stretch underlying ebitda (before schemes 
costs) targets of £310m for fy14 and £360m for fy15 and these will remain 
internal targets going forward. however the board has decided to review various 
options with regard to remunerating mike ashley in light of the passage of time 
since first considering this scheme.
Pension Scheme 
the enrolment of our employees into the government’s auto-enrolment pension 
scheme took place in may 2013. 
the scheme is administered by the p eople’s pension and is available to all 
employees who are deemed eligible under the government’s criteria.  
the group is committed to meeting the targets of a 1% contribution in 2013, 
a 2% contribution in 2017 and a 3% contribution in 2018. w e also contribute 
towards a number of workplace pensions in relation to companies which we 
have acquired. 
Dividend 
the board has decided not to propose a dividend in respect to fy13. the  
board feels that it remains in the best interests of the company and its 
shareholders to maintain financial and strategic flexibility, including pursuit 
of potential acquisition opportunities and ongoing investment in group 
infrastructure and store portfolio. the payment of dividends will remain under 
review for consideration in future years.
Conclusion 
finally, on behalf of myself and the board, i would like to thank all of our 
employees for their substantial contribution during the year.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information GROUP
the financial y ear ended 28 april 2013 (“the year”) was a 52-week year. in order 
to make a comparison to the previous period, which was a 53-week year, all 
references to financial performance in respect of the income statement, cash 
flow and business reviews are made by reference to a pro-forma 2012 52-week 
basis unless otherwise specified.
for the y ear we increased group revenue by 20.9% to £2,186m. this was 
primarily due to the r etail division, where we grew revenues by 22.7%, including 
a 17.6% growth in total sports r etail coupled with the premium lifestyle 
division, which contributed revenues of £128m.
group gross margin in the year increased by 40 basis points from 40.5% to 
40.9%. total sports r etail division gross margin increased by 20 basis points to 
41.4% (fy12: 41.2%), while brands division gross margin increased to 44.9% 
(fy12: 41.2%).
group operating costs increased 22.5% to £607.9m (fy12: £496.2m). sports 
r etail and brands division operating costs were £491.0m (fy12: £400.0m) and 
£66.6m (fy12: £58.8m), respectively.
OvERvIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
i am pleased to report a further year of strong profit growth for sports direct. the results for the year have benefited from the uefa 
european championships and the london olympics, but have been achieved in a retail environment that remains challenging.  
the group has grown consistently, and the resilience and flexibility of our business model continues to allow us to offer an 
unparalleled product range at the best available prices. w e will continue to be the consumers’ champion.
56 new sports r etail stores opened during the year in the uk and europe, with 
the group continuing to put the consumer at the forefront of our business by 
offering the best combination of product range and value for money. whilst we 
are the clear market leader in the uk sports r etail sector, we are also pleased to 
have broadened our customer base in new areas, such as lifestyle and f ashion, 
and built on our strong retail infrastructure and systems.
our p remium lifestyle division has continued to expand, having acquired 114 
r epublic stores from the administrator in february 2013. the division offers its 
customers an enhanced shopping experience, following the previous acquisition 
of companies including usc, flannels, cruise and v an mildert.
following the success of our 2009 employee bonus share scheme, the group 
launched a new four-year scheme in 2011, covering the period fy12 to fy15, 
with challenging underlying ebitda targets of £215m, £250m, £260m and 
£300m respectively. w e are delighted to inform you that both the first and 
the second of these targets have been achieved and we would like to take 
this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their outstanding contributions 
over the past year. there is no doubt that the schemes continue to be a major 
contributing factor in improving the group’s staff retention. those employees 
that were involved in the 2009 scheme received their first share rewards in 
august 2012 and we are pleased that august 2013 will see the second part of 
the 2009 bonus share scheme vest and we look forward to seeing our fellow 
colleagues well-rewarded for their efforts.

Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
18  r eflecting the success of our approach – balancing revenues and gross margin, 
while maintaining a tight focus on operating costs – we grew group underlying 
ebitda (pre-scheme costs) for the year by 22.1% to £287.9m (fy12: £235.7m). 
within this underlying ebitda , we increased the total r etail division ebitda by 
23.8% to £260.9m (fy12: £210.7m) while the brands division ebitda increased 
by 8.0% to £27.0m (fy12: £25.0m).
excluded from underlying ebitda is a £22.1m (fy12: £20.7m) charge in  
respect of the 2009 and 2011 employee bonus share schemes and the 
executive bonus share schemes. this charge has been taken centrally and, 
except in note 4 to the accounts, is not reflected in divisional (r etail and brands) 
numbers in this report. 
for the y ear, group underlying profit before tax increased 39.6% to £208.1m, 
primarily as a result of the £52.2m increase in (pre-scheme costs) ebitda 
and £9.9m decrease in depreciation and amortisation, offset by the £1.4m 
increase in employee bonus share scheme charges. underlying eps for the year 
increased by 43.3% to 26.85p (fy12: 18.74p). 
net debt at 28 april 2013 was £154.0m (29 april 2012: £145.2m), which is 0.58 
times reported ebitda . r eported ebitda includes realised foreign exchange 
gains/losses in selling and administration costs and the employee bonus share 
scheme charges.

UK SPORTS RETAIL 
uk sports r etail revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by our retail and logistics skills – providing the widest choice of 
products at the best value with universal availability.
uk sports r etail sales were up 17.3% to £1,574.9m (fy12: £1,342.4m). sales and gross profit from the former JJb stores are 
excluded from uk sports r etail revenue and margin and are included in uk wholesale and other.
sales in the first half benefited from the uefa european championships and 
the london olympics, although sales in the second half of the y ear were still up 
16.4% to £778.0m (fy12 h2: £667.7m). gross margins for the second half of the 
year improved to 39.9% (fy12 h2: 39.7%). gross margin for the y ear increased 
by 10 basis points to 41.1% (fy12: 41.0%). w e have invested significantly in 
gross margin throughout the year.
uk sports r etail like-for-like gross contribution, which excludes online, increased 
by a record 11.2%, marking the fourth consecutive year of growth in this kpi 
(fy12: +0.7% / fy11: +6.6% / fy10: +3.4%). uk sports r etail like-for-like 
contribution is defined as the percentage change in gross contribution in the 
successive 12-month period. a like-for-like store is one that has been trading 
for the full 12 months in both periods and has not been affected by a significant 
change, such as a major refurbishment. the number of stores included in this 
year’s kpi is 275 (fy12: 290).
operating costs increased by 18.8% to £409.4m (fy12: £344.5m). operating 
costs in h2 increased by 13.9% to £214.5m (fy12 h2: £188.4m). store wages 
were up 18.0% but as a percentage of sales increased only 0.2% to 8.8% 
(fy12: 8.6%), in spite of a substantial investment in store staff. uk sports 
r etail premises costs increased by only 1.5% due to reduced rent following 
the purchase in the prior year of freehold properties previously rented, and the 
ongoing process of store relocations and rent renegotiations. 
other operating costs were up 34.2% to £157.0m (fy12: £117m) which is due 
to increased warehouse and storage costs to support the growth in our online 
business and increased overheads relating to the obligations acquired from 
the administrator of JJb. the majority of this increase came in h1, with other 
operating costs in h2 only increasing by 15.1% to £84m (fy12: £73m).
operating costs were also reduced by a release of the onerous lease provision  
of £14.6m due to the closure of unprofitable stores, the sub-let of previously 
vacant space and a strategic decision to invest in other stores previously 
planned for closure.
underlying ebitda for uk sports r etail was £247.7m (fy12: £207.7m), an 
increase of 19.2% for the year. this increase was driven by a £111.7m increase 
in gross profit (including uk wholesale and other) due to the growth in store 
contribution and online sales offset by the £64.9m increase in operating costs.
the group’s retail businesses performed strongly in a difficult economic 
environment. our retail model, offering outstanding value to our customers, 
remains resilient, both in the uk and internationally. throughout the y ear,  
we continued to focus on offering the customer the most comprehensive 
product range, the best availability and value while reducing our costs  
wherever possible.

UK SPORTS RETAIL continued
our store portfolio remains constantly under review with the performance of 
each store and ways of maximising performance being regularly examined. 
during the year we opened 37 and closed 36 stores. w e have closed 113  
stores since 2008 as the mix of our portfolio continues to evolve. w e increased 
our period end square-footage to c. 4.0m square feet (fy12: c. 3.9m).
in the 12 months to 28 april 2013, rent reviews have been agreed on 33 stores. 
the average increase in rent was 2.48% (0.48% annual equivalent). there are 
currently 42 rent reviews outstanding with a further 40 falling due in 2013-14. 
our lease expiry profile over all core stores (excluding lillywhites p iccadilly)  
is now 6 years, allowing a significant amount of flexibility within our portfolio to 
adapt our format to the rapidly changing multi-channel environment. 
in the current financial year, we are targeting to open 25-30 stores. w e 
anticipate closing more stores than we open in fy14. this is in line with our 
aim of maintaining four million square feet of retail space, but with an increased 
average store size. w e have already opened six in the first quarter, including  
two relocations.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information UK RETAIL - PREMIUM LIFESTYLE 
during the year we have continued our expansion of the premium lifestyle 
division. in July 2012 we purchased a majority stake in the flannels group, 
and in february 2013, 114 stores and certain assets were acquired from the 
administrators of the fashion retailer r epublic. following negotiations with 
landlords, 85 r epublic stores remain open. both acquisitions have expanded the 
breadth of our premium lifestyle offering. p ost year end we have also acquired 
the remaining 20% stake in cruise.
the results of r epublic are excluded from the above analysis as the fascia had 
not been fully integrated into the group by the end of the year. for the nine 
weeks since acquisition, r epublic made a loss of £4.5m ebitda .
the results for fy13 include a full year’s trading for usc, cruise and v an mildert 
and nine months for flannels. the fy12 results included nine months of trading 
for usc and cruise and two months for v an mildert.
sales for the division in the year were £128.4m (fy12: £73.5m), gross margin 
was 43.4% which is 100 basis points lower than the prior year (fy12: 44.4%). 
the divisional ebitda (excluding r epublic) was £5.4m, after the release of an 
onerous lease provision of £2.0m (fy12: loss of £7.8m).
usc online sales increased by 84.7% to £10.9m (fy12: £5.9m), driven by the 
adoption of the group’s fulfilment systems and online platform.
at the year end, the division traded from 74 stores with five targeted fascias:

the group has a 50% shareholding in the heatons chain which operates 14 
sports direct stores in northern ireland and 26 sports stores in the r epublic  
of ireland. during the year we opened a new store in iceland through our  
25% shareholding. 
all of the stores in the previous table are operated by companies wholly owned 
by the group, except portugal, where the group owns 50.1%. as part of the 
accelerated growth programme in our european subsidiary, we opened 19 
new stores in europe and entered four new countries. as at 28 april 2013, 
international r etail operated from a total retail sales space of c. 1.1m sq. ft 
(fy12: c. 0.895m sq. ft).
importantly, with all of our new and existing stores in europe, local management 
are working hard to ensure that all stores are committed to the operational 
efficiencies and standards that exist across the uk sports stores.
our strategy remains to identify partners in new territories while continuing 
to expand our operations in the countries where we currently trade. for fy14, 
and in line with our accelerated european expansion, we are targeting eight to 
12 new stores and two to three new territories. in the first quarter, we have 
already opened two stores in poland and one in spain. in conjunction with the 
acquisition recently announced in austria and the baltic region, we are now 
active in 19 countries across europe.

CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REPORT & BUSINESS REvIEW continued
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
24  in march 2012 we acquired the firetrap brand and assets from the administrator. 
during fy13 the business underwent a complete customer and operational 
review, resulting in significant cost savings and a more streamlined operation. 
the brands division remained acquisitive during the y ear, acquiring vandanel 
premier, a distributor of football branded clothing and equipment and also 
w aterline, a wholesale fishing business.
licensing revenues in the y ear were up 12.0% to £30.7m (fy12: £27.4m). 
w e signed 87 new licence agreements, covering multiple brands and product 
categories, with minimum contracted values of $53m over the life of the 
agreements. w e remain on track for licence income to achieve a compound 
average growth rate (cagr) of 11%, reaching at least $60m of licensing 
revenues by fy15.
longer term, we still regard licensing as the key driver of brands division 
profitability and crucial for the overall growth of the brands business. the main 
growth areas are expected to be asia p acific and the americas which should 
compensate for a tougher licensing landscape in the uk and europe.
operating costs increased by 19.4% to £66.6m (fy12: £55.8m) which includes 
a £3.0m cost for the firetrap reorganisation. excluding these costs underlying 
ebitda therefore increased by 8.0% to £27.0m (fy12: £25.0m).

wholesale revenues were up 5.8% to £178.3m (fy12: £168.5m), driven by strong performances in our north american businesses. 
brands gross margin increased by 370 basis points to 44.9% (fy12: 41.2%). wholesale gross margin rose to 35.4% (fy12: 31.7%).
w e continue to focus on developing world-class products that 
are endorsed by leading athletes on the field of play. a recent 
addition to our team of key brand ambassadors is r obson 
green. r obson, the face of channel 5’s extreme fishing, is the 
ambassador of the fishing range developed under our iconic 
dunlop brand. 
the group recognised that fishing is a sport which involves 
significant mass participation and therefore developed 
product ranges of superior quality and great value, to suit the 
needs and value expectations of our customers.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information
dunlop brand ambassador - r obson green EMPLOYEES
sports direct has made great progress and a large proportion of this is due to 
the hard work and loyalty of our c. 24,000 staff throughout the business.  
i am overwhelmed by the contributions that have been made by our employees 
towards achieving an exciting future for the group. i believe that the dedication 
of our employees has placed us in an extremely strong position in the market in 
what is most definitely a difficult time for most retailers. the past contributions 
from our employees make me confident that we can replicate our successes as 
we look forward to the future.
the employee bonus share schemes have been a fundamental tool which 
the group has used to promote, incentivise and motivate its staff. sharing the 
responsibility of achieving these targets was matched by the potential benefits 
to employees if the targets were met. the schemes have been crucial to 
influencing staff behaviour and maximising the group performance. 
the 2009 employee bonus share scheme was the first scheme which we 
trialled, vesting in august 2012 and august 2013. all of the elements of the 
scheme were met and the first awards were successfully vested for eligible 
employees in 2012. the second award of shares will vest for eligible employees 
in august 2013 amounting to approximately 21 million shares. the second 
awards were to the value of 75% of base pay for the majority of employees, and 
25% of base pay for those employees who joined the group later but still within 
the rules of the scheme.
to the extent that a significant number of eligible employees elect to sell 
some or all of their shares, whilst the company has no obligation to buy back 
the shares, the board will consider a number of options open to it, including 
whether to: (i) implement an on-market buy back of shares pursuant to the 
authority given by shareholders at the company’s agm in 2012; or (ii) fund the 
company’s employee benefit t rust so as to allow it to acquire shares in the 
market to replace those shares transferred to eligible employees pursuant to  
the vesting.
a further incentive for our employees has been the introduction of the 2011 
employee bonus share scheme. the 2011 scheme has been developed 
to incentivise and motivate our current employees in pursuit of our shared 
group objectives. the on-going growth and performance of the group may be 
attributed to the successful adoption of the 2009 and 2011 employee bonus 
share schemes. employees who have received bonuses under the 2009 scheme 
could be eligible for further awards under the 2011 scheme, and we hope to 
retain our valued employees by offering such rewards. this year 15.5% of our  
uk employees left the business, down from 17% in fy12.
the underlying ebitda targets (before the costs of the scheme), of £215m in 
fy12 and £250m in fy13, have been achieved. the targets for fy14 and fy15 
are £260m and £300m respectively. these further targets, coupled with the 
individual employee’s satisfactory personal performance, must all be met in 
order for the scheme to vest in august 2015 and 2017. with approximately 6m 
shares due to vest in 2015 and approximately 17m shares due to vest in 2017,  
it is important that we continue to work together towards these shared goals.
2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme
ebitda targets of:
• £215m in fy12 (achieved £235.7m)
• £250m in fy13 (achieved £287.9m)
• £260m in fy14
• £300m in fy15
all four targets have to be met. maximum award of 23m shares, to include  
c. 3,000 employees.

Objective So Far What Next?
Identify
In-Store the group focuses on its stores to ensure the best presentation of our product 
range. our product collections provide a ‘good/better/best’ presentation to 
ensure our customers find the right product at the right price. our specialist 
collaborations with sherunsheruns and soccer scene @ the boot r oom 
provide a high level of customer service. our multi-channel approach also 
gives flexibility to our customers.
the group continues to enhance its in-store offering with further dedicated 
areas for specialist product collections:
• european golf
• swimshop.co.uk
• w aterline
• dragoncarp direct
• field & t rek
Acquisitions in fy13 the group acquired the key assets of JJb including the distribution 
centre in wigan and the slazenger golf brand. the group also acquired a 51% 
stake in the flannels group for the p remium lifestyle division and added used 
tackle and w aterline to expand the fishing product offering. 
in february 2013 the group acquired various assets of the fashion retailer 
r epublic including the stock, 114 stores and the website.
the group continues to identify suitable opportunities to expand the product 
range, our specialist collaborations and the premium lifestyle division.
Invest
Store Portfolio since april 2012, uk sports r etail has opened 28 core stores and closed 10 
core stores. the group also opened nine and closed 26 non-core stores. 
during fy13, international r etail opened 19 new stores and closed five. as at 
28 april 2013, international r etail operated wholly owned subsidiaries in nine 
countries and a 50.1% partnership in portugal.
the group also opened a new store in iceland as a joint venture and has a 50% 
stake in the heatons chain in northern ireland and r epublic of ireland.
the group intends to continue to enhance its store portfolio in both the uk and 
internationally. the group will continue with the strategy to identify strategic 
partners in new territories while expanding operations in those countries 
where we currently have a presence. plans are in place to expand international 
r etail operations into all countries that have adopted the euro.
People our employees have contributed substantially towards our growth and 
success. w e are consistently investing in the training and development of 
our employees to ensure that they are incentivised and recognised for their 
contribution. the 2009 and 2011 employee bonus share schemes are an 
important contributor to employee motivation and group performance. the 
targets of the 2009 employee bonus share scheme were achieved and the 
second award is due to vest in august 2013. the 2011 employee bonus share 
scheme has been embraced by our employees and they have worked hard to 
contribute towards the ebitda targets to date. if the additional group targets 
are achieved, members of the 2011 scheme will be rewarded with shares in 
the group.
due to the success of the first bonus share scheme, we continue to 
encourage and motivate employees with the 2011 employee bonus  
share scheme. 
Develop
Website online r etail sales currently represent 15.0% of total sports r etail revenue, up 
from 11.6% in fy12.
aided by the new platform launched in november 2012, our monthly unique 
visitors have risen 50.9% on fy12 and the average basket size has risen 4.6% 
to £59.50.
our conversion ratio of unique visitors who go on to make a purchase has 
risen from 5.4% to 5.7%.
online revenue continues to be an area of significant growth and the group 
continues to look at opportunities to develop this revenue stream further. the 
website has benefited from the group’s investment in online product range and 
availability, and from recognition of the online brand now that 376 stores have 
the sportsdirect .com fascia.
the launch of sportsdirectnews .com in november 2012 provides a further 
opportunity to drive incremental visitors to our website.
Promote
Brands the group’s portfolio includes a wide variety of world famous sport, fashion 
and lifestyle brands. the group’s r etail division sells products under these 
group brands in its stores, and the brands division exploits the brands through 
its wholesale and licensing businesses.
the brands division wholesale business sells the brands’ core products,  
such as dunlop tennis rackets and slazenger tennis balls, to wholesale 
customers and distributors throughout the world. this results in far wider 
distribution of the products than would be the case if their sale was restricted 
to group stores.
the wholesale business also wholesales childrenswear and apparel. the 
licensing business licenses third parties to apply group-owned brands to 
non-core products manufactured and distributed by those third parties. w e 
currently have in excess of 300 licensees in over 100 countries. the brands 
division manages these licensees to ensure global brand consistency and the 
international success of our group brands.
the brands division is closely involved in the development of licensed products 
and monitors licensees and their manufacturers to ensure product quality, 
presentation and consistency with the appropriate brand strategy. the brands 
division continues to sponsor a variety of prestigious events and retains a 
portfolio of globally-recognised, high-profile athletes.
the brands division strategy includes further expansion into asia, as well 
as the americas. such expansion will provide us with more opportunities to 
expand the global presence and international appeal of our group brands.
in order to maintain brand awareness and authenticity, the brands division 
will continue to invest in the development of core products for wholesale 
customers and distributors throughout the world.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information MAIN TRENDS AND FACTORS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE FUTURE 
DEvELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUP ’S BUSINESSES
the group’s retail businesses will undoubtedly be affected by the economic 
climate and changes therein. movements in interest rates and exchange rates 
affect the businesses directly and consumer confidence and spending is affected 
by a wide range of factors including employment, tax and interest rates, house 
prices and the general ‘feel-good factor’; factors beyond the group’s influence. 
all of the above apply equally to our brands businesses, both wholesale and 
licensing. r eduction in customer demand is reflected in the wholesaling and 
licensing business, as orders and royalties are affected. moreover, in difficult 
economic times, suppliers come under increasing pressure to reduce their prices 
to their customers and all suppliers run the risk of their customers ceasing to 
trade or reducing demand for their products. 
difficult economic conditions can also make it difficult for suppliers to obtain 
credit insurance in respect of some customers, leaving the supplier with a 
difficult question of whether or not to supply and, if they do, with the attendant 
risk of bad debts.
later in this report, we comment on risks and uncertainties that relate to the 
group’s businesses and while we manage to reduce risks, where possible, the 
likelihood of their occurring and their impact if they do, are factors that could 
influence the group or part of it.
the group applies hedge accounting, which is in line with other major retailers. 
this reduces an element of potential volatility in reported profit.
CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REPORT & BUSINESS REvIEW continued
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESS 
Internal Controls and Risk Management  
the board has a responsibility to govern the group in the interest of the 
shareholders. the board is responsible for setting strategic objectives and part 
of this involves assessing the risks involved. risks are an inherent part of the 
business world and, due to the nature of the business, the group is exposed to 
a wide variety of these. in order to minimise the effect of potentially damaging 
effects to the group, the board ensures these are managed and monitored 
effectively via a framework of controls and robust procedures.
The Group’s Approach to Risk 
the identification and management of risk is a continuous process, and the 
group’s system of internal controls and the business continuity programmes are 
key elements of that. the group maintains a system of controls to manage the 
business and to protect its assets with the development of contingency plans 
and rapid response to changing circumstances and does much to mitigate the 
risks facing the group. the group continues to invest in people, systems and in 
it to manage the group’s operations and its finances effectively and efficiently.
executive management teams are responsible for the identification, analysis, 
evaluation and mitigation of the significant risks applicable to their areas of 
business. these comprise of directors as well as of senior managers.
the teams meet regularly to discuss the identified risks, and how these 
should be reviewed and monitored. the board ensures that the appropriate 
arrangements are in place under which employees can raise concerns about 
possible financial or other impropriety, which are then appropriately investigated. 
these arrangements include formal grievance procedures and employee 
confidential hotlines.
the board is assisted by the audit committee in fulfilling its overview 
responsibilities, reviewing the reporting of financial and non-financial information 
to shareholders and the audit process, satisfying itself that appropriate systems 
of internal control and risk management are in place and are serving to identify 
and manage risk.
the group operates a r etail support unit which provides strong operational 
internal audit services in the r etail division, and there are procedures in place in 
the brands division to monitor and control licensees.
the external auditors are invited to attend all meetings of the audit committee, 
save for those parts of any meeting when the committee reviews the 
performance of the auditors and when the committee is having separate 
discussions with the group finance director.
with the exception of heatons, who are the group’s only material associate,  
the group’s system of internal control and risk management and its 
effectiveness is monitored and reviewed by the board, the audit committee  
and management, and the board believes that the group has maintained 
throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the annual report and 
accounts an effective embedded system of internal control and has complied 
with the turnbull guidance.
the systems of internal control and risk management are designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve business objectives.
Risk Policies and Procedures 
business plans and budgets for each business include financial and strategic 
targets against which performance is monitored. monitoring includes the 
examination of and changes to rolling annual and quarterly forecasts, monthly 
measurement of actual achievement against key performance targets and plans, 
and weekly reviews of performance.
the group has clear procedures for the approval and control of expenditure. 
strategic investment decisions involving both capital and revenue expenditure 
are subject to formal detailed appraisal and review according to approval  
levels set by the board. operating expenditure is controlled within each  
business with approval levels for such expenditure being determined by the 
individual businesses.
the group has a formal whistle-blowing policy for employees who wish to raise 
any issues or concerns relating to the group’s activities on a confidential basis.

Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
28  Key Risks 
Control environment 
the group’s operating procedures include a comprehensive system for reporting 
financial and non-financial information to the board including:
• preparation of three years of strategy plans for business development;
• preparation and review of annual budgets; and
• review of the business at each board meeting, focussing on any new risks 
arising (for example key changes in the market).
Control procedures 
detailed operational procedures have been developed for each of the group’s 
operating businesses that embody key controls. the implications of changes in 
law and regulations are taken into account within these procedures.
Financial reporting process 
the group has in place internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to the group’s financial reporting process and the group’s process for 
the preparation of consolidated accounts. these include clearly defined lines 
of accountability and delegation of authority, policies and procedures that 
cover financial planning and reporting, preparing consolidated accounts, capital 
expenditure, project governance and information security.
the audit committee is responsible for overseeing and monitoring these 
processes, which are designed to ensure that the group complies with 
relevant regulatory reporting and filing provisions. as at the end of the period 
covered by this r eport, the audit committee, with the participation of the chief 
executive and group finance director, evaluated the effectiveness of the design 
and operation of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that 
information required to be disclosed in financial reports is recorded, processed, 
summarised and reported within specified time periods.
Monitoring Process 
the groups’s approach to monitoring the system of key controls is set out in this 
section of the chief executive’s r eport.
Principal Risks Affecting the Group 
the group has identified the following factors as potential risks to, and 
uncertainties concerning, the successful operation of its business. the group is 
however exposed to a wider range of risks than discussed below but these are 
the principal risks, that have recently been discussed by the board and audit 
committee and are of primary concern.
Area Risk Mitigation
Supply Chain
the group operates internationally so is reliant on 
the successful distribution of goods from when 
they are distributed by the manufacturer to when 
they are sold in the stores.
the group is reliant on manufacturers in 
developing countries as the majority of the group’s 
products are sourced from outside the uk .
the group is therefore subject to the risks associated 
with international trade and transport as well as 
those relating to exposure to different legal and other 
standards. risks including cost increases, energy 
shortages, natural disasters, working practices and 
product safety could all cause significant problems.
the group requires all suppliers to sign up to the group’s code of ethics/supply p olicy which enables 
the group to monitor and benchmark the performance of the supplier. it allows the group to carry out 
inspections of premises to ensure compliance with the group’s codes for continuity and quality of 
supply. this is an on-going process and inspections occur on a random basis.
many risks relating to the supply chain, reliance on non-uk suppliers, and to the reputation of the 
group’s brands are managed and mitigated by the implementation of these policies. strong service 
level agreements and maintaining relationships with all parties involved in the supply chain also 
mitigate these risks.
Key Suppliers
the group is reliant on good relationships with 
its major manufacturers, key brands or brand 
suppliers.
a failure to replace any of its major manufacturers 
or suppliers on commercially reasonable terms could 
have an adverse effect on the group’s business, 
operating profit or overall financial condition. it may 
mean that customers shop elsewhere if stores cannot 
supply the required product.
the group follows policies of forging long term relationships with suppliers and of utilising two leading 
supply chain companies to procure much of the group’s own branded goods. this close relationship 
brings a better understanding of the supplier’s resources enabling the group to react quickly to changes 
in the international supply market. 
Treasury and Financial Risk
the group operates internationally. the majority of 
foreign contracts relating to the sourcing of group 
branded goods are denominated in us dollars 
and the euro, thus leaving exposure to foreign 
exchange risk.
the group has net borrowings, which are 
principally at floating interest rates linked to bank 
base rates or libor .
the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising 
from various currency exposures and a strengthening 
of the us dollar or a weakening of the pound sterling 
making goods more expensive.
foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial 
transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s 
functional currency, as exchange rates move. this 
could significantly reduce profitability.
the group seeks to mitigate the expenses and fX fluctuations by hedging via forward foreign currency 
contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
the group also holds assets overseas in local currency, and these assets are revalued in accordance 
with currency movements. this currency risk is not hedged.
the group is cash generative and is now targeting its debt levels to mitigate interest rate risk and 
currently has debt levels of less than 1 x underlying ebitda .
Credit and Liquidity Risk
the group, primarily the brands division, provides 
credit to some of its customers.
f unding and liquidity for the group’s operations 
are provided through bank loans, overdrafts and 
shareholders’ funds. 
the group could have a credit risk if credit evaluations 
were not performed on all customers requiring credit 
over a certain amount.
the group’s objective is to maintain sufficient funding 
and liquidity for its requirements, but the availability 
of adequate cash resources from bank facilities and 
achieving continuity of funding in the current financial 
climate could be a risk to the group in future years.
the group may not be able to purchase  
essential acquisitions.
the group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
the group’s key suppliers also face credit risk and as such the group regularly assesses the viability of 
its suppliers and ensures there are plans to source from alternative businesses should key suppliers fail.
rigorous procedures are in place to mitigate this credit risk. the group has a credit policy in place and 
the exposure to risk is monitored on an on-going basis.
credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount, and 
concentration of credit risk is managed.
investment of cash surplus, borrowings and derivative investments are made through banks and 
companies which have credit ratings and investment criteria approved by the board.
the group mitigates liquidity risk by keeping debt levels low and the current finance facility is held with 
a club of 10 banks, thereby spreading the risk.
the group works with a number of trusted advisors.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESS continued
Area Risk Mitigation
Investment Risk
the group holds shares in  
publicly-listed companies.
fluctuations in publicly-listed companies’ share prices will have a financial impact on 
the business or results.
the group has chosen to limit further purchases of publicly-listed company 
shares in order to reduce the potential risk to the business, although current 
investments are in known business sectors and are not deemed to be in 
volatile companies.
Succession Planning
the group’s directors and key management 
employees ensure that the current level of 
success is maintained.
illness, injury or resignation of key individuals could change the whole dynamic  
of the group.
succession plans in place where appropriate.
key individuals working ”on the ground” to assess the strengths of  
fellow employees.
r egular appraisals to ensure that employees are developing and training is 
given when necessary.
Market Forces
the sports r etail industry is highly 
competitive and the group currently 
competes at national and local levels with a 
wide variety of retailers of varying sizes who 
may have competitive advantages, and new 
competitors may enter the market.
the competition continues to place pressure on the group’s pricing strategy, margins 
and profitability.
the group has a discount pricing policy to help reduce the risk of increased 
competition in the industry. the group has an incredibly strong property 
portfolio and owns a very large number of key brands. external suppliers often 
consider the group as a very large account.
Pensions
some subsidiaries in the group make 
contributions to certain occupational defined 
benefits pension schemes.
an increase in the schemes’ funding needs or changes to obligations in respect of the 
schemes could have an adverse impact on its business.
although the group is unable to mitigate any change in legislation regarding 
contributions, the schemes are historical and closed to new entrants. the 
group does not intend to enter into any further final salary arrangements 
going forward.
Operational
the group is reliant on the divisional head 
offices and the national distribution centre 
at shirebrook operating without disruption, 
along with the uninterrupted running of the 
group’s fleet of vehicles.
the majority of the group’s revenue is derived 
from the uk .
any disruption to the head offices, the national distribution centre and the fleet 
of vehicles might significantly impact the group’s ability to manage its operations, 
distribute products to its stores and maintain its supply chain.
any long term interruption of the group’s it systems would have a significant impact 
on the group’s operation, particularly in the r etail division.
terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, government actions or adverse weather affecting 
the road networks within the uk could result in a significant reduction in consumer 
confidence, which would in turn have an adverse affect on sales in stores.
the group has a strong business continuity plan that is regularly reviewed 
to address operational risks. the last review and testing of this took place 
during the most recent financial year (fy13).
the board is confident that as far as it is practical, the risks and uncertainties 
that face the group are being monitored and managed and that, where 
required, appropriate action is being taken.
the group constantly monitors the business environment and the nature  
of the business model allows for the group to act swiftly under  
extraordinary circumstances.
the group ensures that health and safety, maintenance and staff training is 
actively monitored and enforced.
Health & Safety
health and safety is key to the group as 
the implementation of policies in this regard 
protects our employees and customers.
f ailure to create and maintain environments which are safe for both employees and 
customers. incidents leading to injuries, trauma or fatalities could result from poor 
compliance with essential health and safety regulations.
health and safety is a priority for the group. incidents are recorded and steps 
are put in place to minimise the risk of these recurring.
as health and safety requirements vary from country to country, we  
ensure that each company in the relevant countries are fully trained in the 
standards required.
Legal
the group’s trade marks, patents, designs 
and other intellectual property rights are 
central to the value of the group’s brands.
the group believes that its licensees, suppliers, agents and distributors are in 
material compliance with employment, environmental and other laws. the violation, 
or allegations of a violation, of such laws or regulations, by any of the group’s 
licensees, suppliers, agents or distributors, could lead to adverse publicity and a 
decline in public demand for the group’s products, or require the group to incur 
expenditure or make changes to its supply chain and other business arrangements to 
ensure compliance.
the group may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce its intellectual 
property rights and any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion  
of resources.
third parties may try to challenge the ownership or counterfeit the group’s  
intellectual property.
the group has an in-house specialist trade mark and license legal 
department that administers all registrations and regulations. this in-house 
expertise is vital in mitigating any or all such issues.
Sales
the group’s retail businesses are subject 
to seasonal peaks. the incidence and 
participation in major sporting events  
will have a particular impact on the uk  
r etail business.
prolonged unseasonal weather conditions or temporary severe weather during peak 
trading seasons could have a material adverse effect on the group’s businesses. the 
group are dependent upon the store portfolio and consumers’ spending habits.
although unable to mitigate environmental conditions the group are able to 
influence the retail portfolio and therefore constantly monitor development  
of stores and the group’s aim to increase the square footage through 
viable new retail space. by monitoring stock levels correctly through sales 
forecasting the group can manage the peaks in demand and trading profiles 
can be predicted.
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
30  Area Risk Mitigation
Consumer
the group’s success and sales are 
dependent, in part, on the strength and 
reputation of the brands it sells, and are 
subject to consumers’ perceptions of the 
group and of its products, which can fall  
out of favour.
adverse publicity concerning any of the group’s brands, manufacturers or  
suppliers could lead to substantial erosion in the reputation of, or value associated 
with the group. 
the dedicated legal department monitors usage of the group’s own brands to 
ensure they are used in the correct manner.
specific individuals in the media are chosen to promote brands.  
the group carefully selects individuals who will fit with the products and  
the target market.
Environmental
the group is subject to the negative effects 
that environmental disasters can have on the 
business environment.
environmental disasters have highlighted how it is impossible to predict how an 
environmental occurrence will affect businesses.
the group constantly updates systems to mitigate any delay or loss of goods 
in transit or the absence of any employee or large numbers of employees that 
may or may not be altered by acts of nature.
CONTRACTS ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS OF THE GROUP
the group has long-established relationships with nike and adidas, the major 
suppliers of third-party branded sporting goods, particularly footwear, and 
considers that continued supplies from these companies are critical to the 
business of the group.
ENvIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
the corporate r esponsibility r eport is on pages 52 to 55 and a review of 
the assessment of the group’s impact on the environment is included in the 
corporate r esponsibility r eport on pages 53 and 54.
RESEARCH AND DEvELOPMENT
the group’s success depends on the strength of the group brands and, to a 
lesser extent, the licensed-in brands. the group’s efforts to continually develop 
or obtain brands in a timely manner or at all may be unsuccessful. 
OUTLOOK
the start of the fy14 has already been busy with the acquisition of majority 
stakes in two leading european sporting goods retailers in austria and in  
the baltic region. this means that the group is now active in 19 countries across 
europe. while management is focused on the successful integration  
of these businesses, we also expect to see more opportunities to grow the 
group internationally.
the group has witnessed a strong start to the year with trading ahead of 
management’s expectations. this performance is attributable to a number of 
factors including the investment in gross margin made last year, increased 
operating efficiencies and the exceptional quality and unbeatable value sports 
direct continues to offer to its customers. however, recent out-performance 
versus management expectations may not continue for the full year. fy14 is a 
non-tournament year, which will make fy13 a tough comparator following the 
uefa european championships and the london olympics. 
with this performance in mind, we remain focused and driven to achieve our 
internal stretch underlying ebitda target of £310m (before the charge for the 
2011 employee and executive bonus share schemes).

the directors believe that underlying ebitda , underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share provide more useful information for shareholders on the 
underlying performance of the business than the reported numbers and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally. they are not recognised 
profit measures under ifrs and may not be directly comparable with “adjusted” profit measures used by other companies.
ebitda is earnings before investment income, finance income and finance costs, tax, depreciation and amortisation and, therefore, includes the group’s share of 
profit from associated undertakings and joint ventures. underlying ebitda is calculated as ebitda before the impact of foreign exchange, any exceptional or other 
non-trading items and costs relating to the employee bonus share schemes.

iv. ifrs revaluation of foreign currency contracts which decreased profit by £2.0m; and
v. f air value adjustments within associates which increased profit by £0.4m.
 
SELLING, DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS 
selling, distribution and administration costs for the group decreased as a 
percentage of revenue. this was as a result of cost and efficiency savings 
offsetting inflation and increased investment online.
 
FOREIGN ExCHANGE
the group manages the impact of currency movements through the use of 
forward fixed rate currency purchase and sales contracts. the group’s policy 
has been to hold or hedge up to four years (with generally a minimum of six 
months) of anticipated purchases in foreign currency.
the realised exchange gain of £2.3m (fy12: £2.0m loss) included in 
administration costs has arisen from:
a. accepting dollars and euros at the contracted rate; and
b. the translation of dollars and euro denominated assets and liabilities at the 
period end rate or date of realisation.
the exchange loss of £2.0m (fy12: £3.5m gain) included in finance costs / 
income substantially represents the reduction in the mark-to-market asset 
made (under ifrs) for the group’s unhedged forward contracts as at 29 april 
2013. a number of the forward contracts outstanding at 28 april 2013 qualify 
for hedge accounting and the fair value gain on these contracts of £15.6m has 
been credited to equity through the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. the group has sufficient us dollar contracts to cover the majority of 
purchases in uk r etail for fy14. these hedged contracts are at an average rate 
of usd / gbp 1.631.
the sterling exchange rate with the us dollar was $1.626 at 29 april 2012 and 
$1.547 at 28 april 2013.

the rise in interest payable is a result of the increased use of the revolving credit 
facility. this increase is attributable to the acquisitions during the year and the 
investment in working capital.
the loss on the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts arises under 
ifrs as a result of marking to market at the period end those contracts that do 
not qualify for hedge accounting.

the success which the group has enjoyed is largely a result of the loyalty 
and enthusiasm of our c. 24,000 employees. both the 2009 employee bonus 
share scheme and the 2011 employee bonus share scheme have incentivised 
employees and provided them with an opportunity to own shares in the listed 
company while working towards a shared target. the schemes are subject 
to a number of conditions, including personal performance conditions. the 
purpose of the schemes has been to encourage hard work in our employees 
in order that the group achieves the requisite underlying ebitda targets and 
the employee achieves a bonus. the schemes have also assisted the group to 
retain key employees whose skills and expertise are necessary to the success 
of the group. the first part of the 2009 employee bonus share scheme vested 
in august 2012 and the second part of the scheme is due to vest in august 
2013. these awards will provide many employees with life-changing sums. the 
2011 employee bonus share scheme vests in september 2015 and september 
2017. this scheme has four essential underlying ebitda targets, two of which 
have already been achieved. both of these bonus share schemes will operate in 
addition to the current workplace bonus schemes, which are directly related to 
specific workplace performance.
f urther information on relationships with employees can be found in the 
corporate r esponsibility r eport on page 52.
EqUAL OPPORTUNITIES
the group’s policy for employees and all applicants for employment is to match 
the capabilities and talents of each individual to the appropriate job. f actors

ethnic origin should be ignored and any decision which is made with regard to 
candidates should be irrespective of these. discrimination in any form will not be 
tolerated under any circumstances within the group.
applications for employment by disabled persons are given full and fair 
consideration for all vacancies, and are assessed in accordance with their 
particular skills and abilities. the group does all that is practicable to meet its 
responsibilities towards the training and employment of disabled people, and 
to ensure that training, career development and promotion opportunities are 
available to all employees. 
the group makes every effort to provide continuity of employment where 
current employees become disabled. attempts are made in every circumstance 
to provide employment, whether this involves adapting the current job role 
and remaining in the same job, or moving to a more appropriate job role. Job 
retraining and job adaptation are just two examples of how the group works 
in the interests of employees to promote equal opportunities in order that the 
employee’s employment within the group may continue. the group values 
the knowledge and expertise that employees have gained throughout their

Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
40  CORPORATE GOvERNANCE REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
i am pleased to introduce the corporate governance statement which contains 
details of the activities of the board and its committees and how the group 
complied with the uk corporate governance code 2012 for the 52-week period 
ended 28 april 2013. the annual r eport is regarded as the cornerstone of the 
groups’ communication with shareholders. this report is aimed at providing a 
clear understanding of the governance in the group.
our diverse board remains committed to ensuring that corporate governance 
is maintained in the current challenging climate. the structure of the board has 
remained constant for some time now, and the group has found that this has 
led to a higher degree of trust and uniformity when it has come to making tough 
business decisions.
in line with the recommendations of the t yson r eport, the group wholeheartedly 
agrees that board diversity should ultimately benefit shareholders. following 
on from the davies r eport in february 2011, the group’s board (excluding the 
chairman) is made up of 14% women. this is in excess of the figures provided 
from the cranfield r eport in april 2013 which stood at 13.3%, and also bears 
comparison to the number of senior women in the public sector. diversity in our 
boardroom is a major consideration to the group, as is merit, and these will be 
key objectives when appointing future board members as and when suitable 
vacancies arise. however, due to the geographical locations, complexity, and  
the nature of the operations of the group, ensuring that we have the correct  
level of relevant knowledge, skills and experience in the boardroom is the 
immediate priority.
w e are aware of the european commission proposal on 14 november 2012  
for a gender diversity directive, which aims for 40% of board members to be 
made up by women by 2020, and lord davies’ recommendation that ftse 350 
companies should aim towards voluntary targets. as a result of these, over 
the forthcoming year we have set a voluntary target in line with the european 
commission proposal, which is both fair and achievable. however, we do not 
agree with the t rades union congress’ proposal to impose compulsory quotas, 
as we feel that this will be both prejudicial to women and detrimental  
to businesses. 
across the group we employ thousands of individuals from a wealth of 
backgrounds. w e aim to employ individuals based on relevant skills, knowledge 
and criteria, rather than based on age, race or gender. w e are looking to 
replicate our success of women in the business to senior management and  
the boardroom. 
succession planning is extremely important to the group in order to mitigate risk 
and build on the strengths, skills and competencies which we currently possess. 
although our current structure remains appropriate at present, we aim to share 
the knowledge of key individuals in order that when they leave, the skills that 
they have learnt remain in the group. under our forward-looking approach we 
aim to utilise the resources from our own talent pool. w e offer a large variety 
of activities, including site visits and specialised training, to improve personal 
development and to progress our colleagues to the next step in their careers 
within the group. current and future vacancies are advertised both internally and 
externally to ensure that the largest range of individuals view it and can apply, in 
the hope that the appointment is awarded to the most suitable individual.
the group is actively considering how to make management roles more 
attractive. in future we are looking at how to attract the highest calibre of 
individuals, including exploring family-friendly working and graduate training 
schemes. w e hope to encourage both men and women of all backgrounds to 
senior positions within the group.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOvERNANCE CODE
the overall responsibility for the group’s risk management and internal controls 
systems sits with the board. this is an on-going process which relates to the 
identification, evaluation, management and monitoring of significant risks. this 
complies with the uk corporate governance code. 
the board is subject to the latest corporate governance code, which was 
issued in september 2012. the main principles of the code are:
Leadership
Effectiveness
Accountability
Remunerations
Relations with Shareholders
the board has reviewed the company’s corporate governance processes and 
policies, and has concluded that during the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013 (the 
year) the company complied with the provisions of the code except as set out 
below.
provision b.1.1 states “the board should state its reasons if it determines that 
a director is independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships or 
circumstances which may appear relevant to its determination, including if the 
director: has received or receives additional remuneration from the company 
apart from a director’s fee, participates in the company’s share option or a 
performance-related pay scheme, or is a member of the company’s pension 
scheme”. keith hellawell, the group’s chairman, has the option to buy 50,000 
shares for the nominal value of £0.10 per share in the group on an annual 
basis. the board and r emuneration committee are satisfied that the additional 
remuneration does not impair his independence. this year, as with last year, 
keith hellawell has opted to waive his right to take the shares.
THE BOARD
the board consists of a non-executive chairman, keith hellawell, the deputy 
chairman, mike ashley, two other executive directors, and four further non-
executive directors. the names, skills and short biographies of each member of 
the board are set out on pages 34 and 35.
the size and composition of the board are regularly reviewed by the board to 
ensure that there is the appropriate balance of skills and experience.
Role of the Board 
the role of the board is to ensure the overall long-term success of the group. 
this is achieved through the review, development and implementation of 
the group’s strategy. the board also maintains responsibility for corporate 
responsibility, accountability and to ensure effective leadership is delegated to 
management for the day to day running of the group and ensures an appropriate 
strategy is in place for succession planning.
the board has a programme in place to enable it to discharge its responsibility 
of providing effective and entrepreneurial leadership to the group within a 
framework of prudent and effective controls.
the board plans to meet on a formal basis six times during the year with up to 
four additional strategy meetings at convenient times throughout the year when 
broader issues concerning the strategic future of the group will be discussed. 
the board will meet on other occasions as and when the business demands. 
during the year the board met on five occasions.
the group is committed to high standards of corporate governance. the following section will detail how the uk corporate 
governance code has been applied during the year.

the business r eview Management & Governance financial statements & notes additional information THE BOARD continued
a detailed agenda is established for each meeting, and appropriate 
documentation is provided to directors in advance of the meeting. r egular  
board meetings provide an agenda that will include reports from the chief 
executive, the group finance director, reports on the performance of the 
business and current trading, reports on meetings with investors, reports from 
committees of the board and specific proposals where the approval of the board 
is sought. the board will monitor and question monthly performance and review 
anticipated results.
presentations are also given on business or strategic issues where appropriate, 
and the board will consider at least annually the strategy for the group. minutes

the board, unless a conflict of interest arises, to enable all directors to have 
oversight of those matters delegated to committees, and copies of analysts’ 
reports and brokers’ notes are provided to directors.
it is the responsibility of the directors to ensure that the accounts are prepared 
and submitted. having assessed the current annual r eport, along with the 
accounts, the directors confirm that, taken as a whole, they are fair, balanced 
and understandable. the directors authorise that these documents provide 
the necessary information in order for shareholders to assess the group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

The Chairman and Executive Directors 
the division of responsibilities between the non-executive chairman, the 
executive deputy chairman and the chief executive is in writing and has been 
agreed by the board however they work closely together to ensure effective 
decision-making and the successful delivery of the group’s strategy.
the chairman is responsible for leadership of the board, ensuring its 
effectiveness and that all directors are able to play a full part in the activities of 
the company. he ensures that the directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information. the chairman officiates effective communication with shareholders 
and that the board understands the views of major investors, and is available to 
provide advice and support to members of the executive team.
the executive deputy chairman is an ambassador for the company. he takes 
the lead in the strategic development of the company, formulating the vision and 
strategy which he does in conjunction with the chief executive.
the company has entered into a r elationship agreement with mike ashley, the 
executive deputy chairman, whose wholly owned company, mash holdings 
limited, currently holds approximately 64.40% of the issued share capital of 
the company (excluding treasury shares). this agreement is described in the 
directors’ r eport on pages 38 to 39.
the chief executive is responsible for the running of the group’s business for 
the delivery of the strategy, leading the management team and implementing 
specific decisions made by the board to help meet shareholder expectations. 
the chief executive reports to each board meeting on all material matters 
affecting the group’s performance. no one individual has unfettered power  
of decision.
given the structure of the board, the fact that the chairman and chief executive 
roles are fulfilled by two separate individuals and the terms of the r elationship 
agreement with mike ashley, the board believes that no individual or small 
group of individuals can dominate the board’s decision making.
The Non-Executive Directors 
the board consists of four non-executive directors and the chairman. the role 
of the non-executive directors is to understand the group in its entirety and 
constructively challenge strategy and management performance, set executive 
remuneration levels and ensure an appropriate succession planning strategy is 
in place. they must also ensure they are satisfied with the accuracy of financial 
information and that thorough risk management processes are in place.
the non-executive directors have excellent experience from a wide range of 
sectors. the non-executive directors assist the board with issues such as 
governance, internal control, remuneration and risk management.
simon bentley is the senior independent non-executive director. he supports 
the chairman and non-executive directors and is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns.
The Non-Executive Directors – External Appointments 
non-executive directors are required to disclose prior appointments and other 
significant commitments to the board and are required to inform the board 
of any changes to or additional commitments. details of the non-executives 
directors external appointments can be found on pages 36 and 37.
before accepting new appointments non-executive directors are required to 
obtain approval from the chairman, and the chairman requires the approval of 
the whole board. it is essential that no appointment causes a conflict of interest 
or jeopardises the non-executive director’s commitment and time spent with 
the group in their existing appointment.
The Non-Executive Directors – Independence 
the group considers the non-executive directors to be independent in 
accordance with the 2012 uk corporate governance code.
claire Jenkins had been a consultant for the company on an ad hoc basis for 
approximately fifteen days each year between 2007 and 2010. notwithstanding 
this involvement, the board still believes that she is independent in character 
and judgement.
Executive and Non-Executive Directors - Conflicts of Interest 
the board has set procedures to deal with directors’ conflicts of interest that 
arise. during the year the board reviewed and, where appropriate, approved 
certain situational conflicts of interest that were reported to it by directors, and 
a register of those situational conflicts is maintained and reviewed. the board 
noted any transactional conflicts of interest concerning directors that arose and 
were declared. no director took part in the discussion or determination of any 
matter in respect of which he had disclosed a transactional conflict of interest.

and each director and each board committee may take independent professional 
advice at the company’s expense, subject to prior notification to the other 
non-executive directors and the company secretary. the company maintains 
appropriate directors and officers insurance.
Executive and Non-Executive Directors - Performance Evaluation 
there is a formal process in place for the performance evaluation of the board, 
its committees and individual directors. each director is given the opportunity 
to express their views on the organisation and operation of the board and its 
committees, their effectiveness and contribution to the business, and on any 
other matter they consider relevant.
the chairman holds regular development reviews with each director and an 
internal board evaluation was facilitated by the chairman who provided the 
other members of the board with a confidential questionnaire. the findings were 
presented to the board.
the evaluation did not highlight any areas of concern and the directors are 
satisfied the board and its committees are operating effectively.
the board and the nomination committee will consider the output from the 
evaluation programme in their evaluation of the skills, knowledge and experience 
of the board, and in formulating development plans.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
attendance at meetings of committees is set out on page 43. 
directors who served on the committee during the y ear were: 
 
simon bentley (chairman)
dave singleton 
charles mccreevy
claire Jenkins
simon bentley, the chairman of the audit committee is a chartered accountant, 
has relevant financial experience and is supported by the rest of the committee. 
all of the members of the committee are considered independent, ensuring that 
the interests of the shareholders are properly protected in relation to financial 
reporting and internal control.
in addition to the committee members, the external auditors are invited to 
attend meetings of the committee, save for those parts of any meeting when the 
committee reviews the performance of the auditors and when the committee is 
having separate discussions with the group finance director, who also attends 
when requested. the committee meets the auditors in the absence of executive 
management at least twice a year and the chairman of the audit committee 
meets with the auditors as and when it is needed.
where requested by the board, the audit committee can provide advice on 
whether the annual r eport and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.
the committee met on three occasions during the y ear. the audit committee 
will meet not less than three times a year: this could be increased depending on 
the group’s requirements.
the committee’s programme is pre-planned to ensure that each aspect of its 
responsibilities is discharged as part of an annual cycle during the company’s 
financial year.
The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee include:
• assisting the board with the discharge of its responsibilities in relation to 
internal and external audits and controls. 
• agreeing the scope of the annual audit and the annual audit plan and 
monitoring the same.
• r eviewing and monitoring the independence of the external auditors and 
relationships with them and in particular agreeing and monitoring the extent 
of the non-audit work that may be undertaken.
• monitoring, making judgements and recommendations on the financial 
reporting process and the integrity and clarity of the group’s financial 
statements.
• r eviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control and risk 
management policies and systems in place.
• monitoring the audit of the annual and consolidated accounts.
• r eporting to the board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
What has the Committee done during the year? 
• monitored the effectiveness of internal controls, and also considered the 
current economic climate and its likely impact on the group.
• considered the reappointment of the auditors.
• r eviewed accounting policies, presentations and the financial statements.
• approved policy for non-audit work.
on an annual basis, the audit committee considers the reappointment of the 
auditors and their remuneration and makes recommendations to the board. the 
auditors are appointed each year at the annual general meeting. the committee 
consider the level of service provided by the auditors and their independence.
the committee recommend the reappointment of grant thornton uk llp for 
fy14. the committee believes their independence, the objectivity of the external 
audit and the effectiveness of the audit process is safeguarded and remains 
strong. this is displayed through their robust internal processes, their continuing 
challenge, their focused reporting and their discussions with both management 
and the audit committee.
to maintain the objectivity of the audit process, the external auditors are 
required to rotate audit partners for the group audit every five years and the 
current lead partner has been in place for four years. under the corporate 
governance code 2012, audit services must be put to tender at least every  
ten years or else we must explain why we have not done so. our current 
auditors, namely grant thornton uk llp , have been in place since the listing  
in february 2007.
the committee has approved a policy on the engagement of the external 
auditors for non-audit work, in order to ensure that the objectivity of the auditors’ 
opinion on the group’s financial statements is not or may not be seen to be 
impaired, and has established a process to monitor compliance.
the policy identified three categories of potential work.
Auditor Authority Type of Work
w ork the auditor may not provide as 
completing the task could create a threat  
to independence.
the work includes the preparation of accounting entries or financial statements, it systems design and 
implementation, management of projects and tax planning where the outcome would have a material impact 
on the financial statements or where the outcome is dependent upon accounting treatment.
w ork the auditor may undertake with  
the consent of the chairman of the  
audit committee.
corporate finance services, acquisition due diligence, management consultancy and secondment of staff other 
than for the preparation of accounting entries or financial statements.
w ork the auditor may undertake. there are services that the auditors may provide as the work is clearly audit related and there is no potential 
threat to independence, including regulatory reporting and acting as reporting accountants. the company is 
satisfied that its policy falls within the requirements of the auditing p ractices board.

UK BRIBERY ACT
following the introduction of the uk bribery act, all policies and procedures 
have been reviewed to ensure that they comply with the act and measures are 
in place to prevent employees accepting bribes.
BUSINESS MODEL 
our business model, which sets out the basis on which the company generates 
or preserves value over the longer term, and the strategy for delivering the 
objectives of the company can be found at page 5.
WHISTLE-BLOWING 
the group has a formal whistle-blowing policy for employees who wish to raise 
any issues or concerns relating to the company’s or group’s activities on a 
confidential basis.
GOING CONCERN 
the company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the business 
r eview on pages 18 to 31.
the financial position of the company, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the finance director’s r eview on pages 
32 to 35. in addition, notes 27 and 28 of the financial statements include the 
group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
the company is profitable, highly cash generative and has considerable financial 
resources. the company continues to operate comfortably within its banking 
facilities and covenants, which run until march 2015. the company is well-
placed to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise. 
as a consequence, the directors believe that the company is well-placed 
to manage its business risks successfully despite the continued uncertain 
economic outlook. the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
the board recognise the importance of communicating with shareholders. this 
is done through the annual r eport and financial statements, interim statements 
and trading updates. all directors are available at the annual general meeting 
when shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions.
the chairman, chief executive and finance director regularly meet with the 
company’s institutional shareholders to discuss the group’s strategy and 
financial performance within the constraints of information already available to 
the public. the senior independent non-executive director is also available to 
meet with shareholders.
keith hellawell, david singleton and claire Jenkins met with shareholders and 
institutions to discuss various topics throughout the year and to gain a better 
understanding of the views of shareholders.
the company’s website is an important method of communication and holds 
all material information reported to the london stock exchange together with 
copies of financial reports, interim management statements and trading updates.
REMUNERATION
the r emuneration committee is responsible for determining and reviewing 
remuneration policy and setting remuneration levels. see r emuneration r eport 
on pages 47 to 50.
SHARE DEALING CODE 
the group has adopted the model code as published in the uk listing rules.
anyone deemed to have ‘insider information’ must seek consent before dealing 
in the group’s shares.
the executive directors require the consent of the chairman or the senior 
independent director and the chairman requires consent from the chief 
executive and the senior independent non-executive director. any other 
employees with ‘insider information’ must gain the consent of the chief 
executive or company secretary before dealing in the group’s shares.
details concerning the share capital structure of the company can be found in 
the director’s r eport on pages 38 to 40.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
the key features of the group’s system of internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to the financial reporting process and the preparation of the 
group accounts are set out below or cross-referred to other parts of the annual 
r eport where relevant.
the board of directors has overall responsibility for determining the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and for maintaining sound risk management and internal control 
systems, and for reviewing their effectiveness. the risk management process 
and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failures to achieve the company’s objectives. it should be recognised that 
such systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
ASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS RISK
a system to identify, assess, and evaluate business risk is embedded within 
the management processes throughout the group. strategic risks are regularly 
reviewed by the board. risks relating to the key activities within the subsidiary 
operating units are assessed continuously.
f urther details of the risks and uncertainties relating to the group’s business, 
and how the group seeks to mitigate these, can be found on pages 28 to 31.

Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
46  DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
the remuneration package for senior executives is highly performance-based, 
with the performance element paid in shares, which encourages the growth 
and long-term success of the group. the executive directors’ basic salaries 
have been set at a level well below the lower quartile for a business of the size 
and complexity of the group and have remained the same since 2002. senior 
executive salaries will not increase in 2013 / 2014. the senior executives enjoy 
no additional benefits.
the executive and employee bonus share schemes are closely aligned and 
reflective of the “one t eam” ethos. to drive sustained business performance, 
instead of granting smaller awards on an annual basis, larger upfront awards are 
granted which only vest if significant and consistent growth is delivered year 
on year. the extended time horizon for vesting of awards for the 2011 executive 
share bonus scheme is six years (in 2017). 
clear, published and stretching performance targets must be fully satisfied 
before any proportion of the share awards vest. aligned to the company’s 
performance culture, the executive and employee share schemes are designed 
on the basis that awards should vest in full for achieving the upper end of stretch 
targets (i.e. with an ‘all or nothing’ vesting schedule) rather than providing for 
a lower level of vesting for meeting a threshold target rising to full vesting for 
achieving the stretch targets (i.e. a scaled vesting schedule). 
in 2014 the r emuneration committee intend to raise the required shareholding 
value of executive directors to two times annual salary while employed by  
the company. 
the r emuneration committee strongly believes that this simple and transparent 
incentive framework is aligned with the company strategy for growth. w e 
believe that this remuneration strategy has also directly driven historic 
out-performance of the stretch targets set by the r emuneration committee, 
cemented a “one t eam” culture across all levels of the company, supported 
the group’s success and has clearly led to increased shareholder value since 
inception in 2009. in this regard, our remuneration arrangements are tailored 
to the culture and strategy of the company, take account of the current and 
forecasted economic climate, and are already providing a strong platform for the 
ongoing long-term success of the company.
this report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of r egulation 
ii and schedule 8 of the large and medium-sized companies and groups 
(accounts and r eports) r egulations 2008 (the r egulations) and of the corporate 
governance code.
the remuneration policy of the company is very closely aligned to its commercial strategy for long term profitable growth, its very 
strong employee performance culture and a reward ethos of “one t eam”.

THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
the r emuneration committee consists of simon bentley, dave singleton, claire 
Jenkins and charles mccreevy who are independent non-executive directors, 
and keith hellawell who is the non-executive chairman.
the role and main responsibilities of the committee are detailed in the corporate 
governance r eport on page 45.
attendance at the meetings held during the year is detailed on page 43.
ADvISERS
dave forsey, the chief executive, bob mellors, the group finance director, and 
mike ashley, the executive deputy chairman, have also advised or materially 
assisted the committee when requested.
REMUNERATION POLICY
the aim of the group is to achieve long-term success and increase shareholder 
value. this is underpinned by the main principles of the r emuneration 
committee to ensure policies and practices are in place to encourage 
performance which will in turn help achieve this success.
the committee has endorsed the provisions of section d of the uk corporate 
governance code, and has had those provisions in mind when determining 
remuneration policies for the past, current and future years.
the retail environment in which the group operates is highly competitive so 
the committee ensures that the level and form of remuneration is sufficient to 
attract, retain and motivate directors and senior managers of the quality and 
talent required to run the group successfully.
the remuneration policy for executive directors is highly performance-based 
which links the executive directors’ reward to the growth and long-term success 
of the group. all performance-based remuneration is paid in shares to align the 
interest of the executive directors with the interest of shareholders.
basic salaries have been set at a level well below the lower quartile for a 
business of the size and complexity of the group and have remained the 
same since 2002. during the year the performance-related elements of the 
remuneration packages consisted of participation in the executive bonus share 
scheme, although there are no other benefits. f ull details are on page 48.
mike ashley does not receive a salary for his role and has not received a bonus.
the committee consults major shareholders and representative groups where 
appropriate concerning remuneration matters.
the committee is at all times mindful of the company’s social, ethical and 
environmental responsibilities, and is satisfied that current remuneration 
arrangements do not inadvertently encourage irresponsible behaviour.
the committee has reviewed the salaries, other remuneration and other 
employment conditions of senior and middle managers throughout the group, 
and has taken them into account in considering directors’ salaries and the 
creation of new incentive schemes in order to create a sense of common 
purpose and sharing of success. the executive bonus share scheme 
performance targets mirror those to be applied to awards under the bonus share 
scheme which will apply to all uk permanent employees of the group in uk 
r etail, brands and head office on the same basis.
the committee is mindful that any bonus arrangements are balanced against 
delivering sustainable growth in earnings for shareholders.
the committee’s remuneration policy in respect of the non-executive directors 
is to pay annual fees which reflect the responsibilities and duties placed upon 
them, while also having regard to market practice.
47 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued
BASIC SALARY
basic salaries are reviewed annually. in the review in 2013 the committee 
decided again not to alter executive directors’ salaries. executive directors’ 
salaries have now been at the same level since 2002.
the basic salaries of executive directors at the y ear end and at 18 July  
2013 (the latest practicable date before the printing of this report) were  
as shown below:
At 18 July 2013 At 28 April 2013

dave forsey £150,000 £150,000
bob mellors £150,000 £150,000
 
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 
the committee has determined that no annual bonus scheme will be  
operated for executive directors while the executive bonus share scheme is 
being operated. 
ExECUTIvE BONUS SHARE SCHEME
the executive bonus share scheme was approved at the company’s  
annual general meeting in september 2010 to motivate and help improve the 
retention of the executives and to drive underlying group ebitda in line with 
group strategy.
subject to continued employment, each executive and two members of senior 
management will have the right to exercise their options to acquire one million 
shares each in the company from august 2013 as the company has attained the 
following targets:
• underlying ebitda of £195m (net of the cost of the scheme) in 2010-2011; 
and
• underlying ebitda /net debt ratio of 2 or less at the end of 2010-11.
a further executive bonus share scheme is currently in operation. each 
executive and two members of senior management have been granted an 
award of one million shares each which will vest if the company attains all the 
following targets: 
• underlying ebitda of £215m in 2012
• underlying ebitda of £250m in 2013
• underlying ebitda of £260m in 2014
• underlying ebitda of £300m in 2015
• individual satisfactory employment performance
the bonus will vest in 2017 subject to continuous employment to this date. the 
targets and vest dates are in line with the employee bonus share scheme.
in respect of each relevant year, the committee will adjust reported underlying 
group ebitda for the purpose of the scheme to ensure consistency in the 
calculation of underlying ebitda and to ensure that underlying ebitda is a fair 
comparison year by year, for example, by eliminating the impact of acquisitions 
where the cost of acquisitions is not reflected in underlying ebitda .
underlying ebitda is as defined on page 33 and is not at constant foreign 
currency exchange rates.
in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement (other than a scheme to 
create a new holding company for the company having substantially the same 
shareholders as the company) or voluntary winding-up of the company, share 
awards will vest in full following such an event to the extent the performance 
conditions have been met. if the performance conditions have not been met the 
awards will lapse.
PENSION
the executive directors are entitled to participate in a stakeholder pension 
scheme under which the company makes a contribution although they have 
opted out of this. 
SHARE OWNERSHIP POLICY 
the board believes it is important that executive directors have a significant 
holding in the capital of the company.
in order to participate in the executive bonus share scheme, there are current 
internal guidelines that the executive directors will be required to maintain a 
minimum level of shareholding in the company equivalent to one year’s salary 
while they remain employed by the company. however these guidelines can 
be waived with the permission of the board. the board applied their discretion 
during 2013 and allowed dave forsey and bob mellors to sell their remaining 
shares. permission to sell the shares was granted by the board as they had the 
knowledge that both dave forsey and bob mellors would shortly receive a large 
number of shares due to the vesting of the executive bonus share scheme.
the sale of the shares by the directors was reported in an rns announcement 
and also on the company’s website.
SERvICE CONTRACTS
all executive directors are employed on a rolling 12 month contract which is 
terminable by either party on 12 months’ written notice. the company may elect 
to terminate the employment of dave forsey and/or bob mellors by making a 
payment in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary that the director would have 
received during the notice period or, if notice has already been given, during the 
remainder thereof. 
details of the letters of appointment are set out below:

bob mellors 11/02/2007 12 months england & w ales 
any entitlement to benefits under any share-related incentive scheme is 
determined in accordance with the rules of that scheme.
each executive director’s service contract automatically terminates on the date 
that the director reaches such age as is determined by the board from time to 
time as the retirement age for executive directors.
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
48  NON-ExECUTIvE DIRECTORSHIPS
the non-executive directors enter into an agreement with the group for a 
period of three years. the appointments of the non-executive directors may be

the articles of association of the company. t ermination would be immediate in 
certain circumstances (including the bankruptcy of the non-executive director).

50  DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES and r esponsibility statement
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
the directors are responsible for preparing the annual r eport, the r emuneration 
r eport and the company and group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. under that law the directors are required to prepare the group 
financial statements in accordance with international financial r eporting 
standards (ifrss) as adopted by the european union.
the directors have elected to prepare the company financial statements in 
accordance with united kingdom generally accepted accounting p ractices  
(uk gaap).
under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
and profit or loss of the company and group for that period. in preparing the 
financial statements the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  for the group financial statements, state whether applicable ifrss have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statement;
•  for the company financial statements, state whether applicable uk 
accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the company and group will continue in 
business.
the directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements, and the 
r emuneration r eport, comply with the companies act 2006 and article 4 of 
the ias r egulation. they are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
the directors confirm that:
• so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the company’s auditors are unaware; and 
• the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
auditors are aware of that information.
the directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the company’s website. legislation in 
the united kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
to the best of our knowledge: 
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the company and of the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
and
(b) the management report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

51 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
EMPLOYEES
our people are at the very heart of our business, and as we continue to grow 
it is the skill and enthusiasm of our c. 24,000 employees that are key to our 
success. our ability to attract, retain and develop the best people is crucial to 
achieving our strategic objectives. w e have an established bonus share scheme 
that is applicable to employees at every level of our business, and robust training 
initiatives to ensure our employees best understand the essential role they play 
in driving the business forward.
Key Highlights:
total employees: 24,000
hours invested in training 40,000
 
Attracting our People  
in no small measure, the progress we continue to make is down to the 
dedication and expertise of our staff. w e believe that performance-based 
rewards motivate colleagues, help improve employee retention and align the 
interests of employees and shareholders. w e incentivise our staff by enabling 
them to share in the business’ success through the bonus share scheme. if the 
group reaches the ebitda targets (detailed in the table below) and employees 
performance is deemed satisfactory, eligible employees will receive sports 
direct shares.
2012: underlying ebitda of £215m
2013: underlying ebitda of £250m
2014: underlying ebitda of £260m
2015: underlying ebitda of £300m
 
approximately 27 million shares will be distributed between eligible employees 
upon successful completion of the scheme, c.6 million shares will vest in 2015 
and c.21 million in 2017.
Retaining our People 
employee retention is extremely important in order for us to retain expertise and 
measure employee satisfaction. for this reason it is one of our key performance 
indicators. this year 15.5% of our uk employees left the business, down from 
17% in 2012; the vast majority of them were from our stores.

the group also has several policies and systems to in place to ensure employee

Developing our People 
sports direct is committed to encouraging and developing our people. w e 
believe that offering the right training and development for our staff will not only 
help each individual progress, but will also enhance productivity and the overall 
customer experience. w e have invested significantly in training over the last few 
years, and in 2012 alone over 40,000 hours were spent on training at  
sports direct.
w e are proud to offer a great portfolio of training courses, all housed in state of 
the art facilities at our shirebrook campus. this ensures every member of our 
team has the opportunity to be inspired, stimulated, motivated and to be better 
in their role.
corporate r esponsibility is central to our vision to be an industry leader. our established corporate r esponsibility framework focuses 
on five key areas: employees, health and safety, the environment, customers and the community. sports direct has developed key 
performance indicators (kpis) to ensure we deliver on our commitments. these kpis are further discussed in this report and in the 
chief executive’s r eport and business r eview, and are based solely on our uk operations.

HANDBOOK
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
52  w e have extensive operational and skills training at sports direct, as well as 
general job performance and management development courses. our operational 
and skills training takes place in four specialised training environments at our 
shirebrook campus, focused on running, football, women’s and sku (sports 
knowledge underground). these specialised environments ensure that our staff 
are equipped with the most up-to-date knowledge to enable them to confidently 
advise customers on specific product choices, such as the most relevant trainer 
for their running style.
Nike Training 
our international nike academy is the only such facility in the world and offers 
an unrivalled training experience.
sports direct uses an online training programme in conjunction with nike, called 
sku (sports knowledge underground). f ull completion of the academy training 
programme means that staff have invested 15 hours of their time in learning 
about nike products, nike technology and how best to sell it. w e are the world 
number one in terms of the percentage completion for a multiple door retailer.
Key Highlights of Training Programme Include:
• 32 specialist nike training days have taken place since august 2010
• 252 staff have progressed to graduate level
• 64 graduates have also attended a bespoke post-graduate training day
• f urther product and graduate training will take place in 2013
adidas and Puma and Training 
w e also work closely with adidas and puma to create extensive training 
programmes to support in-store initiatives and products. in 2012, 358 people 
attended adidas sessions on product knowledge and selling skills. this year we 
opened new puma training rooms at our shirebrook campus and, throughout 
2013, will continue to offer training to capture new product releases.
Induction Training 
all of our managers attend a two-week residential induction programme at 
shirebrook to ensure that they are able to perform their job effectively. the 
modules covered consist of a mixture of shop floor-based training and classroom 
activities, and focus on merchandising, product training, administration, delivery 
process, health and safety, shop closure procedure and retail business skills.
Management Development Training 
w e have an internal promotion programme aimed at full-time staff and 
supervisors who are aspiring to move into management positions. as part 
of this, we hold a 5-day residential programme at our shirebrook campus 
which consists of a combination of trainer-led modules. the modules focus on 
operational training and the skills and behaviour measures that form part of 
an employee’s role, covering areas such as communication, leadership, and 
decision-making.
The Future of Training 
2013 is set to be another groundbreaking year as we work to develop a bespoke 
online training platform that will form the basis of every new starter’s induction 
to the business. designed to be informative, interactive and fun, the platform will 
be available on any mobile device and will provide knowledge, consistency and 
improved selling and service skills to all employees.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
sports direct is committed to appropriate standards of health and safety.  
our board has ultimate responsibility for health and safety across the group,  
and we regularly review our procedures to ensure safety management is robust.  
the continued emphasis on in the business has improved awareness of 
reporting and recording of incidents.
Key Figures:
• no environmental prosecutions or work related fatalities
• in fy13, 1854 (2012: 1711) accidents were reported to head office,  
of which 67 (2012: 65) were reportable to the health and safety executive
• 63% of accidents occurred in store and 29% were slips, trips and falls
the increase in accident figures has coincided with the increase in  
store portfolio.

nike t raining academy - shirebrook ENvIRONMENT
w e recognise that we have a responsibility to manage the impact our business 
has on the environment, and we are committed to reducing this both now and 
in the future. w e continue to comply with the government’s carbon r eduction 
commitment, and have identified key areas where we can make a difference, in 
particular energy usage in our stores, transport and waste management.
Carbon Footprint  
w e are continuously aiming to reduce our carbon footprint. the single most 
significant element is electricity, which makes up 83% of the footprint. the 
carbon footprint spread across all uk sites is detailed in the chart below.
Carbon Footprint Analysis 1st April 2012 - 31 March 2013
 
 
electricity 83.4%
diesel 12.9%
other 1.0% 
the effect of increased trading hours in the run up to the olympics has 
contributed to a small increase in energy consumption across 239 like stores, 
and therefore an unavoidable increase in the amount of electricity used. w e set 
our energy efficient benchmarks against fy08 year, compared to which we have 
made significant reductions of 25% across the like stores.
Energy Consumption Indexed on 2008 kWh per ‘000 sq ft

 emissions. the emissions declared are for the period 1 
april 2012 – 31 march 2013 in line with the crc protocol.
Waste Reduction 
w e are actively reducing the amount of waste we send to landfill and segregate 
waste to ensure that we recycle as much as possible. 
This year we recycled:
6,425 units of electrical equipment (2012: 5,546 units)
58 tonnes of waste paper (2012: 55 tonnes)
8,893 tonnes of cardboard (2012: 6,622 tonnes)
107 tonnes of metal (2012: 127 tonnes)
508 tonnes of plastic (2012: 453 tonnes)
all stores now use biodegradable carrier bags and provide the option of “a  
bag for life”. this is actively promoted in-store through high levels of  
employee engagement.
looking ahead, we will continue our commitment to minimise waste and 
improve energy efficiency across our stores.
CUSTOMERS
customer service is at the forefront of our business. w e aim to provide 
customers with an enjoyable experience both in-store and online and ensure all 
our products are safe and fit for purpose. 
monitoring customer satisfaction and responding to queries is a continuous 
process. all written complaints are recorded, including an analysis of the nature 
of the complaint so that trends can be assessed and appropriate action taken.
w e have an online customer contact form that reduces the time it takes for 
our customers to contact us and increases the volume of contact. online 
communication has reduced the amount of time it takes for us to respond to 
queries thereby increasing our service levels, while reducing the print and 
postage costs for both the group and customers.
w e are continuously working to improve customer service at all levels within the 
group from the retail stores, head office and through to our website.
COMMUNITY
Supply Chain  
w e are committed to responsible business practices in our own business 
and within our supply chain. w e continue to procure merchandise from 
manufacturers who have proved to uphold ethical employment and trading 
practices, and we have a strict code of ethics that we require every supplier to 
adhere to. the code provides for the fair treatment of workers, ensuring a safe 
environment in accordance with the local and national laws where workers are 
treated with respect and paid fairly for what they do. the code also ensures 
there is no child labour and no use of illegal means or materials in the production 
of goods.
w e have longstanding relationships with our suppliers who have demonstrated 
that their work practices are consistent with the sports direct’s standards. 
approximately 40% of our current suppliers have been working with the 
company for 10 years or more.
w e have worked with two leading supply chain companies in singapore and 
south korea for a number of years. using their local knowledge and experience 
helps benefit the business and the communities in which they operate. both 
businesses have the highest social and business ethics code which aligns 
with our own code of ethics, the bsci code of conduct (which is based upon 
the united nations declaration of human rights), iso9001 and the social 
accountability 8000 (sa8000) code.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EqUITY
for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013
the business r eview management & governance Financial Statements & Notes additional information
61 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
the consolidated financial statements of sports direct international plc (the 
“company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “group”) have been prepared in 
accordance with international financial r eporting standards as adopted by the 
european union (“ifrs”).
Basis of preparation 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with ifrs as adopted for use in the european union (including international 
accounting standards (“ias”) and international financial r eporting standards 
committee (“ifrsc”) interpretations) and with those parts of the companies 
act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs as adopted for use in 
the european union. the consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, as modified to include fair valuation of 
certain financial assets and derivative financial instruments.
Consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements consolidate the revenues, costs, assets, 
liabilities and cash flows of the company and its subsidiaries, being those 
entities in relation to which the company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies, generally achieved by a share of more than 50% of the 
voting rights.
on acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary 
are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. any excess of fair 
value of the consideration transferred over the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. any deficiency of fair value of 
consideration transferred below the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is credited to the consolidated income statement in the period of 
acquisition. the non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportion of the fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. costs incurred relating to acquisitions are expensed to the income 
statement
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included 
in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up 
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on 
transactions between group companies are eliminated. 
Associates and joint ventures 
associates are entities over which the group has significant influence but not 
control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the 
voting rights. 
a joint venture is an entity in which the group holds an interest on a long 
term basis and which is jointly controlled by the group and one or more other 
venturers under a contractual agreement.
the group’s share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included 
in the group’s consolidated income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the 
group’s consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the 
group’s share of the net assets of the associates and joint ventures, less any 
impairment in value. the carrying values of investments in associates and joint 
ventures include acquired goodwill.
if the group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds 
its investment in the associate or joint venture, the group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments on 
behalf of the associate or joint venture.
unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are 
eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the entity.
Investments  
a vailable-for-sale investments are initially recognised at fair value. where fair 
value is different to cost, this is recognised in the income statement on initial 
recognition. subsequent gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. when the security 
is disposed of, de-recognised or is determined to be impaired the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment within 
other comprehensive income. 
Acquisitions 
for business combinations achieved in stages, the group re-measures its 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value 
and recognises the resulting gain or loss, if any, in the income statement as 
appropriate.
Goodwill  
goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset and reviewed for 
impairment at least annually or when a change in circumstances or situation 
indicates that the goodwill has suffered an impairment loss. the need for 
impairment is tested by comparing the market value of the cash-generating unit 
(cgu) to the carrying value. any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. gains and 
losses on the disposal of a business include the amount of goodwill relating to 
that business.  
when the non-controlling interest of an existing subsidiary is acquired the 
carrying value of the non-controlling interests in the balance sheet is eliminated. 
any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is 
adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid is recognised directly in 
equity.
Other intangible assets  
brands, trade marks and licences that are internally generated are not recorded 
on the balance sheet.  acquired brands, trade marks and licences are initially 
carried on the balance sheet at cost.  the fair value of brands, trade marks and 
licences that are acquired by virtue of a business combination is determined at 
the date of acquisition and is subsequently assessed as being the deemed cost 
to the group.
expenditure on advertising and promotional activities is recognised as an 
expense as incurred.
no amortisation is charged on those brands, trade marks or perpetual/renewable 
licences with an indefinite life as the group believes that the value of these 
brands and trade marks can be maintained indefinitely.  the group carries out 
an impairment review of indefinite life intangibles, at least annually, or when 
a change in circumstances or situation indicates that those intangibles have 
suffered an impairment loss.  impairment is measured by comparing the carrying 
amount of the intangible asset as part of the cash-generating unit (cgu) with the 
recoverable amount of the cgu , that is, the higher of its fair value less costs to 
sell and its value in use.  value in use is calculated by using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have 
not been adjusted.
amortisation is provided on other brands, trade marks and licences with a 
definite life on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives of 10 to 15 
years and is accounted for within the selling, distribution and administrative 
expenses category within the income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment  
property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation less 
any recognised impairment losses. cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items. subsequent costs 
are included in the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the costs 
can be measured reliably. 
for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
62  all other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs, are charged to the 
income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment other than freehold 
land and is calculated on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis, 
whichever is deemed by the directors to be more appropriate, to allocate cost 
less assessed residual value, other than assets in the course of construction, 
over the estimated useful lives, as follows: 
f reehold buildings - 2% per annum - straight line
long-term/short-term  - over the terms of the lease - straight line 
leasehold improvments 
plant and equipment  - between 5% and 33% per annum - reducing balance
the assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed and, if appropriate, 
adjusted at each balance sheet date. 
the gain or loss arising on disposal or scrapping of an asset is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds, net of selling costs, and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment of assets other than goodwill and intangible assets with an 
indefinite life  
at each balance sheet date, the directors review the carrying amounts of the 
group’s tangible and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets 
with an indefinite life, to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
the impairment loss, if any. where the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit, (cgu) to which the asset belongs. with respect to 
property, plant and equipment, each store is considered to be a cgu and where 
onerous leases are noted the assets of each individual store are individually 
assessed for impairment.
r ecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in 
use. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
if the recoverable amount of an asset (or cgu) is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cgu) is reduced to 
its recoverable amount. an impairment loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in  
which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. 
impairment losses recognised for cgus, to which goodwill has been allocated, 
are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. any remaining 
impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cgu . 
where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cgu) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but 
so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset (cgu) in prior periods. a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement immediately. 
Revenue recognition  
r evenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or 
receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of 
discounts, returns and value added taxes.
in the case of goods sold through retail stores, revenue is recognised at the point 
of sale of a product to the customer, less provision for returns. accumulated 
experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of the 
sale. r etail sales are usually in cash, by debit card or by credit card. 
in the case of good sold on the internet revenue is recognised at the point that 
the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which is 
the point of delivery to the customer. transactions are settled by credit card 
or payment card. provisions are made for internet credit notes based on the 
expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of 
returns.
in the case of income generated from trade marks and licences, revenue is 
recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the relevant agreements or 
on a transactional basis when revenue is linked to sale or purchase volumes. 
Exceptional items 
the group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, 
those significant items of income and expense which, because of their size, 
nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate 
presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial 
performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods to 
assess trends in financial performance more readily.
Interest income 
interest income is reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest 
method. 
Government grants and similar income 
income from government grants that compensate the group for the cost of 
an asset is recognised in the balance sheet as a deduction in arriving at the 
carrying amount of the related asset. this is considered to reflect the true 
cost of the asset to the group. the amount is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement over the life of the depreciable asset by way of a reduced 
depreciation charge. to date the group has not received government grants in 
compensation for expenses charged in the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currencies  
the presentational currency of the group is sterling. the functional currency of 
the company is also sterling.  foreign currency transactions are translated into 
sterling using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
exchange differences of the company arising on the settlement of monetary 
items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income 
statement for the period. exchange differences arising on the retranslation of 
non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement 
for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. for such non-monetary items, any exchange component 
of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.  
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  
on consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a 
functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling at foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. the revenues and expenses of 
these subsidiary undertakings are translated at average rates applicable in the 
period. all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and documented in a separate component of equity.
when a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange differences that have 
been recognised as a separate component of equity are reclassified from equity 
to the income statement when disposal is recognised. 
in order to mitigate its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group 
enters into forward contracts (see chief executive’s r eport and the cash flow 
hedging accounting policy on page 65). 
Inventories  
inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. cost includes the 
purchase price of the manufactured products, materials, direct labour, transport 
costs and a proportion of applicable overheads. cost is calculated using fifo 
(first in, first out). net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price 
less all estimated selling costs. 
the business r eview management & governance Financial Statements & Notes additional information
63 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
the company receives trade discounts and rebates from suppliers based upon 
the volume of orders placed in a given time window and as a contribution 
towards marketing costs. where there is sufficient certainty that a discount 
or rebate will be received in the future that relates to historic purchases this is 
reflected in the cost of inventories.
Loans and receivables  
loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction 
costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost under the effective interest 
method less provision for impairment. provision for impairment is established 
when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. the amount of 
the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original 
effective interest rate.
Cash and cash equivalents  
cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, 
together with other short term highly liquid investments, that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
Trade and other payables  
trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. 
Deferred taxation  
deferred taxation is calculated using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. however, if the 
deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is 
not accounted for. deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares 
in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary 
differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will 
not occur in the foreseeable future. in addition, tax losses available to be carried 
forward as well as other income tax credits to the group are assessed for 
recognition as deferred tax assets. deferred tax is determined using tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted (or substantively enacted) by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
deferred tax liabilities are provided in full. 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be 
utilised. 
changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a 
component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate 
to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related 
deferred tax is also charged to other comprehensive income or credited directly 
to equity. 
Pensions  
the group operates pension plans for the benefit of certain employees, including 
both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. 
in relation to its defined contribution plans, the group makes contributions to 
independently administered plans, the contributions being recognised as an 
expense when they fall due. the group has no legal or constructive obligation to 
make any further payments to the plans other than the contributions due. 
in relation to its defined benefit schemes, the group recognises in its balance 
sheet the present value of its defined benefit obligations less the fair value of 
plan assets. the current service cost is charged against operating profit. interest 
on the schemes liabilities is included in finance costs and the expected return on 
schemes assets is included in finance income. 
the defined benefit obligation is calculated at each period end by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. the present value of the 
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and which have terms to 
maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liabilities. actuarial 
gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are reflected in the other comprehensive income in the period in 
which they arise. 
Borrowings and borrowing costs  
borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred, and subsequently at amortised cost. any difference between the 
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method. 
borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months from 
the balance sheet date. 
borrowing costs, being interest and other costs incurred in connection with the 
servicing of borrowings, are recognised as an expense when incurred. 
Provisions  
a provision is recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. 
the group provides for its legal responsibility for dilapidation costs following 
advice from chartered surveyors and previous experience of exit costs. the 
estimated cost of fulfilling the leasehold dilapidations obligations is discounted 
to present value and analysed between non-capital and capital components. the 
capital element is recognised as a decommissioning cost and depreciated over 
the life of the asset. the non-capital element is taken to the income statement 
in the first year of the lease where the cost it represents is of no lasting benefit 
to the group or its landlord. ‘ w ear and tear’ costs are expensed to the income 
statement. provisions for onerous lease contracts are recognised when the 
group believes the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease obligations exceed 
the economic benefits expected to be received under the lease. 
Leases  
leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. finance 
leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the 
leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. each lease 
payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve 
a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. the asset subject to the 
finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term. 
the corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included as a 
liability. 
leases of property, plant and equipment where the group does not have 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating 
leases. payments made under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. incentives provided by 
the lessor are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
minimum lease term. 
contingent rental payments, above standard payments, are conditional on 
the group’s operating performance derived from the lease item, (e.g. turnover 
levels). these are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
r ental income from operating leases where the group acts as a lessor is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
64  Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
the most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to 
purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the us dollar. the group’s 
policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with purchases denominated 
in foreign currencies by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, 
taking into account any foreign currency cash flows. 
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. where derivatives 
do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on re-measurement 
are immediately recognised in the income statement. where derivatives qualify 
for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
in order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document 
from inception the relationship between the item being hedged and the 
hedging instrument. the group is also required to document and demonstrate 
an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going 
basis. this effectiveness testing is performed at each period end to ensure that 
the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedging  
derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when 
they hedge the group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or 
a highly probable forecast transaction.
the effective element of any gain or loss from re-measuring the derivative 
instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
the associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive 
income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction 
affects the profit or loss. the reclassification of the effective portion when 
recognised in the income statement is the same as the classification of the 
hedged transaction. any element of the re-measurement of the derivative 
instrument which does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised 
immediately in the income statement within finance income or costs. 
hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
at that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. 
if a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to 
the income statement as a reclassification adjustment. 
Treasury shares 
the purchase price of the group’s own shares that it acquires is recognised as 
‘treasury shares’ within equity. when shares are transferred out of t reasury the 
difference between the market value and the average purchase price of shares 
sold out of treasury is transferred to retained earnings.
Employee Benefit Trust 
the cost of shares acquired by the sports direct employee benefit t rust is 
recognised within ‘own share-reserve’ in equity. 
Share-based payments  
the group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain directors 
and employees. these are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is 
expensed to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, with the corresponding credit going to equity.
non market vesting conditions are not taken into account in determining grant 
date fair value. instead, they are taken into account by adjusting the number of 
equity instruments to vest.
f air value is based on the market share price on the grant date. the expected 
staff numbers used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.  a share-based payment charge of £22,183,000 was 
recognised in selling, distribution and administrative expenses for the 52 weeks 
ended 28 april 2013. the key details in respect of the share scheme charges are 
set out in note 21.
the credit for the share based payment charge does not equal the charge per 
the income statement as it excludes amounts recognised in the balance sheet 
in relation to the expected national insurance contributions for the shares and a 
transfer of accrued national insurance contributions in respect of previous years’ 
charges which had previously been recognised in equity. the amount transferred 
is not material to the financial statements.
Equity instruments  
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities. equity instruments issued 
by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of any direct issue 
costs. 
Dividends  
dividends are recognised as a liability in the group’s financial statements and 
as a deduction from equity in the period in which the dividends are declared. 
where such dividends are proposed subject to the approval of shareholders, 
the dividends are regarded as declared once shareholder approval has been 
obtained. 
Materiality 
in preparing the financial statements, the board considers both quantitative and 
qualitative factors in forming its judgements, and related disclosures, and are 
mindful of the need to best serve the interests of its stakeholders and to avoid 
unnecessary clutter borne of the disclosure of immaterial items. 
in making this assessment the board considers the nature of each item, as well 
as its size, in assessing whether any disclosure omissions or misstatements 
could influence the decisions of users of the financial statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards (“Standards”) in issue but not 
yet effective  
at the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, the 
international accounting standards board (“iasb ”) and international financial 
r eporting standards committee (“ifrsc”) have issued the following standards 
and interpretations which are effective for annual accounting periods beginning 
on or after the stated effective date. these standards and interpretations are not 
effective for and have not been applied in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements:
• ifrs 9 financial instruments (effective 1 January 2015) 
• ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements (effective 1 January 2014) 
• ifrs 11 Joint arrangements (effective 1 January 2014) 
• ifrs 12 disclosure of interests in other entities (effective 1 January 2014) 
• ifrs 13 f air value measurement (effective 1 January 2013) 
• ias 19 (r evised), employee benefits (effective 1 January 2013)
• ias 27 (r evised), separate financial statements (effective 1 January 2013) 
• ias 28 (r evised), investments in associates and Joint v entures (effective 1 
January 2013) 
• deferred t ax: r ecovery of underlying assets - amendments to ias 12 income 
taxes (effective 1 January 2012) 
• annual improvements 2009-2011 cycle (effective 1 January 2013)
the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standard and interpretations 
in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of 
the group except for the treatment of the acquisition of subsidiaries in future 
accounting periods.

65 2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND jUDGEMENTS
the critical accounting estimates and judgements made by the group regarding 
the future or other key sources of estimation, uncertainty and judgement that 
may have a significant risk of giving rise to a material adjustment to the carrying 
values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: 
Impairment of goodwill  
the calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of 
goodwill requires a comparison of the present value of the cgus to which the 
goodwill has been allocated, to the value of goodwill and associated assets in 
the balance sheet. the calculation of present values requires an estimation of 
the future cash flows expected to arise from the cgus and the selection of a 
suitable discount rate. the key assumptions made in relation to the impairment 
review of goodwill are set out in note 15.
Impairment of other intangible assets  
the calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of other 
intangible assets with an indefinite life, specifically brands, trade marks and 
licences, requires a comparison of the present value of the related cash flows to 
the value of the other intangible assets in the balance sheet. the calculation of 
present value requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the other intangible assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate. the 
key assumptions made in relation to the impairment review of other intangible 
assets are set out in note 15.
Useful economic life of intangible assets  
for intangible assets which have a finite life, the directors revisit their estimate 
of useful economic life at each period end and revise accordingly. licences and 
trade marks typically have a life of between 10 and 15 years. 
Identification and valuation of acquired intangible assets  
on acquisition, each material, separable intangible asset is identified and valued 
by the directors with assistance from a professional third party. any such 
calculation is judgemental in nature as it is based on a valuation methodology. 
brand valuations are typically valued using the relief from royalty valuation 
methodology. 
the nature and carrying amounts of these assets are set out in note 15.
Impairment of tangible assets  
the directors review the carrying amounts of the group’s tangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. the key assumptions made in relation to the impairment review 
of tangible assets carried out in the period are set out in note 16.
Provision for obsolete, slow moving or defective inventories  
the directors have applied their knowledge and experience of the sports retail 
industry in determining the level and rates of provisioning required in calculating 
the appropriate inventory carrying values.
Financial position of retirement benefit plans  
the net defined benefit pension plan assets or liabilities are recognised in the 
group’s balance sheet. the determination of the financial position requires 
assumptions to be made regarding inter alia future salary increases, mortality, 
discount rates and inflation. the key assumptions made in relation to the 
pension plan are set out in note 24.
Provision for dilapidations and onerous lease contracts 
the basis of the estimation of the provisioning for dilapidations and onerous 
lease contracts is detailed in the provision accounting policy and note 26. 
estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience, external advice and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
where an onerous lease has been identified, the assets dedicated to that 
contract are impaired.
Calculation of bonus share scheme charge 
a share-based payment charge is recognised in respect of share awards 
based on the directors’ best estimate of the number of shares that will vest. 
the charge is calculated based on the fair value on the grant date, which is 
deemed to be the date on which the entity and counterparty reached a shared 
understanding of the scheme. the key details in respect of the share scheme 
charges are set out in note 21.
 
3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
the group’s current activities result in the following financial risks and set out 
below are management’s responses to those risks in order to minimise any 
resulting adverse effects on the group’s financial performance. 
Foreign exchange risk  
the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via:
a. transactional exposure from the cost of future purchases of goods for 
resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the purchasing company. transactional exposures that 
could significantly impact the income statement are hedged. these exposures 
are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as 
cash flow hedges. the notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in 
note 27.
b. net investment exposure, from the fair value of net investments outside 
the uk . the group hedges its international investments via foreign currency 
transactions and borrowings in matching currencies.
c. loans to non-uk subsidiaries. these are hedged via foreign currency 
transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally 
designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will 
naturally offset.
Interest rate risk  
the group has net borrowings, which are principally at floating interest rates 
linked to bank base rates or libor . the group does not use interest rate 
financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements. the 
group regularly monitors and reacts accordingly to any exposure to fluctuations 
in interest rates and the impact on its monetary assets and liabilities. 
Credit risk  
the directors have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk 
is monitored on an ongoing basis. credit evaluations are performed on all 
customers requiring credit over a certain amount. the group does not require 
collateral in respect of financial assets. 
at each balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit 
risk. the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount 
of each financial asset in the balance sheet. 
investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made 
through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment 
criteria approved by the board.
Liquidity risk  
the availability of adequate cash resources is managed by the group through 
utilisation of its revolving bank and other facilities together with equity and 
retained profits thereby achieving continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
Capital management 
a description of the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
capital are included in note 27.

66  4. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
ifrs 8 - ‘ operating segments’ requires the group’s segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group that are regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources across each operating segment. 
the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the executive directors and the operating segments are identified as the store fascia or brand, in line with 
the internal reporting to the executive directors. 
sales and gross profit for each operating segment, as well as underlying ebitda , are the main measures used by the executive directors to assess performance.

13. EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM TOTAL AND CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EqUITY SHAREHOLDERS
basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year. 
for diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares, 568,971,942 (2012: 568,591,423), is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares under the group’s bonus share schemes, being 51,852,895 (2012: 67,161,036), to give the diluted weighted average number of shares of 
620,824,837 (2012: 635,752,459).

Underlying earnings per share 
the underlying earnings per share reflects the underlying performance of the business compared with the prior year and is calculated by dividing underlying earnings 
by the weighted average number of shares for the period. underlying earnings is used by management as a measure of profitability within the group. underlying 
earnings is defined as profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent for each financial period but excluding the post tax effect of certain non-trading 
items.
the directors believe that the underlying earnings before exceptional items and underlying earnings per share measures provide additional useful information for 
shareholders on the underlying performance of the business, and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally. underlying earnings is not a 
recognised profit measure under ifrs and may not be directly comparable with “adjusted” profit measures used by other companies.

the carrying value of goodwill and brands that are considered to have an indefinite life are allocated to the group’s operating segments before aggregation. with the 
exception of everlast, none of the individual cash-generating units (cgus) are considered material to goodwill or indefinite life intangibles (brands). the carrying value 
of goodwill and brands allocated to the group’s cgus, (as aggregated except in the case of everlast), is shown below:

brands (excl. everlast) 46,281 2,437
everlast 54,438 70,054
129,805 80,991
 
the group tests the carrying amount of goodwill and assets with an indefinite life annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying 
value might be impaired. the carrying amounts of other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication of impairment. 
impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amounts to the value in use derived from discounted cash flow projections for each cgu to which the intangible 
assets are allocated. a cgu is deemed to be an individual fascia, these have been grouped together into similar classes for the purpose of formulating operating 
segments as reported in note 4. 
value in use calculations are based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, representing management’s estimate of the long 
term growth rate of the sector served by the cgus.
for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
74  the key assumptions, which are equally applicable to each cgu , in the cash flow projections used to support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles with 
indefinite lives as at 28 april 2013 were as follows: 
 
UK Sport 
Retail
Lifestyle &

discount rates 11.85% 11.85% 11.85% 11.85% 12.00%
the key assumptions are based on management’s historical experience and future plans for each cgu . 
a reasonably possible change in any key assumption would not cause the carrying value of any cgu to exceed its recoverable amount. 
the intangible assets that have an indefinite life are brands and trading names and are considered to have an indefinite life on the grounds of the proven longevity of 
the brands and trading names and the group’s commitment to maintaining those brands.
all key assumptions are consistent with known external sources of information.

Associates  
the business activity of heatons is that of household, sporting and leisure goods retail. heatons operates in the r epublic of ireland and northern ireland. the directors 
do not consider that they have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of w arrnambool, the parent company of heatons, and so will continue to 
account for the company as an associate.
the remaining associates are not material in the context of the group accounts. 
the group’s share of associates’ assets, liabilities and income statement, which is included in the consolidated financial statements, is as follows: 
 
28 April 2013 (£’000) 29 April 2012 (£’000)

heatons has a coterminous year end with the group. there are no significant restrictions on the ability of associated undertakings to transfer funds to the parent, 
other than those imposed by legal requirements.
as stated in the group’s accounting policies the directors review the carrying amounts of the group’s fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss, if any. 
r ecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to these assets. 
indicators of impairment exist for certain of the freehold properties held within our associate. accordingly an impairment review has been performed in accordance 
with the above policy. 
value in use calculations have been prepared based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate of 2% applied thereafter, representing management’s 
estimate of the long term growth rate of the sector served by these assets. 
these cash flows have been discounted at a risk adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.9%.
no impairment charge has been recognised as a result of the review performed. 
Joint Ventures 
on 25 July 2011 the group acquired the remaining 50% of no fear international limited.

a share-based payment charge of £22,183,000 was recognised in respect of these share awards for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013, based on the directors’ best 
estimate of the number of shares that will vest. the charge is calculated based on the fair value on the grant date, which is deemed to be the date on which the entity 
and counterparty reached a shared understanding of the scheme. 
a number of employees sold their shares upon vesting to the sports direct international plc employee benefit t rust. the 2009 bonus share scheme has been 
accounted for as an equity settled share scheme. this has been decided based on the following:
• the rules of the scheme are that the awards will be settled in equity and this has not changed;
• upon vesting the company entered into a separate contract with the employees to buy their shares although the company only facilitated the sale of shares on 
behalf of employees; 
• the company only communicated to the employees that the company would arrange the sale of the shares, and not that the company would buy the shares;
• the employee does not have a choice of settlement under the scheme rules;
• upon vesting the default settlement option if an employee failed to notify the company was to receive the shares; and
•  there is no obligation on the group to buy the shares upon future vesting of the share schemes.

the dilapidations provision is the best estimate of the present value of expenditure expected to be incurred by the group in order satisfy its obligations to restore its 
leasehold premises to the condition required under the lease agreements at the end of the lease discounted at 4% per annum. the provision is expected to be utilised 
over the period to the end of each specific lease. 
the provision in respect of onerous lease contracts represents the net cost of fulfilling the group’s obligations over the terms of these contracts discounted at 5% 
per annum. the provision is expected to be utilised over the period to the end of each specific lease. p rovision is also made for the strategic rationalisation of certain 
properties. the onerous lease provision has reduced in the current year due to the closure of loss making stores, improved performance at other loss making stores, 
the sub-let of previously vacant space and a strategic decision to invest in other stores previously planned for closure. 
the unwinding of the discount on provision over time passes through the income statement.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
84  Fair value hierarchy  
the group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
• level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and
• level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable mark et data.
as at 28 april 2013, the only financial instruments were derivative financial assets and liabilities, which are classified as level 2, and a vailable-for-sale financial 
assets, which are classified as level 1.
(b) Derivatives: foreign currency forward purchase contracts  
the most significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the us dollar. the group’s policy is to 
reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward fixed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign 
currency cash flows. the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 
they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
the carrying values of forward foreign currency purchase contracts were as follows: 
 
28 April 2013 (£’000) 29 April 2012 (£’000)
f air value of derivative financial instruments - assets 17,965 4,356
the sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 
 
28 April 2013 (£’000) 29 April 2012 (£’000)
us dollar purchases 285,000 371,986
contracted rates 1.63 1.61-1.65
us dollar sales - (40,000)
contracted rates - 1.53-1.54
euro sales (44,031) (24,678)
contracted rates 1.13-1.14 1.13-1.14
at 28 april 2013 £285m of forward us dollar purchase contracts qualified for hedge accounting and the profit on fair valuation of these contracts of £15.6m has 
therefore been recognised in other comprehensive income. this amount is split between a profit of £15.4m recognised in the period, a gain of £2.5m reclassified and

(c) Sensitivity analysis 
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
the group’s principal foreign currency exposures are to us dollars and the euro. the table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the group’s reported profit 
and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the us dollar / sterling and euro / sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain 
unchanged. the figures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange 
rates moved as illustrated. the income statement figures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash flow hedge. the 
impact on us dollar related hedging instruments is included in equity.
positive figures represent an increase / (decrease) in profit or equity:

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
the table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the group’s reported profit and equity to a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other 
variables were unchanged. 
the analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions:
• for floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the  
whole year.
• fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
positive figures represent a (decrease) / increase in profit or equity:

Capital management 
the capital structure of the group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, compromising issued share capital, share premium and retained 
earnings and cash and borrowings.
it is the group’s policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the development of the business.
in respect of equity, the board have decided that, in order to maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under 
review, not to return any cash by way of a dividend at this time.
the board is committed to keeping this policy under constant review and that it would look to evaluate alternative methods of returning cash to shareholders when 
appropriate.
the objective of the bonus share scheme is to encourage employee share ownership and to link employee’s remuneration to the performance of the company. it is 
not designed as a means of managing capital.
in respect of cash and borrowings the board regularly monitors the ratio of net debt to underlying ebitda , the working capital requirements and forecasted cash 
flows however no minimum or maximum ratios are set. the ratio for net debt to reported underlying ebitda , excluding charges for the bonus share schemes, is 0.58 
(2012:0.68). the objective is to keep this figure below 2.0.
based on this analysis, the board determines the appropriate return to equity holders whilst ensuring sufficient capital is retained within the group to meet it’s 
strategic objectives, including but not limited to, acquisition opportunities.
these capital management policies have remained unchanged from prior year.

94  NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting policies 
these accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable united 
kingdom accounting standards. a summary of the material accounting policies 
adopted are described below.
Basis of accounting 
the accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
as permitted by section 408 of the companies act 2006, a profit and loss 
account of the company is not presented. the company’s loss after taxation for 
the 52 week period 28 april 2013 was £3,249,000 (2012: £2,015,000 loss).
Investments 
fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
cost represents cash consideration or the amount of ordinary shares issued by 
the company at nominal value after taking account of merger relief available 
under s612 of the companies act 2006 plus related acquisition costs capitalised 
at fair value.
Deferred taxation 
deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all timing differences, 
which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. no timing 
differences are recognised in respect of gains on sale of assets where those 
gains have been rolled over into replacement assets. a deferred tax asset is not 
recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefit in future is more 
unlikely than not.
deferred tax is calculated on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on 
tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies 
items arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. at the balance sheet 
date all monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the closing rate or at the rate of exchange at which the transaction 
is contracted to be settled in the future. all exchange differences are recognised 
in the profit and loss account.
Dividends 
dividends on the company’s ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the 
company’s financial statements, and as a deduction from equity, in the period in 
which the dividends are declared. where such dividends are proposed subject 
to the approval of the company’s shareholders, the dividends are only declared 
once shareholder approval has been obtained.
Equity instruments 
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. equity instruments 
issued by the company, with the exception of those accounted for via merger 
relief available under s612 of the companies act 2006, are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs.
Income from Group undertakings 
income from group undertakings is recognised when qualifying consideration is 
received from the group undertaking.
Related party transactions 
the company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in frs 8 and has 
therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with wholly owned subsidiaries 
which form part of the group.
Share-based payments  
the company has applied the requirements of frs 20, “share-based p ayments”. 
the company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain directors 
and employees of the company and its subsidiaries. these are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant which is expensed to the profit and loss on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest.
the expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations. a share-based payment charge of £22,183,000 was 
recognised for the 52 weeks ended 28 april 2013 based on the directors’ best 
estimate of the number of shares that will vest. £21,345,000 of this share-based 
payment was recharged to subsidiary undertakings of the company.

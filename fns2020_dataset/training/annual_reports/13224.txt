Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
Another record year
I am pleased to report that whilst the market
has become tougher in the ﬁnal quarter of 2008,
it has been another year of record results for
Regus. We have delivered post-tax earnings
of £114.9 million and increased our net cash
balance by over 100% from £101.4 million to
£211.2 million, despite having returned £36.3
million to shareholders, £37.5 million to the
banks and invested £69.5 million in growing
our workstation capacity.
Our business model remains strong, with
our results clearly demonstrating the focused
execution of our strategy for proﬁtable growth
and strong cash ﬂow conversion in rapidly
changing markets.
Financial performance
Group revenue has increased by 24.9% to
£1,077.2 million and gross proﬁt by 21.4%
to £305.7 million. Excluding the impact of new
centre growth the “like for like” improvement
was 14.1% and 14.7% respectively.
This increase was the result of our continued,
controlled blend of organic growth and targeted
acquisition activity, coupled with the impact of
currency translation, principally the strengthening
of the dollar and euro, contributing 40% of the
overall revenue increase.
Capacity growth
We have continued our measured approach to
growth and in the year to 31 December 2008
we grew our average available workstations
by 15.3%.
Our improved results were driven by average
occupancy increasing to 82.9% from 82.7%
in 2007 and revenue per available workstation
(“REVPAW”) increasing 8.4% to £7,029 from
£6,487 in 2007. Earnings (proﬁt after tax) grew
by 10.9% to £114.9 million and basic earnings
per share increased by 14.3% to 12.0p.
During the ﬁnancial year, we opened 112
centres for a total investment of £69.5 million.
Despite the ongoing challenges of the global
economy, we anticipate continuing to make
targeted investments to develop further our
market presence.
Dividend
Given our strong performance the Board is
recommending a 1.2p per share ﬁnal dividend
for the year. This will be in addition to the interim
dividend of 0.6p per share paid by Regus Group
Limited (then Regus Group plc) in October 2008.
Subject to the approval of shareholders at the
2009 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will be paid on
Friday 29 May 2009 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on Friday
1 May 2009.
Board
In order to achieve our objective of greater
international diversity at board level, the
appointment of three new non-executive
directors – Douglas Sutherland, Ulrich
Ogiermann and Lance Browne – took place
from October 2008. Douglas replaces Stephen
East as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
I would like to thank Stephen and Roger Orf,
who both departed Regus as non-executive
directors at the end of 2008, for their
longstanding service to the Company.

These results, achieved under difﬁcult
circumstances, especially during the ﬁnal
quarter of the year, reﬂect the continued
successful application of our business model
of sustainable, measured growth on a global
basis. We continue to demonstrate our ongoing
ability to return shareholder value with an 80%
increase in our dividend alongside £19.9 million
of share repurchases made during 2008. I am
also pleased to end the year with a balance
sheet reﬂecting a record level of cash, after
repayment of our outstanding debt, which will
enable us to further invest for the future in our
people, products and technology.
Through the ongoing implementation of our
core strategy of controlled, disciplined growth –
via both organic expansion in existing and
new markets and acquisitions – the Group
has delivered substantial workstation growth
in all regions during 2008. Average workstations
grew 20,322 or 15.3% to 153,260 during 2008.
The total number of available workstations
at 31 December 2008 was 159,121. If non-
consolidated workstations are also taken
into account, the total number of workstations
under management increases to 171,277.
We have seen the number of centres we operate
increase by 60 net of closures. New locations
include Karachi in Pakistan, Sharjah in the
U.A.E., St Petersburg in Russia, Fukuoka in
Japan and we opened our ﬁrst centres in Malta,
Monaco and Taiwan.
Strategy and objectives
In 2008, we have continued to adhere ﬁrmly
to our strategy – to continue to grow proﬁt and
cash generation through measured, sustainable
capacity growth.
Whilst we are acutely aware of the potential
impact of the current downturn, and the
unpredictability of its severity and duration,
the core fundamentals of our strategy and
current business model remain unaffected.
We will continue to seek to take the business
forward through disciplined growth, focused
investment for the long term, and through
keeping as nimble as possible in respect

Strategy
Our consistent long-term strategy is that of
measured, sustainable growth to maximise benefits
for our stakeholders.
Overview
Amidst a backdrop of deteriorating economic
conditions, I am delighted to announce a
ﬁfth successive year of record results, with
a 25% growth in revenues, a 20% growth
in proﬁtability and a doubling of our net cash
balance at 31 December 2008.
Chief Executive’s review
Focused on our priorities
Our strategy remains one of sustainable and measured development
Mark Dixon Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_7
Chief Executive’s review
of cost control and operational ﬂexibility. With
a steady adherence to our fundamentals, we
believe we are as well positioned as we could
be to face the forthcoming challenges of 2009.
The delivery of our strategy will continue to
come about through focus on our priorities;
• Brand and product development
• Systems and technology
• People and processes
Brand and product development
Our brand and market presence is strong,
enabling us to respond to a wide variety of
customer needs through a centre footprint
which allows us to be local, regional or global.
In short, we have the adaptability and agility to
be many things to many customers. However,
we recognise the need to continue to respond
to our customers’ needs and leverage further
the core quality and ﬂexibility of our products
which differentiate us from our competitors.
The launch of our Businessworld programme
in early 2008 has been a signiﬁcant success,
with membership expanding rapidly throughout
the year and now encompassing 200,000 card
holders who have signed up for one of four
unique Businessworld membership packages.
With external market research predicting that the
number of mobile workers worldwide will reach
one billion by 2011, we feel that we are the only
company delivering the right product in the right
place at the right time to help them compete in
the current economic climate.
We remain focused on highlighting the signiﬁcant
cost savings our clients can secure through our
product offerings.
Systems and technology
The roll-out of our internally developed,
inventory, reservation and billing system across
our worldwide network has now been completed,
with all of our centres utilising this technology
in their day to day operations (2007: 495 centres).
We are already seeing tangible beneﬁts in terms
of control of our business (notably in discount
and exception management) and in driving new
sales opportunities.
Looking ahead, we anticipate this system
being a key enabler in our newly established
Regional Service Centres, and the system is
being onward developed to ensure full integration
into operational improvements being made in our
centres (i.e. integration to photocopiers, telephone
billing systems, franking, etc). Wherever possible,
we are also seeking to integrate third-party
vendors into this infrastructure.

enable them to obtain signiﬁcantly more value for
money and ﬂexibility than a conventional lease.

• Business lounges, membership

Business centre leader
• 978 centres in 74 countries
• 159,121 workstations
Corporate outsourcing
• Training room
• Managed offices
We have also made improvements during
the year to our data capture and management
systems, which will form a stronger platform
from which to develop better, more timely
reporting. Some early-adopting centres are
already receiving daily activity and planning
reports to allow them to focus on daily
customer-focused priorities and enable quality
planning for the next one to two weeks ahead.
People and processes
The strong results in 2008 have been driven
largely by our 5,442 team members, and I would
like to take this opportunity to thank all of them
throughout the Group for their substantial efforts
in the year. Our results are a testament to their
hard work, diligence and commitment.
As we develop our business and invest for
the future, we recognise the importance of
enhancing skill sets through training and
development programmes. Ultimately, the
quality of our team members and their ability
to deliver high quality customer service remain
fundamental to the continued long-term delivery
of our business model.
We will continue to rely heavily on our people
and their enthusiasm, talent and focus to further
develop the success of our business, regardless
of external economic factors.
Change of residence and appointment
of three new non-executive directors
In successfully implementing our strategy of
diversiﬁcation, both geographically and in our
product offerings, we have developed a more
balanced global revenue platform.
The creation of a new corporate structure and
organisation for Regus, incorporated in Jersey
and resident in Luxembourg, has therefore
given us a chance to further internationalise our
business in keeping with our ongoing strategy.
Coupled with this, the appointment of three new
international non-executive directors further
enhances our global perspective.
Responding to market conditions
Whilst we have delivered a strong set of 2008
results, we anticipate that market conditions
will be challenging during 2009. However, we
have the potential to outperform our competition
by maximising revenue and cash growth whilst
keeping a tight control on costs, and maintaining
focus on our core strategy.
With respect to our cost structure, we will
continue to take early action to manage our
cost base in line with future trading expectations.
Our costs throughout 2008 have continued to
become less ﬁxed in nature as we increase the
number of ﬂexible leases in our portfolio and

reduce our exposure to longer, conventional
leases. In addition, throughout 2008 we have
continued to implement a number of cost saving
programmes throughout our organisation, which
we anticipate will continue to ensure we are able
to act with maximum speed and efﬁciency.
As part of this process, we have accelerated
plans to consolidate certain central and regional
administrative functions into a number of newly
established Regional Service Centres. We expect
that these will be fully operational in the next
ﬁnancial year, with a focus on reducing overall
costs and ensuring better integrated ﬁnance,
information technology and other support
functions across the Group.
Outlook
We are not at all complacent about the outlook.
In the last two months of 2008, the increasing
pressure that we were seeing on our revenues
translated into a softening in our occupancy
and price KPIs which has continued into 2009.
However, although many of the countries in
which we operate are experiencing increasingly
difﬁcult economic conditions, we believe that
we are taking the necessary actions and expect
to strengthen our current market leading
position. Our global footprint, strong balance
sheet and cash generation ensure that we are
well positioned to take advantage of appropriate
opportunities to increase shareholder value as
they arise.
We recognize that we will have to continue to
challenge ourselves to become more efﬁcient
and drive down costs, whilst at the same time
not losing sight of the need for continued long-
term investment in growing our business. With
a strong global brand driven by the stewardship
of our customer-focused teams, a broad and
ﬂexible product range, and a business model
we have continued to adhere ﬁrmly to and
deliver upon, I am conﬁdent of our position to
meet the challenging market conditions ahead.

Performance
Our business in the Americas comprises Canada,
USA and South America and has 495 centres
across 14 countries, with our main business in
the USA operating 411 centres. During the year
we added 3,487 workstations from opening
new centres, which contributed to the increase
in the average number of workstations from
61,160 in 2007 to 70,173 in 2008. Acquisitions
accounted for 14 of these new centres, with the
balance coming from the opening of 25 fully
owned centres. The region delivered revenues
of £414.9 million – up 23.4% on 2007 – and
achieved an average mature occupancy of
86% through the year (2007: 86%).
Outlook
Looking ahead into 2009, we will continue our
aim to maximise yield in our existing centres and
look to grow our portfolio in key cities where we
have minimal representation. The trends toward
ﬂexible working practices and strengthening
environmental awareness will both act to further
increase the demand for our product.

Performance
Our business in EMEA encompasses 240 centres
across 43 countries. During the year we added
1,753 workstations from opening new centres,
which contributed to the increase in the average
number of workstations from 29,125 in 2007
to 32,352 in 2008. Acquisitions accounted for
six of these new centres, with the balance of 29
coming from new centre growth – 20 fully owned
centres, one joint venture and eight managed
centres. We opened centres in two new markets
– Malta and Monaco. The region delivered
revenues of £319.2 million – up 32.8% on 2007
– and achieved an average mature occupancy
of 89% through the year (2007: 87%).
Outlook
Looking ahead into 2009, whilst continuing
to focus on margins in our mature centres we
will continue to look for low-risk opportunities
to expand our network into new markets.

Asia Paciﬁc
Performance
Our business in Asia operates in 112 centres
across 15 countries. During the year we added
2,047 workstations from opening new centres,
which contributed to the increase in the average
number of workstations from 14,748 in 2007 to
19,836 in 2008. Acquisitions accounted for one
of these new centres, with the balance coming
from the opening of 21 fully owned centres.
During the year, we opened one centre in the
new market of Taiwan. The region delivered
revenues of £121.0 million – up 55.7% on 2007 –
and achieved an average mature occupancy
of 82% through the year (2007: 80%).
Outlook
Looking ahead into 2009 we will continue to
consolidate and develop our position as the
largest provider of serviced ofﬁces across all
Asia Paciﬁc markets. To achieve this objective
we intend to continue our measured growth
plan while continuing to focus on the operational
effectiveness of our current portfolio of centres.
To facilitate this, we will be adding a new
customer service centre in the Philippines to
handle all customer administration in the region.

Directors’ Report Business Review
16_www.regus.com
The business model continued to work well.
In addition to seeing increased proﬁts from the
sites we opened and acquired in 2007 we have
continued to see the proﬁts in our older more
mature sites improve. This has enabled us to
both grow the strength of our balance sheet
whilst at the same time continue our expansion
programme which then forms the basis for future
proﬁtable growth.
Taking the business as a whole, we grew its
capacity as measured by the weighted average
number of workstations by 15.3% to 153,260.
At the same time the average occupancy of
these workstations increased from 82.7% to
82.9% and we sold each one on average for
8.1% more.
These factors have delivered a £24.8 million
increase in operating proﬁt rising from £122.6
million in 2007 to £147.4 million in 2008.
Revenue and gross proﬁt (centre contribution)
Revenue for the Group rose 24.9% to £1,077.2
million (2007: £862.4 million) and gross proﬁt
(centre contribution) increased 21.4% to £305.7
million (2007: £251.9 million).
This movement can be analysed as follows:

Sterling weakened in value against the US dollar
by an average of 8.1% and against the euro by
an average of 14.2% in 2008 when compared
to 2007. This increased our revenue by £86.3
million and contribution by £26.9 million.
Our mature, or “like for like”, business increased
its revenues by £33.2 million and its contribution
by £9.9 million driven by improvements in
occupancy and price.
Centres that were added in 2007 contributed a
further £75.9 million of revenue and £31.1 million
of contribution.
New centres added in 2008, both organic and
by acquisition, contributed a further £33.4 million
of revenue but reduced contribution by £10.3
million due to the normal start-up losses incurred
in establishing new centres.
The year on year impact of centre closures
was to reduce revenue by £14.0 million and
contribution by £3.8 million.
Taking all this together, contribution margins
decreased from 29.2% to 28.4%.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by £29.0
million in 2008 compared to 2007 (£18.5 million
excluding the impact of exchange). However,
as a proportion of revenue, they reduced from
15.0% in 2007 to 14.7% in 2008.
Included within administrative expenses were
the £4.8 million costs incurred on the Group
reorganisation and Scheme of Arrangement
completed in October 2008. Excluding these
one-off exceptional costs, overheads were
14.2% of revenues.
This falling percentage was achieved even
though the Group continued to invest in its
systems and processes.
Operating proﬁt
Operating proﬁt was £147.4 million (2007:
£122.6 million), representing a margin of
13.7% (2007: 14.2%).
Share of proﬁt in joint ventures
In the twelve months ended 31 December 2008,
the share of joint venture proﬁts attributable
to Regus increased to £2.3 million (2007: £0.8
million proﬁt). This reﬂected the improving
proﬁtability in mature joint ventures in the
Americas and EMEA regions as well as improved
performance from more recently opened joint
ventures in the Middle East.
Net ﬁnancing costs
Net ﬁnancing costs can be analysed as follows:
(£ million) 2008 2007
Interest payable on bank loans (3.5) (4.4)
Interest receivable 5.3 3.4
Finance lease interest (0.2) (0.2)
Non-cash: Amortisation
of deferred ﬁnancing fees (0.6) (0.5)
Non-cash: UK acquisition related (1.5) (2.3)
Total net ﬁnancing costs (0.5) (4.0)
The lower interest payable reﬂects the reduction
in the Group’s average debt over the year and
the impact of falling interest rates in the Group’s
primary markets. The average Libor rate for
2007 was 5.85% compared to 5.04% for 2008.
The substantial increase in interest receivable
reﬂects a continued increase in the Group’s
average free cash balance to £150.3 million
(£81.4 million in 2007). In addition, improvements
in the management of the Group’s cash partially
offset the impact of falling global interest rates
during the year.
The movement in the cash balance has been
explained in the cash ﬂow section below.
Underlying ﬁnance lease costs remained
unchanged as the maturing of older leases have
been offset by new leases. The amortisation of
deferred ﬁnancing fees relates to loan arrangement
costs incurred for the new credit facilities entered
into during 2006 to fund the UK acquisition and
include a £0.1 million impact from accelerated
amortisation resulting from the early repayment
of the Group’s debt under the credit facility.
Financial review Directors’ Report Business Review
18_www.regus.com
The unwinding of discounted fair value
adjustments on the Regus UK acquisition
resulted in a non-cash net ﬁnancing charge of
£1.5 million in the period to 31 December 2008
compared to £2.3 million in 2007. The decrease
was as a result of a one-off credit of £0.8 million
arising from the accelerated unwinding of the
discounting resulting from the partial waiver
of a loan with a joint venture.
Following an internal review of our facility
arrangements in March 2009 and given the
strength of the Group’s cash position, the
Board has approved the early surrender of
our £100 million revolving credit facility. On an
annualised basis this will save £0.9 million of
ﬁnancing costs. Going forward we will utilise
our cash resources to support the letters of credit
which were previously covered by our facility.
Taxation
The continued improvements in the Group
results have meant that there are less
unrecognised losses available to be offset in
the income statement against rising current
tax charges. Consequently the Group has
recognised a £34.3 million tax charge for the
period (representing an accounting tax rate of
23% of proﬁt before tax) compared to £15.8
million (or 13%) in the comparative period.
The current tax charge for the period was £57.3
million (2007: £22.3 million charge) – an increase
from 19% to 38% of proﬁt before tax. Deferred tax
was a £23.0 million credit in the period (2007: £6.5
million credit). On a cash tax basis the Group paid
£31.3 million in tax. This represents approximately
21.0% of proﬁt before tax compared to 13.5% in
the same period in 2007.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share for the year increased
14.3% from 10.5p to 12.0p. The average
number of shares in issue during the year
reﬂected the share buyback programme in
2008 and therefore reduced to 950,319,978
(2007: 980,961,569).
Currency hedging
Given the continued volatility in exchange rates,
in January 2009 the Board approved a policy
which allows the Group to hedge, subject to
strict limits, the rates at which we translate our
overseas earnings. This will enable the Group
to have more certainty over the sterling value
of these earnings.
Goodwill
The Group has £274.5 million of goodwill in the
balance sheet largely arising from the purchase
in August 2004 of HQ Global Holdings Inc and
the purchase in April 2006 of the remaining
58% interest in the Regus UK business not
already owned.
While impairment tests at the year end on the
carrying value of goodwill indicated that no
impairment was necessary, given the relatively
high discount rates the market is currently
applying to our future cash ﬂows and the
need for prudence in a recessionary
environment, the headroom in these
calculations was low.
It is therefore possible that a future non-cash
impairment may be necessary arising from
relatively small changes in assumptions. Full
details of the approach taken and sensitivities
can be found in note 12 to the Accounts.
Cash ﬂow
Strong operating cash ﬂow remains a prime
feature and continued objective of the Group.
The improvement in operating proﬁt and
continued working capital inﬂows resulted in
the operating cash ﬂow increasing by £38.5
million to £249.6 million (2007: £211.1 million). Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_19
The strong cash performance has enabled the Group to invest in growth. Speciﬁcally, during the
year, 84 new centres were opened at a cost of £57.4 million. A further 28 business centres were
acquired for a net cash consideration of £12.1 million.
To highlight, during the year, the Group has:
• repaid to our investors £36.3 million through both our share buyback and dividend activity
• reduced our debt by £37.5 million
• invested £69.5 million in capacity growth
and still ended the year with an increased cash position.
This can be analysed as follows:
(£ million) 2008 2007
Cash and cash equivalents 219.5 142.9
Bank and other loans (5.3) (40.3)
Finance leases (3.0) (1.5)
Un-amortised ﬁnancing fees – 0.3
Financial assets 211.2 101.4
Overall the Group enters 2009 in a strong ﬁnancial position to meet the challenges of a difﬁcult
economic climate and capitalise on opportunities as they arise.

Financial review Directors’ Report Business Review
20_www.regus.com
Whilst mindful of the current economic
environment, we do not believe that this should
result in a diminution of our commitment to
corporate responsibility (“CR”). Our employee,
environmental, charitable and social activities
in 2008, together with continued plans in these
areas for 2009, bear this out, and we ﬁrmly
believe that our obligations are ongoing – not
only during more positive trading conditions.
Regus remains active in managing its corporate
responsibility, and we recognize that with the
evolving nature of our stakeholders there will
remain a continuous need to meet and exceed
our previous benchmarks.
The establishment, in 2007, of our CR committee
has allowed us to structure our direction and
communications more effectively regarding
our core employee, environmental and
social activities. There have been continued
developments in 2008 relating to employee
training, appraisals and career development
opportunities, and considerable time has
been spent re-aligning our sales training to
enhance focus on the customer. However, there
remain areas where we are keen to improve,
most notably the roll-out of more globally
consistent environmental guidelines and the
communication of an updated CR framework
with global applicability.
People
Fundamental to these goals is an ongoing
commitment to our employees, whose
engagement and focus are vital to ensuring we
continue to deliver successfully on our strategy.
With over 5,400 team members throughout our
global network, the majority of whom work
directly in customer facing roles, our people
remain the driving force behind the sustainable
growth of our business. We recognise the need
to continue to strengthen our teams, through
ensuring that our people feel valued, rewarded
and recognized for their efforts, that they have
career advancement opportunities and that they
are provided with quality training to allow them
to continue to develop.

Driving competitive advantage
Aligning our business strategy and the needs of our stakeholders remains a critical component
of the ongoing sustainable development of our business
Corporate responsibility Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_21
To this end, formal training during 2008 –
provided supplementally to on-the-job
development – has resulted in the following:
• over 2,500 team members participating in
classroom training, at a cost of £1.4 million;
• the completion of over 17,000 hours of online
training using the Brainshark learning
management system;
• the roll-out of worldwide sales re-training to
align our sales forces to the current economic
challenges faced by our customers; and
• over 400 team members trained as “experts”
on our new internal inventory, reservations
and billing system.
We have also continued to highlight to our
employees both our Global Code of Ethics
and our conﬁdential whistleblowing service. The
former encapsulates the core principles by which
all of our companies and employees are expected
to work, whilst the latter provides a service that
allows team members to conﬁdentially highlight
issues of concern or wrongdoing in the workplace,
with review of these identiﬁed matters at the
highest level.
Environment and sustainability
During the year, we have continued to highlight
to our stakeholders the environmental beneﬁts
that a number of our products and services offer,
most notably video conferencing (“VC”) and our
underlying worldwide network of international,
regional and local ofﬁces which can allow our
customers to materially reduce the amount
of travelling they need to undertake. Speciﬁc
examples of our environmental activities include:
• With increases in our VC business during 2008,
we have been able to build on the air miles
saved by our customers year on year.
• Distribution of our “Why Commute” leaﬂets
in a number of US cities, promoting the use
of our suburban centres instead of commuting
to city centre locations.
• Localised initiatives, including eliminating
printing out spare copies of invoices, reducing
paperwork in general.
• Considering centre environmental impacts –
our Atlantic Station centre is based in Atlanta’s
ﬁrst pre-certiﬁed Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) Gold high-rise,
low-impact ofﬁce building.
Within our ofﬁces, we have also continued
to encourage recycling on the part of our
employees and customers, and wherever
possible to incorporate low-energy solutions
into the day-to-day operations of our centres.
Community
We remain committed to supporting the
local communities in which we do business
through fundraising activities by our employees,
through providing ofﬁce space and ancillary
services or through more direct corporate avenues.
The introduction of the “Get Started” initiative
encapsulates one of the more signiﬁcant
corporate initiatives we have undertaken
recently. “Get Started” offers ofﬁce space and
practical support for start-ups that need help
getting off the ground. Under the scheme, we are
offering free use of business lounges and cafés –
worth approximately £10 million – in over 1,000
locations worldwide by signing people up to our
Businessworld programme. We anticipate that
the campaign could help many entrepreneurs
realise their business ambitions whilst mitigating
some of the risk.
Other causes which we have supported during
the year include:
• Great Causes and Debra via the 2008 London
Triathlon (over £25,000 of direct contributions).
• $20,000 raised in our US business through
considerable numbers of staff donating their
Christmas gift cheques to charity.
• Signiﬁcant numbers of staff-driven initiatives
to support local causes, such as providing toys
and presents for local children. More than 20
team members in the Chicago area helped
prepare and package freeze-dried nutritional
meals that were shipped to over 59 countries,
including the US, in order to feed malnourished
children. As a group, the team prepared 12,690
meal packs, which can feed 34 children for
one year.

Policy and practice on payment of creditors
The Group does not follow a universal code dealing speciﬁcally

• Ensure that suppliers are made aware of these terms
of payment.
• Pay in accordance with contractual and other legal
obligations.
At 31 December 2008, the number of creditor days outstanding
for the Group was 22 days (2007: 25 days) and for the Company,
36 days.
Going Concern
The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the Accounts on pages
41 to 81.
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation
can be found in note 23 to the Accounts on page 64.
Employees
The Group treats applicants for employment with disabilities
with full and fair consideration according to their skills and
capabilities. Should an employee become disabled during
their employment, efforts are made to retain them in their
current employment or to explore opportunities for their
retraining or redeployment elsewhere within the Group.
Political and charitable donations
It is the Group’s policy not to make political donations either
in the UK or overseas. The Group made charitable donations
of £0.1 million during the year (2007: £0.1 million).

Capital structure
The Company’s share capital comprises 945,019,822 issued
and fully paid up ordinary shares of 1p nominal value in Regus
plc (2007: 950,818,822 issued and fully paid up ordinary shares
of 5p nominal value in Regus Group plc). As at 20 March 2009,
the Company held 5,950,000 ordinary shares as treasury
shares. All ordinary shares, except treasury shares, have the
same rights to vote at general meetings of the Company and
to participate in distributions. There are no securities in
issue that carry special rights in relation to the control of the
Company. The Company’s shares are traded on the London
Stock Exchange.
On 14 October 2008, the Group completed a capital
reorganisation which resulted in the introduction of the
new holding company of the Group, Regus plc, a company
incorporated in Jersey with its place of central administration
(head ofﬁce) in Luxembourg and accordingly being registered
as a société anonyme. The ordinary shares of Regus plc were
admitted to listing on the main market of the London Stock
Exchange. The ordinary shareholders of Regus Group plc
acquired ordinary shares in Regus plc in the same proportions in
which they held Regus Group plc ordinary shares immediately
prior to the reorganisation and Regus Group plc became a
wholly owned subsidiary of Regus plc. The ordinary shares
of Regus Group plc were delisted from the London Stock
Exchange. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse
acquisition in the consolidated accounts and details can
be found in note 2 of the Accounts on page 45.
Details of the role of the Board and the process for the
appointment of directors can be found on pages 26 to 28.

Other information Directors’ Report Corporate Governance
26_www.regus.com
The Board is committed to the high standards of corporate
governance set out in the Combined Code published in
June 2006 (“the Code”) for ﬁnancial periods beginning after
1 November 2006. The Board is accountable to the Company’s
shareholders and this report describes how the Board applied
the principles of good governance. In its prospectus dated 8
September 2008 the Company stated its intention to voluntarily
comply with the Combined Code so far as it is practical for a
Luxembourg company to do so. There is no similar corporate
governance regime in Luxembourg applicable to the Company.
The Board
At 31 December 2008, the Board of Directors was made up
of seven members comprising the Chairman, two executive
directors and four non-executive directors. Biographical
details of the directors are set out on pages 22 and 23.
During the year, as a result of the Group reorganisation and
Scheme of Arrangement completed on 14 October 2008,
Regus Group plc ceased to be the holding company of the
Regus Group and a new parent company, Regus plc, was
created. The Board and committees of Regus plc after the
reorganisation were therefore treated as a continuation of
the Board and committees of Regus Group plc prior to
the reorganisation.
Role of the Board
The primary role of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial
leadership and to review the overall strategic development
of the Group. The Board approves the corporate plan
and the annual budget and reviews performance against
targets at every meeting. Through the Audit Committee, the
directors ensure the integrity of ﬁnancial information and the
effectiveness of ﬁnancial controls and the internal control and
risk management system. The Board has delegated authority
to the Remuneration Committee to set the remuneration
policy for directors and senior management. The Nomination
Committee recommends the appointment of Board directors
and has responsibility for succession planning at Board level.
The various Board Committees have authority to make
decisions in their areas of expertise.
Frequency of meetings
There were three scheduled Regus Group plc and two Regus
plc Board meetings during 2008.
The number of meetings of the Board and Committees and
individual attendance by the directors are shown below. Details
for Regus Group plc are for the period 1 January 2008 until
14 October 2008 and for Regus plc for the period 14 October
2008 until 31 December 2008.

Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for
its decision, to ensure that no one individual has unfettered
powers of decision. These include:
• Approval of regulatory announcements including the
interim and annual ﬁnancial statements.
• Terms of reference and membership of the Board and
its Committees.
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure.
• Changes to the Group’s management and control structure.
• Capital investment in excess of £5 million.
• Material contracts (annual value in excess of £5 million).
Minutes are taken of all Board discussions and decisions
and all directors are encouraged to request inclusion of any
unresolved concerns that they may have in the Board minutes.
Roles of Board members
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairman
John Matthews is responsible for leadership of the Board,
setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures
effective communication with shareholders and that the Board
is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates
both the contribution of the non-executive directors and
constructive relations between the executive directors and
non-executive directors.
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, is
responsible for ensuring that all directors are properly briefed
on issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and
timely access to relevant information.
The Chairman is not deemed to be independent because he
has been a non-executive director for more than ten years.
The Chief Executive
Mark Dixon is responsible for formulating strategy and for its
delivery once agreed by the Board. He creates a framework
of strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure the
successful delivery of key targets, and allocates decision-
making and responsibilities accordingly.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each bring their own senior level
of experience and objectivity to the Board. The independent
counsel brought to the Group by the non-executives enhances
the overall decision making of the Board. Non-executives are
Governance framework Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_27
appointed for an initial three-year term, subject to election by
shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) after
their appointment. The Board consider the non-executive
directors to be independent.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary, Tim Regan, is responsible for advising
the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters
and for ensuring that appropriate minutes are taken of all Board
meetings and discussions. The appointment and removal of the
Company Secretary are matters reserved for the Board.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain of its governance
responsibilities to the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration
Committees. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all of
the Board Committees and minutes of meetings are circulated
to all Board members.
The terms of reference of these committees have been
documented and approved by the Board and are available on
the Company’s website www.regus.com. A brief summary of
the members, activities and terms of reference of the Board
Committees is provided below.
Audit Committee
Douglas Sutherland (appointed and Chairman from
14 October 2008)
Martin Robinson
Ulrich Ogiermann (appointed 14 October 2008)
Lance Browne (appointed 14 October 2008)
Roger Orf (Chairman until 10 March 2008;
resigned 14 October 2008)
Stephen East (Chairman from 10 March 2008;
resigned 14 October 2008)
The Board has delegated the responsibility for applying an
effective system of internal control and compliance, accurate
external ﬁnancial reporting, fulﬁling its obligations under law
and the Combined Code, and managing the relationship with
the Company’s external auditors to the Audit Committee.
The Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors.
The Audit Committee meets at least three times a year. At the
request of the Chairman, the external auditors, the executive
directors, the Company Secretary and the Head of Risk
Management attend each meeting.
Summary terms of reference:
• Financial Reporting – provide support to the Board by
monitoring the integrity of the published financial statements
of the Group and any formal announcements relating to
the Company’s ﬁnancial performance and ensuring that
they comply fully with the relevant statutes and
accounting standards.
• Internal control and risk systems – review the effectiveness of
the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems.
• Internal audit – monitor and review the annual internal
audit programme ensuring that the internal audit function is
adequately resourced and free from management restrictions
and review and monitor responses to the ﬁndings and
recommendations of the internal auditors.
• External audit – the Committee advises the Board on the
appointment, re-appointment, remuneration and removal
of the external auditors. The Committee has the opportunity
to meet with the external auditors without senior management
being present.
• Employee concerns – the Committee reviews the Company’s
arrangements under which employees may in conﬁdence
raise any concerns regarding possible wrongdoing in ﬁnancial
reporting or other matters. The Committee ensures that these
arrangements allow proportionate and independent
investigation and appropriate follow-up action.
The Committee also meets independently with the Company’s
auditors and with the Head of Risk Management to informally
discuss matters of interest.
External auditors
KPMG Audit S.à.r.l. were the Company’s auditors for the
year ended 31 December 2008. For 2009, the Committee
has recommended to the Board that a resolution to re-appoint
KPMG Audit S.à.r.l. as the Company’s auditors be proposed
at the AGM. The Committee will continue to keep under review
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the
effectiveness of the audit process and the rotation of the lead
audit partner.
The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the
Company’s external auditor is monitored by and, above certain
thresholds, requires prior approval from the Committee to
ensure that the provision of non-audit services does not
impair their independence or objectivity. During the year,
KPMG performed statutory work in relation to the Group
reorganisation. KPMG is prohibited from providing services
that would be considered to jeopardise their independence
such as book-keeping services, valuations and system design.

Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have
an impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The Group
has a risk management structure in place designed to identify,
manage and mitigate business risks. Risk assessment and
evaluation are an essential part of the annual planning,
budgeting and forecasting cycle.
The directors have identiﬁed the following principal risks and
uncertainties affecting the Company. These do not constitute
all of the risks facing the Group.
Economic downturn in signiﬁcant markets
The Group has a signiﬁcant proportion of its centres in the
Americas (predominantly the USA) and Europe. An economic
downturn in these markets could adversely affect the Group’s
operating revenues thereby reducing operating performance or,
in an extreme downturn, resulting in operating losses.
Generally, the terms on which the Group earns revenues
from customers and pays its suppliers (principally landlords) are
matched to reduce working capital needs. However, a reduction
in revenues, with no immediate decline in the cost base, could
result in signiﬁcant funding shortfalls in the business. Any
funding shortfall may require the Group to seek external
funding or sell assets in the longer term.
In addition, competition may increase as a result of landlords
offering surplus space at discounted prices and companies
seek to reduce their costs by sub-letting space. These factors
could result in reduced revenue for the Group as the prices it
is able to charge customers would be reduced.
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this risk:
• The Group has entered into performance-based leases with
landlords where rent costs vary with revenues earned by
the centre.
• Building lease contracts include break clauses at periodic
intervals to allow the Group to exit leases should they
become onerous. In cities with a number of centres this
allows the Group to stagger leases such that an orderly
reduction in exposure to the location may be facilitated.
• The proﬁle of clients in a centre is continually reviewed
to avoid undue reliance on a particular client or clients
in a particular industry group.
Additionally, in the event of a downturn, the Group has
a number of options for mitigating losses, for example
by closing centres at lease break points.
The Group’s strategy also focuses its growth into emerging
markets that will reduce the proportion of the Group’s revenue
generated from the USA and Europe over time and provide
better protection to the Group from an economic downturn
in a single market.
Exposure to movements in property markets
A number of the Group’s lease contracts contain market rent
review clauses. This means that the costs of these leases may
vary as a result of external movements in the property market.
In particular, in the UK, lease contracts typically contain
“upward only” rent reviews which means that should open
market rents decrease, then Regus could be exposed to
paying higher than market rent in these locations.
If the Group is unable to pass on increased rent costs to
customers due to local property market conditions then this
could result in reduced proﬁtability or operating losses in
these markets.
Equally, for Group lease contracts without market rent review
clauses, the Group may beneﬁt from paying below market rent
in a market with increasing open market rents. This may allow
the Group to improve proﬁtability if the movements in open
market rents are passed on to clients.
The length of the Group’s leases (or the period after which the
Group can exercise any break option in the leases) is usually
signiﬁcantly longer than the duration of the Group’s contracts
with its customers. If demand falls, the Group may be unable
to increase or maintain occupancy or price levels and if revenue
declines the Group may be unable to reduce the lease cost
base. Additional costs could be incurred if the Group disposes
of unproﬁtable centres.
Exposure to movements in exchange rates
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas operations whose
businesses are generally conducted in the currency of the
country in which they operate. The principal exposures of the
Group are to the US dollar and the euro with approximately
38% of the Group’s revenues being attributable to the US
dollar and 19% to the euro respectively.
Given that transactions generally take place in the functional
currency of Group companies, the Group’s exposure to
transactional foreign exchange risk is limited. However, the
translation into sterling of overseas proﬁts and net assets will
be affected by prevailing exchange rates. In the event that
either the US dollar or euro were to signiﬁcantly depreciate
or appreciate against sterling, this would have an adverse
or beneﬁcial impact on the Group’s reported performance
and position respectively.
The ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies of the
Group, together with an analysis of the exposure to such risks,
are set out in note 23 of the Accounts. Wherever possible,
Governance framework continued Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_29
the Group attempts to create natural hedges against currency
exposures through matching income and expense and assets
and liabilities in the same currency.
Given the continued volatility in exchange rates, in January
2009 the Board approved a policy which allows the Group
to hedge, subject to strict limits, the rates at which overseas
earnings are translated. This will enable the Group to have
more certainty over the sterling value of these earnings.
Group reorganisation and restructuring
In October 2008, the Group entered into a reorganisation to create
a new Group structure. Reorganisations of international groups
can lead to a risk of a signiﬁcant tax liability. In addition, as a
result of the scheme, it is expected that Regus plc will be
regarded as tax resident solely in Luxembourg. If Regus plc
were nonetheless to be treated as tax resident in any other
jurisdiction, this could lead to an increase in the overall
effective tax rate and tax compliance costs of the Group.
As a Jersey-incorporated company having its place of central
administration (head office) in Luxembourg and being tax
resident in Luxembourg, Regus plc is required to comply
with both Jersey law and Luxembourg law, where applicable.
In addition, Regus plc’s ordinary shares are listed on the Ofﬁcial
List of the UKLA and admitted to trading on the main market
of the London Stock Exchange. It is possible that conﬂicts may
arise between the obligations of Regus plc under the laws of
each of these jurisdictions or between the applicable laws and
the Listing Rules. If an irreconcilable conﬂict were to occur then
Regus plc may not be able to maintain its status as a company
tax resident in Luxembourg.
The Group manages the risk that a signiﬁcant tax liability could
arise by taking appropriate advice, both in carrying out the
Group reorganisation and on an ongoing basis. In addition, the
Group believes that under current laws and regulations the risk
of irreconcilable conﬂicts between current laws and regulations
impacting Regus plc is low.
As part of the Group reorganisation, the Group announced
plans to operate an income access share (IAS) arrangement
for the payment of dividends. The Group expects that dividends
will be paid to Regus plc shareholders who make (or are
deemed to make) an IAS election through the IAS
arrangements. However, there can be no certainty that
dividends will be paid in this way and the IAS arrangements
may be suspended or terminated at any time and for any
reason. If the IAS arrangements do not operate shareholders
will be paid dividends by Regus plc which may be subject
to Luxembourg withholding tax. In addition, there is a low
risk that share buy-backs undertaken by Regus plc could
also be subject to Luxembourg withholding tax.
Centrally managed applications and systems
The Group has moved to a centrally managed applications and
systems environment with the resultant effect that all systems
and applications are housed in a central data centre. Should the
data centre be impacted as a result of circumstances outside
the Group’s control there could be an adverse impact on the
Group’s operations and therefore its ﬁnancial results. This risk
is managed through a detailed service agreement with our
external data centre provider which incorporates appropriate
back-up procedures and controls.
Internal controls
The Board has ultimate responsibility for maintaining a sound
system of internal control and for periodically reviewing
its effectiveness.
In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined
Code”, an ongoing process has been established for identifying,
managing and evaluating the risks faced by the Group. The
Group’s system of internal controls is designed to:
• facilitate the effective and efﬁcient response to risks which
might affect the achievement of the Group’s objectives.
• safeguard assets from inappropriate use or from loss or fraud.
• help ensure the quality of internal and external
ﬁnancial reporting.
• help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance
against material mis-statement or loss. The Group’s system
of controls helps to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide
reasonable assurance that potential problems will normally
be prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for
appropriate action.
Strategy and risk management
The Board conducts regular reviews of the Group’s strategic
direction. Country and regional strategic objectives, quarterly
plans and performance targets for 2009 have been set by the
executive directors and are regularly reviewed by the main
Board in the context of the Group’s overall objectives.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the risks faced by the Group. Major business risks
and their ﬁnancial implications are appraised by the responsible
executives as part of the budget process and these are
endorsed by regional management. Key risks are reported
to the Board and the Audit Committee. The appropriateness
of controls is considered by the executives, having regard to
cost/beneﬁt, materiality and the likelihood of risks crystallising.
Key risks and actions to mitigate those risks are regularly
considered by the Board and are formally reviewed and
approved by the Board annually.
Control environment
High standards of behaviour are demanded from staff at
all levels in the Group. The following procedures are in place
to support this:
• the induction process is used to educate new team
members on the standards required from them in their role,
including business ethics and compliance, regulations and
internal policies.
• all team members are provided with a copy of the “Team
Member Handbook” which contains detailed guidance on
employee policies and the standards of behaviour required
of staff.
• policies and procedures manuals and guidelines are readily
accessible through the Group’s intranet site.
• operational audit and self-certiﬁcation tools require individual
centre managers to conﬁrm their adherence to Group policies
and procedures.
Governance framework Directors’ Report Corporate Governance
30_www.regus.com
To underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the Group’s policy
to recruit and develop appropriately skilled management and
staff of high calibre, integrity and with appropriate disciplines.
The Group has also established an externally hosted whistle-
blowing channel to enable all staff to report issues and
concerns in conﬁdence.
Control processes
The Group has had procedures in place throughout the year
and up to 20 March 2009, the date of approval of this Annual
Report, which accord with the Internal Control Guidance for
directors on the Combined Code. These include the following:
• The Board normally meets with regional executives every six
months to carry out a wide-ranging review of Group and
regional ﬁnancial performance, business development
opportunities, Group infrastructure and general Group
management issues.
• The annual budget process is driven from senior management
meetings. Budgets are prepared at a detailed level by
business centre and roll-up at a country and regional level.
The executive directors review regional budgets to ensure
consistency with regional strategic objectives, and the ﬁnal
budget is reviewed and approved by the Board. The approved
budget forms the basis of business management throughout
the year.
• Operational reports and ﬁnancial reports are prepared and
distributed to the Board on a monthly basis. Actual results
are reviewed against budget and forecast and explanations
are received for all material movements.
• Key policies and control procedures (including ﬁnance,
operations, and health and safety) are documented in
manuals having Group-wide application. These are available
to all staff on the Group’s intranet system.
• The Board has formal procedures in place for the review and
approval of investment and acquisition projects. The Group
Investment Committee (comprising the executive directors)
reviews all investments prior to approval by the Board.
Additionally, the form and content of investment proposals
are standardised to facilitate the review process.
• The Group has clearly delegated authority limits with regard
to the approval of transactions. Purchase orders must be
obtained in advance for all purchases in excess of £1,000.
• Numerous reports are generated from the Group’s sales
and operating systems on a daily, weekly and monthly basis
to provide management at all levels with performance data
for their area of responsibility which helps them to focus
on operational issues that may require their input.
Information and communications processes
The senior management team is integrally involved in the
business and to this extent regularly discusses and addresses
issues and opportunities with regional and functional teams.
Formal business review meetings, chaired by Mark Dixon,
are held with the regional teams and functional heads on
a monthly basis.
Regular staff communications include general information on
the business from senior management as well as operational
guidance on changes in policies and procedures.
Sales staff and operational management periodically attend
regional sales or management conferences at which information
on operational issues is shared. Delegates present the key
messages to employees who did not attend the event.
Monitoring effectiveness
The following key mechanisms were available to the Board
at various times during the year in the conduct of its review
of internal controls:
• Review of the Group’s monthly management accounts
which contain detailed analysis of ﬁnancial performance
for the Group and each of the Group’s geographic
reporting segments.
• An ongoing process of review, through Board meetings,
senior management meetings and divisional reviews
as well as other management meetings, for the formal
identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant operational risks and mitigating
control processes.
• Internal audit reviews of key risk areas. The ﬁndings
and recommendations of each review are reported to
management and the Audit Committee.
• Quarterly post-investment reviews are presented to the
Audit Committee to allow appraisal of the effectiveness
of investment activity.
• A bi-annual internal control self-assessment and management
certiﬁcation exercise covering the effectiveness of ﬁnancial
and operational controls. This is based on a comprehensive
internal control questionnaire collated and reviewed by
Internal Audit. Results and any necessary mitigating action
plans are presented to senior management and the Board.
Other matters
Board Performance Evaluation
During 2008, a formal annual performance evaluation was
conducted in respect of the Board, its Committees and
each individual director by means of an internally produced
written questionnaire. This required performance to be scored
on a scale of 1 to 5 against a number of criteria with
1 representing a need for urgent improvement in performance,
3 representing adequate performance and 5 representing
excellent performance.
The results of these evaluations were consolidated by the
Chairman and presented to the Board for formal consideration.
All criteria were scored as adequate or better and
therefore no formal corrective actions have been initiated.
The independent senior non-executive director reviewed
the Chairman’s performance.
Training and resources
Appropriate training is made available for all new directors to
assist them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Training
is provided on an ongoing basis to meet particular needs with
the emphasis on governance and accounting developments.
Governance framework continued During the year the Company Secretary, Tim Regan, provided
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, whilst
the Audit Committee regularly considers new accounting
developments through presentations from management,
internal audit and the external auditors. The Board programme
includes presentations from management at which, together
with site visits, the non-executive directors’ understanding of
the business and sector is increased.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures, corporate governance and regulatory compliance
are followed and complied with. Should a director request
independent professional advice to carry out his duties, such
advice is available to him at the Company’s expense.
Directors and ofﬁcers insurance
The Group’s insurance programme is reviewed annually and
appropriate insurance cover is obtained to protect the directors
and senior management in the event of a claim being brought
against any of them in their capacity as directors and ofﬁcers
of the Company.
Dialogue with shareholders
Regus reports formally to shareholders twice a year, with the
half-year results announced in August/September and the
annual results normally announced in March. There are
programmes for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer to give presentations of these results to the Company’s
institutional investors, analysts and media in London and
other locations. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer maintain a close dialogue with institutional investors
on the Company’s performance, governance, plans and
objectives. These meetings also serve to develop an ongoing
understanding of the views and any concerns of the Company’s
major shareholders. The non-executive directors are given
regular updates as to the views of the institutional shareholders
and the Chairman is available to meet with these shareholders on
request. The principal communication with private shareholders
is through the Annual Report, the Interim Report and the AGM.
The Company has engaged the services of Brunswick Group
plc as their Investor Relations adviser.
AGM
The AGM will be held in May in Luxembourg and will be
attended, other than in exceptional circumstances, by all
members of the Board. In addition to the formal business
of the meeting, there is normally a trading update and
shareholders are invited to ask questions and are given
the opportunity to meet the directors informally afterwards.
Notice of the AGM, together with any related documents is
mailed to shareholders at least 20 working days before the
meeting and separate resolutions are proposed on each issue.
The level of proxy votes cast and the balance for and against
each resolution, together with the level of abstentions, if any,
are announced to the meeting following voting by a show
of hands. Substantial resolutions of the shareholders require
a poll to be taken.
Financial and other information is made available on the
Company’s website www.regus.com.
Re-election of the Board
All directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders
at least every three years and directors appointed during the
period are required to seek election at the next AGM.
Non-executive directors are subject to the re-election
requirements and serve the Company under letters of
appointment, which have an initial three-year term.
Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the provisions set out in
section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year ended
31 December 2008, with the exception of the following:
• Provision D.1.1 – The senior independent non-executive
director, Martin Robinson, does not have regular meetings
with major external shareholders.
The Board considers it appropriate for the Chairman to be the
main conduit with investors, rather than the senior independent
non-executive director. The Chairman participates in investor
meetings and makes himself available for questions, in person,
at the time of major announcements. The Chairman regularly
updates the Board and particularly the senior independent
non-executive director, on the results of his meetings and the
opinions of investors. On this basis, Regus considers that the
senior independent non-executive director is able to gain full
awareness of the issues and concerns of major shareholders.
Notwithstanding this policy, all directors have a standing
invitation to participate in meetings with investors.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect
of the annual report and ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and
parent company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and
applicable law and are required to prepare the parent company
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with Luxembourg Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice and applicable law.
The Group ﬁnancial statements are required by law and IFRSs
as adopted by the EU to present fairly the ﬁnancial position and
performance of the Group.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
• for the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the parent company
and Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
ﬁnancial position of the parent company and to enable them to
ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with applicable law
and regulations. They have general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing a
Directors’ Report, a Remuneration Report and Corporate
Governance Statement.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in Luxembourg governing
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions and the Company’s
Articles of Association permit the Company to communicate
with shareholders in a similar way to that permitted by UK
company law.
Statutory statement as to disclosure to auditors
The directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of
this Directors’ Report conﬁrm that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
The annual accounts have been approved by the directors
of Regus plc. The directors conﬁrm that the annual accounts
have been prepared in accordance with applicable law
and regulations and that they include a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the position
of the parent company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Remuneration Report
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee
(the “Committee”) of Regus plc
1
and approved by the Board of
Directors of Regus plc (the “Board”)
2
. The report complies with
the UK Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and,
in compliance with such regulations, a separate resolution
approving this report will be put to shareholders at this year’s
Annual General Meeting.
This report sets out the Company’s policy on directors’
remuneration for the forthcoming year as well as information
on remuneration paid to directors during the year.
Information relating to the emoluments and pension
contributions to the directors and directors’ interests in
the Company’s shares and under Employee Share Plans
is unaudited.
Unaudited Information
Membership and responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee is made up of non-executive directors and
chaired by Martin Robinson, the Company’s independent senior
non-executive director. During the year the members of the
Committee were:
• Martin Robinson
• Stephen East (resigned 14 October 2008)
• Roger Orf (resigned 14 October 2008)
• Lance Browne (appointed 14 October 2008)
• Ulrich Ogiermann (appointed 14 October 2008)
• Douglas Sutherland (appointed 14 October 2008)
The Committee met three times during the year.
The Committee has responsibility for determining, in
consultation with the Chairman and/or Chief Executive as
appropriate, the total remuneration package of each executive
director and senior manager, including bonuses, incentive
payments and share options or other share awards.
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility to:
• Determine and agree with the Board the remuneration
policy for the executive directors and the Group’s other
senior management.
• Approve the design of, and determine targets for, any
performance related pay schemes operated by the
Company and approve the total annual payments
made under such schemes.
Following its acquisition of Halliwell Consulting, the
Committee receives advice on executive remuneration
from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”), an external
consultancy which has wide experience of executive
remuneration in UK listed companies. PWC has no
other connection with the Company.
Directors are not permitted, under Regus plc’s Articles
of Association, to vote on their own terms and conditions
of remuneration.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website, www.regus.com. The members of the
Committee attend the Company’s AGM and are available to
answer shareholders’ questions about directors’ remuneration.
Compliance with the best practice provisions
In accordance with the Board’s commitment to maintaining
high standards of Corporate Governance, the Committee
has complied with all remuneration related aspects of the
Code during the year.
Remuneration policy
The principal objectives of the Committee’s remuneration
policy are:
• To focus on rewarding exceptional pay for exceptional
performance, executives should be focused on delivering
exceptional returns to shareholders over both the short and
long terms and given the opportunity to receive exceptional
levels of reward if such performance is delivered. Conversely,
if returns are conservative compensation levels should be
extremely conservative.
• To provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain and
motivate people of the highest calibre and experience needed
to shape and execute the Company’s strategy and to deliver
shareholder value.
The guiding principles which the Committee has regard to
and balances, as far as practicable, in determining policy
and objectives for 2008 and future years are:-
• to maintain a competitive package of total compensation,
commensurate with comparable packages available with
similar companies operating in similar markets (the
“Comparator Group”);
• to make a signiﬁcant percentage of potential maximum
reward conditional on short and long-term performance;
• to ensure that the interests of the executives are closely
aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders through
the provision of share-based incentives;
• to link reward to the satisfaction of targeted objectives
which are the main drivers of shareholder value; and
• to be sensitive in determining executive directors’
remuneration to pay and employment conditions
throughout the Group.

2 For purposes of this report the deﬁnition of the Board includes the Board of Directors of Regus Group plc up to 14 October 2008. Directors’ Report Corporate Governance
34_www.regus.com
In order to achieve the above policy, the Committee capped
the pay rise applicable to the ﬁxed elements of the executives’
compensation package for 2008 at 2.5% (this did not apply to
the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s salary which following completion
of his probationary period increased from £250,000 to £300,000
per annum).
This ensured a greater weighting towards variable remuneration
with the opportunity for total compensation packages to be
in the upper quartile of salaries earned within the Comparator
Group dependent upon the degree to which the associated
stringent performance conditions attached to the short and
long-term incentive schemes had been satisﬁed.
The table below illustrates the balance between ﬁxed and
performance related (variable) compensation for each executive
director for the year ended 31 December 2008:

Fixed 30.9 28.4 30.0
Variable 69.1 71.6 70.0
*Resigned from the Board 14 October 2008
Fixed compensation comprises salary, beneﬁts and pension
contributions. Variable compensation comprises the annual
bonus paid in relation to the year ended 31 December 2008
and the total fair value of share awards granted in the year
(excluding entitlements under the Value Creation Plan). For
Rudy Lobo this is pro-rata for the period to 14 October 2008.
The main elements of the packages and the performance
conditions are described below.
Non-executive directors are remunerated with fees, set at levels
that are sufﬁcient to attract and retain their services and are
in line with market rates. The non-executive directors do not
receive any pension or other beneﬁts, other than appropriate
expenses, nor do they participate in any bonus or share
option schemes.

Remuneration packages
The remuneration for executive directors during the year
comprised a basic salary, a beneﬁt package, an annual
performance-based short-term incentive award paid partly in
cash and partly in shares and participation in the Company’s
share incentive arrangements, the Regus Co-Investment Plan
and the Value Creation Plan.
Basic salary and beneﬁts
The basic salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually
and any increases are effective from 1 January.
In light of current market conditions salaries for the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer during 2009
will be unchanged from 2008, being £522,750 and
£300,000 respectively.
Beneﬁts comprise a company car or allowance, fuel,
private medical insurance, disturbance allowance and
a living allowance for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.
The Chairman has agreed to serve at a reduced annual fee
of £114,000 and the Senior Independent Non-Executive has
agreed to serve without a fee.
Annual bonus scheme
The Committee believes ﬁrmly in the ﬁnancial effectiveness
of short-term incentives. Accordingly, every employee in the
Group participates in some form of incentive scheme.
The Committee sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility
each year.
The maximum bonus potential, for the executive directors,
for the year ending 31 December 2008 was 300% of salary,
consisting of a standard bonus and a discretionary bonus.
The Committee are of the opinion that all financial and
personal measures and targets were achieved by the executive
directors and as such, bonuses of 100% of salary were paid for
this element. 50% of this bonus payment will be paid in cash
and 50% deferred to purchase shares (“Investment Shares”) in
Regus plc. These shares are awarded under the Co-Investment
Plan with the opportunity to receive an additional award of
shares (“Matching Shares”) after a three-year period subject
to certain conditions. Share awards will be granted in the
form of either a nil-cost option or a conditional share award.
Although the cash element of the bonus has been approved,
at the time of the drafting of this report the award of Investment
Shares and associated Matching Shares has not been made
due to the Company being in a close period. The Committee
will provide full details of the award and relevant performance
conditions in its Remuneration Report for the year ending 31
December 2009. The maximum number of share awards to be
granted to the executive directors will be based on the price of
an ordinary share at the time of the grant and the monetary
value of Investment Shares will not exceed 50% of salary and
200% of salary for Matching Shares.
In addition, the Company’s operating proﬁt exceeded external
forecasts based on a consensus of analysts’ estimates and the
Remuneration Report continued Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_35
Committee have rewarded this exceptional performance with
a discretionary bonus of 36% of salary paid out of the self-
ﬁnancing “pool” system. For exceptional performance in
relation to his work in relation to the recent Scheme of
Arrangement which became effective on 14 October 2008
the Committee has awarded the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer a
one-off cash bonus of £30,000.
For the year ending 31 December 2009, in consideration of
current market conditions, the Committee has decided to
reduce the maximum potential bonus from 300% to 200%
of salary. The standard bonus will remain at a maximum of
100% of salary linked to the achievement of stretching short-
term financial and individual performance targets, while
the maximum discretionary element for exceptional out-
performance will be capped at 100%. The discretionary bonus
will be based on a self-ﬁnancing bonus “pool” system deﬁned
by reference to a percentage of operating proﬁts in excess of
external forecasts based on a consensus of analysts’ estimates.
Bonuses are non-pensionable. Non-executive directors do
not receive a bonus.
Pension beneﬁts
The executive directors participate in the Company’s Money
Purchase (Personal Pension) Scheme. The Company matches
contributions up to a maximum of 7.0% of basic salary. The
Committee considers that the pension beneﬁts of the executive
directors are low compared with comparative companies but
prefers to offer enhanced variable compensation (rather than
a ﬁxed additional pension contribution).
The Group does not operate a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme
and has no plans to introduce such a scheme.
Long Term Incentives
Overview
The Company operates three long term incentive plans, the
Regus plc Co-investment Plan (“CIP”), the Regus plc Share
Option Scheme and the Regus plc 2008 Value Creation Plan
(the “VCP”).
Co-investment Plan (“CIP”)
There are two elements to the CIP:
The ﬁrst element operates in conjunction with the annual bonus
whereby a gross bonus up to 50% of salary will be taken as a
deferred award of shares to be released at the end of a three-
year period with the balance paid in cash.
Matching Shares will be awarded linked to the number of
Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on the
Company’s future performance (see below). Matching Shares
are awarded at no cost to participants.
The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be
awarded to a participant in the CIP is 200% of salary. As
such the maximum number of Matching Shares which can
be awarded based on Investment Shares awarded is 4:1.
The Committee have determined that this ratio will apply
to any payout of the annual bonus.
Grants during the year ending 31 December 2008:
Stephen
Mark Dixon Rudy Lobo* Gleadle
CIP award face

* Resigned 14 October 2008.
** The fair value was calculated by taking the face value of the shares on the date of
award and adjusting this value by the probability of the performance condition
being satisﬁed at this date (in accordance with the principles of IFRS 2).
The second element is that the Committee may also make
stand alone whole share awards (“LTIP Awards”) without
reference to the annual bonus, up to a maximum of 100%
of salary per annum. An LTIP Award is a conditional right over
a whole number of shares with the release being dependent
on the extent to which (if at all) the challenging performance
conditions set by the Committee at the time the LTIP Award
is made are satisﬁed.
No LTIP award was made in 2008. It is unlikely that future stand-
alone LTIP Awards will be made to existing executive directors
unless there are exceptional circumstances.
The performance conditions associated with the release of the
LTIP Awards and CIP Matching Shares awards made in the
years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are set out in the following table:
Growth in FCF (a) 11p 12p 13p 14p
per share over 3 years (b) 15% 20% 25% 30%
10% 6% 13% 19% 25%
15% 13% 25% 38% 50%
20% 19% 38% 56% 75%
25% 25% 50% 75% 100%
(a) For Nov 2005 LTIP and March 2006 CIP Adjusted EPS (p) for the year ended
31 December 2008.
(b) For March 2007 CIP % increase in published EPS for the year ended 31 December
2009 compared to the prior year.
In addition, no LTIP Awards or CIP Matching Shares are
to be released unless the Company’s TSR is at least at the
median when compared against that of the companies
comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date
of grant, unless the Remuneration Committee at its discretion
decides otherwise.
The Company achieved the EPS and FCF performance
targets in full for the awards made in 2005 and 2006. As a
result of the level of performance against these key corporate
fundamentals the Remuneration Committee has partially waived
the TSR underpin as the attainment of these conditions has
not been reﬂected in the share price of the Company over the
performance period and accordingly 80% of the matching
shares and LTIP shares have been released.
It should be noted that for issues relating to commercial
sensitivity and the extreme volatility in the global economic
Remuneration report Directors’ Report Corporate Governance
36_www.regus.com
environment in which the Company operates, the Committee
believes that it is not practical to set the speciﬁc performance
conditions relating to the release of Matching Shares granted
in 2008 at this time. The Committee also intends to take
a similar position in relation to the performance conditions
applying to the Matching Shares to be granted in March 2009
relating to the bonus paid for the year ending 31 December
2008. Once there is more certainty as to the long-term corporate
performance outlook the Committee will set targets for the
release of Matching Shares in accordance with the Company’s
performance as measured against some or all of the following
corporate fundamentals:
• comparative TSR;
• EPS growth;
• free cash ﬂow;
• growth in revenue; and
• growth in EBIT.
The Committee will ensure that only 25% of the Matching Share
award is released for achievement of an “acceptable” level of
performance and that full release (a 4:1 match) will only occur
for exceptional performance against the relevant metrics.
To give comfort to shareholders that there is integrity of process
in relation to the application of the performance targets and
the operation of the CIP the Committee will lodge full details of
the performance conditions with its auditors once set and then
disclose details of the targets in the Company’s Remuneration
Report for the year in which the conditions have been set.
Share Option Scheme
The options granted to executive directors prior to the
introduction of the CIP are set out below. The Company
continues to grant options on an ad hoc basis to certain
non-participants of the CIP .
Regus plc 2008 Value Creation Plan (the “VCP”)
The VCP was introduced in 2008 with the objective of delivering
exceptional rewards to participants provided absolute returns to
shareholders are exceptional.
The VCP operates over a ﬁve year period from May 2008 to
March 2013. Participants in the VCP are granted entitlements
(“VCP Entitlements”) to receive a maximum number of
shares which shall be earned by the conversion of the VCP
Entitlements into an option or series of options (the “VCP
Options”) which may be granted on certain dates (the
“Measurement Dates”) based on the Company’s share price
performance. The exercise price for VCP Options will be the
closing share price on the date of the Company’s 2008 AGM.
VCP Entitlements granted in 2008:
Stephen
Mark Dixon Rudy Lobo* Gleadle
Number of shares subject
to VCP Entitlement** 3,500,000 3,000,000 3,000,000
* Resigned 14 October 2008
** VCP Entitlements hold no value.
The share price of the Company will be calculated at each
Measurement Date, the ﬁrst of which is 31 March 2010, and
compared against a matrix of extremely stretching ﬁxed share
price targets to determine the number of shares subject to the
VCP Entitlement over which a VCP Option will be granted. If
a lower share price target is achieved a VCP Option shall be
granted over a lesser number of shares with the ability for the
balance to be received at a subsequent measurement date
subject to relevant share price targets being achieved.
The share price targets for the VCP Entitlements granted
in 2008 are as set out in the following table:
Measurement date
(Shares awarded at each date less
those already earned in a prior year) 31/03/10 31/03/11 31/03/12 31/03/13
Share price is less than £2.60 –– ––
Share price is more than
£2.60 but less than £3.50 2.5m 1.8m 1.2m 0.6m
Share price is more than
£3.50 but less than £4.50 3.5m 2.5m 1.8m 1.2m
Share price is £4.50 or more 3.5m 2.5m 1.8m
The number of Ordinary shares above are based on the entitlements of the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer. For the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer the number of ordinary shares will
be lower but based on the same ratios.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
The above graph shows the Company’s performance,
measured by TSR for the Group compared with the
performance of the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE 350
Support Services Index. The Committee consider the FTSE
250 Index relevant since it is an index of companies of similar
size to Regus plc. As detailed earlier in the report, the Company
considers its TSR performance for share awards under the CIP
in comparison to that of the FTSE 350 Support Services Index.
External appointments
Executive directors are permitted to accept appointments on
external boards or committees so long as these are not deemed
to interfere with the business of the Group. Any fees received in
respect of these appointments are retained directly by the relevant
executive director. At 31 December 2008, the executive directors
did not hold any external positions for which they received fees.

Annual resolution
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the Remuneration Report at the AGM on 19 May 2009.
Audit requirement
Under Luxembourg law and regulations there is no requirement for the sections on Directors’ remuneration, shareholdings and
pension beneﬁts on pages 37 to 39 inclusive to be audited; therefore all sections of the Remuneration Report are un-audited.

Independent Auditors’ report to the shareholders
Report of the Réviseurs d’Entreprises on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements
We have audited the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Regus
plc S.A., which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as
at 31 December 2008 and the consolidated income statement,
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
cash ﬂow statement for the year then ended, and a summary
of signiﬁcant accounting policies and other explanatory notes
as set out on pages 41 to 80.
Board of directors’ responsibility for the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements
The Board of directors is responsible for the preparation and
fair presentation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the European Union. This responsibility includes:
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated
ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying
appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Responsibility of the Réviseur d’Entreprises
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
ﬁnancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
as adopted by the Institut des Réviseurs d’Entreprises. Those
standards require that we comply with ethical requirements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the judgement of the Réviseur d’Entreprises,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the Réviseur
d’Entreprises considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board
of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements set out
on pages 41 to 80 give a true and fair view of the consolidated
ﬁnancial position of Regus plc S.A. as of 31 December
2008, and of its consolidated ﬁnancial performance and its
consolidated cash ﬂows for the year then ended in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the European Union.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
The consolidated Directors’ report, which is the responsibility
of the Board of directors, is consistent with the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.

(a) Total reserves attributable to equity holders of the parent:
• Share capital represents the net proceeds (the nominal value) on the issue of the Company’s equity share capital (prior to 14 October 2008 the equity share capital
of Regus Group plc).
• Treasury shares represent 5,950,000 ordinary shares of the Group that were acquired for the purposes of the Group’s employee share option plans and the share buyback
programme. During 2008, prior to the Scheme of Arrangement on 14 October 2008, 24,624,000 shares in Regus Group plc were acquired and 36,571,702 shares were
cancelled. Subsequent to the Scheme of Arrangement 2,750,000 foundation shares in Regus plc were acquired and a further 3,200,000 Regus plc shares were acquired in the
market.
At 20 March 2009, 5,950,000 treasury shares were held. As a result of the purchase of treasury shares,the distributable reserves of the Group were reduced by £1.4 million.
• The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the ﬁnancial statements of foreign subsidiaries and
joint ventures.
• The revaluation reserve arose on the restatement of the assets and liabilities of the UK associate from historic cost to fair value at the time of the acquisition of the
outstanding 58% interest on 19 April 2006.
• Other reserves include £37.9 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken on 14 October 2008, £6.5 million relating to merger reserves and £0.1 million
to the redemption of preference shares partly offset by £29.2 million arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken in 2003.
(b) On 14 October 2008, the Group entered into a Court approved Scheme of Arrangement. As a result of the Scheme of Arrangement shares in Regus Group plc were
cancelled and shares in the new Group holding company, Regus plc, were issued on the basis of one Regus plc share (nominal value one pence) for one share previously
held in Regus Group plc (nominal value ﬁve pence). As a result, the shareholders of Regus Group plc became the shareholders of Regus plc. The transaction was
accounted for as a reverse acquisition and consequently the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to Regus plc. Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_45
Notes to the accounts
1. Authorisation of ﬁnancial statements
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements for the year ended
31 December 2008 were authorised for issue by the Board of
directors on 20 March 2009 and the balance sheets were signed
on the Board’s behalf by Mark Dixon and Stephen Gleadle. Regus
plc S.A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and
registered and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company’s ordinary
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared and approved
by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Company
is required to prepare its parent company ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with Luxembourg GAAP; extracts from these are
presented on page 81.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate those of the parent
company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”)
and equity account the Group’s interest in the associate and jointly
controlled entities. The extract from the parent company ﬁnancial
statements presents information about the Company as a separate
entity and not about its Group.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these
Group ﬁnancial statements. Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
with an effective date from 1 January 2008 did not have a material
effect on the Group ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 11 “IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions” was
applicable for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 March
2007. The Interpretation addresses how share based payment
should be accounted for within a Group and therefore the adoption
of IFRIC 11 had no impact on the reported income or net assets
of the Group.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these
accounting policies that have signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnancial
statements and estimates with a signiﬁcant risk of material
adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31.
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis,
with the exception of certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value. The ﬁnancial statements have also been
prepared on the basis that the Group will continue as a going
concern for the foreseeable future. Further details on the Group’s
ﬁnancial risks, including liquidity and credit risk, can be found in
note 23 to the accounts.
The Group and Company ﬁnancial statements are presented in
Pounds Sterling and all values are in million pounds, rounded to
one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise.
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied
The Group did not adopt the following standards, interpretations
and amendments to standards which were available for optional
early adoption and were relevant to the Group:
• IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” will be applicable for accounting
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The Standard
requires the disclosure of segmental information on the basis of
the components of an entity that management monitors in making
operating decisions. Therefore, the adoption of IFRS 8 will have
no impact on the reported income or net assets of the Group.
• Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 “Cost of an investment in a
subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate” requires that all
dividends from a subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate
should be recognised as income when the right to receive the
dividend is established.
• Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements:
A Revised Presentation” will require the presentation of both
a statement of comprehensive income and a statement of
changes in equity as ﬁnancial statements.
• Amendments to IFRS 2 “Share Based Payment: Vesting
Conditions and Cancellations” clariﬁes the nature of vesting
conditions as service conditions and performance conditions.
All other conditions are non-vesting conditions.
• Improvements to IFRS (2007) contains 24 amendments that
result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or
measurement purposes.
The adoption of any of the above standards or amendments
to standards is not expected to have a material impact on the
Group’s ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists
when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the
ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The
ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences.
The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the
subsidiary qualiﬁes as a disposal group at which point the assets
and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell
and carrying value.
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed
of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁcant
inﬂuence, but not control, over the ﬁnancial and operating policies.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the Group’s share
of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an
equity accounted basis, from the date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence
commences until the date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence ceases or
the associate qualiﬁes as a disposal group at which point the
investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell
and carrying value.
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those
entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established
by contractual agreement. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements
include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses
of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis, from the
date that joint control commences until the date that joint control
ceases or the jointly controlled entity qualiﬁes as a disposal group
at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value
less costs to sell and carrying value.

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a
joint venture, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations
or made payments on behalf of a joint venture.
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the
shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the
Group. As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business
from that date. The acquisition was accounted for through the
purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and
liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value. The effect
of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already owned
was reﬂected in the revaluation reserve.
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital
of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of
Regus plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share
held previously in Regus Group plc. At the date of the transaction,
Regus plc had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the
transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc
by Regus Group plc.
Consequently no fair value acquisition adjustments were required
and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been attributed to
Regus plc.
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase
method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of
acquisition over the share of the fair value of identiﬁable assets
(including intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities
of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date
of acquisition.
Business combinations that took place prior to the Group’s
transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated
under the requirements of IFRS.
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment
in value. An impairment test is carried out annually and, in addition,
whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. Positive goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
for the purpose of impairment testing.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets other than deferred
tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life and intangible
assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount
was estimated at 31 October 2008 and updated in February 2009.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount
of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units
are allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce the
carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
A cash generating unit is the smallest identiﬁable group of assets
that generates cash inﬂows that are largely independent of the
cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to
the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent
cash inﬂows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are
capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an
acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill
if their fair value can be identiﬁed and measured reliably on
initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the assets as follows:
Brand – Regus brand Indeﬁnite life
Brand – other acquired brands 20 years
Computer software 3–5 years
Customer lists 1–2 years*
Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract
* Customer lists recognised on the acquisition of the remaining 58% interest in the
UK business are amortised over four years.
Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration
expenses in the income statement.
Leases
Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed
as ﬁnance leases. All other leases, including all of the Group’s
property leases, are categorised as operating leases.
Finance leases
Plant and equipment acquired by way of a ﬁnance lease is
capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments
at inception. Future payments under ﬁnance leases are included
in creditors, net of any future ﬁnance charges. Minimum lease
payments are apportioned between the ﬁnance charge and
the reduction of the outstanding liability. Finance charges are
recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as
to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability.
Operating leases
Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and rent free periods are included in the calculation
of minimum lease payments. The commencement of the lease term
is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset.
2. Accounting policies continued Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_47
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together
with any further periods for which the Group has the option to
continue to lease the asset and when at the inception of the lease
it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option.
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inﬂation
indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre
turnover or proﬁtability and are excluded from the calculation
of minimum lease payments. Contingent rentals are recognised
in the income statement as they are incurred.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are those signiﬁcant items which are
separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to
enable a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to non-recurring items are
restructuring, reorganisation costs and onerous commitments.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the assets as follows:
Fixtures and ﬁttings Over the shorter of the lease
term and 10 years
Furniture 10 years
Ofﬁce equipment and telephones 5 – 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 3 – 5 years
Revenue
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable (excluding
sales taxes).
Workstations
Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the
service is rendered. Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred
and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service.
Customer service income
Service income (including the rental of meeting rooms) is recognised
as services are rendered. In circumstances where Regus acts as
an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only
the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue.
Management and franchise fees
Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are
recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees charged
for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other
services provided during the period of the agreement, are recognised
as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.
Membership card income
Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and
recognised over the period that the beneﬁts of the membership
card are provided.
These categories represent all material sources of revenue
earned from the provision of global workplace solutions.
Employee beneﬁts
The Group’s contributions to deﬁned contribution plans and other
paid and unpaid beneﬁts earned by employees are charged to the
income statement as incurred.
Share based payments
The share option programme entitles certain employees and
directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company;
these awards are granted by the ultimate parent.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The
fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black Scholes
valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into account the
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the
actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture
is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights (CIP) are also granted by the Company
to certain employees. The fair value of the amount payable to the
employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding
increase in equity. The fair value is initially recognised at grant date
and spread over the period during which the employees become
unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share
appreciation rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo valuation
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which
the instruments were granted.
The Group also operates a Value Creation Plan (VCP) which awards
entitlements to certain employees and directors of the Group.
These entitlements are convertible into options over ordinary shares
subject to the Group’s share price reaching certain targets. The fair
value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is
initially recognised at the date of the award of the entitlements and
spread over the period during which the entitlements are convertible
into ordinary shares. The fair value of the entitlements is based on
the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms
and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
Taxation
Tax on the proﬁt for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The
following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets and liabilities
that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt other than in a
business combination; and differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
Financial Statements Notes to the accounts continued
Financial Statements
48_www.regus.com
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based
on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which
the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outﬂow
of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation.
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a
business reorganisation where the plans are sufﬁciently detailed
and well advanced and where the appropriate communication to
those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract
exceed the economic beneﬁts expected to be delivered, discounted
using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date
and the gains or losses on translation are taken to the income
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The results and
cash ﬂows of overseas operations are translated using the average
rate for the period.
Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments,
of overseas operations are translated using the closing rate with
all exchange differences arising on consolidation being recognised
in the foreign currency translation reserve. Exchange differences
are released to the income statement on disposal.
Under the transition requirements of IFRS, cumulative translation
differences for all foreign operations have been set to zero at
1 January 2004.
Finance charges
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income
statement on an accruals basis. Financing transaction costs that
relate to ﬁnancial liabilities are charged to interest expense using
the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the
carrying value of the related ﬁnancial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as
a prepayment and recognised through the ﬁnance expense over the
term of the facility. In the event of a facility being drawn the relevant
unamortised portion of the fee is recognised within the carrying
value of the ﬁnancial liability and charged to the interest expense
using the effective interest rate method.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried
at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding
the discount is recognised as a ﬁnance expense or ﬁnance income
as appropriate.
Interest bearing borrowings and other ﬁnancial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, ﬁnancial liabilities are stated at
amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption
value being recognised in the income statement over the period
of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The Group derecognises ﬁnancial liabilities when the Group’s
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value
through proﬁt or loss where the liability is either held for trading
or is designated as held at fair value through proﬁt or loss on initial
recognition. They are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or
loss recognised in the income statement.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classiﬁed as either at fair value through proﬁt
or loss, held to maturity investments, available for sale ﬁnancial
assets or loans and receivables. The classiﬁcation depends on
the nature and purpose of the ﬁnancial assets and is determined
on initial recognition.
Trade and other receivables that have ﬁxed or determinable
payments and are not quoted in an active market are classiﬁed
as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short-term receivables when recognition
would be immaterial.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group’s policy on the use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments can
be found in note 23. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are measured
initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised
through proﬁt or loss unless the derivative ﬁnancial instrument has
been designated as a cash ﬂow hedge whereby the effective
portion of changes in the fair value is deferred in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand
and are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.

3. Segmental analysis – statutory basis
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s geographical segments. The Group’s primary activity and only business
segment is the provision of global workplace solutions. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a
segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. There is no inter-segment trading. Management fees are in
consideration of subsidiaries’ use of Group services including, but not limited to, intellectual property, business development services,
purchasing, information technology, sales and marketing, ﬁnance and treasury, human resources and legal services. Unallocated items
comprise mainly interest bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses. Segment capital expenditure is the
total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year. The business is run
on a worldwide basis, but managed through four principal geographical segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia
Paciﬁc and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom segment was added following the acquisition on 19 April 2006 of the remaining 58%
of the share capital of the UK business. The United Kingdom segment does not include the Group’s non-trading holding companies that
are based in the UK. The EMEA segment does not include the Group’s non-trading head ofﬁce and holding companies that are based in
Luxembourg. These are shown as unallocated. The results of business centres in each of these regions form the basis for reporting
geographical results.

The applicable tax rate is determined based on the tax rate in the UK which was the corporate tax rate applicable in the country of domicile
of the parent company of the Group from the beginning of the ﬁnancial year until 14 October 2008. The tax rate in the UK reduced from
30.0% to 28.0% on 1 April 2008 and the reconciliation for 2008 has been included at the effective UK rate for the year of 28.5%. From
14 October 2008, when the parent company of the Group became Regus plc, the country of domicile became Luxembourg where the
corporate tax rate is 29%.

Deferred tax assets recognised on short term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and share
based payments. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are forecast taxable
proﬁts in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unmerited earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £50.2 million (2007:
£39.0 million). It is considered that no signiﬁcant tax liability would arise should these reserves be remitted due to available overseas
tax credits. Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_55

Cash-generating units, comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying out
impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed. Goodwill acquired through
business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash ﬂows of these cash-generating
units. The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows:
2008 2007
£m £m
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 168.6 123.6
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 5.0 3.1
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 10.6 7.7
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 90.3 88.6
274.5 223.0
The carrying value of goodwill and indeﬁnite life intangibles allocated to two cash-generating units, the USA and UK, is material relative to
the total carrying value comprising 90% of the total. The remaining 10% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 23 countries (23 cash-
generating units). The goodwill and indeﬁnite life intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash-generating units is set out below:
Goodwill Intangible assets 2008 2007
£m £m £m £m
USA 156.1 – 156.1 112.9
UK 90.3 11.2 101.5 99.8
Other cash-generating units 28.1 – 28.1 21.5
274.5 11.2 285.7 234.2
The indeﬁnite life intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in
the year ended 31 December 2006 (see note 13).
The recoverable amount of each of the cash-generating units above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as
the present value of future cash ﬂows attributable to the unit.
The value in use for each cash-generating unit has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each
unit from the value in use of the Group as a whole. Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management, it also
reﬂects external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reﬂected in the market capitalisation of the Group, and prevailing tax rates,
which have been used to determine the risk-adjusted discount rate for the Group. As the model reﬂects current market risk factors,
management believe that the the actual performance of the business is more likely than not to exceed the projections used in the value
in use model in the medium to long term. However, as described below, in the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the
assumptions used in the projections, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods. Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_57
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of cash-generating units:
• future cash ﬂows are based on budgets for 2009 approved by the Board and have been adjusted for speciﬁc risks and uncertainties
identiﬁed for each cash-generating unit. The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that are anticipated but had not been
committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use. Thereafter forecasts have been prepared by management for a
further four years that reﬂect a steady growth rate of 3% and an unchanged underlying gross margin before adjusting for the effect of an
anticipated modest recovery in global economic conditions from 2011. This compared to forecasts used in the model in the year ended
31 December 2007 that projected improving margins throughout the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the model with steady growth thereafter. Therefore
the current cash ﬂow projections take a more cautious approach than the projections used in 2007. These forecasts exclude the impact
of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods. As a result gross margins and real operating proﬁts at
the end of the ﬁve year period remain either at or below the levels achieved in the year ended 31 December 2008. Management consider
these projections to be a cautious projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position reﬂecting the current uncertain global
economic conditions. Cash ﬂows beyond 2013 have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which does not exceed the long-
term growth rate for any of the markets in which the relevant cash-generating units operate.
• a terminal value is included in the assessment reﬂecting the Group’s expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets and
the long term nature of the businesses.
• a country speciﬁc pre-tax discount rate was applied to the future pre-tax cash ﬂows for each cash-generating unit based on an
underlying post-tax discount rate for the Group. The pre-tax rate therefore reﬂects current market assessments of the Group as a whole
and is adjusted for risks speciﬁc to such businesses in each country. The Group post-tax rate used as the base for the pre-tax discount
rate was 16% (2007:12%). The increase compared to the prior year reﬂected an increase in the market risk adjustment caused by the
current market capitalisation of the Group. The underlying weighted average cost of capital for the Group, before the market risk
adjustment, was unchanged from 2007 at 9%.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates are subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on
the operating performance of the business. Current market conditions are more challenging for the Group and the current global conditions
make forecasting medium term cash ﬂows more difﬁcult than is traditionally the case. The forecast cash ﬂows used to derive the value
in use are sensitive to changes in revenues (driven by changes in prices, occupancy or a combination of both), costs and discount rates
(including the market assessment of the risks of the Group reﬂected in the Group’s market capitalisation). Actual conditions could result
in either better or worse cash ﬂows than included in the value in use calculation. Should current economic conditions prove to be more
severe or more prolonged than currently expected this would adversely impact the forecast cash ﬂows and could result in impairments
to goodwill and indeﬁnite life intangible assets in future periods. It is not possible to predict the extent of such possible impairments.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a signiﬁcant nature so as to result in most cash-generating
units’ carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount. For the USA and UK cash-generating units, a reasonably possible change in
the key assumptions used to determine the cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount could cause the unit’s carrying amount to exceed
its recoverable amount.
For the USA, the goodwill in this cash-generating unit arose on acquisitions completed since 2004 – principally the acquisition of HQ
Global Workplaces in 2004. The recoverable amount exceeded its carrying amount by $51 million and therefore no impairment was
necessary at 31 December 2008. The main assumptions on which the forecast cash ﬂows were based included the impact of the
economic downturn in the short term on revenues and margins; the mid-cycle revenue achieved in 2013 prior to the application of the
long-run growth rate of 2%; and the discount rate used. The model assumes a decrease in gross margins in 2009 and 2010 from 28%
in 2008 to 20% and a fall in operating proﬁts from $103 million in 2008 to $40 million in 2009. A further fall in gross margins in 2009 and
2010 by ﬁve points to 15% (equating to an operating proﬁt of $8 million) with recovery to a gross margin of 22% in 2011 would result in the
recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount. The model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2013 of 23% and an operating
proﬁt of $71.7 million. A reduction to 21% and $54.7 million would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount.
The cash ﬂows have been discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 15% (pre-tax 18%; 2007: 20%). The discount rate used is lower
than the risk adjusted rate for the Group of 16% reﬂecting the mature nature of the Regus business in the USA and the competitive
environment. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used from 18% to 22% would result in its recoverable amount being equal to
its carrying amount.
For the UK, the goodwill in this cash-generating unit arose on acquisitions completed since 2006 – principally the acquisition of the
remaining 58% of the UK business in 2006. The recoverable amount exceeded its carrying amount by £18 million and therefore no
impairment was necessary at 31 December 2008. The main assumptions on which the forecast cash ﬂows were based included the
impact of the economic downturn in the short term on revenues and margins; the mid-cycle revenue achieved in 2013 prior to the
application of the long-run growth rate; and the discount rate used. The model assumes a decrease in gross margins in 2009 and 2010
from 19% in 2008 to 15% and a fall in underlying operating proﬁts from £18.4 million in 2008 to £11.6 million in 2009. A further fall in gross
margins in 2009 and 2010 by four points to 11% (equating to an operating proﬁt of £3.6 million) with recovery to a gross margin of 17% in
2011 would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount. The model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2013 of
18% and an operating proﬁt of £21.7 million. A reduction to 16% and £15.7 million would result in the recoverable amount being equal to
the carrying amount. The cash ﬂows have been discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 16% (pre-tax 19%; 2007: 17%). The discount
rate used is in line with the risk-adjusted rate for the Group reﬂecting the mature nature of the Regus business in the UK and the greater
degree of competition in the market. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used from 19% to 22% would result in its recoverable
amount being equal to its carrying amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Group’s joint ventures.

Included with the brand value is £11.2 million relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended
31 December 2006. The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indeﬁnite useful life due to the fact that the
value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indeﬁnite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying
value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable amount
of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business (see note 12). Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_59

23. Financial instruments and ﬁnancial risk management
The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to ﬁnancial instruments and the management of capital are
determined at Group level. The Group’s Board maintains overall responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis. The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Group Treasurer review the Group’s
risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis. The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility
for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Audit Committee is
supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of business. The principal ﬁnancial instruments used by
the Group to ﬁnance its operations are cash and loans.
Going concern
The Business Review on pages 6 to 15 of the Report and Accounts sets out the Group’s strategy and the factors that are likely to affect
the future performance and position of the business. The Financial Review on pages 16 to 19 within the Business Review includes a review
of the trading performance, ﬁnancial position and cash ﬂows of the Group. A feature of the Group has been its strong cash ﬂows during the
year ended 31 December 2008 and its cash balance at that date. Although many countries that the Group operates in are experiencing
increasingly difﬁcult economic conditions, the directors believe that the Group is taking the necessary actions and expect to strengthen the
current market leading position of the Group.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report
and accounts.
Following an internal review of the Group’s facility arrangements in March 2009, and given the strength of the Group’s cash position,
the Board approved the early surrender of the £100 million revolving credit facility. The decision does not impact the judgement of the
directors that it is appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.
Credit risk
Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a ﬁnancial instrument and arises
principally in relation to customer contracts and the Group’s cash deposits.
A diversiﬁed customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which contribute
the majority of the Group’s revenue minimise the Group’s exposure to customer credit risk. No single customer contributes a material
percentage of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s policy is to provide against trade receivables when speciﬁc debts are judged to be
irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced. A provision is created where debts are more than three months
overdue which reﬂects the Group’s historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables. These provisions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
Cash assets and derivative ﬁnancial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does
not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below.

Americas 28.4 19.9
EMEA 51.3 33.0
UK 21.6 22.0
Asia Paciﬁc 14.2 11.5

All of the Group’s trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and no individual customer has a material balance
owing as a trade receivable.
The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was:

123.1 (7.6) 90.1 (3.7) Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_65
During the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group provided for an additional £5.5 million against potential bad debts (2007:
£3.1 million) and utilised £2.6 million directly against the balance of trade receivables (2007: £2.7 million).
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority
of its revenue in advance of the provision of ofﬁce services and requires deposits from its customers.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufﬁcient liquidity to meet
its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due. In addition to free cash (excluding blocked cash) of £205.4 million (2007: £128.5 million) the Group
has an undrawn senior committed facility of £100.0 million (2007: £136.0 million).
The Group’s undrawn senior committed facility of £100.0 million expires on 19 March 2011, subject to the Group continuing to comply
with the covenants under the facility agreement. These covenants include the ratio of net debt to EBITDA; the ratio of cash ﬂow to net
debt service (including the net interest expense and scheduled debt repayments); and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest and rental
charges. The Group does not anticipate that any of the covenants in the facility will be breached in the foreseeable future.
In March 2009, the Board approved the early surrender of the £100 million revolving credit facility following an internal review of the Group’s
facility arrangements. Of the facility approximately £50 million had been set aside to support bank guarantees provided against obligations
of the Group. In order to continue to support these, the Group will deposit sufﬁcient funds with the guaranteeing banks which will reduce
cash available for use by an equivalent amount. The directors do not believe that this decision will have an adverse impact on the Group’s
liquidity given the strength of the Group’s cash position.
Even though the Group has net current liabilities, the directors do not consider that this gives rise to a liquidity risk. A large proportion
of the net current liabilities comprise balances such as deferred income, acquisition related fair value adjustments and rent adjustments
that represent deferred items to be recognised in future periods through the income statement. Although the Group holds customer
deposits of £174.8 million which are refundable to customers, these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit
held for an individual customer is material. Therefore the directors do not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk.
The net current liabilities of the Group, excluding deferred income, were £0.1 million at 31 December 2008 (2007: £17.8 million).
It is considered appropriate to exclude deferred income in assessing the liquidity of the Group as it reﬂects the future non-refundable
contractual revenue of the Group to be recognised as revenue in the following period.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
In November 2008, the Group repaid the remaining £24 million of debt that remained outstanding on the £50 million facility after the
scheduled repayment of £12 million in April 2008. This debt was held at variable interest rates.
Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis. Whenever possible, and subject to
the operational requirements of the Group, cash is repatriated to the head ofﬁce and managed by the Group Treasury department.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries
are carried out in local currency. Working capital balances are generally held in the functional currency of the overseas subsidiary and
therefore the impact of the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities in the income statement of overseas subsidiaries is not
considered to have a material impact on the Group.
The majority of the Group’s net assets are in Pounds Sterling, US dollars and euros. During the year ended 31 December 2008 the
Group did not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate
ﬂuctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks. At 31 December 2008 there were no derivative ﬁnancial instruments
outstanding (2007: none)
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks
The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.
Capital management
The Group’s parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base. The
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer monitors the diversity of the Group’s major shareholders and further details of the Group’s communication with
key investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 26 to 31. In 2006, the Board approved the commencement
of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.

23. Financial instruments and ﬁnancial risk management continued
During the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group completed a reorganisation that introduced a new holding company for the Group.
This was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in the Group’s consolidated accounts and as a consequence the shareholders of Regus
Group plc became the shareholders of the new holding company, Regus plc. This reorganisation had no impact on the Group’s approach
to capital management.
The Group’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and both executive members of the Board hold
shares in the Company. Details of the Directors’ shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 33 to
39. In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share
capital in the market. In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both the need to issue shares under
the Group’s share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders. In the year ended 31 December
2008, 24,624,000 Regus Group plc and 3,200,000 Regus plc shares were repurchased in the market (2007: 12,853,001) and none were
used to satisfy obligations under the share option programme (2007: 905,299).
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group continued its share buyback programme during the year ended 31 December 2008. Regus Group plc declared an interim
dividend of 0.6p per share (2007: nil) during the year ended 31 December 2008 and Regus plc proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 1.2p per
share (2007: 1.0p per share) – an 80.0% increase on the 2007 dividend. There were no other changes to the Group’s approach to
capital management during the year.
The Group’s objective when managing capital (equity and borrowings) is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher
levels of borrowings with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Group’s return on capital employed for the
year ended 31 December 2008, deﬁned as operating proﬁt divided by total shareholders’ equity, was 30.7% (2007: 39.6%). During the
year the Group repaid the remaining outstanding balance of its principal secured ﬁnancing through an early repayment of £24 million.

Sensitivity analysis
At 31 December 2008 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Group’s proﬁt
before tax by approximately £1.5 million (2007: £0.4 million) with a corresponding increase in total equity.
It is estimated that a ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the
Group’s proﬁt before tax by approximately £3.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £3.1 million). It is estimated that
a ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the Group’s proﬁt before tax
by approximately £1.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £1.0 million).
It is estimated that a ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against Pounds Sterling would have decreased the
Group’s total equity by approximately £12.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £8.8 million). It is estimated that a
ﬁve percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against Pounds Sterling would have increased the Group’s total equity by
approximately £0.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £nil million).

Summary of methods and assumptions
Trade and other receivables/payables and customer deposits
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reﬂect the fair value.
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value of ﬁnance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash ﬂows at an appropriate discount rate which reﬂects current
market assessments and the risks speciﬁc to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts
The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at ﬂoating rates where payments
are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

Performance conditions for share options
The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest. The share
options vested based on the basic earnings per share (adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible amortisation) that
exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index. The basic earnings per share for performance purposes was 1p. 100% of the
options awarded in July and September 2004 vested during 2007.
The options awarded in March 2007, April 2007 and March 2008 have the same performance conditions as the CIP Awards granted in
the same year as described further below.

(a) The LTIP Awards have release dates of 3 November 2008 and 28 September 2009. There is no expiry date and therefore remaining contractual life on the basis that
the awards release immediately. The LTIP nil cost options have vesting dates of 3 November 2008 and 28 September 2009 and expiry dates of 3 November 2015 and
28 September 2016 respectively. The performance conditions for the LTIP awards made on 3 November 2005 are based on the ﬁnancial results for the year ended
31 December 2008 and therefore no awards were released during the year ended 31 December 2008.
(b) The CIP awards have release dates of 21 March 2009, 21 March 2010 and 18 March 2011. There is no expiry date and therefore remaining contractual life on the basis

* Adjusted EPS.
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in
determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion. The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must
have been met on a run rate or underlying basis. As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying
performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees ﬁt at the time, by way of example the following adjustments
are currently anticipated:
• In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive proﬁts in future years. As such it is important to
ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly those costs,
incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation. These would
include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from
investing in new locations.
• Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
• It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing
progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax
assets as the business strengthens, reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next. To provide greater clarity
and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
• The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ﬂow performance targets are a transparent and accurate
measure of the Company’s performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value. In
addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Company’s return to shareholders
is competitive compared to comparable companies. Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_71
The performance conditions for awards under the matching share element of the CIP made in March 2007 are set out below:
% increase in published EPS for the year ended 31 December 2009
compared to the published EPS for the prior year 15% 20% 25% 30%
Growth in free cash flow per share over 3 years

20% 19% 38% 56% 75%
25% 25% 50% 75% 100%
% denotes the % of the Award which will be released at the end of the performance period.
In addition, no awards will be released unless the Company’s TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of the companies
comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date of the grant subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Details of the performance conditions for the awards made in March 2008 can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee
on pages 35 to 36.
As mentioned above, awards under the CIP in respect of the bonus paid for the year ended 31 December 2008 will be made subsequent
to the publication of this report. However, the maximum number of awards granted will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the
time of grant and the monetary value will not exceed 50% of basic salary. Full details of the levels of award and performance conditions
will be disclosed in the Committee’s Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2009.

Notes to the accounts continued
Fair value accounting for business combinations
For each business combination, we assess the fair values of
assets and liabilities acquired. Where there is not an active market
in the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with
a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired
company do not provide sufﬁcient information to derive an accurate
valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based
on available information and experience.
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where
management’s judgement has an impact on the amounts
recorded include tangible ﬁxed assets, customer list intangibles
and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities. For
signiﬁcant business combinations management also obtains third
party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate
valuation to be included in the ﬁnancial statements.
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess
potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an
event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to
recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the carrying
value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and
make that determination based upon future cash ﬂow projections,
which assume certain growth projections which may or may not
occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying
value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value.
Further details of the methodology and assumptions applied to the
impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2008, including
the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, can be found
in note 12.
Tax assets and liabilities
We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current
tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other
expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and
rates, and their related interpretations, and future business results
may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation
of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax
consequences represents management’s best estimate of future
events that can be appropriately reﬂected in the accounting
estimates. It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax
asset when it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available
against which the assets can be used. The Group considers it
probable if the entity has made a taxable proﬁt in the previous year
and is forecast to continue to make a proﬁt in the foreseeable future.
Where appropriate the Group assesses the potential risk of future
tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple
tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for those
risks that can be estimated reliably. Changes in existing tax laws can
affect large international groups similar to Regus and could result in
signiﬁcant additional tax liabilities over and above those already
provided for.
Onerous lease provisions
We have identiﬁed certain poor performing centres where the
lease is considered onerous, i.e. the Group does not expect to
recover the unavoidable lease costs up to the ﬁrst break point.
The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net
amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the ﬁrst break
point, discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost
of capital.
Dilapidations
Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the
Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date
of signing the lease. The costs to bring the property back to that
condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the
Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date. However,
given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made
to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is
unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary.
Consequently, provision has been made only for those potential
dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outﬂow will
occur and can be reliably estimated.

I am pleased to report another year 
of good progress for Dunelm. On a 
consistent 52-week basis, we grew 
our total sales by 7.1%, driven by the 
opening of six new stores, 1.0% growth 
in our like-for-like store sales and 23.2% 
growth in our home delivery sales. We 
converted this revenue growth into 6.2% 
growth (5.1% growth on a 53-week basis) 
in pre-tax profits and 7.5% growth (6.3% 
growth on a 53-week basis) in earnings 
per share, notwithstanding our sustained 
investment in the business. 
This profit growth, coupled with strong 
cash flow, allows us to propose a 19.4% 
increase in the final dividend, which 
would increase the full year dividend by 
16.7%. In addition, we paid a special 
dividend of 31.5 pence per share during 
the year, bringing the total dividend 
proposed for the year to 56.6 pence 
per share, some £115m in shareholder 
distributions. In view of the scale of the 
special dividends in recent years, the 
Board has refined our dividend policy 
to provide a slightly higher ordinary 
dividend pay-out ratio, the details of 
which are included in the Chief Financial 
Officer’s report.
Dunelm has become the UK’s leading 
homewares retailer by offering customers 
an unrivalled proposition through our 
national network of 152 superstores and 
website, providing an extensive choice 
of good quality, great value products, 
backed up by the knowledge and 
expertise of nearly 9,000 colleagues. 
Let me thank all our colleagues for 
their tremendous contribution to our 
continuing success. We really appreciate 
their hard work and dedication.
Our Chief Executive, John Browett, 
describes in the following report the 
key initiatives which our teams are 
implementing to further strengthen our 
business and support future growth. 
These initiatives, which represent a 
considerable investment in the business, 
include exciting new store designs, 
investment in our online shop and its 
supporting infrastructure, and improved 
supply chain and warehousing which 
will improve product availability and 
efficiency. In addition, we shall continue 
to invest in our people with increased 
training and talent development 
programmes. In short, we aim to give our 
customers even more reasons to shop at 
Dunelm and to make Dunelm a better 
place for our colleagues to work.
We have successfully navigated a year 
of considerable change in our Board, 
with John Browett formally taking the 
CEO reins in January 2016, Keith Down 
becoming our new CFO in December 
2015 and two new Non-Executive 
Directors, William Reeve and Peter 
Ruis, joining our Board. John has also 
strengthened our Executive team with a 
number of new appointments, which are 
central to delivering our plans. We are 
pleased to have brought in strong new 
leadership whilst maintaining Dunelm’s 
distinct business principles and culture, 
which have sustained our growth since 
the business was founded by Bill and 
Jean Adderley in 1979. We are proud of 
our culture which is exemplified by our 
Deputy Chairman, Will Adderley.
The competitive landscape in retail 
continues to change at a fast pace 
with the growth of new competition, 
especially online. Our operating model 
has allowed us to gain market share in 
times of uncertainty, and post-Brexit,  
we are confident the same opportunities 
exist now. We have ambitious plans 
to continue to grow our business and 
we intend to grasp the opportunities 
to further strengthen our competitive 
position. We remain confident in the 
Dunelm proposition and look forward to 
reporting further progress.

MARKET SIZE AND GROWTH
The market has seen continued growth in the past year. 
There has been no immediate impact of Brexit but it is 
too early to ascertain longer term impact on demand in 
the homewares market. The UK homewares market is 
estimated to reach £11.6bn in 2016.
Dunelm continues to grow share and affirm its position 
with clear market leadership. Whilst the market remains 
fragmented, the top three retailers continue to grow 
share and now have a combined share of 19.2% vs 
15.1% four years ago.
Value for money is the most important consideration for 
a homewares customer, followed by quality and price. 
Dunelm’s proposition enables customers to buy across 
a broad spectrum of both price and quality. Dunelm has 
a market leading range and its key customer service 
metric, net promoter score, is consistently high.

We are working on making our website easier to 
access. We want to make the range and relevant 
content broader and provide an improved site 
experience. We also want to provide greater 
convenience through an increase in collection 
points, times and availability.
We have reviewed all activities carried out in 
store and found several opportunities to help 
our colleagues work more effectively. As a 
result, we have reduced task in the business 
and reinvested colleagues’ time into helping 
customers, improving service and driving sales.
We are trialling several new category merchandising 
initiatives and continue to improve the store format 
design as we open new stores, reflecting a lighter,

We have successfully opened our new 
warehouse in Stoke, which doubles our 
capacity and provides a purpose-built 
platform for reducing costs over time. We 
are correspondingly reducing our third party 
storage requirements which are costly and 
inefficient. Improved efficiency also enables us 
to offer better availability to our customers.
We are working hard to improve our offer 
through delivery of new ranges with better 
quality and greater choice. We are trialling new 
formats in store using room-sets and new ways 
to display products. We are working on an 
improved service model and our new point of 
sale system will help our colleagues to sell our 
entire online range in store. 
Great product is the lifeblood of our business. 
We have started working on a new strategic 
initiative (replacing stock management) to 
further improve our product ranges. We 
see major opportunities in product design, 
innovation and sourcing.
The work on product should enable us to grow 
by appealing to a broader set of customers 
across more categories. Our sourcing work 
should also improve our value for money 
proposition.

Dunelm AR2016-front.indd   9 12/10/2016   09:57:27 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
One of the great things about Dunelm 
is that we are able to offer tremendous 
value for money for our customers and 
an unrivalled range whilst remaining 
a low cost retailer. In the last year we 
have continued to strengthen our offer 
and expand our store base, allowing 
us to further increase market share and 
enhance our market leading position. 
We are confident that our ambitious 
plans will bring further improvements for 
customers and underpin our prospects, 
even if the market proves to be difficult.
Customers love what we do; our wide 
product ranges are suitable for all 
budgets and tastes. Our prices are 
always competitive or market leading. 
We have fantastic colleagues in our 
stores, in the supply chain and our 
support centre who give great service. 
We have high on-shelf availability in-
store and online. Indeed, our offer is 
unmatched by our competitors.
Our low cost model is a critical part of 
making our business work for customers. 
Our store costs are low because we 
have built a network of stores that work 
for customers but have been rented 
on sensible terms. We have modern 
IT systems that are cost effective and 
easy to upgrade. By running a defined 
contribution pension scheme we have 
clear costs and no legacy liabilities. We 
always endeavour to run a lean operation 
so we can invest more in lower prices 
and better products.
Last year, we continued to improve the 
shopping trip for our customers. We 
have improved our ranges, have become 
more competitive on price, made our 
stores easier to shop and launched a 
vastly improved website. I think almost 
all our customers have noticed the work 
we have done to clear the aisles, put the 
product back into logical places and run 
our promotions much more tightly and 
effectively. These may seem like small 
things, but through customer feedback 
we know they make a major difference.
The improvements in the customer offer 
are paid for by running our business 
more effectively. We continue to work on 
developing our IT platform to provide 
more efficient processes as well as a 
better customer experience in-store and 
online. Our internal ‘Keep it Simple’ 
programme looks at activity in our head 
office to ensure that we are eliminating 
unnecessary work or improving broken 
processes. Last year, we invested heavily 
in our logistics infrastructure to enable 
better customer service at lower costs 
in the future. The store teams have also 
made great progress in simplifying their 
operation to free up hours to serve 
customers.
In the year ahead it may be that the 
economy proves to be difficult. However, 
even if there are short term problems, 
life continues and for a business like 
Dunelm this is almost sure to bring 
new opportunities. Our ‘Simply Value 
for Money’ proposition becomes even 
more appealing if consumers feel under 
financial pressure. In addition, our 
business is not significantly reliant on 
big-ticket purchases; our average basket 
size remains around £30.
Dunelm is a strong business due to the 
level of profit and cash flow generated, 
combined with its low leverage, even 
including our lease liabilities. None of 
that changes because of Brexit. Indeed, 
in uncertain times our strengths become 
even more of an advantage. It should 
mean that we can expand faster and 
offer even more to our customers.
At the end of my first year, I’d like to 
express what a tremendous privilege it 
is to work with all of our colleagues at 
Dunelm and I want to thank them for all 
their effort, enthusiasm and dedication 
to making Dunelm a great place to shop 
and work. It is hard to get everything 
right every day, but it is both pleasurable 
and rewarding to find a company which 
is always trying to do the right thing.
Growth Strategy 
When we reported our half year results in 
February, we reiterated our commitment 
to our three-part growth strategy; 
growing like-for-like sales, rolling out new 
stores and growing our home delivery 
channel. We also identified eight key 
initiatives that I believe will enable us to 
achieve this and will be the key method 
by which we improve our business 
substantially for our customers and 
shareholders over the medium term. 
Online
Whilst we continue to work towards 
increasing our store estate to 200 stores, 
we still believe in a multi-channel world 
for homewares and continue to see 
online as a critical part of our shopping 
trip.
We are working on making our website 
easier to access; for example allowing 
customers to browse and order in-
store. We want to make the range and 
relevant content broader and provide an 
improved site experience. We also want 
to provide greater convenience through 
an increase in collection points, times 
and availability.
We have also made progress in multiple 
other areas. The integration of our one-
man fulfilment process into our Stoke 
distribution centre is a significant step 
towards broader fulfilment options. 
We have grown our email database to 
over two million customers, an increase 
of 18%. We have an online Made to 
Measure service, and are building a 
more comprehensive solution, due to be 
launched later this year.
Over the coming year, we are looking 
to extend our range through a new 
DSV (drop shipped vendor) service. We 
are also rolling out tablet devices and 
associated chip and pin payment options 
in-store and are working towards a full 
Click & Collect service.
London
As part of our challenge to find 50 
new stores to reach our 200 target, we 
recognise that London and the South 
East will provide a significant proportion 
of this opportunity.
Encouragingly, we have legally 
committed to nine new stores in the 
coming year, of which three are within

Chief Executive’s Review
Dunelm AR2016-front.indd   10 12/10/2016   09:57:35 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5  
the M25; an excellent result given that 
we have only eight stores currently in this 
area.
We are also focusing on improving the 
capability of our colleagues in the region 
and will be looking to increase our online 
participation in London, aided by the 
increased store presence. 
Store Operations 
We have reviewed all activities 
carried out in-store and found several 
opportunities to help our colleagues 
work more effectively. As a result, we 
have reduced hours worked on certain 
tasks in the business, partially to mitigate 
the cost of introducing the National 
Living Wage, but more importantly to 
reinvest back into helping customers, 
improving service and driving sales. 
We see this as a continual process, with 
several rounds of improvements that will 
allow us to continue to reinvest in wages 
and service.
Store Format
Our customers love our stores, but they 
do tell us that we could make them 
easier to shop, particularly in terms of 
navigation and making our displays more 
attractive. 
We are trialling several new category 
merchandising initiatives, and are 
particularly pleased with the work that 
we have done around rugs, lighting and 
the till area. We will continue to roll these 
out across the estate in the coming year. 
We also continue to improve the store 
format design as we open new stores. 
Our recent openings in Nottingham and 
Sheffield in particular reflect a lighter, 
more open environment with lower 
shelving and easier navigation. We are 
aiming to refit around 15 stores in FY17 
in this new format, as well as using the 
format in our new store openings. 
Made to Measure
Made to Measure is a service that 
differentiates us from most of our 
competitors. We manufacture the 
majority of our curtains ourselves and 
offer great value for money. 
We are trialling new operations in-store 
and developing a greater understanding 
of how investment in service, 
presentation and range can enhance 
our offer. We are looking to improve our 
manufacturing performance by creating 
more efficiency in our processes. We 
are also working on a new IT system 
to manage customer orders and make 
things easier for customers. 
Furniture
Dunelm continues to develop its 
furniture offer across all channels. We are 
working hard to deliver new ranges, with 
better quality and greater choice. We are 
trialling new formats in-store using room-
sets and new ways to display products. 
We are also working on an improved 
service model and our new POS system 
will help our colleagues to sell our entire 
range in-store.
Supply Chain
We have successfully opened our new 
warehouse in Stoke, which doubles our 
capacity and provides a purpose-built 
platform for reducing costs over time. 
We are correspondingly reducing our 
third party storage requirements which 
are costly and inefficient. 
We are near the end of the process of 
moving our one-man delivery operation 
into Stoke, which is a precursor to 
moving to a Click & Collect offer. This 
will enhance the attractiveness of our 
online offer by providing greater choice 
and ease to customers. 
We will look to further integrate our 
e-commerce and direct-to-store 
distribution over time. This will enable 
improved availability, productivity and a 
cleaner end of season clearance. 
Stock Management
To meet customer expectations, we rely 
on having full ranges available in-store 
which previously resulted in a high 
stock holding. We are working towards 
reducing the amount of stock that we 
hold whilst improving availability. This 
will make us more efficient and enable us 
to reinvest in the customer offer. 
We have reduced our stock holding by 
£16.5m (12.4%) during the course of 
the year by focussing on sensible retail 
disciplines such as reducing minimum 
order quantities, reducing pack sizes 
and through the better use of order 
replenishment systems. In-store we have 
focused on better stock management, 
both on shelf and back of house, by 
enhancing stock control processes. 
Although we believe we can reduce 
stock levels further in time, we consider 
this to be business as usual and stock 
management will therefore no longer 
form one of our strategic initiatives in 
FY17. 
Product 
Great product is the lifeblood of our 
business. We have started work on  
a new strategic initiative (replacing 
stock management) to further improve 
our product ranges. We see major 
opportunities in product design, 
innovation and sourcing.
The work on product should enable us 
to grow by appealing to a broader set of 
customers across more categories. Our 
sourcing work should also improve our 
value for money proposition. 
Enablers 
While our key initiatives are the 
focus for improving the business for 
customers, there are several initiatives 
we are working on to make the business 
more effective. This work ranges from 
‘Keep it Simple’ changes in the Store 
Support Centre and Contact Centre, to 
developing our IT systems to support 
the key initiatives and customer offer. We 
could also talk at length about the use of 
better customer insight, service and sales 
training in stores and investment in skills 
and training across the Company. 
At Dunelm we are always looking for 
opportunities and working on making 
our business better for customers and a 
more fulfilling place to work. The agenda 
is always ambitious. 
Outlook
Whatever the market brings us, our 
strategy remains unchanged. Indeed, 
we may be able to achieve more in a 
difficult economy. We can’t forecast 
what will happen to the broader market 
but we know we will be busy improving 
our Company, through our self-help 
initiatives and also by continuing to roll-
out and reinvest in our stores. 
As we have seen in previous years, hot 
weather can have a dampening effect on 
footfall, so the start to the new financial 
year has inevitably seen some impact 
here. However, the weather is outside 
of our control and our job is to trade 
through such periods. 
Encouragingly, we believe that we 
continue to outperform the homewares 
market as a whole and therefore are 
confident of continuing to deliver on 
our growth ambitions, including new 
store openings which should number 
at least nine this year. We have the key 
infrastructure in place, the right team, a 
great heritage and a continued focus on 
product and people.

13 Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the period ended 2 July 2016
Dunelm AR2016-front.indd   13 12/10/2016   09:57:51 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
The year ended 2 July 2016 was a 
52 week accounting period but the 
comparative year ended 4 July 2015 
was a 53 week accounting period. 
The additional 53rd week last year 
contributed £13.1m of revenue and 
£1.2m of operating profit. Unless 
otherwise stated, reference to 2015 or 
the comparative year relates to this 53 
week period.
Revenue
Group revenue for FY16 was £880.9m 
(FY15: £835.8m), an increase of 5.4% for 
the full financial year and 7.1% on a 52 
week basis. Like-for-like (‘LFL’) sales grew 
by 2.5% on a 52 week basis as a result of 
growth in both in-store LFL sales (+1.0%) 
and home delivery sales (+23.2%). Over 
the financial year as a whole, home 
delivery sales represented 7.0% of total 
business (FY15: 6.1%).
Our store expansion programme 
continued with six new openings in the 
year (of which two were relocations). 
We also closed our high street store 
in Coalville, leaving a portfolio of 152 
superstores and five stores in high street 
locations.

Gross Margin
Gross margin increased by 60 basis 
points to 49.8% (FY15: 49.2%). Gross 
margin in FY15 was impacted by a high 
level of markdown needed to clear 
excess stocks (particularly furniture). In 
FY16, however, we have improved our 
product life cycle management, stock 
turn and absolute stock levels.
Operating Costs
Operating costs in FY16 grew by 7.1% 
compared with the prior year, an increase 
of £20.5m, or by 9.1% on a 52 week 
basis, an increase of £25.7m. The main 
drivers of this increase were:
 z Store portfolio growth – six new store 
openings and two closures;
 z Multi-channel fulfilment – the value 
of business through this channel rose 
by 23.2% compared with the previous 
year;
 z Warehousing infrastructure – we 
invested £3.0m in transition costs 
associated with the opening of 
our new Distribution Centre (‘DC’) 
in Stoke. This DC will significantly 
increase our ability to deliver 
multi-channel fulfilment operations 
and negates the need to operate 
additional third party storage facilities;
 z Store labour – the increase in the 
National Living Wage has been offset 
by productivity savings;
 z IT capability – recognising the 
importance of IT in our business, we 
have again significantly increased the 
scale and capability of our internal IT 
function. We have also seen the first 
year of amortisation relating to our 
web re-platform;
 z Marketing – increased spend on 
digital marketing to replace loss 
of natural search following web re-
platform; and
 z Administration – we have invested 
in the Board and Executive team to 
support the continued growth of the 
business.
Looking ahead, a number of these 
cost drivers will continue to apply in 
the new financial year as we open new 
stores, look to refit 15 stores into our 
new format, grow our home delivery 
business further and continue to invest in 
IT and management to support our key 
initiatives.
Operating Profit
Group operating profit for the financial 
year was £129.3m (FY15: £122.5m), 
an increase of £6.8m (5.6%). On a 52 
week basis operating profit increased by 
£8.0m, an increase of 6.6%. Operating 
profit margin was 14.7% (FY15: 14.7%). 
In the year the business invested in 
operating costs (described above) 
to enhance key infrastructure and 
capabilities to deliver future growth. 
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation were 
£154.3m (FY15: £144.2m, £142.6m 
on a 52 week basis).This represents 
an increase of 7.1% on the previous 
financial year, or 8.2% on a 52 week 
basis. The EBITDA margin achieved was 
17.5% of sales (FY15: 17.3%, 17.3% on a 
52 week basis).

Chief Financial Officer’s Review
Dunelm AR2016-front.indd   14 12/10/2016   09:57:53 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5  
Financial Items
The Group incurred a net financial 
expense of £0.4m in FY16 (FY15: £0.1m 
income). Interest and amortisation of 
costs arising from the Group’s revolving 
credit facility amounted to £1.6m (FY15 
£0.7m). These costs were partially offset 
by interest earned on cash deposits of 
£0.2m (FY15: £0.5m) and gains of £1.0m 
(FY15: £0.3m) resulting from foreign 
exchange differences on the translation 
of dollar denominated assets and 
liabilities. 
As at 2 July 2016 the Group held $90.5m 
(FY15: $91.5m) in US dollar forward 
contracts, representing approximately 
61% of the anticipated US dollar spend 
over the next financial year. Surplus US 
dollar cash deposits amounted to $1.6m 
(FY15: $3.2m).
Hedging
Due to the Brexit vote that took place 
close to the Group’s period end, the 
hedging balance was material at  
2 July 2016, and additional disclosures 
have been included in the notes to 
the financial statements. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described below. In addition, note 16  
to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, 
its financial risk objectives, details of 
its financial instruments and hedging 
activities, and its exposures to credit and 
liquidity risk.
PBT
After accounting for interest and foreign 
exchange impacts, profit before tax for 
the financial year amounted to £128.9m 
(FY15: £122.6m), an increase of 5.1%. 
On a comparable 52 week basis this 
represents an increase of 6.2% over 
FY15.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was 20.6% 
of profit before tax, compared with 
21.6% in the prior year. This reflects 
the reduction in the headline rate of 
corporation tax from 20.75% in FY15 
to 20.0% this year. The tax charge 
is expected to trend approximately 
75-80 bps above the headline rate 
of corporation tax going forward, 
principally due to depreciation charged 
on non-qualifying capital expenditure.
PAT and EPS
Profit after tax was £102.3m (FY15: 
£96.1m), an increase of 6.5%.
Basic earnings per share (EPS) for the 
52 weeks ended 2 July 2016 was 50.5p 
(FY15: 47.5p), an increase of 6.3%. Fully 
diluted EPS increased by 6.3% to 50.3p 
(FY15: 47.3p). This is a rise of 7.5% on 
a comparable 52 week basis (FY15 52 
week: 46.8p).
Operating Cash Flow
Dunelm continues to deliver strong cash 
returns. In FY16 the Group generated 
£148.2m (FY15: £118.2m) of net cash 
from operating activities, an increase of 
25.4%.
Year-end working capital decreased by 
£18.3m compared with the previous 
year-end. This reflects our drive to 
improve product life cycle management 
and increase stock turn. At the end of 
the year the Group had £16.5m lower 
inventories than the prior year despite 
the investment in new stores. Trade 
and other payables due within one year 
increased by £7.4m primarily as a result 
of an increase in the capital creditor as a 
result of the completion of our new DC 
in Stoke at the end of the year.
Capital Expenditure
Gross capital expenditure in the financial 
year was £42.5m compared with £31.5m 
in FY15. Significant investments were 
made in the opening of our second 
distribution centre in Stoke (£11.9m), IT 
infrastructure (£7.2m) and in acquiring 
the Fogarty brand (£4.8m). In addition 
we invested £18.0m in the continued 
growth and development of the store 
portfolio with the addition of six new 
superstores and seven major refits. 
We expect higher capital expenditure in 
the next financial year of approximately 
£50m to support the business’ growth 
strategy. We expect to open more new 
stores (requiring an average investment 
of £1.2m per store), we plan to carry 
out a number of major store refits 
(approximately £20m in total), and 
will continue to invest in IT systems 
development (estimated at £6m) and 
supply chain improvements (estimated 
at £5m). We will also consider freehold 
store acquisitions on an opportunistic 
basis, with FY17 having already seen 
the purchase of a freehold property in 
Shoreham for £5.5m.
Banking Agreements and 
Net Debt
The Group has in place a £150m 
syndicated Revolving Credit Facility 
(‘RCF’) which matures in 2020. The 
terms of the RCF are consistent with 
normal practice and include covenants 
in respect of leverage (net debt to be 
no greater than 2.5× EBITDA) and fixed 
charge cover (EBITDA to be no less than 
1.5× fixed charges), both of which were 
met comfortably as at 2 July 2016.
In addition the Group maintains £20m of 
uncommitted overdraft facilities with two 
syndicate partner banks.

15 Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the period ended 2 July 2016
Dunelm AR2016-front.indd   15 12/10/2016   09:57:54 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
Net debt at 2 July 2016 was £79.3m 
(0.51x historical EBITDA) compared 
with £73.6m in FY15 (0.51× historical 
EBITDA). Daily average net debt in 
FY16 was approximately £50.0m. This 
compares with an average of £75.4m 
in FY15 from the date of the special 
distribution (20 March 2015) following 
the inception of our RCF . 
Capital and  
Dividend Policy 
During FY15, the Board adopted a new 
policy on capital structure, targeting an 
average net debt level (excluding lease 
obligations and short-term fluctuations 
in working capital) of between 0.25× 
and 0.75× historical EBITDA. This policy 
provides the flexibility to continue to 
invest in the Group’s growth strategy 
and to take advantage of investment 
opportunities as and when they arise, for 
example freehold property acquisitions. 
At the year end, net debt/EBITDA was 
0.51× (FY15: 0.51×).
The Board’s policy on dividends in FY15 
was that ordinary dividend cover (by 
which we mean the Group’s earnings 
per share divided by the total amount 
paid to shareholders by way of ordinary 
dividend) should be between 2 and 2.5× 
in the full year in respect of which the 
dividend is paid. The Board has decided 
to move the targeted range of dividend 
cover to a range of 1.75 and 2.25×, 
reflecting the strong cash generation in 
the business and the Board’s confidence 
in the growth prospects of the business.
The Board will consider further special 
distributions in the future if average 
net debt over a period consistently 
falls below the minimum target of 
0.25× EBITDA, subject to known and 
anticipated investment plans at the time.
The Group’s full capital and dividend 
policy is available on our website at 
www.dunelm.com.
Dividend and Special 
Dividend Paid
Reflecting the capital and dividend 
policy, an interim dividend of 6.0p per 
share was paid in March 2016 (FY15: 
5.5p). It is proposed to pay a final 
dividend of 19.1p per share (FY16: 
16.0p), subject to shareholder approval. 
The total dividend of 25.1p represents an 
increase of 16.7% over the previous year, 
giving a dividend cover of 2.0× (FY15: 
2.2×). The final dividend will be paid on 
25 November 2016 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on  
4 November 2016.
During the year, the Group returned 
excess capital of £63.8m (31.5p per 
share) to shareholders in the form of a 
special dividend.
In total the Group returned £108.4m to 
shareholders by way of dividend in the 
year, the equivalent of 53.5p per share.
Distributable Reserves
During the current financial year, the 
Group undertook a capital restructuring 
exercise which facilitated the payment of 
dividends from subsidiary undertakings 
to Dunelm Group plc of £359m. 
Consequently the Parent Company has 
retained earnings of £242.8m as at 2 July 
2016.
Share Buy-back
During the year, the Group invested 
£7.8m to buy 841,359 shares to hold 
in treasury in line with its policy to 
purchase shares in the market to satisfy 
the future exercise of options granted 
under incentive plans and other share 
schemes. At the year-end, 846,455 
shares were held in treasury, equivalent 
to approximately 42% of options 
outstanding. Over time, we expect to 
increase our holding in treasury to be 
equivalent to approximately 60% of 
outstanding options.
Since the year end £4.2m has been 
invested to purchase an additional 
500,000 shares into treasury.
Tax Policy
The Group has a straightforward and 
transparent tax policy. The aim is to 
comply with all relevant tax legislation 
and pay all taxes due, in full and on time 
as well as actively managing tax affairs 
and only to engage in tax planning 
where this is aligned with commercial 
and economic activity and does not lead 
to an abusive result. We would normally 
expect our corporation tax charge to 
be higher than the statutory tax rate. 
HMRC has recently renewed the Group’s 
low-risk tax status. Further details of the 
Group’s tax policy are available on our 
website, www.dunelm.com.
During the year, total tax contributions 
paid to HMRC in the form of corporation 
tax, property taxes, PAYE and NICs and 
VAT were £140.8m (FY15: £122.7m).
Treasury Management
The Group Board has established an 
overall Treasury Policy, day-to-day 
management of which is delegated to 
me as Chief Financial Officer. The policy 
aims to ensure the following:
 z Effective management of all clearing 
bank operations
 z Access to appropriate levels of 
funding and liquidity
 z Effective monitoring and 
management of all banking covenants
 z Optimal investment of surplus cash 
within an approved risk/return profile
 z Appropriate management of foreign 
exchange exposures and cash flows
Key Performance 
Indicators
In addition to the traditional financial 
measures of sales and profits, the 
Directors review business performance 
each month using a range of other KPIs. 
These include measures shown on  
pages 12 and 13.

The Board as a whole takes responsibility for management of risk throughout the business. 
We believe that risk is best managed by a combination of the following:
 z Formal risk management processes as described in this report
 z The Board and senior management leading by example
 z Alignment through shareholding
 z Embedding our culture and values
Given the size of our Board and the relative lack of complexity in our business, we do not 
have a separate Board Risk Committee; our Audit and Risk Committee oversees the risk 
management process as part of its activities.
Board Collective responsibility for  
managing risk
 X Formal review of principal risks twice annually – one of which is in connection 
with consideration of the viability statement (see further below)

Risk management framework
The Board confirms that:
 z there is an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks faced by the Group;
 z the systems have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts;
 z they are regularly reviewed by the Board; and
 z the systems accord with the guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council’s guidance on risk management, internal 
control and related financial and business reporting issued in September 2014.
The diagram below sets out how responsibility for risk management is allocated and how that responsibility is discharged:

Dunelm AR2016-front.indd   17 12/10/2016   09:57:55 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
The Audit and Risk Committee has 
oversight of the system of internal 
controls and of the external assurance 
programme and receives the report of 
the external auditor following the annual 
statutory audit. For further details please 
see the Audit and Risk Committee 
report.
It should be noted that internal control 
systems such as this are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and 
can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material loss 
or accounting misstatement.
Although no significant control 
weaknesses have been identified as a 
result of the review, the Board agreed 
that the Audit and Risk Committee would 
look at how assurance of performance 
against the controls is gained to identify 
whether any further assurance is needed.
Process for preparing 
consolidated financial 
statements
The Group has established internal 
control and risk management systems 
in relation to the process for preparing 
consolidated financial statements. The 
key features of these systems are:
 z Management regularly monitors 
and considers developments in 
accounting regulations and best 
practice in finance reporting 
and, where appropriate, reflects 
developments in the consolidated 
financial statements. The external 
auditor also keeps the Audit and 
Risk Committee apprised of these 
developments.
 z The Audit and Risk Committee 
and the Board review the draft 
consolidated financial statements.  
The Audit and Risk Committee 
receives reports from management 
and the external auditors on 
significant judgements, changes 
in accounting policies, changes in 
accounting estimates and other 
pertinent matters relating to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 z The full year financial statements are 
subject to external audit and the half 
year financial statements are reviewed 
by the external auditor.

The Board confirms that it has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The Board’s assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group and the mitigation in place is set out below. 
Following a review of the risks as part of the process to support the viability statement, the Board decided to amend the 
description of some of the risks set out below; the categorisation used in last year’s report is recorded in the table. The risks 
themselves have not changed materially, with the exception of the addition of the risks associated with the United Kingdom’s exit 
from the European Union.

Competition, 
market and 
customers
The Group competes 
with a wide variety of 
retailers across multiple 
channels and across a 
broad spectrum of price-
points. Failure to maintain 
a competitive offer in 
the homewares market 
on multiple fronts (price, 
range, quality and service) 
and/or to respond to 
changing customer needs 
could materially impact 
profitability and limit 
opportunities for growth.
 z Comparative performance within 
the homewares market tracked 
monthly across all main product 
categories.
 z Customer insight research gauges 
relative customer perception and 
experience.
 z Investment in store design 
and marketing designed to 
communicate our credentials on 
range, choice and value.
 z We continually focus on new 
product development, both in 
existing and new homewares 
categories, to strengthen our 
specialist proposition.
Board oversight: 
Reviewed annually in depth by the 
Board at its Strategy Day.

The quality and safety of 
our products and services is 
essential to the business. 
We must also ensure that 
our suppliers share and 
uphold our approach to 
business ethics, human 
rights (including safety and 
modern slavery) and the 
environment. 
Failure to do so could result 
in harm to individuals and 
consumers, colleagues and 
other stakeholders losing 
confidence in the Dunelm 
brand.
 z We have a range of policies 
specifying the quality of 
products and production 
processes which suppliers must 
adopt.
 z We operate a full test schedule 
for all new products and on 
a sample basis for on-going 
lines, overseen by our specialist 
Product Technology team. 
 z Food hygiene is maintained 
through the adoption of clear 
operating guidelines contained 
in our food safety manual. Staff 
certification is compulsory and 
risk assessments, equipment 
inspections and compliance 
audits are performed regularly 
to ensure standards are 
maintained.
 z All stock and food suppliers 
and the majority of our other 
suppliers are required to sign 
up to our Anti-Bribery and 
Ethical Codes of Conduct which 
is in line with international 
guidelines, and also specifically 
covers modern slavery.
 z We conduct periodic audits on 
all stock suppliers against our

Going concern
The Directors have made appropriate 
enquiries and formed a judgement 
at the time of approving the financial 
statements that it is appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial information.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision 2.2 of the 
2014 Corporate Governance Code, in 
addition to the going concern statement, 
the Directors have also assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a longer 
period. 
The Directors confirm that the Group 
has considerable financial strength, 
and therefore they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due for the next five years, 
ending 3 July 2021. 
A period of five years has been chosen 
as this is the timeframe currently 
adopted by the Board as its strategic 
and financial planning horizon, and the 
business is largely dependent on UK 
consumer confidence and discretionary 
spending which is difficult to project 
beyond this period. 
The five year plan considers the Group’s 
earnings growth potential, its cash flows, 
financing options and key financial 
ratios, taking into account the economic 
outlook and principal risks and mitigation 
affecting the Group. 
This assessment of viability has been 
made with reference to the Group’s 
current position and future prospects, 
its strategy, the market outlook and its 
principal risks and the mitigation in place 
to manage them. These were reviewed 
by the Directors at their annual Strategy 
Day in May 2016 when the five year 
plan and the budget for the following 
year was considered and again at the 
September 2016 meeting, when the 
potential effect of the United Kingdom’s 
exit from the European Union was also 
considered. 
The Board considers that the risk 
most likely to occur in the near future 
is a reduction of sales due to a fall in 
consumer confidence following the 
Brexit vote, and an increase in its cost 
base as a result of the fall in the value of 
sterling against the US dollar. However, 
it also considers that the likely impact 
of any of the principal risks materialising 
would be a reduction in the level of 
sales growth and possibly a resultant 
weakening in gross margin. 
As a result, a number of sales and gross 
margin based sensitivities against the 
five year plan have been reviewed by 
the Audit and Risk Committee and the 
Board as part of the assessment made 
to support this statement, together with 
the actions which could be taken to 
mitigate these. Account was also taken 
of the Group’s strong balance sheet and 
relatively low level of debt. 
In the scenarios reviewed by the Board 
the likely impact could be absorbed 
over the term of the financial forecasts 
by making adjustments to its operating 
plans within the normal course of 
business (without impacting its external 
financing or capital and dividend policy).

Our key areas of focus – why these matter
Our core strength as a business is the delivery of market 
leading choice of products and services, at great value for 
money, and an enjoyable shopping experience, backed 
up by friendly and knowledgeable customer service. We 
can only deliver this by having customer interests at the 
heart of our business.
Who manages this for Dunelm: Marketing Director
We have a duty of care which we take very seriously to 
ensure the health and safety of customers, colleagues, 
contractors and all other visitors to our premises. The 
Group’s Health and Safety manager regularly reports to 
Board and Executive Boards, and there is an on-going 
programme of education and training for colleagues.
Who manages this for Dunelm: Chief Executive
We believe that a ‘Great Place to Work = Great Place 
to Shop’. Our success is founded on the hard work and 
dedication of our colleagues; our aim is to preserve our 
culture and values as embodied in our ‘Key Business 
Principles’ as we grow, to provide our colleagues with 
more opportunities and more training, and to celebrate 
their success.
Who manages this for Dunelm: People Director
We do not manufacture the vast majority of the products 
that we sell; therefore we need to maintain relationships 
with suppliers and manufacturers worldwide who can meet 
our high standards for design, innovation, quality and value. 
These suppliers must also demonstrate that they operate in 
accordance with recognised standards that uphold human 
rights and safety and prohibit modern slavery.

We recognise that we have a responsibility to manage 
the impact of our business on the environment both now 
and in the future. The Group is committed to controlling 
and minimising the impact of its operations, directly and

What do we do?
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for the creation and implementation 
of our health and safety policy and 
procedures, which include an effective 
system of ‘upward’ and ‘downward’ 
communication, appropriate standards 
for monitoring performance and 
ensuring that sufficient resources are 
available to support this activity.
Health and safety is a standard agenda 
item at every Board and Executive Board 
meeting and each of these receive a 
monthly report and a formal annual 
presentation from the Group’s Health 
and Safety Manager with accident/risk 
analysis, review of previous objectives 
and agreement of new objectives for the 
next year.
Although senior management 
take responsibility for the overall 
implementation, maintenance and 
development of our safety management 
system, every colleague has a 
responsibility for the safety of themselves 
and other colleagues, customers and 
visitors.
In our stores, each store manager 
is responsible for ensuring the 
implementation of health and safety 
policy and procedures in his or her store, 
supported by the area manager and the 
Group Health and Safety Manager. At 
our Stoke distribution centre we have 
a dedicated Health and Safety Adviser. 
Risk assessments are in place at all 
Company sites and updated as required.
We have an in-house health and safety 
audit, which monitors compliance to 
policy and procedures and is reviewed 
annually to ensure that it meets best 
practice industry standards and to 
address any specific risks identified. Our 
stores complete an online self-audit

Where non-compliance is discovered 
we have a formal procedure for working 
with a supplier to help them achieve 
compliance, usually within three months. 
Critical non-conformances such as use 
of child labour, working against choice/
slavery or absence of valid Building 
or Fire Certificates are escalated 
immediately, and supplies cease until the 
issue has been resolved. Ultimately, if 
progress is inadequate, we will cease to 
trade with the supplier.
We aim to treat all of our suppliers 
fairly and consistently. We ask all of our 
suppliers to sign our standard terms and 
conditions in advance of commencing 
trade. 
We have signed up to the Prompt 
Payment Code which requires companies 
to pay suppliers in accordance with 
agreed terms, with a default period of 
60 days. The number of days’ purchases 
outstanding for payment at 2 July 2016 
was 38 days (2015: 42 days).
 Other achievements
 z Clearer communication to suppliers 
about corrective actions and what is 
expected to make the improvements.
 z Black audits (critical failures) reduced 
from 27 in 2015 to 5 in 2016.

audit style.
2016/17 objectives

a four week period) 4 Pillar SMETA 
audits for stock products. 
 z Extend audit regime to major coffee 
shop suppliers and non-stocked

to be granted to factories with a 
“red” rating, unless they are new to 
Dunelm or have shown a marked 
improvement in their corrective 
actions.
 z Include training on ethical and slavery 
matters in induction for all members 
of the Buying Team, with annual 
refresher training.
 z Introduce Factory Profile 
Questionnaire for potential vendors.
 z Roll out Technical Audits to top 30% 
of factories for stock products.

What do we do?
Effective management of human rights 
throughout our supply chain is built into 
our product procurement procedures. 
Our in-house technology team has 
extensive experience of working with 
factories to improve quality and ethical 
standards. Monitoring and working to 
improve human rights is part of the 
factory management role carried out by 
our Far East sourcing partners on our 
behalf.
All suppliers of product for resale have 
been made aware of the growing risk 
of modern day slavery and have been 
reissued with the Dunelm Ethical Code 
of Conduct, based on the Ethical Trading 
Initiative (‘ETI’) base code which has a 
strengthened section on slavery. New 
ethical audits will be semi-announced, 
4 Pillar SMETA audits. This is to gain a 
more realistic view of the manufacturer 
and learn more about the ethical stance 
of the company. 
We have assessed the remainder of our 
supply base for modern slavery risk and 
have required the major providers to 
sign our revised Code of Conduct. Our 
statement made pursuant to Section 54, 
Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, 
which contains further information, is 
available at www.dunelm.com.
We work with our suppliers to ensure 
that our products are produced in clean 
and safe environments, that workers 
are treated with respect and earn a 
reasonable wage and that suppliers 
work within the relevant local laws and 
regulations. All manufacturers with whom 
we trade directly are required to sign up 
to our Code of Conduct. No new factory 
source is taken on without a satisfactory 
audit being in place, and audits are 
repeated at least every two years.

What do we do?
We and our colleagues believe that 
the Company should contribute to 
the communities in which we operate, 
both nationally and in the local store 
community.
The Group pays corporation tax on its 
operations in the United Kingdom and 
does not operate in any tax havens, or 
use any tax avoidance schemes.
We have a Charity Committee which 
adopts a ‘charity of the year’, for which 
collections are made in-store, specific 
fund-raising events are organised and 
the Group makes its own donations. 
Each store has a ‘Charity Champion’ and 
amounts raised by store are reported 
monthly, with the top three recognised in 
the Dunelm Gazette.
We also support colleagues who are 
raising money for charities of their 
choice, often by matching the sums 
raised. All colleagues are entitled to 
an extra day’s paid leave to undertake 
charitable activities.
We donate funds raised from English and 
Scottish carrier bag sales to Roald Dahl’s 
Marvellous Children’s Charity, and from 
Welsh carrier bag sales to GroundWork. 
GroundWork is a charitable organisation 
which brings people and the 
environment together with practical local 
action to build stronger communities, 
create more green spaces and get 
people back into work through creating 
green jobs.
The total value of charitable donations 
made by the Group in the period ended 
2 July 2016 was £58,541 (2015: £98,000). 
Total funds raised for charity by the 
Group and colleagues was £231,328 
(2015: £366,000).

Dunelm is committed to controlling and 
minimising the impact of its business on 
the environment. 
The Group has an Environment 
Committee responsible for the 
development and implementation of 
strategies to maximise waste recycling 
and to reduce energy consumption and 
carbon (CO2) emissions. 
What we do
Dunelm operates a ‘Recycle at Work’ 
initiative across the business aimed 
at achieving high levels of recycling. 
All sites have balers for cardboard 
and colour-coded bins to segregate 
waste and are supported by training 
programmes that increase colleague 
awareness and compliance.
Our national distribution centre in Stoke 
recycles all of our cardboard, plastics, 
paper, bottles, cans, metal and wooden-
pallets. In addition all electrical waste 
is recycled through a WEEE compliant 
scheme. Any waste that is not directly 
recycled within the business is sent 
offsite for further sortation.
The Group achieves a direct recycling 
rate of 78%. This increases to circa 90% 
following offsite sortation.
Key objectives
 z To maximise levels of waste recycling.
 z To anticipate and to be fully 
compliant with all waste legislation.
2016/17 objectives
 z We will audit all sites to ensure that 
the latest equipment, signage and 
training is in place.
 z We will engage colleagues to 
promote greater awareness and to 
drive consistently high standards.
 z We will launch a new scheme to 
recycle all take-away coffee cups in 
support sites.

Dunelm AR2016-front.indd   33 12/10/2016   09:58:13 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
Heading
What we do
Dunelm targets energy reduction on 
a site-by-site basis. ‘Smart’ meters are 
fitted to electricity and gas supplies 
and measure energy consumption on a 
half-hourly basis. Building Management 
Systems (‘BMS’) designed to optimise 
energy use, are also standard across the 
estate. 
Energy consumption is monitored 
by our dedicated Energy Manager in 
conjunction with a specialist energy 
partner. We target underperforming sites 
as well as the implementation of various 
energy reduction initiatives to maximise 
energy efficiency while maintaining a 
comfortable trading environment for our 
customers and colleagues.
The business has prioritised a 
programme to invest in full LED lighting 
at all sites. All new stores are 100% LED 
and we have retro-fitted 69 stores to this 
efficient technology. 87 stores (55% of 
the estate) now have LED lighting fitted.
The Group was fully compliant with the 
Energy Savings & Opportunities Scheme 
(‘ESOS’) newly launched this year. In 
addition, we have partnered with a 
specialist energy provider in this area to 
maximise the benefit and to ensure our 
on-going compliance.
Our key objectives
 z To optimise energy use across the 
business.
 z To evaluate renewable technology 
options and trial where appropriate.
 z To fully comply with the new Energy 
Savings & Opportunities Scheme.
2016/17 objectives
 z Continue our programme of LED 
investments to all sites.
 z To reduce like-for-like energy 
consumption by in excess of 10%.
 z To monitor performance of our solar 
powered stores and assess future 
investment potential.
What we do
We have invested in photovoltaic 
systems (solar power) in four of our 
stores (Leeds, Dunstable, Bristol and 
Cambridge). These systems replace 
energy sourced through the national grid 
with local renewable energy.
We continue to source electricity 
from ‘Green Energy’ supplies such as 
combined heat and power sources 
where CO2 emissions are 30% lower than 
the national average. 
Dunelm also works with a specialist 
partner to consult on our energy buying 
strategy, investments in energy saving 
technology and to further focus on 
reducing our carbon emissions.
Our company car fleet is graded on 
emissions and we encourage the use 
of fuel efficient vehicles in all schemes. 
Average emissions in 2016 were 108 
CO2 g/km (2015: 110 CO2 g/km). 
Our key objectives
 z To reduce CO2 emissions relative to 
turnover year-on-year.
 z To identify and trial new technologies 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Our current performance
Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (‘CO2e’) 
emissions data is reported using the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard 
(Scope 1 & Scope 2) and applies to our 
organisational boundary as defined by 
the ‘operational control’ approach.
The methodology used to calculate 
our emissions is based on the UK 
Government’s GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2013. 
Dunelm uses ‘Tonnes of CO2e per £m 
of turnover’ as its intensity measure 
reflecting the link between growth, 
activity and performance.

The last fifteen months have been a period of renewal for the 
Dunelm Board, with new appointments to both the Executive 
and Non-Executive teams. This has been spurred partly by the 
natural retirement process and partly by the Board’s desire to 
bring in new skills and experiences to deliver our ambitious 
plans. The new team is settling down remarkably well, helped 
by our Deputy Chairman and the experience of our longer 
serving Non-Executive Directors. 
We remain totally committed to maintaining our track record 
of good governance, supporting best practice guidelines and 
seeking to apply them in a pragmatic way that adds value to 
Dunelm.
Marion Sears has played a central role in our Board renewal 
and I am delighted that she will continue as a Non-Executive 
Director. To comply with best practice she has retired from the 
Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees, and as chair of 
the Nominations Committee.
We have asked Simon Emeny to continue as our Senior 
Independent Director and Chair of our Remuneration 
Committee for one more year. We really appreciate the 
continuity and experience that he brings to our Board. 
Although he has served nine years, we believe his 
independence has been in no way compromised by his length 
of service.
In January we held a Corporate Governance meeting, attended 
by Will Adderley, the Non-Executive Directors and myself, to 
which our major institutional shareholders were invited. We had 
a useful exchange of views on a number of governance topics, 
which we have taken into account in our subsequent Board 
discussions. 
We have carried out our regular Board evaluation process, 
with the help of an external expert. This confirmed that your 
new Board is working well together and brought some helpful 
insights to make us more effective.
At our AGM this year, as usual, all Directors will be seeking 
reappointment. In addition, in accordance with the Listing 
Rules, each of the Non-Executive Directors will also be subject 
to a vote of shareholders independent of the Adderley family. 
In April, Will Adderley, our Deputy Chairman and a major 
shareholder, disposed of part of his shareholding to the point 
where it is no longer necessary for us to seek a Rule 9 waiver 
to support our policy to buy back shares to satisfy employee 
share option entitlements. When we asked for this waiver in 
previous years it has caused a policy difficulty for a number of 
our institutional shareholders, although the Board believes that 
it has been in the interests of our shareholders as a whole.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM.
Yours sincerely
Andy Harrison 
Chairman

Overview
Our approach to governance has been unchanged since 
flotation in 2006, and can be summarised as follows:
 z We believe that good governance leads to stronger value 
creation and lower risks for shareholders.
 z It is the Board’s responsibility to instil and maintain a culture 
of honesty, integrity and transparency throughout the 
business, through our policies, communications and by the 
way in which we act.
 z We support corporate governance guidelines and apply 
them in a way that is meaningful to our business and 
consistent with our culture and values. 
 z If we decide that the interests of the Company and its 
shareholders can be better served by doing things in a 
different way, we will explain the reasons why. 
For more information please see the copy of the presentations 
that we made to our major institutional investors and 
shareholder representatives in January 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 
and 2016, available in the ‘Reports and Presentations’ section 
of our corporate website. 
Code compliance
This report explains how we have applied the principles of 
good governance and code of best practice set out in the 
Corporate Governance Code published in September 2014 
(the ‘Corporate Governance Code’).
The Board considers that it has fully complied with the 
Corporate Governance Code during the financial year covered 
by this annual report, with the exception of the fact that Marion 
Sears, determined by the Board in September 2015 to be 
no longer independent, continued to chair the Nominations 
Committee during a transitional period until March 2016. The 
Nominations Committee did not meet during this time. 
The Board considers that it has continued to comply with the 
Corporate Governance Code since the financial year end. In 
making its determination, particular consideration was given 
to the independence of Simon Emeny, who has served nine 
years on the Board in June 2016. Further details are given in 
the section below headed ‘Independence of Non-Executive 
Directors’.

Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Chief 
Executive responsibilities
The Board has adopted written statements setting out the 
respective responsibilities of the Chairman, the Deputy 
Chairman and the Chief Executive; these are available on the 
Group’s website or from the Company Secretary. In general 
terms, the Chairman is responsible for running the Board and 
the Chief Executive is responsible for running the Group’s 
business. The Deputy Chairman supports the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive and undertakes activities to promote the 
long term interests of the business and preserve its culture.
Independence of Non-Executive 
Directors
As required by the Corporate Governance Code and the 
Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority, the 
Board considers annually whether all independent Non-
Executive Directors continue to exhibit independence of 
character and judgement prior to putting them forward 
for reappointment at the AGM. This was last considered in 
September 2016 and we confirmed that Andy Harrison was 
independent on appointment and that Simon Emeny, Liz 
Doherty, William Reeve and Peter Ruis are independent.
As noted above, in the Board’s annual review of the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors in September 
2016, particular consideration was given to the assessment of 
Simon Emeny’s independence in view of his nine year tenure. 
To help preserve continuity following changes to the Board in 
the past year, Simon has been asked to stay on until the AGM 
in 2017, at which point we would anticipate the appointment 
of an additional independent Non-Executive Director to 
succeed him. The Board determined that Simon’s tenure 
has in no way affected his independence of character and 
judgement, and therefore he should continue to be considered 
as ‘independent’. The Board has treated Marion Sears as a 
‘non-independent’ Director since September 2015 in view of 
her tenure of more than nine years on the Board. In March 
2016 she was appointed a director of WA Capital Limited. WA 
Capital Limited is a private limited company established by Will 
Adderley (the Deputy Chairman, and a major shareholder) to 
act as a long term holding company for his beneficial interest 
in the Company and various other investments. One of the 
factors set out in the Corporate Governance Code to indicate 
that a director may not be independent is the existence of 
a ‘relationship which is likely to affect or could appear to 
affect the director’s judgement’ and/or ‘cross-directorships or 
significant links to other directors through involvement in other 
companies’. The Dunelm Board considered the matter prior to 
Marion’s appointment to the Board of WA Capital and decided 
that it would not affect her judgement as a Director of Dunelm; 
and that any potential conflict of interest could be cleared on 
the basis that WA Capital Limited and Will Adderley are parties 
to a Relationship Agreement (referred to below in the section 
headed ‘Conflicts of Interest’) which regulates their conduct. 
Further, as Marion is already treated as non-independent, there 
are no implications for Board composition. The Board therefore 
gave prior consent to the appointment, and considered and 
cleared the potential conflict of interest.
Both Marion and Simon will put themselves forward for 
reappointment at the AGM by shareholders independent of 
the Adderley family as well as a full shareholder vote.
As noted in the report of the Nominations Committee, Board 
refreshment is a continued area of focus and we continue to 
consider the tenure of all Directors as part of our succession 
planning. Our policy on Board diversity is explained in the 
Nominations Committee report.

1. Geoff Cooper and David Stead attended all meetings prior to their 
retirement.
2. Peter Ruis and Keith Down attended all meetings subsequent to their 
appointment.
Any Director who was unable to attend a meeting received the 
papers in advance and passed on comments to the Chairman.
Board meetings
There is a schedule of matters reserved to the Board for 
decision or approval, which is available on the Group’s 
website or from the Company Secretary. Examples of such 
matters include Group strategy and budget, Group capital 
structure, approval of financial results and report and financial 
statements, significant capital or contractual commitments, 
maintaining internal control and risk management and approval 
of significant Group-wide policies.
At each meeting, the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer report on operational performance (including health 
and safety) and the Chief Financial Officer reports on financial 
performance. There is a rolling agenda of other operational, 
strategic and risk topics which is regularly refreshed to reflect 
the most up-to-date strategy and ‘live’ issues in the business. 
The principal topics discussed by the Board in 2015/16 were:
Areas of focus
Strategy X Group strategy, 
including our eight 
strategic initiatives
 X Property strategy
 X Budget
 X Culture and values
 X Treasury policy 
 X Capital and 
Dividend policy 
 X Tax policy
Governance  
and risk
 X Board succession
 X Board 
independence, 
composition and 
diversity
 X Investor feedback 
via advisors
 X AGM voting and 
feedback 
 X Risk reviews and 
“what keeps us 
awake at night”
 X Health and safety
 X Ethical sourcing
 X Modern slavery
 X IT security and 
cyber security
 X Market abuse 
regulation
Operational X Competitor activity
 X Customer insight
 X Store operating 
model
 X Format 
development
 X People strategy 
and colleague 
engagement 
 X Supply chain 
strategy
 X Product quality
We measure the time spent on strategy, governance and 
operational performance at each meeting. Over the year, the 
biggest part of our time was spent on strategy, followed by 
governance and operational performance, which the Board 
considers to be appropriate.
Minutes of all Board and Committee meetings are taken by the 
Company Secretary and committee secretary respectively and 
circulated for approval. Any unresolved concerns raised by a 
Director are recorded in the minutes.
Non-Executive Director meetings
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors formally 
met once during the year without Executive Directors being 
present and regularly have informal, individual, meetings with 
the Executive Directors and other senior managers in the 
business, usually at a store location.

Board committees
The Board has appointed three committees, an Audit and Risk 
Committee, a Nominations Committee and a Remuneration 
Committee. The terms of reference of each of these 
committees can be found on the Group’s website and are 
available from the Company Secretary. 
Details of the membership of the committees and of their 
activities during the past financial year can be found in the 
reports from the Chair of each of the committees.
Training and induction
Upon joining the Board, any new Director is offered a 
comprehensive and tailored induction programme with 
visits to key sites and meetings with senior managers and 
other colleagues. This includes access to recent Board and 
Committee papers, including strategy documentation; 
meetings with each of the Executive Directors and 
the Company Secretary and other members of senior 
management; store visits; meetings with advisers such as the 
auditors.
This year four new Directors joined the Board, two Executives 
and two Non-Executives.
 z John Browett, Chief Executive, had a six month period 
as Chief Executive designate, which he spent gaining a 
detailed knowledge of the business. This included time 
working in stores and our distribution centre and meeting 
with advisers and key suppliers, as well as getting to know 
Board members and senior management. This work enabled 
him to formulate the Senior Management Team and devise 
the eight strategic initiatives that will drive forward the 
Board’s strategy.
 z Keith Down, Chief Financial Officer, had a short handover 
period with his predecessor David Stead. He had a formal 
induction programme which included time with Board 
members and other senior managers in store, as well as 
meetings with advisers and our auditors.
 z William Reeve and Peter Ruis, Non-Executive Directors, both 
met with the Chairman and other Directors and have met 
other senior management in store. They received a briefing 
from the Company Secretary on the duties of PLC directors.
We have an open culture and Non-Executive Directors are 
free to make direct contact with senior management and store 
teams. Throughout the year all Directors have visited stores 
both informally and together with members of the senior 
management team. 
The Company Secretary reports to the Board at each meeting 
on new legal, regulatory and governance developments 
that affect the Group and actions are agreed where 
needed. Directors attend seminars and tutorials provided 
by independent organisations which cover a wide range of 
governance topics.
As part of the annual Board evaluation, any additional training 
or development needs are addressed by the Chairman with 
each Director. Please see the Directors’ biographies on pages 
36 to 38 for details of the specific skills and experience of each 
Director.
Evaluation
Each of the Directors receives a formal evaluation of their 
performance during the year.
The Board and committees are also formally evaluated as a 
whole.
2015 Evaluation
The actions arising from the 2015 review conducted by Andy 
Harrison, as incoming Chairman, were:
 z To ensure that the Board retains and builds on its strengths 
in the coming year during a period of substantial change 
around the Board table. 
 z Continued focus on the Board succession plan.
The Board considered that these objectives, which were 
necessarily broad in a year of change in the composition of 
the Board, have been met. This was confirmed by the 2016 
external Board evaluation. 
2016 Evaluation
An external evaluation was conducted by Lorna Parker in 
April to June of 2016. Lorna Parker does not have any other 
connection with the Group or any of its Directors.
The conclusion of this evaluation was that the Board and its 
committees are functioning well and dynamics are good, 
with all members actively engaged, proud to be associated 
with Dunelm and ambitious for its future. A number of 
recommendations were made and accepted by the Board to 
build on this and make the Board even more effective. The key 
recommendations were:
 z Refocusing the Board’s agenda so that more time is spent 
discussing key aspects of the strategy where the Board can 
add most value to the Executive team, with sufficient time 
on each topic to allow a free flowing debate.
 z Build more structured Non-Executive time into the Board 
timetable; additional Non-Executive only dinners and 
scheduled Non-Executive only sessions at the end of each 
Board meeting.
 z Maximising value from the Non-Executive Directors by 
informal ‘mentoring’ of Executives and continuing to share 
their specialist knowledge and leadership experience 
through presentations to the Senior Management Team.
 z The Company Secretary to facilitate more formal 
governance training for the Non-Executive Directors.

Every two or three years
Chief Executive and Chief 
Financial Officer
Other senior managers as 
appropriate
The Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer report back 
to the Board after the investor roadshows. The Group’s brokers 
and financial PR advisers also provide a written feedback report 
after the full and half year results announcements and investor 
roadshows to inform the Board about investor views, and in 
addition Non-Executive Directors attend a selection of investor 
meetings.
In January we held a Corporate Governance meeting, 
attended by Will Adderley, the Non-Executive Directors, the 
Company Secretary and myself, to which our major institutional 
shareholders were invited. This was the first opportunity for the 
corporate governance representatives of our shareholders to 
meet with the new Non-Executive team following the changes 
that have taken place during 2015. We had a useful exchange 
of views on a number of governance topics, including Board 
composition, the work of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
remuneration, the Rule 9 waiver and corporate social 
responsibility. The views expressed were considered by the full 
Board and have been taken into account in our subsequent 
Board discussions. 
Our corporate website contains useful shareholder information, 
copies of presentations and policies in relation to governance 
and corporate social responsibility. Please see http://dunelm.
production.investis.com.
All Directors will be available at the Annual General Meeting to 
meet with shareholders and answer their questions. 
Rule 9 waiver
In April, Will Adderley, our Deputy Chairman and a major 
shareholder, disposed of part of his shareholding. As his 
shareholding is now below 30%, and the combined Adderley 
shareholding is above 50%, we are no longer required to seek a 
Rule 9 waiver at AGM to support our policy to buy back shares 
to satisfy employee share option entitlements, so long as this 
situation remains the case after the Company share purchase. 
The Rule 9 waiver vote caused a policy difficulty for a number 
of our institutional shareholders, which can now be avoided.
The Board has reviewed whether our policy to purchase shares 
in the market to satisfy share option entitlements (as opposed 
to issuing shares) is still appropriate; we believe that it is in the 
interests of our shareholder base as a whole as it avoids dilution 
of shareholdings, and it is supported by the majority of our 
institutional shareholders. I would like to reassure shareholders 
again that shares bought back by the Company will be held in 
treasury and used only to satisfy share option entitlements, and 
not cancelled. 
Significant shareholders
The Group’s significant shareholders are listed in the Directors’ 
report on page 83 and voting rights are stated on page 82.
Conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 allows the Board of a public company 
to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts of interest of 
individual Directors where the Articles of Association contain a 
provision to that effect. The Company’s Articles of Association 
give the Board this authority subject to the following 
safeguards:
Directors who have an interest in matters under discussion at 
a Board meeting must declare that interest and abstain from 
voting.
Only Directors who have no interest in the matter being 
considered are able to approve a conflict of interest and, 
in taking that decision the Directors must act in a way they 
consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the 
success of the Company.
The Directors are able to impose limits or conditions when 
giving authorisation if they feel this is appropriate.

All Directors are required to disclose any actual or potential 
conflicts to the Board and the following existing matters have 
been considered and approved:
 z Will Adderley is a major shareholder and connected to 
other major shareholders. Authorised on the basis that 
Will continues to abide by the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement entered into between himself, other major 
shareholders and the Company on flotation of the Company 
in 2006.
 z Marion Sears is a director of WA Capital Limited, a private 
limited company established by Will Adderley to act as a 
long term holding company for his beneficial interest in the 
Company and various other investments. Authorised on the 
basis that WA Capital Limited is party to the Relationship 
Agreement referred to above.
Any actual or potential conflicts are considered by the Board 
and any authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes 
and reviewed annually by the Board.
Conflicts that have been disclosed are reviewed annually by 
the Board.
The Board considers that its procedures to approve conflicts 
of interest and potential conflicts of interest are operating 
effectively.
Appointment and removal of Directors
The Articles of Association of the Company provide that 
a Director may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders in general meeting, or by the 
Board so long as the Director stands down and offers him or 
herself for election at the next Annual General Meeting of 
the Company. The Articles also provide that each Director 
must stand down and offer him or herself for re-election by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting at least every 
three years. The Board has decided to adopt the requirement 
of the Corporate Governance Code, that all Directors should 
stand down and offer themselves for re-election at each Annual 
General Meeting.
Directors may be removed by a special resolution of 
shareholders, or by an ordinary resolution of which special 
notice has been given in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006. The Articles also provide that the office of a Director 
shall be vacated if they are prohibited by law from being a 
Director, or is bankrupt; and that the Board may resolve that his 
or her office be vacated if he or she is of unsound mind or is 
absent from Board meetings without consent for six months or 
more. A Director may also resign from the Board.
The Nominations Committee makes recommendations to the 
Board on the appointment and removal of Directors.
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Code, all 
Directors will retire from the Board and offer themselves 
for re-election at the Annual General Meeting. Non-
Executive Directors will also be subject to a separate vote by 
shareholders independent of the Adderley family as required 
by the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority.
Powers of Directors
The business of the Company is managed by the Board, which 
may exercise all of the powers of the Company, subject to the 
requirements of the Companies Act, the Articles of Association 
of the Company and any special resolution of the Company. 
As stated above, the Board has adopted internal delegations 
of authority in accordance with the Code and these set out 
matters which are reserved to the Board or committees and the 
powers and duties of the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
respectively.
At the Annual General Meetings of the Company from 2007 
onwards, the Board has sought and been given authority 
to issue shares and to buy back and reissue shares. Similar 
resolutions are being tabled at the 2016 Annual General 
Meeting. Any shares bought back would be held in treasury 
for reissue to employees who exercise options under one of 
the Group’s share incentive schemes. For further details see 
the Notice of Annual General Meeting which accompanies this 
report.
Advice and insurance
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. In addition Directors may seek legal 
advice at the Group’s cost if they consider it necessary in 
connection with their duties.
The Group purchases Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
cover for its Directors.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended 
by a special resolution of shareholders. 
Governance and risk
Details of our risk management framework, systems and 
controls and internal control framework are set out in the 
Strategic report on pages 17 to 25.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on  
14 September 2016.

This has been a year of change for the Board and for the Audit 
and Risk Committee. Keith Down was appointed as our new 
Chief Financial Officer in early December 2015, succeeding 
David Stead who retired from the Board at the end of that 
month. I am pleased to report that the transition has been a 
smooth one, reflecting the calibre of both individuals and the 
strength of the finance team and the controls and systems in 
place. 
Marion Sears retired from the Committee in September 2015 
to comply with corporate governance guidelines, following 
the Board’s determination that she is no longer ‘independent’ 
due to her tenure on the Board. I thank her for her vigilant and 
dedicated service to the Committee during the previous ten 
years. Andy Harrison also retired from the Committee when he 
was appointed Chairman in July 2015, again to comply with 
governance guidelines. Both continue to make themselves 
available for attendance as requested. The Committee has 
also welcomed our two new Non-Executive Directors, William 
Reeve and Peter Ruis, who joined the Board in July 2015 and 
September 2015 respectively. We therefore have a healthy mix 
of old and new members to bring both ‘corporate knowledge’ 
and continuity as well as fresh perspectives.
We have spent time this year overseeing the preparations for 
the Board’s statements on long term viability, going concern 
and risk management. This work has involved looking again at 
our principal risks and ensuring that the process for reviewing 
and assessing them is expressly linked to our financial planning 
process, and to our annual report disclosures. 
The Board has responded to the FRC’s Financial Reporting 
Lab’s paper in November 2015 on ‘Disclosure of dividends 
– policy and practice’, and has provided a more detailed 
description of its capital and dividend policy. This was reviewed 
by the Committee prior to being adopted by the Board.
All businesses continue to be exposed to cyber risks, and this 
continues to be a standing agenda item for the Committee. 
Following a number of high profile data security breaches at 
other businesses, the Committee carried out a ‘deep dive’ 
review of the processes in place at Dunelm to manage a data 
breach.
Our programme of internal audit activity, supported by external 
assurance providers, continued throughout the year. Specific 
reviews were conducted of the way in which we account for 
supplier income and the accounting processes used with ‘drop 
ship’ vendors.
We paid our auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP advisory 
fees of £70,500 in the financial year, as against the audit fee 
of £75,000. This relates to the review work carried out on our 
interim results which we requested for the first time this year 
to reflect the growing size and complexity of the business; to 
some follow up work on senior management remuneration 
from a previous year; and to a technical piece of work to 
support the future availability of distributable reserves. We 
have adopted a new policy on use of our auditors for non-audit 
services for the FY17 financial year which is in line with recently 
adopted regulations.
Looking forward, we have noted the recent revisions to 
the Corporate Governance Code which relate to Audit 
Committees and also the Financial Reporting Council’s 
guidance issued in June, and we will be taking steps to ensure 
that we can demonstrate that we are adhering to these. 
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM.
Yours sincerely,

The Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman of the 
Board usually attend meetings by invitation, along with a 
representative from the external auditors. Other Directors 
attend by invitation as required.
The Board considers that I have recent and relevant financial 
experience by virtue of my professional qualification and my 
previous executive roles, including as Chief Financial Officer 
of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. Members of the Committee 
can also demonstrate a breadth of experience across the retail 
and consumer goods sector through their current and previous 
roles – please see the Directors’ biographies on pages 36 to 38 
for full details.

Significant areas of judgement
Within its terms of reference, the Committee monitors the 
integrity of the annual and half year results and interim 
management statements, including a review of the significant 
financial reporting issues and judgements contained in them.
At its meetings in September 2015 and 2016, the Committee 
reviewed a comprehensive paper prepared by the Chief 
Financial Officer, which analysed the Group’s results for the 
financial year; highlighted matters arising in the preparation of 
the Group financial statements; and provided information to 
support the Directors’ viability and going concern statements. 
The Committee also considered a paper prepared by the 
external auditors, which included significant reporting and 
accounting matters. 
The major accounting issues discussed by the Committee in 
September 2016 in relation to the FY16 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements were as follows: 
Provisions for inventory, returns and 
property
For each of the above, the Committee considered the 
approach taken by management and assessed available 
evidence, including historical outcomes. Particular attention 
was given to reviewing the provision for obsolete, slow-moving 
or discontinued inventory and the pattern of stock clearance 
over the financial period. The Committee concluded that the 
values recorded in the financial statements are appropriate. 
Complex supplier arrangements
The Committee received a report from management on 
the nature and scale of supplier income. The Committee 
noted that the main source of supplier income is through 
retrospective volume rebates, that these are not significant 
in the context of the Group’s financial statements, and that 
management’s policy for recognising such income is in any 
event conservative.
“Fair, balanced and understandable”
At the request of the Board, the Committee also considered 
whether the annual report and financial statements as a whole 
are “fair, balanced and understandable”. Factors taken into 
account included:
 z Does the narrative of the Chief Executive’s and Chief 
Financial Officer’s reviews fairly reflect the performance of 
the Group over the period reported on?

 z Are the narrative sections consistent with each other, and 
with the financial statements?
 z Is the connection between strategy and remuneration 
clearly described?
 z Can readers easily identify key events that happened during 
the year?
Committee members received the draft annual report in 
advance and had the opportunity to make comments in 
advance of the formal meeting at which the report was tabled 
for approval.
Following its review, the Committee confirmed that the FY16 
annual report was “fair, balanced and understandable”.
External auditor
The report and financial statements were audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , following that firm’s appointment 
as statutory auditor in January 2014. 
One of the primary responsibilities of the Audit and Risk 
Committee is to assess the effectiveness of the external audit 
process and make recommendations to the Board in relation to 
the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external 
auditors. The Committee took a number of factors into account 
in its assessment, including but not limited to:
 z The quality and scope of the planning of the audit. In 
February 2016, the external auditors presented their 
strategy for 2015/16 to the Committee. The Committee 
reviewed and agreed with the external auditors’ assessment 
of risk. The Committee also reviewed the audit approach 
and the approach to assessing materiality for the Group;
 z The quality of reports provided to the Committee and the 
Board and the quality of advice given;
 z The level of understanding demonstrated of the Group’s 
businesses and the retail sector;

The fee paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the statutory 
audit of the Group and Company financial statements 
and the audit of Group subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 
was £75,000. A breakdown of non-audit fees paid to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the financial year is set 
out below. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attended the Committee 
meetings in September 2015, February, June and September 
2016. The Committee also met privately with them during the 
September meetings, and as Chair of the Committee I had 
dialogue with the audit partner on a number of occasions. 
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
as auditors and to authorise the Directors to agree their 
remuneration will be put to shareholders at the AGM.
Use of auditors for non-audit work
The Committee is aware that the use of audit firms for non-
audit work is a sensitive issue for investors and corporate 
governance analysts, as it could potentially give rise to a 
conflict of interest.
We have a relatively flat management structure and all 
advisory work commissioned from our auditor is required to be 
sanctioned by the Chief Financial Officer, who obtains the prior 
approval of the Committee (or between meetings of myself as 
Committee Chair). Consent would only be given if there are 
no issues regarding independence. Much of the advisory work 
that we outsource is tax related, and we have retained the 
services of KPMG for this purpose. 
Following the issue of the EU Audit Directive in June 2016, we 
reviewed our policy on the use of auditors for non-audit work 
in September 2016. The full policy is available on our website, 
www.dunelm.com, but in summary from FY17:
 z Fees for non-audit services provided by the statutory 
auditor in any year may not exceed 70% of the average fees 
for the Group statutory audit in the three previous years.
 z The auditor will be prohibited from providing certain non-
audit services, including:
 — almost all tax work
 — internal audit 
 — corporate finance
 — involvement in management activities, including working 
capital and cash management and the provision of 
financial information.
During the period we paid PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
£70,500, of which £15,000 related to their review of the 
interim financial statements and £40,000 to a technical piece 
of work to support the future availability of distributable 
reserves. The remainder was in relation to an executive salary 
benchmarking exercise for below Board Executives. In each 
case they were considered to be the best firm to provide 
the work in view of their expertise and knowledge of the 
Group. Their appointment was made in line with the policy 
applicable during the financial year, and was approved by me 
as Committee Chair. 
Fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for audit work were 
£75,000.

Auditor rotation
It is our policy to tender the statutory audit at least every five 
years and to rotate auditors at least every 20 years, in line 
with the requirements of the EU Audit Directive. This means 
that the next tender will be for the 2018/19 audit at the latest. 
We will also invite at least one firm outside the ‘Big Four’ 
to participate in the tender process. I can confirm that the 
Company has complied with The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use 
of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 during the financial year.
Viability statement and risk management
The Company is required to provide a viability statement 
for the first time in this year’s annual report. The Committee 
reviewed the process in place to support the assurance given. 
This included a full review of the principal risks facing the 
Group and the process by which they are managed by the 
Board and management. We also reviewed the risks in the 
context of our strategic and financial planning process to 
ensure that all elements are appropriately aligned. As a result 
of this review, we revised the ‘Principal Risks and Uncertainties’ 
statement set out in this report to make it more consistent with 
the terminology used by management. 
The Committee formally reviewed the process in place to 
support the viability statement and for the identification and 
management of risks in September 2016 and confirmed that it 
is appropriate and in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Internal audit/external assurance
The Committee initiated a formalised programme in 2013 
with activities conducted either by an internal team that is 
independent of the area under review, or by an external party, 
decided on a case by case basis. In either case, the review is 
conducted on behalf of the Committee and reports back to 
them. In February 2016 the Committee discussed and agreed 
that this approach to internal audit remains satisfactory.
Topics reviewed in the year are set out below:
Review topic Reviewed by
Review of supplier income KPMG
‘Drop ship’ vendor processes KPMG
Reports were discussed by the Committee and the Board and 
a number of actions agreed to improve controls.
In addition, the Committee monitored progress against actions 
agreed following the reports received in the 2014-15 financial 
year from external assurance providers in relation to pensions 
auto-enrolment. All agreed actions are now completed. 
Internal control framework
In 2015 the Committee adopted a formal internal control 
framework, covering the following areas: business ethics 
including anti-bribery controls; accountabilities; people 
management, including succession planning; development and 
alignment of incentives; risk management processes; internal 
control; crisis management; monitoring and reporting. 
The framework and the controls in place were reviewed by the 
Committee in June 2016, together with progress that had been 
made against actions agreed in 2015. Although no significant 
control weaknesses have been identified, we agreed that 
we would look at how assurance of performance against the 
controls is gained to identify whether any further assurance is 
needed.
Information security
Information security remains one of the most important risk 
areas and it is a standing Committee agenda item, as well as 
being one of the Board’s principal risks, as outlined in the ‘Risks 
and Uncertainties’ section of this annual report. In view of the 
high profile data breaches suffered by certain retailers, and 
the tougher data protection regime that will shortly come into 
force under the terms of the Data Protection Directive, this year 
the Committee also reviewed the processes we have in place 
to minimise the risk of a data breach and also the steps that 
we would take in the event that a breach occurred, and found 
them to be appropriate.

This is my first letter as Chair of the Committee, and I would 
like to start by thanking Marion Sears, my predecessor, for the 
detailed and dedicated work she has carried out chairing the 
Committee over the past ten years; and for putting in place 
the principles behind our remuneration structure, which have 
been largely unchanged since flotation in 2006. I have been a 
member of the Committee for the past nine years, and intend 
to continue to apply these principles, which have the support 
of our shareholders and are in line with best practice.
Last year we put forward a revised Remuneration Policy for 
approval at the AGM. We needed to update the performance-
related elements of Executive remuneration following the 
appointment of our new Executive team, John Browett 
(Chief Executive) and Keith Down (Chief Financial Officer). 
I am pleased that the policy was approved by 97.7% of our 
shareholders, reflecting the positive feedback that we had 
received through prior consultation with our major institutional 
shareholders. This policy is set out on the following pages 
of this report, although we are not asking for shareholder 
approval this year.
The Committee is aware that remuneration continues to be 
an issue of focus for shareholders and governance analysts, 
particularly where executive reward earned is out of line with 
profits and shareholder returns. Our policy has always been 
to structure remuneration so as to reward shareholder value 
creation over the long term, so that the majority is performance 
based according to stretching targets. We consider that 
this remains relevant and are pleased that our simplicity of 
approach and execution is in line with recent policy statements 
issued by institutional investor bodies, and the Executive 
Remuneration Working Group.
At the time of writing this report, the effects of the United 
Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union is unclear. A 
sustained economic slowdown or a significant increase in 
our cost base could have a material effect on the potential 
outcome of our performance based incentive schemes, 
particularly the Long Term Incentive Plan. Although we have 
left the targets unchanged for the LTIP awards to be granted 
this year, we will review these before we make awards in 2017 
to ensure that they continue to be in line with our policy to 
provide fair reward for strong performance. We would consult 
with major shareholders before proposing any change.
In the financial year under review, our Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer have earned an annual bonus equal to 
58% of the maximum, reflecting the financial performance of 
the business, the work that has been carried out to further our 
eight strategic initiatives, and their own personal performance. 
Although both have received awards under our Long Term 
Incentive Plan, these awards will not vest until 2018, subject of 
course to performance conditions. Will Adderley’s basic salary 
was reduced to £1 from 1 July 2015 at his request, and he has 
also waived his entitlement to an award under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan. Total executive pay was therefore £1.8m, 1.4% 
of PBT.
Our 2015 policy also requires that newly appointed Executive 
Directors are required to make an investment in Dunelm shares 
on appointment (subject to Company closed periods). I am 
pleased to report that in October 2015 John Browett purchased 
21,606 shares for £200,227 and Keith Down purchased 5,265 
shares for £49,500; Keith made a further purchase of 3,246 
shares in April 2016 for £29,700. Since the year end John and 
Keith have purchased 4,534 and 5,629 shares respectively, 
taking their total holdings at the date of this report to: John 
Browett: 27,785 shares and Keith Down: 14,140 shares.
For completeness I should add that Will Adderley and David 
Stead did not receive any payment in respect of loss of office 
when John Browett and Keith Down assumed the roles of 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer respectively. David 
Stead, who retired as a good leaver after 12 years, has been 
permitted to benefit from performance-related bonus and LTIP 
options earned during his employment, pro-rated to his service 
and after applying performance criteria. Full details were 
disclosed on his retirement and are set out in the report and in 
last year’s report, and are in line with our approved policy.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM.
Yours sincerely,
Simon Emeny

HOW OUR POLICY IS LINKED TO OUR STRATEGY
Remuneration Report
54 dunelm.com Stock code: DNLM                                           
The principles behind, and the reasons for, the overall remuneration structure that we have adopted for our Executive Directors 
are directly related to our long term strategic goal of delivering shareholder value through the profitable growth of a quality 
business.
Since the flotation of the Company our Executive remuneration has been structured specifically:
 X To pay fairly and appropriately for an individual’s role and responsibilities;
 X To reward strong performance;
 X To be focused on long term value creation;
 X To align Executives strongly with shareholders through share ownership.
The majority of the Executive Directors’ potential remuneration is variable and performance-related in order to encourage and 
reward superior business performance and shareholder return. Discretion is allowed in certain circumstances to ensure rewards are 
appropriate and overall levels of pay are analysed carefully each year.
This is consistent with delivery of the objectives set out in our corporate strategy, which are all long term in nature; namely the 
growth of like-for-like sales in store; obtaining national coverage from rolling out new stores; and growing sales and profit in the 
home delivery channel. Our approach is also in keeping with the family origin of the business, and is important to the Adderley 
family who remain our majority shareholders.
It is our intention to maintain a simple and transparent remuneration structure for the benefit of all parties.
Introduction
This Directors’ Remuneration Report is divided into three sections: the Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
set out on page 52; the Policy Report; and the Annual Report on Implementation.
The Policy Report sets out the Directors’ remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 24 November 2015, and took effect from that date. This was a binding vote and the policy remains in place until the 
AGM in 2018.
No payment may be paid to a Director or past Director unless it is consistent with the approved policy unless shareholder 
approval is sought.
The Annual Report on Implementation sets out how the policies approved in November 2014 and November 2015 have been 
applied during the financial year being reported on and how policy will be applied in the coming year. This report will be put to 
shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting in November 2016, although the vote on the implementation report is 
advisory.
This report complies with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, as well as the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
UKLA Listing Rules.

and will be due for renewal at the latest at the 2018 AGM.

Remuneration Report CONTINUED
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with the policy, where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time 
when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration, and in relation to an award over shares, the terms of payment are ‘agreed’ at the time 
the award is granted.
The Committee may also make minor changes to this policy which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its 
operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approval, but taking into account the interests of shareholders.
Performance measures and how targets are set
The Remuneration Committee selects performance measures that it believes are:
 z Aligned with the Group’s strategic goals.
 z Unambiguous and easy to calculate.
 z Transparent to Directors and shareholders.
Annual bonus
For 2015-16 and 2016-17, 80% of the annual bonus is linked to PBT and 20% to personal and strategic objectives. Each Director’s 
annual bonus is therefore linked primarily to delivery of Group financial performance, but also to personal performance and 
contribution to the strategic progress of the Group. The PBT target is set by the Remuneration Committee each year, taking into 
account market consensus and broker expectations. Personal and strategic objectives are set at the commencement of the year 
and assessed by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee reserves the right to adjust the financial performance target or change the performance condition if justified by 
the circumstances, for example if there was a major capital transaction.
For future years, the Committee will determine the financial measures and the weighting of financial and non-financial measures 
based on specific business priorities in a particular year.
LTIP
The Remuneration Committee considered the use of EPS as a performance measure carefully when the Company was floated 
in 2006, and has discussed it with shareholders regularly. EPS is believed to be closely aligned to the drivers of growth for 
the business and in the long term, EPS performance is expected to be reflected in shareholder value. EPS is a more suitable 
performance measure for Dunelm than for many other companies and it is therefore considered appropriate to use it as a single 
measure for the LTIP . The use of EPS as a primary measure for Dunelm’s LTIP is considered appropriate because of the low level 
of leverage in the business and because the capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid 
EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital.
The EPS target for the LTIP is based on growth in EPS compared to the increase in the Index of Retail Prices (RPI) over the 
performance period. The targets that apply to awards that are outstanding are set out in the Policy table on pages 55 to 59.
The number of shares comprised in an award or the performance target which applies may be adjusted by the Remuneration 
Committee in accordance with the plan rules if justified by the circumstances, for example, if there were a major capital 
transaction. Any amendment and the reason for it would be fully disclosed. A copy of the plan rules is available from the 
Company Secretary on request.
LTIP awards made to Executive Directors prior to approval of 2015 policy may vest on their original terms.

Illustrative performance scenarios
The following graphs set out what each of the Executive Directors could earn in the financial year 2016-17 under the following 
scenarios:
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the scenarios above:

1. 20% of salary reflecting pension provision for 2016–17.
2. 15% of salary reflecting pension provision for 2016–17.
In line with expectations –  Fixed pay plus annual cash bonus at on target performance of 40% of maximum opportunity (i.e. 
50% of salary) and vesting of 59% of the award of shares under the LTIP .
Maximum performance – Fixed pay plus 100% of maximum annual bonus opportunity (i.e. 125% of salary) and 100% of shares 
vesting under the LTIP .
Please note that two-thirds of performance pay earned by John Browett and Keith Down (after payment of their tax and national 
insurance liability) must be invested in Dunelm shares pursuant to the ‘Lifetime Lock-in’.
Will Adderley has requested that his annual salary be reduced to £1 per annum, and he has waived his entitlement to receive an 
LTIP award.

Remuneration Report CONTINUED
It should be noted that the illustrative performance number 
is likely to be different to the actual pay that is earned by the 
Executive Directors during the year:
 z Actual pay will reflect Company and personal performance 
over the relevant performance period.
 z We are required to show the value of the LTIP awards that 
are expected to be made in the year, not those which will 
actually vest. This valuation is based on the expected face 
value of the date of grant without making any assumptions 
for share price growth, and assuming that the award vests in 
full at the end of the three year performance period.
 z The value of the LTIP awards to be made is based on the 
average price of a Dunelm share over the three months to  
2 July 2016, which is 869.95p – the actual share price at 
date of award is likely to differ.
 z We are not required to show Keith Down’s joining award 
which was granted on 7 December 2015, and included 
in the illustrative performance graph in last year’s annual 
report. 7,470 shares will vest on 15 September 2016 
pursuant to this award.
Recovery
There is provision for recovery of variable pay, as highlighted in 
the policy table.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, recovery 
(malus) may be made against any unpaid cash bonus or 
unvested LTIP options in the following circumstances:
 z performance to which a bonus or LTIP award relates proves 
to have been misstated; or
 z there has been a miscalculation in the extent to which 
performance conditions have been met in respect of 
previous awards made to the individual that have vested 
and been exercised; or
 z there has been gross misconduct on the part of the 
individual.
Clawback may be operated at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee against all variable awards in the 
above circumstances, for up to three years from payment or 
vesting as appropriate; and in cases of fraud the Committee 
can apply malus and clawback for an unlimited period of time.
In addition, Keith Down’s joining award is subject to malus 
and clawback if there has been a misstatement of results for a 
financial period from 2015-16 onwards or in the case of gross 
misconduct or fraud.
Salary, pension and benefits and Sharesave options are not 
subject to recovery.
Service contracts and loss of office 
payments
All of the Executive Directors have service contracts. The 
notice period for termination for Will Adderley is 12 months 
from either party, and for John Browett and Keith Down is 
six months from either party. If the Company terminates the 
employment of the Executive Director it would honour its 
contractual commitment. Any payment of salary on termination 
is contractually restricted to a maximum of the value of salary 
plus benefits for the notice period. If termination was with 
immediate effect, a payment in lieu of notice may be made. 
The Remuneration Committee may apply mitigation in respect 
of any termination payment.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to make a 
payment in respect of annual bonus, provided that it is 
prorated to service.
The limited circumstances in which unexercised LTIP 
awards might be exercised following termination of an 
Executive Director’s service contract are set out below. If 
the Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion to 
allow exercise of an unvested LTIP award, it may make a 
cash payment in lieu of the anticipated value of the award, 
calculated at the date of the payment (taking into account 
prorating of the award and the extent to which performance 
criteria may apply, as appropriate).
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment. The 
term is for an initial period of three years with a provision for 
termination of one month’s notice from either party, or three 
months’ notice from either party in the case of Andy Harrison, 
the Chairman. Letters are renewed for up to two additional 
three year terms, and then renewed annually. The letter of 
appointment will terminate without compensation if the 
Director is not reappointed at the AGM.
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment 
are available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s 
registered office.
Exercise of LTIP and Sharesave options 
following termination of employment
LTIP
If a participant leaves the employment of the Group, the 
following provisions apply to options granted under the LTIP:
 z Options that have vested but have not yet been exercised 
may be exercised within six months of cessation of 
employment (12 months in the case of death).
 z Except in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, options 
which have not yet vested, but where the performance 
period has elapsed (for example if cessation of employment 
occurs during the deferral period applicable to LTIP options 
granted to David Stead (former Finance Director) from 
2013 onwards), may be exercised within six months of the 
relevant vesting date (or 12 months in the case of death), 
to the extent that the performance condition has been 
met. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to allow 
earlier exercise but would only use this in exceptional 
circumstances (such as death or ill health retirement), or at 
its discretion for a good leaver.
Dunelm AR2016-middle.indd   62 12/10/2016   09:56:45 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
63 Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the period ended 2 July 2016
governance
 z If the participant leaves the Group before an option has 
vested and before the performance period has elapsed, 
the option will usually lapse. Except in the case of dismissal 
for gross misconduct, the Remuneration Committee has 
a discretion to allow the exercise of options for which 
the performance period has not elapsed at the date of 
cessation of employment, within six months of the relevant 
vesting date (or 12 months in the case of death). The 
Remuneration Committee also has discretion to allow earlier 
exercise. The Remuneration Committee would only use this 
discretion in exceptional circumstances (such as death or ill 
health retirement), or at its discretion for a good leaver.
 z If early exercise is permitted, the Remuneration Committee 
may apply an adjustment to take into account the amount 
of time that has elapsed through the performance period 
and the extent to which any performance criteria have been 
met.
In all cases, unexercised LTIP awards would be subject to 
recovery (malus) in the relevant circumstances. In respect of 
LTIP awards made after 1 July 2014, clawback may also apply 
to vested awards.
Sharesave
If a participant leaves the Group, options granted under the 
Sharesave will normally lapse, but may be exercised within six 
months from the cessation of employment due to death, injury, 
disability, retirement, or redundancy (or 12 months in the case 
of death), or the employing company leaving the Group or, 
provided that the option has been held for at least three years, 
cessation for any other reason (apart from dismissal by the 
Company).
Joining award
If Keith Down leaves the employment of the Group prior to 
vesting of the joining award it will lapse if he leaves due to 
resignation, or he is dismissed for misconduct. If he leaves for 
any other reason it will vest on the normal vesting date and 
be exercisable for six months (if it has not already vested), 
although the Committee retains discretion to permit the award 
to vest earlier. If Keith leaves other than due to resignation 
or dismissal for misconduct after the award vested, it will be 
exercisable for six months after cessation.  
Change of control and other corporate 
events
LTIP
The following provisions apply to awards made under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan in accordance with the Plan rules if there is 
a change of control or winding up of the Company:
 z Any vested but unexercised options may be exercised.
 z Any options in respect of which the performance period has 
elapsed and to which the performance condition has been 
applied will vest and may be exercised.
 z Any options in respect of which the performance period 
has not elapsed may be exercised at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, subject to any adjustment to 
take into account the amount of time that has elapsed 
through the performance period and the extent to which 
any performance criteria have been met.
 z The Executive Director may agree that his awards are ‘rolled 
over’ into shares of the acquiring company as an alternative.
If the Company has been or will be affected by any demerger, 
dividend in specie, special dividend or other transaction 
which will adversely affect the current or future value of any 
awards under the LTIP , the Plan rules allow the Remuneration 
Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, to determine the 
extent to which any awards should vest and the period within 
which Options may be exercised.
A copy of the Plan rules is available from the Company 
Secretary on request.
Sharesave
Sharesave options may be exercised within six months 
following a change of control or winding up of the Company, 
using savings in the participant’s account at the date of 
exercise. The participant may agree that his or her awards 
are ‘rolled over’ into shares of the acquiring company as an 
alternative.
If the Company has been or will be affected by a capitalisation, 
rights issue, subdivision, reduction, consolidation, special 
dividend or other variation in respect of which HMRC will allow 
the variation of options, the Plan rules allow the Remuneration 
Committee, with the consent of HMRC, to vary the number 
and/or nominal value of shares covered by an option or the 
option price to be varied proportionately.
A copy of the Plan rules is available from the Company 
Secretary on request.
Joining award
If there is a change of control or winding up of the Company, 
shares subject to the award will vest and may be exercised in 
full.
The Executive may agree that his awards are ‘rolled over’ into 
shares of the acquiring company as an alternative.
Executive pay and the pay of other 
colleagues
Pay for all colleagues throughout the Group is set at a level that 
is fair for the role and responsibilities of the individual, and is 
designed to attract and retain high calibre talent that is needed 
to deliver the Group’s strategy, without paying too much.
The remuneration of Executive Directors is more heavily 
weighted towards variable pay than other colleagues, so that 
a greater part of their pay is linked to successful delivery of 
strategy and aligned with shareholders. They are also required 
to retain two-thirds of post-tax performance pay in Dunelm 
shares to be held for the duration of employment and beyond, 
and are subject to higher personal shareholding targets.
Dunelm AR2016-middle.indd   63 12/10/2016   09:56:45 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5

Remuneration Report CONTINUED
The remuneration of colleagues below the Board reflects the 
seniority of the role, market practice and the ability of the 
individual to influence Company performance.
All eligible colleagues are encouraged to participate in 
the Sharesave scheme, which enables them to become 
shareholders at a discounted rate. Participation is usually 
offered annually at the maximum price discount permitted 
(currently 20%), at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee.
In setting the policy for the Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee takes note of the overall approach to 
remuneration in the Group.
The base salary of Executive Directors may be increased 
annually in line with the Company-wide award unless other 
circumstances apply, as set out in the policy table.
The Committee does not formally consult with colleagues 
in relation to executive pay. However colleagues have the 
opportunity to raise any concerns via the People Director, 
or anonymously through engagement surveys. Recent 
engagement surveys have not identified executive pay to be a 
concern to colleagues.
Shareholder views
The Board is committed to on-going engagement with 
shareholders in respect of all governance matters, including 
executive remuneration.
In addition to this, the Company holds a Corporate 
Governance Day, usually every two years, hosted by the 
Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and the other Non-Executive 
Directors, to which all major shareholders are invited. This 
enables both parties to informally discuss governance topics, 
including remuneration. In addition, the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors usually attend results presentations and a 
selection of shareholder meetings.
Formal feedback on shareholder views is given to the Board 
twice per annum by the Company’s brokers and financial public 
relations advisers. The AGM reports issued by the Investment 
Association (IA), the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association, 
ISS and Pensions Investment Research Council (PIRC) are also 
considered by the Board.
All Directors usually attend the Annual General Meeting, and 
the Chairman and the Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
may be contacted via the Company Secretary during the year.
If any significant change to policy were proposed, the 
Committee would consult with major shareholders in advance.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Remuneration Committee will apply the following 
principles when agreeing a remuneration package for a 
new Director (whether an external candidate or an internal 
promotion):
 z The package must be sufficient to attract and retain the 
high calibre talent necessary to develop and deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
 z No more should be paid than is necessary.
 z Remuneration should be in line with the policy approved 
by shareholders set out above; however, the Committee 
reserves the discretion to make appropriate remuneration 
decisions outside the standard policy to meet the individual 
needs of the recruitment provided the Committee believes 
the relevant decisions are in the best interests of the 
Company.
These circumstances might include:
 — Where an interim appointment is made on a short term 
basis, including where the Chairman or another Non-
Executive Director has to assume an executive position.
 — Employment commences at a time in the year when it 
is inappropriate to provide a bonus or share incentive 
award as there is insufficient time to assess performance 
the quantum for the subsequent year might be increased 
proportionately instead.
 — An executive is recruited from a business or location 
that offered benefits that the Committee considers 
it appropriate to ‘buy out’ but cannot do so under 
the specific terms of the Regulations, or which the 
Committee considers it appropriate to offer.
Examples of remuneration decisions that the Committee may 
decide are set out below:
 z It may be appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, with a 
series of increases to reach the desired salary over a period 
of time, subject to performance.
 z A longer notice period of up to a maximum of 24 months 
might be offered, reducing by one month for every month 
served until the policy position is reached.
 z The Committee may also alter the performance criteria 
applicable to the initial annual bonus or LTIP award so 
that they are more applicable to the circumstances of the 
recruitment.
 z An internal candidate would be able to retain any 
outstanding variable pay awarded in respect of their 
previous role that pays out in accordance with its terms of 
grant.
 z Appropriate costs and support will be provided if the 
recruitment requires the relocation of the individual.
Dunelm AR2016-middle.indd   64 12/10/2016   09:56:45 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
65 Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the period ended 2 July 2016
governance
The maximum level of variable pay that could be awarded 
to a new Executive Director in the first year of employment, 
excluding any buyout arrangements and awards in the first 
year of employment, would normally be in line with the policy 
table set out on pages 53 to 59. The Committee would explain 
the rationale for the remuneration package in the next annual 
report of the Company.
In addition, on hiring an external candidate the Committee 
may make arrangements to buy out remuneration that the 
individual has forfeited on leaving a previous employer. The 
Committee will generally seek to structure buyout awards 
and payments on a comparable basis to remuneration 
arrangements forfeited. These awards or payments are 
excluded from the maximum level of variable pay referred 
to in the policy tables; however, the Committee’s intention is 
that the value awarded or paid would be no higher than the 
expected value of the forfeited arrangements. The Committee 
does not intend to use any discretion in this section to make 
a non-performance related incentive payment (for example a 
‘golden hello’).
In order to implement the arrangements described, the 
Committee may rely on the exemption in Listing Rule 9.4.2, 
which allows for the grant of share or share option awards 
to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a 
Director.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience 
and calibre of the individual and pay for similar roles in 
companies of similar size and complexity in the market. No 
share incentives or performance related incentives would be 
offered.

to executive remuneration on an ad hoc basis. Deloitte is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and as such 
voluntarily operates under a code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Deloitte does 
not have any other ongoing business relationship with the 
Group. The Committee is satisfied that the advice that they 
have received from Deloitte in the year has been objective and 
independent.
Total fees paid to Deloitte for remuneration related work in the 
year were £6,400.

1. Keith Down joined the Board on 7 December 2015. His basic salary, benefits, pension and bonus are pro-rated from that date.
2. As disclosed in last year’s report, the Committee agreed to pay Keith Down relocation expenses of up to £35,000. The actual amount paid of £19,365 is 
included in the ‘benefits’ column above. 
3. David Stead retired from the Board on 31 December 2015. His basic salary, benefits and pension are pro-rated to that date. He has received a time pro-
rated percentage of his FY16 annual bonus entitlement, after applying the financial performance criteria over the full performance period and the personal 
performance criteria to the date of his cessation of employment.
4. Benefits include the cost to the Company of a car allowance and private health insurance for the individual and their family (health insurance waived by 
David Stead). The 2014-15 value also includes the taxable benefit in respect of the car and chauffeur provided to Will Adderley in connection with his role 
prior to 10 September 2015. 
5. Annual bonus is the amount earned in respect of the financial year 2015-16. Details of how this was calculated are set out below.
6. The LTIP award number for 2016 is the value of the LTIP award vesting whose three year performance period ends on the last day of the financial period 
being reported (2015-16). Details of how this value was calculated are set out in the note to table 5. The first LTIP grant to John Browett and Keith Down 
was made in December 2015. Therefore there are no LTIP awards vesting to them for 2016.
 The comparable figure for 2014-15 is the actual value of the 2012 LTIP award which vested in favour of David Stead on 20 November 2015 based on the 
mid-market price on 20 November 2015, of 965.5p. The comparable figure in the 2014-15 annual report was based on the number of shares in the 2012 
LTIP award due to vest in favour of David Stead on 20 November 2015 calculated using the average share price over the three months preceding the end 
of the performance period on 4 July 2015, which was 915.7p.
7. Pension is 20% of base salary for John Browett, 15% of base salary for Keith Down and 10% for David Stead. Will Adderley waived his entitlement to 
pension from 1 July 2015.
8. From 1 July 2015 the following changes to base salary/fee were implemented: Will Adderley’s salary was reduced to £1 per annum; David Stead’s salary 
increased by 2% in line with the Company-wide award; the base fee for Non-Executive Directors was increased to £48,000 and the Committee Chair and 
SID fee increased to £6,000 per annum. Andy Harrison’s fee was increased to £200,000 per annum with effect from 8 July 2015 when he assumed his 
position as Chairman.
9. From 1 July 2016, John Browett and Keith Down’s base salary was increased by 2%, in line with the Company-wide award. Will Adderley’s base salary is held 
at £1 per annum. The fees for the Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors were also increased by 2%.

Annual bonus
Executive Directors were awarded an annual performance-related cash bonus for 2015-16 with a maximum potential payment of 
125% of salary for John Browett and Keith Down, and 100% of salary for David Stead (the bonus for both David Stead and Keith 
Down being pro-rated by time in line with service over the financial year). For all three Directors, the performance condition was 
linked to PBT versus budget (80%), and performance against personal and strategic objectives (20%). The Committee has the 
ability to apply judgement to increase or decrease the amount payable by application of the formula, although no more than the 
maximum potential opportunity would be paid.  
Financial target – 80% of bonus opportunity
For the period ended 2 July 2016, budget PBT was £128.2m. The financial target set was that no bonus would be paid until PBT 
reaches £120.5m and maximum bonus will be paid at £134.6m. Between those numbers, bonus would be payable calculated on 
a straight-line basis. Market consensus for 2015-16 PBT at the date the target was set in early September 2015 was £130.6m.
Reported PBT of £128.9m for 2015-16 has therefore given rise to a bonus payable of 47.12% of the maximum for this element of 
the bonus, meaning £235,600 to John Browett, £93,813 to Keith Down (pro-rated from 7 December 2015) and £52,809 for David 
Stead (pro-rated to 31 December 2015).
Strategic and personal objectives – 20% of bonus opportunity
Both John Browett and Keith Down were new in role during the financial year, and the strategic initiatives which underpin delivery 
of the Group’s strategy were in the course of being formalised by the Executives during the second part of the year. Their strategic 
and personal bonus targets were linked to progress against these initiatives, albeit that in view of their stage of development hard 
KPIs could not be set for all of them. The Committee therefore recognised that as a result they would need to form a holistic view 
of performance. The FY17 bonus objectives are also linked to delivery of specific strategic objectives and have firm KPIs.
Assessment of performance against strategic and personal objectives was made as follows:
Director Target Performance and bonus earned
John Browett X Satisfactory performance against the 
eight strategic initiatives during the 
financial year, measured by reference 
to milestones set out in the project 
plan for each initiative.
 X Personal objectives linked to 
establishment of a strengthened and 
highly engaged senior management 
team, and development of a strong 
relationship with the Board.
The Committee assessed that these strategic and personal 
objectives had been met in full during the year, resulting in 
delivery of 20% of total bonus opportunity.
FY16 initiative milestones were substantially met. Information 
on progress against the eight strategic initiatives is set out in 
the CEO’s Review on pages 10 to 11.
A new Executive Board is in place and the Board is working well 
(as confirmed by the external Board evaluation).
Keith Down X Ensure that the strategic initiatives 
have clear plans with a supporting 
business case, and that all of the 
plans are aligned.
 X Departmental objectives to 
strengthen the finance function.
The Committee assessed that these strategic and personal 
objectives had been met in full during the year, resulting in 
delivery of 20% of total bonus opportunity. 
All of the strategic initiatives have a formal project plan which 
contains a summary of deliverables, milestones and financial 
targets. These have been integrated into the FY17 budget and 
aligned to the IT Roadmap.
Departmental objectives have been drafted and planned 
actions completed.
David Stead X Completing the FY15 year end process 
in a satisfactory manner.
 X Facilitating a smooth handover to Keith 
Down.
The Committee assessed that these strategic and personal 
objectives had been met in full during the year, resulting in 
delivery of 20% of total bonus opportunity. 
Year end process and handover to Keith Down all completed 
smoothly.
As set out above, the Committee determined that all three Executives had met the personal and strategic targets applicable to 
their bonus in full. This has given rise to payments of £125,000 to John Browett, £49,774 to Keith Down (pro-rated from  
7 December 2015) and £28,019 to David Stead (pro-rated to 31 December 2015) in respect of this element of the bonus.

LTIP – awards earned in respect of performance in 2015–16
The only award which will mature in respect of 2015-16 performance is that granted to the former Chief Financial Officer, David 
Stead in 2013. The Remuneration Committee determined that as a ‘good leaver’, David would be entitled to receive part of 
this award, subject to performance criteria, and pro-rated by time served over the performance period (the three financial years 
ended 2 July 2016). In the case of the award maturing on 7 October 2016, this would equate to a maximum of 40,976 shares. The 
performance criteria applicable to this award was based on growth in fully diluted EPS over the performance period. For further 
information please see the policy report on pages 55 to 65.
Please note that this award is subject to a two year holding period, and therefore will not vest until October 2018.
Over the three year performance period which ended on 2 July 2016, reported fully diluted EPS grew at a compound annual rate 
of 7.9%. This is 6.1% above the compound annual growth in RPI over the same period. Accordingly, 44% of the October 2013 
LTIP award will vest in October 2018 as follows:

performance criteria.
Will Adderley waived his entitlement to receive an LTIP award in 2013. John Browett and Keith Down joined the business in 2015 
and no awards under the LTIP are due to vest to them until 2018.
The 2013 LTIP award which vests in favour of David Stead as described above is included in the single number for total 
remuneration for 2015/16 set out in table 3. The value has been calculated using the average share price over the three months

Joining award made to Keith Down in 2015
Following approval by shareholders at the AGM on 24 November 2015, and as noted in last year’s annual report, a joining award 
was made to Keith Down on 7 December 2015 over 33,958 shares in the form of a nil cost option, under the terms of the Share 
Award Agreement approved by shareholders on 24 November 2015. The market value of the award was £335,000 based on the 
closing share price on 4 December 2015, of 986.5p per share. 7,470 (22%) of these shares will vest on 15 September 2016, and 
26,488 (78%) of these shares are due to vest on 15 September 2017. Further details are set out in the policy report on page 59.
Payments to past Directors and for loss of office (audited)
Geoff Cooper
Geoff Cooper retired from his position as Chairman and stepped down from the Board on 7 July 2015. Geoff continued to 
receive a fee for his role on the Board up to and including 7 July 2015 at the rate of £122,400 per annum. He did not receive any 
payment in lieu of notice or for loss of office. As a Non-Executive Chairman, Geoff Cooper was not entitled to participate in the 
Company’s bonus, employee share plans or pension arrangements.
David Stead
David Stead retired from the Board on 31 December 2015. David received his salary, benefits and pension allowance as usual until 
his leaving date of 31 December 2015, at the rate set out in the Annual Report for 2014/15.
At 31 December 2015, David had worked for six months of the 12 month performance period applicable to his FY16 annual 
bonus. The Remuneration Committee determined that he would receive 50% of his FY16 annual bonus entitlement in September 
2016, after applying the financial performance criteria over the full performance period and the personal performance criteria to 
the date of cessation of employment. Details of the amount paid are included in tables 3 and 4. 
At 31 December 2015, David had three outstanding awards under the LTIP:

*  Includes two year holding period following the end of the three year performance period.
The Remuneration Committee determined that as a ‘good leaver’ with 12 years’ service during a time of substantial growth 
in shareholder value, David may exercise the above awards, subject to time pro rating, and after applying the applicable 
performance criteria over the full performance period. The maximum possible vesting, if performance conditions are fully met, is 
set out in the table above (column headed “No of shares pro-rated to 31 December 2015”).
The awards may be exercised within six months of the normal vesting date specified above.
The above arrangements are fully in line with the Remuneration Policy approved at the AGM in November 2015. The LTIP award 
made to David Stead in October 2015 was disclosed in last year’s remuneration report which was approved by shareholders. The 
Remuneration Committee’s decision reflects the service provided by David over the financial years covered by the applicable 
performance periods and has been pro-rated according to that service over those periods.
No further payments have been or are being made to David Stead in respect of loss of office or the termination of his 
employment.
Statement of Directors’ share interests (audited)
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding target which requires them to build a beneficial holding of Dunelm shares with 
a value of 1× salary after three years and 2 × salary after five years (measured by reference to share price at the financial year 
end). In addition, they are required to make a personal investment in Dunelm shares on appointment (subject to Company close 
periods); and to invest two-thirds of any annual bonus paid and LTIP awards earned (after payment of tax and national insurance 
liability on exercise) in Dunelm shares.

Share options and dilution
The Remuneration Committee considers the provisions of the Investment Association’s Guidelines on Executive Remuneration 
when determining the number of shares over which share scheme incentive awards may be made. At the date of this report, since 
flotation of the Group in 2006, options have been granted over 2.5% of the Company’s issued share capital. The Group does not 
hold any shares in an employee benefit trust.
Service contracts
In accordance with the Group’s policy, the service contracts of the Executive Directors have no fixed term, the notice period for 
termination is 12 months from either party for contracts entered into before 1 July 2015, and six months for contracts entered into 
on or after that date. Payments on termination are restricted to a maximum of the value of base salary and benefits for the notice 
period. The Remuneration Committee may apply mitigation in respect of any termination payment.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years with a provision for termination of one 
month’s notice from either party, or three months’ notice from either party in the case of Andy Harrison, the Chairman.
Table 10 – Directors’ service contracts

Since Marion Sears has now served 11 years on the Board (nine of which are post flotation of the Company in 2006), and Simon 
Emeny has served nine years on the Board, their contracts are renewed for one year terms (rather than three), with the notice 
period referred to above.
Relative TSR performance
The graph below shows the Group’s performance over seven years, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the 
FTSE General Retail Index and the FTSE 250. The Remuneration Committee has chosen these indices for comparison because 
they provide a range of comparator companies which have similar market capitalisation, which are in the same sector and which 
face similar market and economic challenges in the long term.

Executive Director external Board appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold one external appointment as a Non-Executive Director or similar advisory or 
consultative role, subject to the Board being satisfied that there is no conflict of interest and that the position will not impact 
negatively on the Executive’s commitment to their Dunelm role. The Board may allow the Executive to retain any remuneration 
received in respect of the appointment.
Will Adderley does not hold any external PLC Board appointments.
On joining the Company on 1 July 2015, John Browett was a Non-Executive Director of easyJet plc, and retained this position until 
31 December 2015. He was also a Director of Octopus Capital Limited and Octopus Investments Limited (effectively one external 
role) during the period. He retained his Director fees (easyJet £30,000 to 31 December 2015; Octopus £50,000).
Keith Down was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Topps Tiles plc on 1 July 2015, prior to his appointment to the Board 
of Dunelm. He retained his Director fees (£24,000 from 7 December 2015 in 2015-16). 
David Stead was a Non-Executive Director of Card Factory plc on 12 May 2014. He retained his Director fee (£26,000 to

Senior Executive remuneration
The Remuneration Committee provides oversight and guidance on the remuneration structure for Executive Board members. The 
package for new appointments is formally presented to the Committee for approval. In conducting its assessment of Executive 
Board remuneration, the Committee pays particular regard to whether any individual is incentivised to take risks inappropriate to 
their role and responsibilities.
Members of the Senior Management Team are eligible for awards under either the LTIP or the Company Share Option scheme 
(market priced options).
All members of senior management who receive share awards are also subject to shareholding targets as follows:
Executive Board and certain other senior Executives 1× base salary to be acquired over five years
Other Executives 0.5× base salary to be acquired over time

Annual bonus
John Browett and Keith Down have been awarded a bonus opportunity of up to 125% of base salary. The performance conditions 
attached to the bonus are:
 z 80% linked to achievement of Budget PBT;
 z 20% linked to achievement of strategic and personal targets, aligned to the Group strategy.
The Budget PBT is set taking into account market consensus and broker expectations. The actual financial and strategic targets 
have not been disclosed at this time as they are commercially sensitive. The targets and an assessment of the extent to which they 
have been achieved will be disclosed in next year’s remuneration report.
John Browett and Keith Down have each committed that two-thirds of the bonus earned (after payment of income tax and national 
insurance) will be invested in Dunelm shares, to be held for the duration of employment, with 50% of these shares to be retained 
for two years following cessation of employment.
LTIP
An award is expected to be made to John Browett and Keith Down under the Long Term Incentive Plan in October 2016. The 
award to John Browett will be over 110,000 shares, and to Keith Down over 60,000 shares.
The awards to John Browett and Keith Down will vest, subject to continued employment, on the third anniversary of the grant 
date, to the extent that performance conditions have been met. Two-thirds of vested shares (after sale to cover tax and national 
insurance liability on exercise) must be retained for the duration of employment, and 50% of these must be retained for two years 
following cessation of employment.
As in the past four years, Will Adderley has waived his entitlement to receive an LTIP award.
Sharesave
An invitation will be issued in October 2016 to all eligible employees, to apply for options to be granted under the Sharesave 
scheme at a 20% discount to the closing market price of Dunelm Group shares on the dealing day preceding the issue of the 
invitation. The maximum monthly savings will be £500 per month. Executive Directors employed at the eligibility date may apply 
for Sharesave options.

Last year we announced a number of changes to our Board as 
part of our long term succession plan as Dunelm moves into its 
next chapter of growth. This has been a year of transition for 
the Board during which these changes have taken effect.
I succeeded Geoff Cooper as Chairman of the Board at the 
start of the financial year in July 2015, and became Chair of this 
Committee in March of this year. The previous chair, Marion 
Sears, played a major part in shaping the Board that we have 
today during her ten years as Committee Chair and I thank her 
on behalf of the Board and shareholders for her diligent and 
committed work.
As we announced last year, our Executive team changed during 
the year. In January 2016, John Browett formally succeeded 
Will Adderley as Chief Executive, after a six month induction 
during which he spent time working in all parts of the business, 
developing the eight strategic initiatives which underpin our 
growth strategy, and making a number of new appointments to 
strengthen the Executive team. The Board and the business are 
already benefiting from John’s clear leadership and experience, 
which, combined with that of Will Adderley, means we now 
have two top retailers on our Board.
Keith Down succeeded David Stead as Chief Financial Officer 
in December 2015. David retired from the Board after twelve 
years on the Board. During this period he built and led the 
finance team (and, until recently, the IT and HR functions) 
through the Group’s IPO in 2006 and the sustained growth 
which followed. Keith has brought a wealth of experience from 
his previous roles in the consumer, hospitality and transport 
sectors, and he has already made an impact at the Board and 
with the wider Executive team.
We were also joined by two new Non-Executives: William 
Reeve in July 2015 and Peter Ruis in September 2015. 
We now have a Board with a combination of experience and 
fresh ideas, with complementary retail, consumer and online 
expertise. The Board is already working well together, and I 
expect that we will continue to build on this over the coming 
months and years.
This year we held an externally facilitated Board evaluation, 
which was completed shortly before the financial year end. This 
confirmed that your new Board is working well together and 
brought some helpful insights to make us more effective.
A number of external bodies have commented during the year 
on the importance of the work of the Nominations Committee 
in overseeing succession planning in particular, including the 
Financial Reporting Council and the report produced through 
a collaboration between Ernst & Young and the Institute of 
Company Secretaries and Administrators. We have a number 
of the recommended best practice processes in place, 
including a formal Board succession plan, and oversight of 
the composition and changes to the Executive team below 
the Board. This focus will continue and grow over the coming 
years.
Looking forward, as part of our normal succession process, we 
expect to appoint an additional Non-Executive Director during 
2017 to succeed Simon Emeny, who is expected to step down 
at the 2017 AGM after ten years on the Board. 
Yours sincerely,
Andy Harrison 
Chair of the Nominations Committee

Committee Activities in 2015–16
Board Succession Planning
For a number of years we have had a formal, long range plan 
for how Board membership should develop. As usual, we 
aim to balance continuity with regular refreshment of skill and 
experience.
In 2015-16 a number of changes planned and announced in 
the previous year took effect. 
On at least an annual basis each Director’s intentions are 
discussed with regard to serving on the Board and their 
succession is considered in the context of the shape of the 
overall Board and the corporate governance guidance on 
Non-Executive Director tenure. This transparency amongst a 
small and collegiate Board allows for an open discussion about 
succession for each individual, both for short-term emergency 
purposes as well as longer-term plans.
As part of our Board evaluation process, we conducted an 
analysis of the balance of skills on the Board as a whole, 
taking account of the future needs of the business, and the 
knowledge, experience, length of service and performance 
of the Directors. In accordance with our policy, we also had 
regard to the requirement to achieve a diversity of characters, 
backgrounds and experiences amongst Board members. 
Summary of Board changes in 2015–16
 X July 2015: Andy Harrison succeeded Geoff Cooper as 
Chairman.
 X September 2015: Peter Ruis appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director. 
Simon Emeny succeeded Marion Sears as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee.
 X December 2015: Keith Down succeeded David Stead as 
Chief Financial Officer. 
David Stead retired.
 X January 2016: John Browett succeeded Will Adderley as 
Chief Executive. 
Will Adderley become Deputy Chairman.
 X March 2016: Andy Harrison succeeded Marion Sears as 
Chair of the Nominations Committee.
All of these changes were described in last year’s Nominations 
Committee report.
Board evaluation
This year we appointed a third party, Lorna Parker, to carry out 
a formal evaluation of the Board and its processes. The review 
confirmed that there is a good balance of complementary skills 
and experiences on the Board, and that compared to many 
other companies the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
are especially hard-working, committed and involved.
Separately I carried out a formal evaluation of the Non-
Executive Directors and the Chief Executive; the Chief 
Executive reviewed the performance of the Chief Financial 
Officer; and the Non-Executive Directors reviewed my 
performance. 
Diversity
In 2011 we set out the Board’s policy on diversity which we 
believe remains appropriate for Dunelm. It can be summarised 
as follows:
 z Whilst confirming that our overriding concern is to ensure 
the Board comprises outstanding individuals who can 
lead the Group, we also believe the Group’s best interests 
are served by ensuring that these individuals represent a 
range of skills, experiences, backgrounds and perspectives, 
including gender.
 z Accordingly, it is our policy that the Board should always be 
of mixed gender.
 z Quotas are not appropriate as a target for female 
representation on company boards, since they are likely 
to lead to compromised decisions on Board membership, 
quality and size.
 z We will seek to ensure that specific effort is made to bring 
forward female candidates for Board appointments.
 z We will monitor the Group’s approach to people 
development to ensure that it continues to enable 
talented individuals, both male and female, to enjoy career 
progression within Dunelm.

Details of the gender balance within the Group are set out in 
the Corporate Social Responsibility report on page 29. The 
Committee is pleased that there is a good level of gender 
diversity at Board, Executive Board and senior management 
level (22%, 40% and 33% respectively).
Tenure and Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
all Directors will seek re-election at the 2016 AGM, and as 
now required by the Listing Rules the Non-Executives will be 
subject to an additional vote by shareholders independent of 
the Adderley family.
Marion Sears and Simon Emeny have served eleven and nine 
years on the Board respectively. Marion is now considered by 
the Board to be ‘non-independent’ in view of her tenure. As 
noted in last year’s report, we have asked Simon to stay for an 
extra year at the end of his nine year term to provide continuity 
during the recent period of change; it is expected that he 
will retire at the 2017 AGM following the appointment of a 
successor. I am mid-way through my first three year term, and 
Liz Doherty is now in the fourth year since appointment, with 
both William Reeve and Peter Ruis in their first term.
Executives below Board
The Committee has for some years had both formal and 
informal oversight of the Executive team below Board. Dunelm 
Board members have regular contact with these Executives, 
both through formal Board presentations and in regular store 
visits, where a Non-Executive Director meets a member of the 
Executive Board on a less formal basis. This year the Board also 
received a Talent Management presentation from the People 
Director, which will become part of the Board’s rolling agenda 
going forward. As part of the development of the Senior 
Management Team, we have implemented a programme of 
presentations by Non-Executive Directors to this group of 40 
or so senior managers, to share their leadership experience. 
Although these activities are not formally conducted as part 
of the work of the Nominations Committee, we see this as a 
useful way of preserving our culture and an important aspect 
of our oversight of the Executive team development and 
succession process.

b. not take any action which precludes or inhibits any member 
of the Group from carrying on its business independently 
of Jean and Bill Adderley and their associates (as defined in 
the Listing Rules);
c. not exercise any of their voting rights or other powers to 
procure any amendment to the Articles of Association of the 
Company which would be inconsistent with or undermine 
any of the provisions of the Relationship Agreement;
d. abstain from voting on any resolution to which LR11.7.R(4) 
of the Listing Rules applies involving Jean Adderley, Bill 
Adderley or Will Adderley or any of their associates as the 
related party;
e. not carry on (other than through their holding of securities 
of the Company) or have any financial interest (other 
than a financial interest in securities which are held for 
investment purposes only) in any person who carries on a 
business as a homewares retailer, to the extent that it would 
be inconsistent with or undermine any provisions of the 
Relationship Agreement; and
f. only enter into, amend or terminate any transaction, 
agreement or relationship between themselves or any of 
their associates and any member of the Group with the 
approval of a majority of the independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
WA Capital Limited and Nadine Adderley, to whom Will 
Adderley transferred shares by way of a gift, have subsequently 
become party to this agreement.
In July 2014, the Relationship Agreement was amended so as 
to comply with Listing Rule LR 9.2.2A(2)(a), which came into 
effect on 16 May 2014. The following additional undertakings 
were given by the parties:
 z no action will be taken that would have the effect 
of preventing the Company from complying with its 
obligations under the Listing Rules; and
 z no resolution will be proposed, or procured to be proposed, 
which is intended to, or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
In addition, the Articles of Association of the Company provide 
that the election and re-election of independent Directors must 
be conducted in accordance with the election provisions set 
out in LR 9.2.2ER and LR 9.2.2FR. This means that the election 
or re-election of each independent Director at the Annual 
General Meeting will be subject to an additional separate 
resolution upon which parties controlling 30% or more of the 
voting shares of the Company are not eligible to vote.
The Company confirms that it has complied with its obligations 
under the Relationship Agreement during the financial period 
under review, and that so far as it is aware, all other parties to 
that agreement have complied with it.
The Company confirms that there are no contracts of 
significance between any member of the Group and any of 
the parties to the Relationship Agreement, with the exception 
of Will Adderley’s service agreement as a Director of the 
Company, the terms of which are outlined in the Remuneration 
Report.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of Ordinary Shares 
in the Company other than certain restrictions imposed by 
laws and regulations (such as insider trading and marketing 
requirements relating to close periods) and requirements of 
the Listing Rules whereby Directors and certain employees of 
the Company require Board approval to deal in the Company’s 
securities.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required 
to:
 z select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 z make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 z state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
 z prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Corporate Governance Report, confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
 z the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
 z the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with Section 418, the Directors’ report shall 
include a statement, in the case of each Director in office at the 
date the Directors’ report is approved, that:
a. so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
b. he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the members of Dunelm Group plc
Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
 z Dunelm Group plc’s Group financial statements and Parent 
Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the Parent Company’s affairs as at 2 July 2016 and of the 
Group’s profit and the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
cash flows for the 52 week period (the “period”) then 
ended;
 z the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union;
 z the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 z the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, 
comprise:
 z the consolidated and Parent Company statements of 
financial position as at 2 July 2016;
 z the consolidated income statement and consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the period then 
ended;
 z the consolidated and Parent Company statements of cash 
flows for the period then ended;
 z the consolidated and Parent Company statements of 
changes in equity for the period then ended; and
 z the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere 
in the Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (the ‘Annual Report’), 
rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These 
are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, and applicable law and, as regards the 
Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit approach
Overview
  
  
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas
of focus
 z Overall Group materiality: £6.4 
million which represents 5% of 
profit before tax.
 z The Group is structured with 
one segment that comprises a 
consolidation of six legal entities.
 z We conducted an audit of the 
complete financial information of 
these six legal entities, together 
with additional procedures 
performed, including over the 
Group consolidation.
 z Inventory provisions.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and 
effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We 
have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these 
specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is 
not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

financials
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Inventory provisions
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 49 
and the use of estimates and judgements in the Accounting 
Policies on page 96.
Inventory represents a significant asset on the Group’s balance 
sheet and is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value (“NRV”).
The NRV provision involves judgement in assessing slow 
moving or obsolete inventory. The Group accounting policy 
is based upon an analysis of the number of weeks’ cover of 
inventory (i.e. number of weeks’ sales held in inventory) based 
upon an average of the previous 26 weeks of sales. Provisions 
are recorded according to the number of weeks’ cover, type 
of inventory, certain classifications (such as whether inventory 
is a continuity line or discontinued) and management’s 
assessment of the expected realisable value for each category 
of inventory.
We tested the inputs to the provision calculation, including 
the classification (for example continuity line or discontinued) 
of inventory to reports from the buying department, which 
is segregated from the finance department, and found them 
to be consistent. We also re-performed the weeks’ cover 
calculation, identifying no exceptions.
We challenged the expected realisable value of inventory 
by reference to the historic experience of selling inventory 
at below cost and management’s intended plans for future 
routes of clearance. We found that the provision rates were 
consistent with the evidence obtained, based on past activity, 
and appropriately applied.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we 
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the 
geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes 
and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured with one segment. The Group financial 
statements are a consolidation of six legal entities within 
this segment, comprising the Group’s operating business, 
intermediate holding companies and centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we 
identified two legal entities: Dunelm Soft Furnishings Limited 
and Dunelm Group plc, which, in our view, required an audit 
of their complete financial information due to their financial 
significance to the Group.
In addition, we also conducted the statutory audits of the 
remaining four non-significant legal entities such that the audit 
work was complete prior to finalisation of the audit of the 
Group financial statements, thereby providing further evidence 
in support of our Group opinion. 
The audits of these six legal entities, together with the 
additional procedures performed at the Group level, including 
over the Group consolidation, gave us the evidence we 
needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a 
whole.

Independent Auditors’ Report CONTINUED
to the members of Dunelm Group plc
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality
£6.4 million (2015: £6.1 million).
How we 
determined it
5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
We have applied this benchmark, a 
generally accepted auditing practice, as 
we believe this is the key measure used 
by the shareholders in evaluating the 
performance of the Group.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£0.05 million (2015: £0.05 million) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 25, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to 
in relation to the Directors’ statement about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material 
to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern 
basis presumes that the Group and Parent Company have 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from 
the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our 
audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.

Independent Auditors’ Report CONTINUED
to the members of Dunelm Group plc
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in 
relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted 
of making enquiries and considering the Directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are 
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our 
audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information 
and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 z we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
 z adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 z the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 
opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, a corporate governance statement 
has not been prepared by the Parent Company. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further 
provisions of the Code. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.  
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 84, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
 z whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 z the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and
 z the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial 
statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We 
obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge

Dunelm AR2016-back.indd   95 12/10/2016   09:55:24 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of Dunelm 
Group plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’). The Company financial statements 
on pages 91 to 115 present information about the Company 
as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group and its subsidiaries are domiciled, and are 
incorporated as limited companies, in the UK.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations 
Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the 
European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS and these are presented on 
pages 91 to 115.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise 
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these Group financial statements.
The annual financial statements are prepared under the 
historical cost convention except for financial assets and 
financial liabilities, which have been stated at fair value. The 
financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, rounded 
to the nearest hundred thousand.
Going concern 
The Group has considerable financial resources together with 
long standing relationships with a number of key suppliers 
and an established reputation in the retail sector across the 
UK. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group 
is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. 
Having reassessed the principal risks, the Directors consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial information.
Further information regarding the Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position is set out in the Strategic Report 
and Business Review on pages 3 to 34. The financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s review 
on pages 14 to 16. In addition note 16 to the Annual Report 
and Accounts includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
Use of estimates and judgements
The presentation of the annual financial statements in 
conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires the 
Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience 
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in 
any future periods affected.
The key estimates and judgements used in the financial 
statements are as follows:
Inventory provisions
The Group provides against the carrying value of the 
inventories held where it is anticipated that net realisable value 
(NRV) will be below cost. NRV is calculated as the expected 
selling price less any cost to sell the goods. Future price 
reductions in turn are assumed to be in line with the Group’s 
standard approach to clearing discontinued and slow-moving 
inventory and are applied to such proportion of inventory as 
deemed appropriate given the level of cover in relation to 
recent sales history, on a line by line basis.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. An 
investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date 
that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or 
income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Consistent accounting policies have been 
adopted across the group.
Revenue
Revenue is generated from the sale of homewares through 
the Group’s stores and website, and small amounts of related 
services such as the Dunelm at home consultants. Revenue 
therefore represents the proceeds from sales of goods and 
related services, excluding sales between Group companies 
and is after deducting returns, discounts given and VAT. 
Revenue is recognised when risk and reward passes to the 
customer, which is predominantly at the point of sale. The 
exceptions to this are for custom-made products, where 
revenue is recognised at the point that the goods are 
collected, gift vouchers, where revenue is recognised when 
the vouchers are redeemed and web sales, where revenue is 
recognised at the point of delivery. Revenue is settled in cash 
at the point of sale.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
prevailing rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at 
the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Resulting exchange 
gains or losses are recognised in the income statement for the 
period.

Intangible assets
These comprise software development and implementation 
costs and brands and are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation (see below). Costs incurred in developing the 
Group’s own brands are expensed as incurred.
Separately acquired brands are shown at historical cost. Brands 
have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate the cost of brands over their estimated 
useful lives. 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on 
the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use 
the specific software. These costs are amortised over their 
estimated useful lives.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software 
programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design 
and testing of identifiable and unique software products 
controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets 
when the following criteria are met:
 z it is technically feasible to complete the software product so 
that it will be available for use;  
 z management intends to complete the software product and 
use or sell it;  
 z there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
 z it can be demonstrated how the software product will 
generate probable future economic benefits;  
 z adequate technical, financial and other resources to 
complete the development and to use or sell the software 
product are available; and 
 z the expenditure attributable to the software product during 
its development can be reliably measured.  
Other development expenditures that do not meet 
these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are 
not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets 
are amortised over their estimated useful lives.  
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. These are 
as follows:
software development and licences 3 years 
trademarks and brands 5 to 15 years
Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses. 
Cost includes the original purchased price of the asset and the 
costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for intended use. 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment to write down the cost 
to its estimated residual value. Land is not depreciated. The 
estimated useful lives are as follows:
freehold buildings 50 years
leasehold improvements over the period of the lease
plant and machinery 4 years
fixtures and fittings 3 to 5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair 
value and then carried at amortised cost net of impairment 
provisions.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is derived using the average cost method and 
includes costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price less cost to sell in the ordinary course 
of business. Provisions are made for obsolete, slow-moving or 
discontinued stock and for stock losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and 
deposits. All cash equivalents have an original maturity of three 
months or less.
Trade and other payables
Trade and payables are recognised initially at their fair value 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate.
Bank borrowings and borrowing costs
Interest-bearing bank loans are initially recorded at their fair 
value and subsequently held at amortised cost. Transaction 
costs incurred are amortised over the term of the loan. 
Borrowings are classed as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments used are forward foreign 
exchange contracts and structured foreign exchange 
options. These are measured at fair value. The fair values are 
97 Dunelm Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the period ended 2 July 2016
Dunelm AR2016-back.indd   97 12/10/2016   09:55:24 24722.04    12 October 2016 7:29 AM   PROOF 5
determined by reference to the market prices available from 
the market on which the instruments involved are traded.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as 
hedges in line with the Group’s treasury policy. These are 
instruments that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows 
that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
highly probable forecasted transaction.
For cash flow hedges the proportion of the gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an 
effective hedge, as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’, is recognised in equity, 
directly in the hedge reserve with any ineffective portion 
recognised in the income statement. Such hedges are tested, 
both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective 
and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing 
effectiveness. The gains or losses that are recognised in equity 
are transferred to the income statement in the same period in 
which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value derivative 
financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised 
in the income statement
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value and value 
in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an 
asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds the 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement.
Share capital
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital 
(treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares 
are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, any consideration received net of any directly 
attributable incremental transactions costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group 
has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. A provision 
for onerous contracts, including property leases, is recognised 
when the expected benefit to be derived by the Group from 
a contract is lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its 
obligations under the contract.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is an 
expectation of future obligations relating to the maintenance 
of leasehold properties arising from events such as lease 
renewals or terminations.
Operating leases
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment and 
motor vehicles. Where a significant portion of the risks and 
rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor, these leases 
are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of 
the lease. 
Expenses
Property leases
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income 
statement evenly over the full term of the lease.
Where leases for land and buildings provide for fixed rent 
review dates and amounts, the Group financial statements 
account for such reviews by recognising, on a straight-line 
basis, the total implicit minimum lease payments over the non-
cancellable period of the lease term.
Financing income/expense
Financing income/expense comprises interest payable on 
borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, 
interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange 
gains and losses.
Retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan using 
a third-party provider. Obligations for the contributions to this 
plan are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for equity instruments 
(options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is 
recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted:
 z including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
 z excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the 
entity over a specified time period); and
 z including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for 
example, the requirement for employees to save).

financials
Non-market performance and service conditions are included 
in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting 
period, which is the period over which all of the specified 
vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
In addition, in some circumstances employees may provide 
services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant 
date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the 
expense during the period between service commencement 
period and grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest 
based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company either issues 
new shares, or uses treasury shares purchased for this purpose. 
For issued new shares, the proceeds received net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The social security contributions payable in connection with 
the grant of the share options is considered an integral part  
of the grant itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-
settled transaction.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which 
they are approved such that the Company is obligated to pay 
the dividend. Interim dividends are recorded when paid.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the 
taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be recognised. Deferred tax assets are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be recognised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income 
taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balances on a net basis.
New standards and interpretations
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective 
for the first time for the period beginning on or after 5 July 
2015 have had a material impact on the Group or Parent 
Company. 
At the balance sheet date there are a number of new 
standards and amendments to existing standards in issue 
but not yet effective. None of these is expected to have a 
significant effect on the financial statements of the Group or 
Parent Company, except the following, set out below: 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, which is effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018, replaces IAS 39 and 
addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of 
financial assets and financial liabilities.
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ addresses the definition of a lease, 
recognition and measurement of leases and establishes 
principles for reporting useful information to users of financial 
statements about the leasing activities of both lessees and 
lessors. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most 
operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet for 
lessees. The standard replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’, and related 
interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is 
permitted, subject to EU endorsement and the entity adopting 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ at the same 
time. The full impact of IFRS 16 has not yet been assessed.

1 Segmental reporting
The Group has one reportable segment, in accordance with IFRS 8 — Operating Segments, which is the retail of homewares  
in the UK. 
Customers access the Group’s offer across multiple channels and often their journey involves more than one channel. Therefore 
internal reporting focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify individual segments. 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc. Internal management reports are 
reviewed by them on a monthly basis. Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial 
KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making 
resource allocation decisions. 
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK. The Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of 
individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.

8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company 
and held as treasury shares (note 20).
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the 
average market price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares during the period.

16 Financial risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal process for 
reviewing and managing risk in the business is in place. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as foreign 
exchange hedging agreements with its banking counterparties. The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses 
publicly available financial information to rate its counterparties.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of ‘A’ credit 
rating. Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to £25m for any individual party.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of financial assets. At the period end the 
maximum exposure is detailed in the table below.

Cash and cash equivalents 14.9 16.2 
Trade and other receivables 3.2 3.2
Derivative financial instruments 7.4 – 
Total financial assets 25.5 19.4
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, 
under both normal and extreme circumstances. The Group manages this risk by continuously monitoring cash flow forecasts. The 
Group’s available facilities can be found in note 17.
The table below analyses estimated future contractual cash flows in respect of the Group’s financial liabilities, according to the 
earliest date on which the Group could be required to settle the liability. Floating rate interest payments are estimated based on 
market interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges. The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the 
Group within the constraints of its financial covenants. The Group will continue to monitor movements in the interest rate swap 
market. 
At the year end if Libor interest rates had been 10 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post tax profit 
would have been £0.1m lower/higher (2015: £0.1m) as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.

16 Financial risk management continued
Foreign currency risk
All of the Group’s revenues are in sterling. The majority of purchases are also in sterling, but some goods purchased direct from 
overseas suppliers are paid for in US dollars, accounting for just under 20% of stock purchases in the period ended 2 July 2016.
The Group uses various means to cover its exposure to US dollars: holding US dollar cash balances and taking out forward foreign 
exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars.
All the Group’s foreign exchange transactions are designed to satisfy US dollar denominated liabilities. The maximum level of 
hedging coverage which will be undertaken is 100% of anticipated expenditure on a three month horizon, stepping down to 75% 
on a nine to 12 month horizon. Coverage beyond 12 months is minimal.
Cash flow hedges are in place to manage foreign exchange rate risk arising from forecast purchases denominated in US dollars. At 
the balance sheet date, the fair value of US dollar foreign exchange forward contracts held in cash flow hedges was £7.2m asset 
(2015: £0.3m liability) which relates to a commitment to purchase $90.5m for a fixed sterling amount. A fair value movement of 
£10.3m (2015: £1.0m) was recognised in other comprehensive income and no ineffectiveness (2015: nil) was noted on cash flow 
hedges during the period. In the period, a gain of £2.9m (2015: £1.7m loss) was recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve to 
inventory to offset foreign exchange movements on purchases. The remaining hedge reserve balance will be recycled to the income 
statement to offset future purchases occurring after the balance sheet date, the majority of which expire in the next 12 months.
The outstanding US dollar liabilities at the period end were $0.4m (2015: $0.3m).
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group could seek to minimise the impact on 
profitability by changing the selling price of goods, renegotiating terms with suppliers or sourcing from alternative markets.
At the year end if GBP had strengthened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post tax profit would have 
been £0.2m higher (2015: £0.4m) as a result of foreign exchange gains on translation of USD denominated trade payables 
compensated by foreign exchange losses on translation of USD cash and cash equivalents. Other components of equity would 
have been £5.0m lower (2015: £5.9m lower) as a result of a decrease in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.
Conversely, if GBP had weakened by 10% against USD with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would 
have been £0.2m lower (2015: nil) and other components of equity would have been £6.1m higher (2015: £7.2m higher).
The US dollar period end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.3265 (2015: 1.5603).
Fair values
The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying value. The fair value of foreign currency 
contracts are amounts required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the period.
Fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
 z Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 z Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
 z Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All derivative financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, based on observable 
market data.

Capital management
The Company considers equity plus debt as the capital.
The Board’s objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order to 
optimise returns to shareholders. The Board’s policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and 
market confidence and to sustain future development. The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in the Group to ensure 
that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market. The shares are intended to be used for issuing shares 
under the Group’s share option programmes. The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed to ensure that all 
options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares.
During FY15, the Board reviewed its policy on capital structure and dividends. The original policy was established at the time of 
the flotation of the Company in 2006 and in the Board’s opinion has ceased to reflect the scale of the business and its consistent 
track record of cash generation over many years. Accordingly, the Board determined that the Group will operate with a modest 
amount of leverage such that net debt should fall within the range of 0.25 to 0.75 times the last 12 months EBITDA. In order to 
fund the ongoing debt, the Group entered into an arrangement with a syndicate of three major banks for the provision of a £150 
million revolving credit facility, expiring on 9 February 2020.
The gearing ratio and net debt as a percentage of EBITDA was as follows:

21 Share-based payments continued
a) Dunelm Group Share Option Plan
The GSOP was established in December 2003. Options have a vesting period of three years from date of grant and a maximum 
life of ten years. All grants have an exercise price equal to market price at date of grant. These grants are dependent on the level 
of growth in the Group’s EPS relative to RPI as well as continuing employment with the Group.

The weighted average share price at the time of exercise during the year was 972.0p.
b) Dunelm Group Savings Related Share Option Plan
The Sharesave scheme was established in 2006 and is open to all staff with eligible length of service. Grants are made under the 
scheme annually. Options may be exercised under the scheme within six months of the completion of each three year savings 
contract. There is provision for early exercise in certain circumstances such as death, disability, redundancy and retirement.

c) Long-Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was approved by the Board in 2006 enabling the Group to award shares to particular individuals, normally in the form 
of nominal cost options. The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee. One grant was made in the period, to the 
Executive Directors and senior management. These grants are exercisable in November 2018, dependent on the level of growth 
in Group EPS relative to RPI, as well as continuing employment. The maximum life of options under the LTIP is ten years from the 
date of grant. Full details of this plan are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 77.

Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted 
IFRSs’) and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements of the Company are prepared 
under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006, applicable accounting standards and 
specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out 
below.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the 
adjusted cost of the investment. IFRS 2 requires the Parent 
Company to recognise an increase in the cost of its investment 
in a subsidiary which has issued share options in the Parent 
Company’s shares to its employees.
Current assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair 
value and then carried at amortised cost net of impairment 
provisions.
Share capital
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital 
(treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares 
are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, any consideration received net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Company operates one equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plan, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of 
the Company. The fair value of the employee services received 
in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an 
expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the options granted:
 z including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
 z excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the 
entity over a specified time period); and
 z including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for 
example, the requirement for employees to save). 
Non-market performance and service conditions are included 
in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting 
period, which is the period over which all of the specified 
vesting conditions are to be satisfied.
In addition, in some circumstances employees may provide 
services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant 
date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the 
expense during the period between service commencement 
period and grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest 
based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company either issues 
new shares, or uses treasury shares purchased for this purpose. 
For issued new shares, the proceeds received net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The social security contributions payable in connection with 
the grant of the share options is considered an integral part  
of the grant itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-
settled transaction.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which 
they are approved such that the Company is obligated to pay 
the dividend.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the 
taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be recognised. Deferred tax assets are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be recognised.
New standards and interpretations
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective 
for the first time for the period beginning on or after 5 July 
2015 have had a material impact on the Parent Company.
At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards 
and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet 
effective. None of these is expected to have a significant effect 
on the financial statements of the Company.

12 Share-based payments
As at 2 July 2016, the Company operated one share award plan:
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
There were no exercisable options under this scheme as at 2 July 2016 (2015: 2,000).
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was approved by the Board in 2006 enabling the Group to award shares to particular individuals, normally in the form 
of nominal cost options. The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee. One grant was made in the period, to the 
Executive Directors and senior management. These grants are exercisable in December 2018, dependent on the level of growth 
in Group EPS relative to RPI, as well as continuing employment. The maximum life of options under the LTIP is ten years from the 
date of grant. Full details of this plan are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 77.
The fair value of options granted during the period was determined using the Black–Scholes valuation model. The significant 
inputs into the model are detailed below. The volatility is measured at the standard deviation of share returns based on the daily 
share price over the twenty days prior to the grant date.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

Introduction
We are pleased to report Nationwide’s maiden 
results following the Company’s successful 
admission to AiM in July 2006. Results for the year 
are very encouraging and demonstrate the progress 
we are making in developing the Group.
Financial Overview 
Sales for the twelve months ended  
31 December 2006 increased by 8% to £151.2m 
(2005: £139.6m), operating profit before  
non-recurring items rose by 42% to £5.8m (2005: 
£4.0m) and profit before tax before non-recurring 
items rose by 67% to £5.9m (2005: £3.5m). 
Operating profit after non-recurring costs relating 
to the flotation and the payment of certain 
contractual bonuses was £2.2m (2005: £7.8m). 
Profit before tax was £2.4m (2005: £7.3m) and 
basic earnings per share were 3.1p (2005: 14.5p). 
Excluding non-recurring items, earnings per share 
were 9.0p (2005: 5.5p), an increase of 64%.
The Company adopts IAS 19, the ‘corridor 
approach’, for its pension obligations. However, 
in order to provide shareholders with financial 
results which are comparable with other companies, 
results under FRS 17 are also shown. Under FRS 
17, operating profit before non-recurring items 
rose by 33% to £7.0m (2005: £5.3m), underlying 
profit before tax improved by 55% to £7.2m 
(2005: £4.6m) and underlying earnings per 
share rose by 53% to 11.0p (2005: 7.2p).
The Group’s cash position remains strong with net 
cash at 31 December 2006 of £6.9m (2005: £4.1m). 
Dividend
As set out in the Company’s AiM Admission 
Document, the Directors intend to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy which broadly reflects 
the growth in underlying earnings over time and 
Group prospects. The Directors are recommending 
the payment of a final dividend of 2.60p per share 
in respect of the year to 31 December 2006. Subject 
to approval at the Annual General Meeting, this 
will be paid on 21 May 2007 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 20 April 2007. 
Ordinarily, over the course of a financial year, final 
dividends are expected to represent two thirds of 
the total annual dividend.
Trading Overview
As our results indicate, trading over the year as 
a whole was very good and reflects the efficiency 
of our operations and systems and the strength 
of our service offering. As expected, the second 
half, which incorporates the holiday months 
of July, August and December, was seasonally 
quieter than the first half but in line with 
management expectations.
Strategy
In the Company’s Admission Document, we 
outlined our aspirations to become the accident 
repair services’ supplier of choice to the UK 
insurance market. We believe that the Group’s 
national coverage, economies of scale and customer 
service give us a competitive advantage when 
competing for business. We continue to pursue 
our twin track approach of improving our existing 
businesses whilst carefully exploring additional 
opportunities for growth through acquisition.

Introduction
2006 was a good year for Nationwide with the 
successful admission to trading on AiM in July, 
the acquisition of Aquilo Motor Services in 
December 2006, an increase in our underlying profit 
and the development of our longer term objectives.
Accident Repair Market
The accident repair market in which we operate 
continues to consolidate. This consolidation is 
mainly driven by three factors:

  Insurance companies are finding the cost 
and burden of dealing with hundreds of 
privately owned companies, on differing IT 
platforms and working to differing standards 
and systems, increasingly onerous.

  The economies of scale and the use of 
integrated IT systems are enabling groups 
to operate more effectively and requiring 
less direct management by insurers on a 
case by case basis.

  Advances in vehicle technology and the need to 
repair vehicles in an environmentally responsible 
manner necessitate continued financial 
investment. A significant number of existing 
repairers operating in the sector are not in 
a position to make the required investment.
Our core business is the repair of damaged vehicles 
at our bodyshops throughout the UK. We aim to 
continue to acquire sites as opportunities arise 
and have recently acquired businesses in Llandudno 
(January 2007) and Lincoln (March 2007). 
We also work continuously on opportunities to 
further improve and grow our existing operations. 
Our management information, supported by 
a robust IT platform, enables us to identify and 
implement operational improvement quicker than 
some of our competitors and we continue to 
leverage this advantage.
Network Services
Our Network Services division is a support 
operation that enables fleets and insurers to opt 
for a single point of contact or ‘one stop shop’, 
should they wish to do so. We continue to grow 
in this area and our acquisition of Aquilo Motor 
Services in December 2006 has proved a valuable 
addition to the Group. Based in Northwich, Cheshire 
Aquilo operates a 24 hour contact centre offering 
a comprehensive motor claims management service 
including emergency and roadside assistance 
and engineering services. This acquisition has 
a number of strategic objectives including:

  Increasing our capacity and expertise in the 
call centre handling of drivers involved in an 
accident and given Network Services’ details 
as the first point of contact. This process is 
known in the industry as ‘FNOL’ or first 
notification of loss.

  Enabling us to increase our IT platform’s 
scope (in particular with regard to claims 
handling) making it easier for insurance 
companies and fleet customers to work with us.

  Enabling us, where appropriate, to direct 
work captured by this process into our 
own repair centres thereby increasing 
their efficiency.
Mobile Solutions
Launched in 2005, our Mobile Solutions division, 
a vehicle based service that offers specialist 
glass work, air conditioning and electronic 
diagnostic services, continues to grow.
Summary
In summary, the bodyshop market continues to 
consolidate, our financial performance is in line 
with expectations and our balance sheet is strong. 
We aim to continue to expand our bodyshop 
capacity and improve our efficiency and our 
support division is growing.

Operating results
Turnover for the twelve month period increased 
by 8% to £151.2m against £139.6m last year 
and operating profit before non-recurring items 
rose by 42% to £5.8m from £4.0m. Operating 
profit after non-recurring costs relating to the 
flotation and the payment of certain contractual 
bonuses was £2.2m (2005: £7.8m) and profit 
before tax was £2.4m (2005: £7.3m).
The acquisition of the business of Aquilo Motor 
Services in December 2006 contributed turnover 
of £246,000 and a loss of £21,000.
Non-recurring costs
Non-recurring costs of £3,542,000 are included 
in the calculation of operating profit for the year 
and comprise costs in relation to the Company’s 
flotation on AiM in July 2006 and non-recurring 
bonuses payable to the Company’s management.
Pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension scheme. The defined 
benefit scheme was closed for future accruals on 
31 July 2006 with active members transferred 
to a new defined contribution section of 
the scheme.
Under IAS 19 the deficit in the scheme as at 
31 December 2006 was £20.6m (2005: £21.0m) 
or £14.4m (2005: £14.7m) net of deferred tax. 
The Group has reached agreement with the 
trustees to make annual special contributions of 
approximately £2.3m with a view to eradicating 
the scheme specific funding deficit over 7.5 years. 
The first payment was made in 2006.
The Group however adopts the ‘corridor approach’ 
under IAS 19 which amortises all actuarial gains 
and losses above the corridor (10% of the greater 
of assets and liabilities) over the future working 
lifetime of the active membership. As a result of 
adopting this approach an asset is recognised in 
the balance sheet of £3.9m (2005: £2.0m) but 
operating profits are reduced as the actuarial 
loss is reflected through the income statement 
each year.
To assist comparisons to be made to other 
businesses that do not adopt the corridor approach 
details are given of the effect on profits and assets 
if FRS 17 was applied instead. Operating profit 
before non-recurring items under FRS 17 would 
be £7.0m (2005: £5.3m) and profit before tax 
before non-recurring items under FRS 17 would 
be £7.2m (2005: £4.6m). Net assets would fall 
to £5.2m (2005: £4.5m).

Cash flow
The net increase in cash during the year was £2.8m 
(2005: a net decrease of £4.8m) which produced a 
net cash balance at 31 December 2006 of £6.9m. 
The Group continues to invest in new plant and 
equipment and in improvements to its sites. 
In addition, the business of Aquilo Motor Services 
was purchased for £762,000 in December 2006. 
The Company paid contributions to its pension 
fund of £2,860,000 (2005: £2,582,000). No 
dividend was paid in 2006 (2005: £5.0m).
The net increase in cash was achieved by profit 
and the strong control of working capital.
The Group does not have any bank borrowings 
although it does have a committed bank facility 
with the Royal Bank of Scotland for £8.0m until 
31 December 2007.
Tax
The effective tax rate is 41% which is higher than 
the standard rate of tax principally as a result of 
the majority of the flotation costs being disallowed 
for tax purposes. The effective rate in 2005 was 
11% which reflected the gain of £4,750,000 
on the disposal of an investment not subject to 
corporation tax.
The Group has no income tax losses available 
but has capital losses of £4.3m.
Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share is 3.1p (2005: 14.5p). 
Both figures are significantly affected by  
non-recurring items. Excluding non-recurring 
items, earnings per share is 9.0p (2005: 5.5p), 
a growth of 64%. As a result of share options 
being granted on 4 July 2006, the basic earnings 
per share is diluted to 3.0p (2005: 14.5p).
As mentioned above the Group adopts the 
‘corridor approach’ for the treatment of its pension 
liabilities and as such the actuarial loss is recognised 
in the income statement. To enable comparisons 
to be made to other businesses, earnings per share 
is also shown on an FRS 17 basis. If FRS 17 was 
applied the underlying earnings per share would 
be 11.0p (2005: 7.2p), a 53% growth.
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend in 
respect of the results for the year ended 
31 December 2006 of 2.60p per share. Subject 
to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, this will be paid on 21 May 2007 
to shareholders on the Register at the close of 
business on 20 April 2007. The dividend is covered 
3.5 times by underlying earnings. On the basis 
that the final dividend represents two thirds of 
a full year’s dividend then if an interim dividend 
had been payable then the dividend cover would 
be 2.3 times (or 2.8 times on an FRS 17 basis). 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS)
The Group and the Company adopted IFRS in 
its accounts for the year to 31 December 2005. 
IAS 33, earnings per share and IFRS 2, share 
based payments have been applied for the 
first time.

_1_NAR_ar06_front.indd   8 12/04/2007   09:28:12 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc 08 Annual Report and Accounts 2006
The Directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Principal activities and review of the business
As noted in the business review within the Chief Executive’s Report and Finance Director’s Review, the business of the Group is the repair of motor 
vehicles and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2006 was to maintain the profitability of the core business, to achieve consistency in margins and to introduce new insurance companies 
to branches where possible. The Directors are pleased with the results for the year and this strategy will be maintained in 2007. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors regularly review principal risks and uncertainties that affect the Group. These include key customer changes, legislation changes affecting 
vehicle and road safety and vehicle repair methodology.
Post balance sheet events 
Since the year end the Group has acquired bodyshop businesses in Llandudno (January 2007) and Lincoln (March 2007). The consideration for these two 
businesses was £585,000 paid in cash.
Results and dividends
The Group’s sales revenue amounted to £151,192,000 (2005: £139,554,000) and the profit before taxation amounted to £2,370,000 (2005: £7,299,000). 
Taxation was a charge of £978,000 (2005: charge of £789,000) and the net profit for the year was £1,392,000 (2005: £6,510,000). 
No dividend was paid during the year (2005: £5.0m). 
The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the results for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 2.60p per share. Subject to approval by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, this will be paid on 21 May 2007 to shareholders on the Register at the close of business on 20 April 2007.
Non current assets
The movement of non current assets is set out in notes 10, 11 and 12 to the accounts.
Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year and their interests in the shares of the Company are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 10. 
Corporate governance 
The Board is committed to the highest principles of corporate governance. As a company quoted on AiM, the Company is not required to comply with 
the requirements of the Combined Code.
The Board consists of three executive and four independent non-executive Directors who take an active role in Board matters and it meets eight times 
in every year. The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and Group assets.
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee, consisting of the Chairman and M Butcher, a Remuneration Committee consisting of the Chairman and  
J J Brade and a Nominations Committee consisting of the Chairman and Lady Judge.
The Audit Committee meets regularly with the external auditors and with the executive Directors to review the interim and final results, key areas of accounting 
treatment and risk and control procedures. The Committee can meet with the external auditors without any of the executive Directors being present.
The Remuneration Committee and Nominations Committee have not met since formation in June 2006.
Employment of disabled persons
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment received from disabled persons having regard to their particular aptitudes 
and abilities and wherever possible the Group continues the employment of, and arranges for reasonable adjustments to the working conditions of, 
employees who become disabled persons while employed by the Group. Disabled employees are treated no differently from any other employees as 
regards training, career development and promotion opportunities. The Group operated this policy throughout the year.
Employee involvement
Effective employee relations are seen as key drivers in moving the Group forward. Consequently human resources, quality, health and safety and training 
functions need to establish good communications with individual sites and are therefore organised on a divisional basis. This structure enables staff to obtain 
the help and guidance they may need and keeps them informed of, and effectively involved in, the development of the Group’s business. Regular review 
meetings are held at local, divisional and Group level to ensure that all employees are kept informed of the Group’s objectives. Progress towards those 
objectives is measured and reported back to individual sites.

Auditor

On behalf of the Board:
Michael Wilmshurst
Chief Executive, 14 March 2007
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of the income of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to:

 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time the financial position of the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as the Directors are aware:

 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company auditor is unaware; and

  the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from other legislation in other jurisdictions.

Remuneration Report
_1_NAR_ar06_back.indd   4 12/04/2007   09:27:23 11 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘’financial statements’’) of Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated and company statements of 
changes in equity, the company balance sheet, the consolidated and company cash flow statements and notes 1 to 27. These financial statements have 
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to 
you whether, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that 
specific information presented in the Chief Executive’s report and Finance Director’s review that is cross referenced from the Business Review section 
and in the Remuneration report cross referenced from the Directors and their interests section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Directors’ report, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s report and Finance Director’s review. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion 
In our opinion:

  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended;

  the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006;

  the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and

 the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, has also complied with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 
and of its profit for the year then ended.

1. Nature of operations
Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc and its subsidiaries’ (the Group) principal activity is the provision of support services to the motor insurance 
industry. Currently, this includes the repair of motor vehicles in the Group’s wholly owned sites and the provision of accident claim management services.
The strategy for 2006 was to maintain the profitability of the core business, to achieve consistency in margins and to introduce new insurance companies 
to branches where possible. The Directors are pleased with the results for the year and this strategy will be maintained in 2007.
The following is a list of the principal subsidiary undertakings of which Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc is either directly, or through subsidiary 
undertakings, the beneficial owner of the whole of the equity share capital. All companies are engaged in motor trade activities. All are incorporated 
in England and Wales.
 
Nationwide Crash Repair Centres Limited 

 Network Services (Nationwide) Limited

 Mobile Vehicle Repairs Limited (trading as Mobile Solutions)
2. General information 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the EU and as developed and published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
3. Summary of accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Earnings per share and IFRS 2, share based payments have been adopted for the first time. The significant accounting policies that have been used in the 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements are summarised below. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historic 
cost basis.
It should be noted that accounting estimates and assumptions are used in preparing the financial statements including the carrying amount of goodwill 
(note 10) and provisions (note 20). Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from those estimates.
New standards and interpretations currently in issue but not effective for accounting periods commencing on 1 January 2006 and their effects are:
i)  Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures (effective 1 January 2007). This will extend disclosures relating to the 
Company’s capital.
ii)  IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (effective 1 January 2007 replacing disclosure aspects of IAS 32). This will extend disclosures relating to the 
Company’s financial instruments.
Consolidation 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has power to control the financial and operating policies. The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Company as well as those entities controlled by the Group by full consolidation.
In addition, acquired subsidiaries are subject to the application of the purchase method. This involves the revaluation at fair value of all identifiable assets 
and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they were recorded in the financial 
statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated balance 
sheet at their revalued amounts, which are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill 
represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statements for their respective 
periods of ownership. Inter-Company trading is eliminated from these accounts where appropriate. As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, 
an income statement is not presented for Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc.
Income and expense recognition
Revenue is recognised upon the performance of the service once authority has been given by the customer to undertake this work. Intra-Group sales and 
value added tax are excluded.
Operating expenses (with the exception of the IAS 19 pension adjustment) are recognised in the income statement upon utilisation of the service. Interest 
income and expenditure are reported on an accruals basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Notes to the Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2006
_1_NAR_ar06_back.indd   12 12/04/2007   09:27:25 19 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
3. Summary of accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost. 
Buildings, fittings and furniture are carried at acquisition cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses. 
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis taking into account estimated residual values.
The useful lives of property, plant and equipment can be summarised as follows:
Land –  Nil 
Buildings  –  5 to 25 years 
Plant and equipment – 3 to 10 years 
IT equipment – 2 to 5 years
On adopting IFRS, the Group and Company have taken advantage of the transitional rule that allows previously revalued fixed assets to be deemed cost.
Leases
Payments on operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis.
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group’s goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating 
units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group 
at which management controls the related cash flows.
Individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill with an indefinite useful life or those not yet available for use are tested for impairment 
at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell and value in use, based on an internal discounted cash flow 
evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of 
goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are 
subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Inventories
Inventories comprise materials and direct labour. At the balance sheet date inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories are 
valued using the weighted average cost. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable selling expenses. 
Accounting for income taxes
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that 
are unpaid at the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which they relate, based on 
the taxable income for the year. All changes to current tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on 
temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled 
by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other 
income tax credits to the group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be offset 
against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective 
period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Most changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement. Only changes in deferred tax 
assets or liabilities that relate to a change in value of assets or liabilities that is charged directly to equity (such as the revaluation of land) are charged 
or credited directly to equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short term highly liquid investments such as money market instruments and bank 
deposits. Money market instruments are financial assets carried at fair value. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value at initial recognition as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.

3. Summary of accounting policies (continued)
Equity
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium includes any premiums received on the initial issuing of the share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are 
deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
The revaluation reserve comprises gains and losses due to the revaluation of property, plant and equipment.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the income statement.
The capital redemption reserve was created on the acquisition by the Company of its own shares.
Share based payments
The Group operates two employee share option schemes. The fair value at the date at which the share options are granted is recognised in the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, taking into account the number of options that are expected to vest. In valuing the share 
options the Group has utilised the Black-Scholes option pricing model for tranche 1 of the options and the Monte Carlo model for tranche 2 of the 
options with the weighted average share price being factored into the model. The expected life of the options has been assumed to be three years for 
tranche 1 and five years for tranche 2 with the options being exercisable between three and ten years.
The following have been factored into the model:
Exercise prices of £1.11 and £1.165, expected volatility of 25%, dividend yield of 3.00%, equivalent risk free rate of return being the rate of return on 
zero-coupon Government bonds with a term equal to the expected live assumptions.
As the Company is newly listed there is no history for the Company regarding the volatility of its shares, as such the expected volatility detailed above 
has been based on a review of competitors’ volatility and the most appropriate has been utilised.
Pension obligations and short term employee benefits
Pensions to employees are provided through a defined benefit plan as well as a defined contribution plan.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one 
or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. The legal obligation for any benefits from this kind of pension plan remains with the Group, even 
if plan assets for funding the defined benefit plan have been acquired. Plan assets may include assets specifically designated to a long term benefit fund 
as well as qualifying insurance policies.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independent entity. The Group has no legal or 
constructive obligations to pay further contributions after payment of the fixed contribution.
The asset/liability recognised in the balance sheet for defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) at the 
balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The 
DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will 
be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are not recognised as an expense unless the total unrecognised gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the obligation and 
related plan assets. The amount exceeding this 10% is charged or credited to profit or loss over the employees’ expected average remaining working lives. 
Actuarial gains and losses within the 10% corridor are disclosed separately. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless 
the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the 
past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The contributions recognised in respect of defined contribution plans are expensed as they fall due. Liabilities and assets may be recognised if underpayment 
or prepayment has occurred and are included in current liabilities or current assets as they are normally of a short term nature.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other payables liabilities. They are included in balance sheet line items ‘long 
term financial liabilities’ and ‘trade and other payables’. 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual agreements of the instrument. All interest related charges are 
recognised as an expense in ‘finance cost’ in the income statement.
Bank loans are raised for support of long term funding of the Group’s operations. They are recognised at fair values, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to profit or loss on an accrual basis using the effective interest 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less settlement payments.
Dividend distributions to shareholders are included in ‘other short term financial liabilities’ when the dividends are approved by the shareholders’ meeting.

3. Summary of accounting policies (continued)
Other provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Other provisions are recognised when present obligations will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group and they can be 
estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises from the presence of a legal or constructive 
commitment that has resulted from past events. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the balance 
sheet date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Any reimbursement expected to be received in the course of 
settlement of the present obligation is recognised, if virtually certain as a separate asset, not exceeding the amount of the related provision. Where there 
are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as 
a whole. In addition, long term provisions are discounted to their present values, where time value of money is material.
All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resource as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, or the amount 
to be provided for cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, unless assumed in the course of a business 
combination. These contingent liabilities are recognised in the course of the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired in the 
business combination. They are subsequently measured at the higher amount of a comparable provision as described above and the amount initially 
recognised, less any amortisation.
Probable inflows of economic benefits to the Group that do not yet meet the recognition criteria of an asset are considered contingent assets.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments are valued at cost less any impairment and after deducting any dividends paid out of pre-acquisition profits.

The £1,000,000 non-recurring bonus paid in 2005 was included within administration expenses in the 2005 accounts, hence the 2005 comparatives have 
been restated to classify this as a non-recurring item.

Notes:
(a)  On acquisition, the value of other intangible assets was considered and no value was attributed. The Directors have considered the value of intangible 
assets and determined that this was immaterial and that the goodwill arising related to expected synergies with the existing business but which are 
not separately recognised under IFRS.
(b) Provisional fair values were placed on all property, plant and equipment at the date of acquisition.
It is not possible to determine the revenue and profit for the period of this acquisition for the period 1 January 2006 to 13 December 2006, as the 
information cannot reliably be extracted from the accounting records. The result included in the Group accounts in relation to the acquisition was a loss 
of £21,000.

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units acquired. The recoverable amounts for the cash-generating units determined 
above are based on value in use calculations, covering a detailed one year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows using a 2.5% 
growth rate. These cash flows were extrapolated over ten years and discounted using a rate of 5%. A ten year period has been chosen because management’s 
experience and knowledge of the business indicates that equivalent sites have a useful economic life in excess of ten years. Management’s key assumptions 
for these cash-generating units include stable profit margins and resulting cash flows which have been determined based on past experience in this market. 
The Group is not currently aware of any probable changes which would necessitate changes in its key assumptions.

14. Pension and other employee assets/obligations
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK which offers both pensions in retirement and death 
benefits to members. Since 1 January 2002 the defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members. The assets of the schemes are administered by 
trustees independent of the Group. The Company made contributions of £2,860,000 (2005: £2,582,000) to the defined benefit scheme during the year. 
The defined benefit scheme was closed for future accruals on 31 July 2006 with active members transferred to a new defined contribution section of 
the scheme. The Company has agreed with the trustees of the pension scheme to make annual contributions of approximately £2.3 million (increasing 
annually by the Retail Price Index) with a view to eradicating the Scheme Specific Funding deficit over a period of approximately 7.5 years.
The Group has opted to amortise all actuarial gains and losses above the corridor (10% of the greater of assets and liabilities) over the future working 
lifetime of the active membership.

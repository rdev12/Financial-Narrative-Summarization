NHP is determined to provide the very highest quality
buildings for its tenants and to provide the highest quality
care to residents in its homes. If we can do this in a timely
and efficient manner , our residents, staff, business
partners and shareholders will all benefit.

Financial highlights
The strategy to consolidate our tenant base has
improved our earnings considerably this year and, more
importantly, will improve the quality of future years’
earnings. In addition, the formation of an operating
business – Highfield Care – has created a potentially
valuable asset for shareholders.

Financial results
Turnover for the year to 30 September
2002 was significantly higher at
£126.0 million (2001: £76.6 million),
due to the substantial expansion in
numbers of homes transferred into
Highfield Care. Profit before taxation
was £16.4 million (2001: £10.0 million)
after a provision for bad debts of £4.8
million (2001: £10.3 million) and an
exceptional credit of £0.2 million (2001:
exceptional costs of £4.7 million).
Earnings per Ordinary Share were up
by 25 per cent to 10.1p (2001: 8.1p,
restated for the effects of the Rights
Issue during the year). There was a
tax credit of £0.5 million (2001: credit
of £2.4 million). 
The net exceptional credit of £0.2 million
comprises primarily tenant receivership
costs of £1.5 million (2001: £0.5 million)
and a credit of £1.5 million (2001: charge
of £1.7 million) representing a write
back of prior charges for permanent
diminution of asset values. 
The creation of our Highfield Care
business to operate many of the care
homes owned by NHP has meant that
Both businesses made steady
progress this year. We have added
109 NHP homes to the operating
business and the property business
has seen a significant improvement in
the rent collection from, and covenant
strength of, its tenant base (including
Highfield Care). This improvement has
been reflected in greatly increased
asset values. 
The successful transformation of NHP
was effected as planned despite the
operating environment for the publicly
funded care home industry generally
continuing to be difficult in the UK. There
have been significant fee increases paid
by local authorities in some parts of the
UK, generally triggered by a localised
supply and demand imbalance.
However , margin pressures caused by
the rising costs of care provision have
resulted in continuing home closures.
The vast majority of local authorities
across the UK will not link their fees to
the rising cost of long term care for the
elderly . These factors, combined with
long NHS hospital waiting lists, have
pushed care for the elderly up the
political agenda. 
our properties now fall into two asset
classes: investment properties (leased
to third parties) and operated properties
(homes leased to Highfield Care). The
investment properties are re-valued
annually at 30 September by external,
independent valuers. From 30
September 2002 onwards, the
operated properties will also be re-
valued annually at that date by the same
external valuers. T aking the two asset
classes together , the value of our
properties at year-end was £643.3
million, representing a 9.5 per cent
increase over last year’ s £587.7 million. 
The uplift in the revaluation reserve of
£56.6 million together with the retained
profit for the year of £16.9 million and
the receipt of £31.9 million (net) in
proceeds from the Rights Issue
produced a 103 per cent increase in
shareholders’ funds to £207.7 million
(2001: £102.4 million). Net asset value
per NHP Ordinary Share rose by 58 per
cent to a year-end figure of 103.4p
(2001: 65.5p, restated for the effects of
the Rights Issue) and net recourse
borrowings were reduced to £51.5
million (2001: £93.8 million).
2 NHP Plc 
The year under review saw the transformation of NHP
into two distinct business units: the original property
business and the new operating business, Highfield
Care. Highfield Care provides NHP with a vehicle to
manage its owned homes as well as a potential source
of quality profits in the future. NHP Plc  3
Dividend
At the time of the Rights Issue,
announced in May , we said that
although the Board did not intend to
recommend a dividend in respect of the
year just ended, it was our intention to
return to the dividend list as soon as
possible thereafter . At that time, we
intended to apply to the Courts for a
reconstruction of capital to eliminate
negative distributable reserves which
existed as at 30 September 2001.
This would have allowed us to resume
dividend payments.
In the event, retained profit and the
effect of the increase in the valuation
of our properties have created
positive distributable reserves in the
holding Company . If trading remains
at current levels, the Directors would
expect to declare an interim dividend
in June 2003 of 0.5p per Ordinary
Share. In future we intend to pay
dividends to shareholders based
on the level of surplus funds
available after satisfying the capital
expenditure requirements of our
care home portfolio. 
Board and management
Our longest serving non-executive
Director , Arthur Bergbaum, retired
from the Board at the Annual General
Meeting in February . We thank him
for his contribution over the years
and wish him a long and happy
retirement.
In November , John Murphy became
Chief Executive of Highfield Care with
a brief to drive operational efficiency
forward and to deliver the highest
possible standards of care. John’ s
achievements to date in the care
home industry make him well qualified
to fulfil our ambitious strategic aims
for Highfield Care.
Outlook
We are successfully rebuilding value for
NHP shareholders and we are grateful
for their support of the successful
Rights Issue to raise £31.9 million (net)
during the year under review. A large
part of the strategy to achieve the goal
of rebuilding value was the creation of
our own operating capability . The Board
is encouraged with the progress made
to date by the Highfield Care team and,
with the appointment of John Murphy ,
believes we have begun to create a
potentially valuable asset for NHP
shareholders.
Our property-based activity has also
improved this year and, looking
forward, we believe that the level of
tenant receiverships will significantly
reduce. The property business will
also continue to benefit from the smaller
number of financially stronger tenants
now in place who can afford the
substantial investment necessary
to keep our homes in top condition.
At 30 September 2002, four tenants
(including Highfield Care) operated
86 per cent of the total number of
beds owned by NHP .
With both operating and property
businesses continuing to perform to
plan, I expect another year of progress
for NHP despite the difficult economic
environment within the publicly funded
care home industry .

4 NHP Plc 
NHP’s financial performance has improved significantly
in the year under review. Progress in both businesses
has increased our reported earnings but more
importantly, has increased the quality and predictability
of future earnings.
The UK care home industry
Over the past year , the sector has
had to deal with a number of changes
in the regulatory regime facing care
homes in the UK. The newly created
Care Standards Commissions for
England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland (four separate
organisations) this year took over
the regulation of all care homes.
Government policy with these bodies,
and generally towards the sector ,
has unfortunately proved to be both
confused and confusing, and has
not addressed the fundamental
problem of overall under-funding. 
Introduction 
NHP’ s financial performance has
improved significantly in the year
under review. The operating business,
Highfield Care, has grown its
operations to a national scale, allowing
us to begin to examine how to create,
and take full advantage of, operational
efficiencies. The property business
has successfully consolidated its
tenant base into a smaller , financially
stronger list. Progress in both
businesses has increased our
reported earnings but, more
importantly , has increased the quality
and predictability of future earnings.

The National Care Standards
Commission – regulating only England –
was due to impose over the next five
years a comprehensive package of
physical property , staff and training
requirements contained in the Care
Standards legislation. Disappointingly ,
the property standards will for the time
being only be applied to new-build
homes after a change of mind by the
Department of Health. This U-turn
followed Government recognition that
too many properties, with owners
unable to afford catch-up investment,
would close and possibly thousands of
much needed care beds would be lost
in addition to those already leaving the
market. It remains to be seen what the
situation will be in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
NHP believes that the UK public has a
right to expect high national minimum
standards in caring for our elderly
citizens. However , we recognise that
until the Government provides sufficient
encouragement to local authorities to
pay fees which fully reflect the cost of
care, many operators will not be able to
meet increased property and training
standards. The vast majority of NHP
beds meet the originally proposed
property standards. It is too early to tell
how effective the new regulatory bodies
will ultimately become but we hope that
current problems and long delays in the
registration and inspection processes
will be addressed in the short term.
T urning to fee levels, the Government,
in this year’ s Budget, increased the
budgets of local authorities’ social
services departments by six per cent.
However , none of the increase was ring-
fenced for elderly care – it was merely
hoped that additional funds would be
made available at the home level.
What this has meant in practice is that
beds continue to be lost in the areas
where publicly funded care home
fees remain below the cost of care.
Consequently , NHS bed blocking
and long waiting lists continue to be
serious national problems.
A huge problem facing care home
operators throughout the UK is wage
inflation as labour costs represent
around 60 per cent of the total costs
of running a care home. The rise in
National Insurance contributions next
April will also increase costs further . The
Minimum Wage has increased this year
only in line with inflation (compared to
last year’ s 11 per cent) but one of the
most serious issues facing the care
home industry is a shortage of care staff.
Competition for staff to work in care
homes from supermarkets, retail and
hospitality outlets and the NHS is
intense. Nursing wage costs are
expected this year to outstrip inflation
while additional NHS recruitment of
nurses has created sometimes severe
local shortages of trained staff. The level
of fee increases therefore remains
crucial with particularly low fee increases
being the norm in central and northern
England and Wales.
There is no doubt that the UK needs
substantial on-going investment into the
care home sector if it is to care properly
for its growing elderly population.
However , home closures are continuing
and new-builds are likely to remain at
very low levels because of the barriers to
entry created by the application of the
new physical property standards on
new-build homes. Sooner or later we
believe that the Government will have to
address the problem of this disincentive
to invest in new care homes, perhaps by
recognising that premium quality homes
should be able to charge fees which
reflect the quality of care delivered.

Chief Executive’s review  continued
Operating business
Highfield Care
Our operating business has grown substantially during
the year and comprised 181 homes at 30 September
2002, including 23 homes owned by third parties. This
growth was due to the acquisition of Highfield Holdings
Limited in December 2001 and the addition of NHP
owned care homes previously operated by third party
tenants that went into receivership. The management
of Highfield Care has become skilled at minimising the
disruption caused by the receivership process whilst
keeping the homes open for business to ensure the
welfare of residents and staff. 
This year has seen the start of some
serious investment in the care
centres. This will make such a
difference to my residents and staff.
SANDRA GRIERSON HOME MANAGER NHP Plc  7
I’m looking forward to the
challenge of turning Highfield
Care into one of the UK’s premier
care home operators.
JOHN MURPHY CEO, HIGHFIELD CARE
Fifteen homes were taken out of
receivership during the year and
assigned to Highfield Care. We are
continuing the process of integrating
them and bringing their standards up
to ours. Three homes have been
transferred from receivership into
Highfield Care since 30 September
2002. The condition of many of the
homes was disappointing but not
surprising, given the lack of investment
by their former operators. We have
planned and are now implementing
a substantial programme of works
to improve the fabric of buildings,
equipment, gardens and staff training. 
Highfield Care, still in its development
phase, not surprisingly recorded an
operating loss for the year of £3.2 million
after being charged full rent of £15.6
million by the property business. NHP
properties with Highfield Care as the
registered operator were valued at
30 September 2002 on an existing use
basis at £159.9 million, representing an
uplift of £15.1 million over last year’ s
valuation of the same properties.
In order to build Highfield Care into an
operator with national coverage and the
necessary economies of scale, we have
deliberately increased the size of the
operational management overhead to
enable us to address the specific issues
relating to receiverships and to integrate
homes into our business quickly and
efficiently . Once this period of rapid
growth is over we will reduce the
overhead level with consequent benefit
to profitability . The review will be part of
the responsibilities of Highfield Care’ s
new Chief Executive, John Murphy . 
This year saw the beginning of a series
of initiatives to market the Highfield Care
brand to national audiences. We have
just completed the production of
brochures for each Highfield Care centre
– all with a common brand identity but
tailored to individual properties to reflect
the local nature of our business. Local
marketing is vital for the individual homes
and we have commenced a programme
of community sponsorship of school
sports and activities. In addition, we
have undertaken a carefully targeted
campaign of press advertisements
aimed at care purchasers and staff
recruitment.
With the growing size and importance
of Highfield Care, we have upgraded
incident reporting mechanisms and

ASSURANCE MANAGER
enhanced our quality control
procedures. This has included an ISO
9001 home accreditation programme
under which the first 22 Highfield Care
homes have now received certification.
Looking ahead, one of our major
financial priorities is planning and
executing targeted investment in the
Highfield Care homes. In the year to
30 September 2002, we invested
£4.6 million in Highfield Care operated
properties and a larger amount is
planned for the current year . We will
also invest in extensions and additions
to selected homes and we currently
have a number of extension and major
refurbishment projects at various stages
of the planning process. In addition,
we have targeted specialist care (of the
physically and mentally impaired) as a
sector in which NHP will seek to grow
a much larger presence. T o this end,
we have charged one of our senior
management team, Saleem Asaria,
with identifying opportunities in this
area and bringing recommendations
to the Board to build a significant
specialist care business.
In the short term, Highfield Care will
continue its in-house development
through investment, training and
improved efficiencies. In the medium
term, we will examine all options open
to us to realise value for shareholders
from what, we believe, will become an
increasingly valuable asset.

Property business
NHP Property
NHP’s original business, where we act as landlord to
third party tenants, accounted for 75 per cent of the
portfolio by value at 30 September 2002 and will
account for 65 per cent of the portfolio by value when
the remaining homes which are managed by Highfield
Care are assigned out of the current receiverships.
The business has shown improved financial
performance during the year . 
Chief Executive’s review  continued NHP Plc  11
subsidiaries of Union Healthcare Group
Limited (with 41 homes in total).
Although modestly disruptive in the very
short term, the receiverships bring our
properties under our direct control and
we can ensure that from now on the
assets are cared for appropriately to
maintain and enhance their value. 
The property business should continue
to benefit this year from reduced
numbers of receiverships and lower
levels of rental voids. In addition, there is
the upside available from those homes
paying turnover rent (where NHP
receives a percentage of tenant homes’
turnover above a certain level) as
occupancy and fee levels increase.
Better performance is also expected at
those homes where we have invested
in refurbishment – with NHP funding
£1.4 million in third party tenants’
homes during the period under review
in addition to the £4.6 million spent in
homes operated by Highfield Care.
We will study carefully opportunities for
enlarging properties or even building
new homes in selective parts of the UK
with tenants we consider top class
operators but we believe the economic
case for new build is far from proven in
many parts of the UK.
Staff
We have begun the process of creating
a single unified team from the managers
and staff who worked for the operating
businesses which together form
Highfield Care. The goodwill and desire
to reach this objective was amply
demonstrated at the recent inaugural
Highfield Care Regional Managers’
Conference and I am encouraged by
the enthusiasm of our operational team.
During the year I have visited well over
100 of our care homes in all parts of the
UK. The people I met who are vital to the
successful operation of Highfield Care –
from regional managers and matrons to
nurses, carers and support staff – have
all proved to be dedicated, professional
and caring. Without their efforts, our
progress this year would have been
significantly reduced. I thank them all for
their hard work and dedication.
Bill Colvin

16 December 2002
NHP owned 261 investment properties
(2001: 324) leased to third parties
which were valued at 30 September
2002 on an investment property basis
at £483.3 million (2001: £535.4 million).
On a like-for-like basis, these 261
properties increased in value by 9.7
per cent, largely due to improved
covenants as two of our largest
tenants, Southern Cross and Idun,
were themselves acquired by venture
capital backed companies.
Our strategy of tenant consolidation has
proved effective in increasing the
amount of rent collected (and therefore
reducing bad debts). The charge for
third party rent void in the property
business was reduced to £4.4 million
(2001: £10.3 million) reflecting the
benefits of consolidating the tenant
base and the inclusion of a number of
currently less profitable homes within
our own operating business. The NHP
independently managed tenant base
has more than halved over the last two
years to eleven companies. 
As we expected, there were a number
of further receiverships. The largest of
these were Harmony Care Homes
Limited (with 16 homes) and six
The new incentives provided
by Highfield Care’s terms and
conditions have really given us
all something to shoot for.
ELIZABETH ROSCOE REGIONAL MANAGER 12 NHP Plc 
Financial review
NHP is beginning to see the benefits of its high quality
asset portfolio in the earnings it derives from it – a
result of better management of our homes, both by
the smaller number of stronger third party tenants
and by Highfield Care. 
This Review provides a commentary
on the principal movements in the
Group accounts for the year to
30 September 2002 and an analysis
of the property business and
Highfield Care.
Profit and loss account
In the property business, rent receivable
from NHP care homes operated by
third parties totalled £56.6 million
(2001: £71.1 million) of which £3.4
million (2001: £3.6 million) represented
turnover rent. T urnover from the
operating business, Highfield Care,
was £69.4 million (2001: £5.5 million).
The two businesses produced a
combined turnover of £126.0 million
(2001: £76.6 million).
Profit before tax was £16.4 million
(2001: £10.0 million) after a provision
for bad debts of £4.8 million (2001:
£10.3 million) and an exceptional
credit of £0.2 million (2001: exceptional
costs of £4.7 million). The depreciation
charge for the Group increased to
£3.4 million (2001: £0.8 million). The
larger number of operated properties
accounted for £2.9 million (2001:
£0.6 million) of this charge.
The reduction of £5.4 million in provision
for bad debt is a reflection of the
financial strength of the smaller number
of tenants of NHP properties and the
rapid growth of Highfield Care. Whilst
results from the poorer performing
homes in our own operating business
have improved, Highfield Care reported
an operating loss for the year to 30
September 2002 of £3.2 million (2001:
operating profit of £0.1 million) after
NHP rent of £15.6 million (2001: £1.5
million) that included £1.2 million of
turnover rent (2001: £nil). 
The exceptional net credit for the period
was £0.2 million (2001: exceptional
costs of £4.7 million). The principal
credits were a £0.2 million writeback
from a provision made for closure
support costs of the Ultima Group
(2001: exceptional cost of £1.2 million)
and the net writeback of £1.5 million
(2001: exceptional cost of £1.7 million)
from the charge for permanent
diminution in value of the property
portfolio made in the profit and loss
account in 2000 and 2001. The cost
element of £1.5 million related to tenant
receiverships (2001: £0.5 million), of
which a major element was wages and NHP Plc  13
salaries due to the care homes’ staff
at the date a Receiver was appointed
and Highfield Care took over the
management of the homes concerned. 
During the year , four tenants went into
receivership as a result of continuing
difficult trading conditions. T wo small
tenants, Cherish Healthcare (MJN)
Limited (with two NHP homes) and
Loughbray Limited (one home) went
into receivership in October 2001 and
February 2002 respectively . Highfield
Care immediately took over the
management of the properties and
their trading performance was largely
unaffected. The two Cherish homes
are now out of receivership and re-
registered to Highfield Care.
Harmony Care Homes Limited and six
subsidiaries of Union Healthcare Group
Limited, were placed in receivership in
January 2002 and late September 2002
respectively . Harmony operated 16 NHP
homes and Union 41. In both cases,
Highfield Care took on the management
of the homes for the Receiver ,
minimising uncertainty for residents and
staff. Of the Harmony and Union homes,
45 are still in receivership (principally the
former Union homes) and 12 have been
re-registered with Highfield Care as the
operator at the date of this report.
Since 30 September 2002, Healthcare
Investments (No. 2) Limited, which
operated four of our homes, went into
receivership and Highfield Care are
managing the homes.
Due to the change of re-registration
responsibility to the new care regulatory
bodies in April 2002, the timetable to
complete the re-registration process
has been subject to considerable delay
that has had the effect of prolonging the
receiverships with a corresponding
increase in costs. 
Net interest payable and similar charges
reduced to £38.1 million (2001: £40.2
million), reflecting the lower bank
borrowings resulting from repayment of
bank debt from the proceeds of the
Rights Issue and cash generation from
the businesses. The average cost of
bank borrowing for the year was 6.0 per
cent compared with 7.3 per cent for
2001 as the Company benefited from
lower UK base rates. The blended fixed
rate of the unchanged £559.0 million of
non-recourse secured notes currently
outstanding, representing 91.2 per cent
of the Group’ s total debt, is 6.7 per cent. 
Earnings per Ordinary Share were 10.1p
(2001: 8.1p, restated for the effects of
the Rights Issue) after a tax credit of
£0.5 million (2001: credit of £2.4 million).
No provision has been made for
Corporation T ax (2001: £nil) because
available capital allowances exceed
taxable profits for the year and the
adoption of FRS 19, requiring us to
make full provision for deferred taxation
on all timing differences, has not resulted
in a deferred tax charge for prior periods
or for the period under review.
Balance sheet
At the year-end, the Group’ s property
portfolio comprised 373 care homes
(2001: 377 homes) with a total of
18,395 beds (2001: 18,721 beds). The
formation of Highfield Care to operate
many of the care homes owned by NHP
has meant that our properties now fall
into two distinct asset classes:
investment properties (leased to third
parties) and operated properties
(homes leased to Highfield Care), the
latter being depreciated. 
The annual year-end independent
valuation of investment properties
extends to the operated properties
which is a change in accounting policy .
The operated properties are now a
significant part of our asset base and
should be included in the balance sheet
at market value on an existing use basis.
The change in accounting policy has
no impact on the prior year figures.
The homes operated by third parties
(261 homes including those still in
receivership) were valued on an
investment property basis, consistent
with previous years, at £483.3 million
and are not depreciated. The
investment property valuation is
primarily based on the anticipated rental
income due under the lease. The 108
operated properties were valued on an
existing use basis at £159.9 million and
these properties are depreciated. The
existing use valuation is based on the
trading prospects of the individual
homes. Both forms of valuation follow
the guidelines set out in the R.I.C.S.
Appraisal & Valuation Manual.
T aking the two asset classes together ,
the value at £643.3 million, represents
a 9.5 per cent increase over last year’ s
£587.7 million. The total cost of the
portfolio, including acquisition costs,
was £659.6 million (2001: £662.1
million). In arriving at the portfolio
valuation of £643.3 million, GVA Grimley
International Property Advisers have
separately assessed the market values
of the individual properties and made
an adjustment by way of a portfolio
premium equating to around 5 per cent.
This portfolio approach is consistent
with that applied in previous years. 
Although the valuation of individual
assets reflects operator strength and
performance, and the condition and
siting of a home, significant regional
differences were revealed. The best
performing regions for NHP were
Scotland, the South East of England 14 NHP Plc 
and Northern Ireland, with Y orkshire
and Humberside, the north west of
England and Wales at the bottom of the
table. It is no coincidence that the best
performing regions are those in which
care purchasers have awarded
meaningful fee increases this year .
The overall yield on the investment and
operated properties, based on the full
annual pavement rents of £67.4 million,
was 10.5 per cent (2001: 11.6 per cent)
ignoring normal investors’ purchase
costs of 5.75 per cent (2001: 5.75 per
cent). When these costs are included,
the yield is 9.9 per cent (2001: 10.9
per cent).
During the year , excluding the deposit
swaps and zero coupon notes of the
securitisation vehicles, net debt fell
from £605.9m to £563.7m. The level
of securitised debt was unchanged
at £559 million but net recourse
borrowings were reduced by £42.3
million to £51.5 million at year-end
(2001: £93.8 million) as a result of
net cash flow and the receipt in July
of the net £31.9 million raised in the
Rights Issue. 
The terms of the Rights Issue were 3
for 8 at 62 pence per new Ordinary
Share and the Issue was 88.6 per cent
taken up by shareholders. At the same
time as the Rights Issue, we completed
a new facility that extended our bank
financing arrangements to December
2004. The new facility provides the
Group with committed revolving
facilities of £90 million. 
Consolidated gearing improved to 222
per cent from 499 per cent during the
period, and gearing excluding non-
recourse securitised assets and
liabilities improved to 30 per cent from
135 per cent. Both reductions are
primarily as a consequence of the
reduction in bank debt and a doubling
of shareholders’ funds. 
Cash flow
Net cash inflow from operating
activities increased by £6.1 million from
£51.8 million in 2001 to £57.9 million
in 2002, largely as a result of increased
rental receipts. 
Net cash interest and finance costs
fell by £1.4m to £43.1 million (2001:
£44.5 million). This reduction is
primarily a result of lower bank debt
interest paid due to the reduced
average net debt for the year of
£595.6 million (2001: £606.8 million)
and a lower average cost of bank
borrowing for the year of 6.0 per cent
(2001: 7.3 per cent).
Cash inflows from asset disposals
exceeded cash outflows from capital
expenditure by £0.2 million (2001: net
£4.5 million inflow). Disposals during
the year totalled £5.5 million (2001:
£10.9 million) and principally
comprised the sale of four homes, at
a book profit to NHP of £0.1 million.
Capital expenditure for the period was
£5.3 million (2001: £6.5 million) as we
began the programme of works to
bring Highfield Care’ s properties up
to the standards that will increase
their value and occupancy levels.
No property acquisitions were included
in capital expenditure during the year
(2001: £1.5 million).
Cash flow generated after financing,
capital items, and taxation was £47.0
million (2001: £10.7 million, excluding
the investment in Ultima Holdings
Limited of £13.6 million) and was used
principally to reduce bank debt.
Financing included the net £31.9 million
(2001: £2.6 million) of new equity . 
Financial derivatives and other
instruments
The deposit swap agreements and zero
coupon notes associated with the
redemption of the Care Homes 1, 2,
and 3 notes remained in place
throughout the period. These
investments mature between 2021 and
2028 and provide for the repayment of
£408 million of the non-recourse £559
million secured notes. In NHP’ s
consolidated accounts, interest on
these instruments accrues on a monthly
basis over the instruments’ various lives
and they are held at a book value of
£132.4 million in the consolidated
balance sheet at 30 September 2002
(2001: £125.8 million).

Directors’ report continued NHP Plc  21
The Remuneration Committee, which sits at least three times in each year, deliberates and makes recommendations to the
Board on the remuneration policy within the Group. The members of the Committee are the non-executive Directors, C H W
Robson, Chairman, Lord Sutherland and R A Henderson. The Committee also consults with Sir Martin Laing, Chairman of
NHP , when appropriate, and retains New Bridge Street Consultants for further advice on policy and pay. The three non-
executive Directors are independent.
Remuneration policy
The Committee considers the following criteria as guidance for its recommendations to the Board on salaries, bonuses, and
long term incentive plans. A significant proportion of Directors’ remuneration is designated to be performance-related
through bonuses and share options.
Salaries 
It is our policy to offer salaries that are competitive and sufficient to attract the best executives possible to run a diversified
and complicated company. These are reviewed annually and designed to be in the upper quartile by any comparison.
Bonuses
Short term bonuses are offered annually to the executive Directors. These are based on the amount by which earnings per
share exceed the budgeted figure agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year. These can rise to 50% of salary when
the performance figures have been met. Senior managers are eligible for cash bonuses of up to 30% of salary, judged
against performance, and these are recommended to the Committee by the Chief Executive.
Share Options
Executive Directors and other senior executives receive options under the Company’ s Executive Share Option Scheme
which was approved by shareholders in August 2001. The first grants were made in September 2001. There were three
tranches of options, and 50% of each is exercisable after three years and 50% after 5 years. T o reflect the fact that senior
executives had not received options for some time since their appointment and the progress that had already been made
towards recovery, the first tranche of options did not have performance conditions. The other two tranches required that
share prices of 50p and 75p were achieved over 30 consecutive dealing days. 
In 2002, further grants were made to senior management. These options are exercisable after three years. Of the last
options awarded 50% of each grant requires the achievement of a share price of 100p and 50% requires 105p.
Details concerning the grants made to the Directors are set out in the options table overleaf. 
The Committee chose to use share price targets because it felt that this was the best way of aligning executives’ and
shareholders’ interests during the Company’ s recovery. There are also no listed companies that in any way compare in
composition to NHP . The Committee will keep this policy under review as the Company progresses and will ensure that all
grants are linked to challenging performance targets, taking into account the Company’ s circumstances at the time. 
Report of the remuneration
committee 22 NHP Plc  
The Committee intends to grant options in future years, subject to the individual grant maximum of 150% of base salary per
annum (or 400% in the case of options granted to facilitate recruitment).

Executive Directors
The executive Directors have contracts of employment for 12 months subject to 12 months notice on either side, which
is in accordance with current corporate governance best practice. The Company pays 20% of their basic salaries as a
contribution to their pensions. Each has the right to a fully expensed company car and is reimbursed on all expenses
incurred wholly on the business of the company. They also receive long-term disability insurance and personal medical
insurance. Executive Directors may not hold outside appointments or directorships without the permission of the Board
in writing. On termination of their contracts, they are not entitled to compensation outside their contractual obligations
of 12 months salary, 20% pension contribution, use of company car, and approved expenses.
Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the Articles of
Association and is based upon independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors. The remuneration paid to

Report of the remuneration
committee continued NHP Plc  25
Application of the principles of corporate governance
Throughout the year the Group complied with the principles of the Combined Code annexed to The Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. This statement describes how the principles of governance are applied by the NHP Group.
Board composition
The Board meets regularly throughout the year, with additional special meetings as required. The Board has a formal agenda
and is responsible for the Group’ s strategy, acquisition and divestment policy and consideration of major financial matters.
The Board currently consists of the non-executive Chairman, Chief Executive, two other executive Directors and three other
non-executive Directors. The Directors’ respective biographies appear on pages 16 to 17.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined. The Chairman is primarily responsible for the
operation of the Board and the Chief Executive is responsible for the creation and implementation of the business strategy
and policies approved at Board meetings.
All four non-executive Directors are independent. Directors appointed by the Board are required to submit themselves for
election at the first opportunity after their appointment and thereafter for re-election at least every three years. Re-
appointment is therefore not automatic.
On appointment Directors go through a business familiarisation process, primarily with the other Directors and the Group’ s
managers, to give them a good understanding of the Group’ s business, procedures, management information systems and
the performance of the Group’ s care homes operators. 
Appointments to the Board
The Chairman, the Chief Executive and Lord Sutherland comprise the Nominations Committee and are responsible for finding
and selecting candidates for appointment as Directors. Board approval is required before an appointment can be made.
The Nominations Committee is continuing to review the composition of the Board so as to ensure that it is appropriate to the
Group’ s future strategy.
Board information
The Board is supplied with regular and appropriate management information and forecasts to enable it to discharge its duties.
The executive Directors produce monthly management reports to the Board summarising the key issues. As part of this
process, forecasts are updated regularly and the executive Directors review the results and report to the Board. These
monthly reports are distributed to the members of the Board and considered in detail at regular meetings.
Statement on corporate governance 26 NHP Plc  
All Directors have access to independent professional advice and to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who
is responsible to the Board for ensuring that the Board procedures are followed and that the Group and Board operate
within applicable legislation, rules and regulations.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, reporting to the Board under the Chairmanship of C H W Robson, includes two other non-
executive Directors, namely Lord Sutherland and R A Henderson. Details of the Group’ s remuneration policy are set out in
the Committee’ s report on pages 21 to 24.
Accountability and audit
The Audit Committee, reporting to the Board, under the Chairmanship of R A Henderson together with two other non-
executive Directors, namely C H W Robson and Lord Sutherland, meets at least four times a year. The Group’ s auditors
frequently attend for part or the whole of each meeting and have direct access to the members of the Committee. The
Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of financial matters including the annual financial statement and
accompanying reports, Group audit arrangements, accounting policies, financial reporting, internal control and the actions
and procedures included in the management of risk throughout the Group. It also provides a forum through which the
external auditors report to the non-executive Directors. 
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’ s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of not achieving business objectives and can only provide reasonable rather than
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Company has been in compliance with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Services Authority for the year ended 30 September 2002 and to the date of this report.
Steps continue to be taken to embed internal control and risk management further into the operations of the business and
to deal with areas of improvement which come to management’ s and the Board’ s attention.
With the growing size and importance of our operating business, incident reporting mechanisms and enhancements of our
quality control procedures, including an ISO 9001 home accreditation programme, have been undertaken. 
Internal financial control
The Group is developing an internal audit function, reporting to the Group Finance Director and reviewed by the Board’ s
Audit Committee.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’ s system of internal financial control on a regular basis, which is designed
to ensure that proper accounting records are maintained, that the assets of the Group are safeguarded and that the financial
information used for reporting and external publication is reliable and accurate.
The Group and each operating company have comprehensive systems for reporting financial results, all of which are
monitored by the executive Directors. Financial results, including a detailed balance sheet analysis, are reviewed on a
monthly basis with comparisons against budget. T welve month profit and cash flow forecasts are reviewed on a quarterly
basis. Treasury reporting is reviewed on a monthly basis. T enant performance indicators (including our own operating
business) are reviewed monthly. All forecasts are reviewed quarterly and revised as necessary. 
The principles underlying all significant transactions and contracts, including those relating to property and all financing
arrangements, are the responsibility of the Board.
Statement on corporate governance
continued NHP Plc  27
Relations with shareholders
The Group maintains a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and fund managers. All shareholders receive the
Interim and Annual Report and Accounts.
The Group maintains a website – www.nhpplc.co.uk – which is regularly updated and contains live links to other sites
containing up to date investor information. The Group’ s site holds the latest accounts of the NHP Plc Group and information
on the performance of the three bond issues. The site has become the most frequently used channel of communication
with private investors.
The Annual General Meeting provides the Board with an opportunity to communicate with, and to answer questions from,
private and institutional investors.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 30 January 2003 are in the Notice of Meeting on
page 67. Prior to a vote being taken on a show of hands, as is recommended in the Combined Code, the number of proxy
votes for and against each resolution are disclosed to the meeting.
Going Concern
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operation for the foreseeable future and so continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
R A Henderson
Chairman
Audit Committee
16 December 2002 28 NHP Plc  
United Kingdom Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss
of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors confirm that they have met the above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group, and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the Group’ s system of internal financial control, for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.

Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities NHP Plc  29
We have audited the financial statements of NHP Plc for the year ended 30 September 2002 which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated
statement of total recognised gains and losses, the consolidated reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds,
the consolidated note of historical cost profits and losses and the related notes 1 to 34. These financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Company’ s Directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibility
is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements, auditing
standards, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding Directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’ s compliance with the seven provisions of
the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’ s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’ s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year as described in
the contents section and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances
of the Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at
30 September 2002 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

1. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment
and operated properties, and in accordance with all applicable accounting standards, including the adoption of Financial
Reporting Standards (“FRS”) 19 ‘Deferred tax’. The particular accounting policies adopted are described below. The
financial statements are in compliance with the Companies Act 1985 except that, as explained below, investment
properties are not depreciated. 
In the year to 30 September 2002, the Directors have carefully considered a change in the accounting policy for operated
properties (described as operational fixed assets in 2001 Annual Report and Accounts). FRS 15 ‘T angible fixed assets’
permits alternative valuation rules which allow for a regular revaluation of the assets. The Directors are of the opinion that
annual revaluation of the operated properties presents the assets in the balance sheet at close to their true commercial
value. Depreciation will be charged based on the revalued amount at the beginning of the year. 
This change in accounting policy has not required a restatement of comparatives (see note 13). 
Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with those of
Care Homes No.1 Limited (“Care Homes 1”), Care Homes No.2 Limited (“Care Homes 2”) and Care Homes No.3 Limited
(“Care Homes 3”). Care Homes 1, Care Homes 2 and Care Homes 3 are not subsidiary undertakings of the Group; however,
by reason of contractual arrangements between the Group and Care Homes 1, Care Homes 2 and Care Homes 3, under
FRS 5, the financial statements of Care Homes 1, Care Homes 2 and Care Homes 3 are required to be consolidated as part
of the Group. Summaries of the financial statements of Care Homes 1, Care Homes 2 and Care Homes 3 are disclosed in
note 31 of the financial statements. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings, representing any excess of the consideration given over
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its
estimated useful life. Goodwill on the acquisition of Highfield Holdings Limited in the year ended 30 September 2002 is
being amortised over 20 years. Goodwill on the acquisition of Highfield Care Homes Limited (formerly ‘Palladium Healthcare
Limited’) and Highfield Care Homes No.3 Limited (formerly ‘Somerford Leased Homes Limited’) in the year ended 30
September 2001 is being amortised over 20 years. Goodwill on the acquisition of G.R. Patrick & Co. Limited in the year
ended 30 September 1999 is being amortised over 10 years. Provision is made for any impairment. 
Valuation of land and buildings 
Investment properties 
The cost of investment properties is purchase cost, any incidental costs of acquisition and the cost of capital improvements.
Investment properties represent freehold or long leasehold properties held for long term retention. In accordance with
Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.19, these investment properties are valued annually by qualified external
valuers. The aggregate revaluation surplus or deficit is transferred to the revaluation reserve whilst any permanent diminution
in value is charged to the profit and loss account. 
Operated properties 
Operated properties, which are initially transferred out of investment properties at the then existing use value, are valued
annually at 30 September by qualified external valuers, the aggregate revaluation surplus or deficit being transferred to the
revaluation reserve whilst any permanent diminution in value is charged to the profit and loss account. 
Properties held for resale 
Properties held for resale are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, any impairment in value being charged to
the profit and loss account. 
Capital expenditure on the investment portfolio assets 
Capital expenditure incurred on a leased care home which improves the physical condition above the level required in the
lease and which enhances the property’ s value is capitalised. Otherwise such capital expenditure is charged in the profit
and loss account. 
Notes to the accounts
For the year ended 30 September 2002 36 NHP Plc  
1. Accounting policies continued
Depreciation 
In accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.19, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment
properties. Under the terms of the Group’ s leases, freehold and long leasehold properties are required to be maintained to a
high standard by its tenants. This treatment is a departure from the requirement of the Companies Act 1985 which requires
all fixed assets to be depreciated over their effective useful lives. However, such properties are not held for consumption but
for investment, and the Directors consider that systematic depreciation would be inappropriate and would not give a true
and fair view. The accounting policy adopted and departure from the Companies Act 1985 is therefore necessary for the
accounts to give a true and fair view. Depreciation is one of the factors reflected in the annual revaluation, and amounts
which might otherwise have been charged cannot be separately identified or quantified. 
Operated properties are depreciated in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful economic lives of each category
of asset. The amount of depreciation, the calculation of which is based on the opening valuation plus subsequent
capitalised capital expenditure less estimated residual value, is charged to the profit and loss account with an appropriate
adjustment being made to the revaluation reserve by the transfer of a sum from revaluation reserve to profit and loss
account. The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: 
Freehold land no depreciation
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 5 to 20 years
Other fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation which is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost in equal
amounts over their anticipated useful lives as follows: 
Short leasehold improvements remaining period of lease
Office equipment and fixtures 5 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Investments 
Except as stated below, investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. 
In the consolidated accounts, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. The consolidated profit
and loss account includes the Group’ s share of associates’ profits less losses, whilst the Group’ s share of the net assets of the
associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill arising on the acquisition is accounted for in accordance with
the policy set out above. Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associates. 
Deferred taxation 
FRS 19 has been adopted for the first time in this accounting period. FRS 19 requires full provision for timing differences
which have originated at the balance sheet date and which could give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the
future. The standard requires that deferred tax is not recognised in respect of gains and losses on revalued assets unless the
company has entered into a binding agreement to sell the assets and the gains or losses have been recognised in the profit
and loss account. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded more likely than not that they will be
recovered. Previously, the Group’ s accounting policy had been to provide for deferred tax on timing differences to the extent
that it was probable a liability or asset would crystallise in the future. 
The adoption of FRS 19 has had no impact on either the current year or prior year results and hence no restatement has
been made. See note 18 for restatement of unprovided amounts. 
Finance costs 
Costs which are incurred directly in connection with the raising of bank loans or Secured Notes are amortised at a constant
rate over the lives of the loan facility or Secured Notes in accordance with FRS 4. 
Interest 
Interest receivable and interest payable are recognised in the financial statements on an accruals basis. Interest on Deposit
Swap Agreements and Zero Coupon Bonds is accrued and capitalised on a monthly basis over their respective lives.
Discounts on Secured Notes, being interest paid in advance, is amortised over the lives of the Secured Notes. 
Notes to the accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 2002 NHP Plc  37
1. Accounting policies continued
Leased assets 
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached
to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their
useful lives. The capital elements of the future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, whilst the interest elements are
charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance
of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated
over their useful lives. 
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. 
Pensions 
The Group contributes to money purchase pension schemes, including contributions to the NHP Executive Pension
Schemes, for the executive Directors at the rate of 20% of basic salary, which is charged monthly to the profit and loss
account. The assets of the NHP Executive Pension Schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds. 
The Company and its subsidiary undertaking, NHP Management Limited contribute to the personal pensions of their
employees at rates from 10% to 20% of basic salary, which is charged monthly to the Profit and loss account. 
A stakeholder pension scheme exists for all employees of Highfield Care Group of companies. 
Financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements in line with the Group’ s risk
management policies. The Group does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Amounts
payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period
of the contracts.

The Directors have taken advice from GVA Grimley, International Property Advisers, and consider that the appropriate value
of assets qualifying for capital allowances, to be used in the calculation of deferred tax, is an apportionment of the total
portfolio value. Applying the valuation, the Group has, as at 30 September 2002, unprovided deferred tax assets of
£14,009,000 in respect of accelerated capital allowances (2001: £20,946,000) and £4,538,000 in respect of revenue
losses (2001: £2,588,000). These assets would be recovered if in future they reverse in the same periods and entities in
which suitable taxable profits arise.
In the prior year the Group reported an unprovided deferred tax liability of £16,057,000 in respect of accelerated capital
allowances. As a result of the implementation of FRS 19, the underlying basis for determining the carrying value of assets
qualifying for capital allowances has been revised to more accurately reflect the historic transactions undertaken by the
Group. The prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect this.
The deferred tax liability on the potential capital gain arising in relation to the revalued freeholds of £29,506,000 (2001:
£8,295,000) is not recognised as the Group has no intention to sell these properties at this time and there is no binding
agreement.

together with a floating charge on its other assets and an unlimited guarantee from NHP Plc.

At 30 September 2001, the provision against loans to subsidiary undertakings of £46,520,000 principally existed as a result of
temporary downward movements in the valuation of properties below their original cost in the year ended 30 September 2000.
At 30 September 2002, the Directors consider a write back of the full amount is appropriate as a result of improvements in the
valuation of the assets in the relevant subsidiary undertakings. In both 2002 and 2001, the valuation of the portfolio of
properties has recovered reducing the provision by £46,520,000 at 30 September 2002 (2001: £12,607,000). 52 NHP Plc

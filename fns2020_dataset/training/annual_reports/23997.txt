frequencies on existing routes, new routes and 
new bases, as well as new commercial partnerships 
including a White Label agreement with SAS in 
Sweden. The benefit is now shown clearly in these 
results, with the Group achieving profitability.
The tragic events in Paris in November 2015 and 
Brussels in March 2016 caused customers to think 
hard about whether they had to travel in the UK and 
north-western Europe. Since this is our entire ambit 
of operations, and with our late-booking business 
market positioning, the effect on Flybe was immediate 
and far-reaching. However, Flybe is now a more agile 
business and management responded by significantly 
reducing capacity and accelerating their cost reduction 
initiatives; while electing to hold yields and accept 
lower load factors. The financial impact on Flybe could 
have been significant, but decisive management action 
reduced the net impact so that our full-year profit 
forecasts were not altered. 
Low spot oil prices are beginning to reduce our costs 
as forward hedges on fuel unwind. This is beneficial 
to the business. However, all airlines, as well as our 
principal competitors, the road, rail and ferry operators, 
have benefited from the lower oil and energy prices.  
As a result, much of the fuel price saving is actually 
passed on to the consumer through lower fares.
Over the past 12 months Flybe has actively engaged 
the UK government and the EU to support regional 
aviation more effectively by providing a level playing 
field versus international air travel and other modes 
of transport. While Flybe is in favour of passenger 
rights, we have argued that penalties for excessive 
flight delays within an airline’s control need to be 
proportionate to the value of the ticket price, and not, 
as is the case currently for regional airlines, at often 
three times the average price! No such punitive regime 
exists for long-haul airlines nor indeed for rail, road  
and ferry operators.
simon l affin
Chairman
a year of strong progress 
and achievement
Our mission is to be Europe’s leading regional airline, 
acting responsibly and generating value for all our 
stakeholders.
Chairman’s statement 
introduction
This has been the second full year of our turnaround, 
and we have made significant progress. In the first 
year of the turnaround, we restructured the business, 
completed a successful capital raise and relaunched 
the Flybe brand. We resolved a number of outstanding 
fleet issues, including an exit from binding new  
aircraft orders, and also divested the unprofitable  
and time-consuming joint venture in Finland. During 
this second year we resolved our final key legacy  
issue by redeploying our E195 aircraft. We also grew 
revenue and delivered a profit despite significant 
market headwinds.
The clearance of our key legacy issues has freed 
management to focus on building a growing and 
sustainable regional airline. The team has established 
a number of growth platforms including additional  f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16  03
Strategic report
The UK government’s Air Passenger Duty (APD) is also 
levied disproportionately on regional flights. A typical 
domestic flight can be charged up to 19 times the tax 
per mile of a long-haul one. This is doubled when a 
return international flight suffers this charge once, but 
a domestic one is taxed twice as APD is a UK departure 
tax. In the run-up to the last general election, the 
government took the political decision to reduce long-
haul APD rates by £1 billion, while, without a glimmer 
of shame, informing Flybe that it could not afford to 
reduce short-haul rates.
We ask that APD should be more reflective either of 
the distances actually travelled or the price of the 
ticket, and that APD is levied more equitably. Indeed 
we have proposed to the Chancellor to lower the levy 
at regional airports by 50% in line with what is being 
planned in Scotland, funding it through an increase at 
the large, slot-constrained airports in London such as 
Heathrow and Gatwick. This would give it some logic, 
akin to an airport congestion charge.
The government continues to highlight an aspiration 
for a Northern Powerhouse, but ignores the importance 
of regional aviation connectivity. The government-
funded £43 billion HS2 will not be part of this in the 
foreseeable future, as it will not reach Manchester for 
the next 17 years. Meanwhile, right now, Flybe operates 
41 flights from Manchester and 46 from Birmingham 
every day and those two million passengers a year 
receive no government subsidy and instead suffer  
an arbitrary tax burden. 
The UK has 22 public service obligation (i.e. publicly 
underwritten) routes. By contrast, France has 45. 
Most of the UK routes are in Scotland, funded by the 
Scottish government. Flybe asks that the government 
takes a more strategic view on UK regional aviation 
and recognises that some communities need support 
to maintain fast physical connectivity to the main 
conurbations, especially London. 
While the decision on the new south-east airport 
capacity continues to be delayed, Flybe proposed 
that it be allowed to operate scheduled services into 
Northolt airport. This would give some of the UK 
connectivity benefits of a new south-east runway with 
none of the environmental disadvantages in the interim 
until the new capacity is built. Flybe would contribute 
c£7m more annually to the government in landing fees 
and APD. It would replace the current noisy private 
executive jets that benefit only a few with our quieter 
efficient turboprops benefiting 300,000 passengers per 
annum. It would actually reduce noise for local residents. 
However, the Ministry of Defence decided perversely 
that it could not even consider our proposal until the 
Heathrow decision had been taken, ignoring the fact that 
our suggestion is an interim one only, and so completely 
irrelevant to the final decision. I suspect that this ended 
up in the ‘all too difficult’ bin of political decision-making.
Board 
David Kappler became Chairman of the Audit 
Committee following Charlie Scott’s retirement after 
the AGM in July 2015. We are also pleased to welcome 
Kate Ledger as our new Company Secretary and 
General Counsel. She brings with her a wealth of legal 
and aviation experience. 
Corporate governance
In line with the standards of best practice and 
regulations, we have made a separate statement  
on page 45.
r esults
This year sees Flybe achieve profitability with an 
adjusted profit before tax of £5.5m, excluding US 
dollar loan revaluation losses of £(2.8)m. There were 
no adjustments this year for either discontinued 
operations or non-recurring items following the 
resolution of our final legacy issue. 
general outlook
The business is now in good shape. With key legacy 
issues behind us, we have made a profit this year. 
This represents an important milestone in the turnaround 
of Flybe. We want to create a business that delivers 
profitable growth underpinned by a robust financial 
foundation. Total revenue grew by 8.7%, and we 
finished the year with £62.2m net funds and £171.4m 
total cash.
The general economic conditions remain difficult.  
We are, as ever, exposed to exogenous events that 
can disrupt regional air travel. Our approach will be to 
continue to drive costs lower, improve the profitability 
of our route network and expand cautiously. 
Flybe plays a vital role in UK regional connectivity. 
The Board believes that our differentiated competitive 
positioning, reduced cost base, strong balance sheet 
and disciplined growth strategy will enable us to 
deliver continued progress in the current year and 
position us well to drive sustainable profitable growth 
in the future.

introduction
The second full year of our three-year transformation 
plan saw Flybe grow seat capacity by 9.7%, passenger 
volumes by 5.9% and passenger revenue by 8.2%, 
as well as deliver a profit, with an adjusted PBT for 
2015/16 of £5.5m. This reflects a c£20m year-on-year 
improvement in profitability even after the adverse 
bookings impact from the Paris events in November, 
absorption of c£20m of cost relating to the E195 jets, 
our last key legacy issue, and pressure on yields from 
industry-wide capacity growth acceleration and lower 
fuel costs.
r esolution of the remaining key legacy issue, surplus 
e195 jets
In November 2015, we announced the resolution of 
our last major legacy issue with the redeployment of 
our remaining nine E195s. In conjunction with regional 
airports, we entered into arrangements that enable 
Flybe to deploy these aircraft on UK regional routes 
while mitigating half of the outstanding £80m financial 
burden to the end of the aircraft leases. 
a gility and delivery in a difficult revenue environment
2015/16 saw an acceleration in seat capacity growth 
rates across the European short-haul sector, enabled 
by industry-wide lower fuel costs. This put significant 
pressure on airline yields, even as the benefits started 
to come through from the unwinding of fuel price 
hedging. This yield pressure was reinforced by the 
adverse impact on bookings following the tragic events 
in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March 2016. 
In this difficult revenue environment, we decided to 
protect yields rather than to chase unprofitable marginal 
revenue and slowed our seat capacity growth rate by 
c10ppts to 2.4% in Q4. This enabled us to deliver on a 
full-year basis a 1.7% increase in yields while load factor 
decreased by 2.6ppts to 72.6%, with a corresponding 
Chief Executive Officer’s statement

Flybe is now a much more resilient business  
and well positioned for profitable growth.

Strategic report
1.4% decrease in passenger revenue per seat. Passenger 
demand is now slowly recovering. In the aftermath of 
Paris, we also maintained and sharpened our unit cost 
reduction focus. On a full-year basis, cost per seat, 
excluding fuel, was reduced by 2.3%, and including  
fuel by 4.2%. 
During the year, we maintained our record of 
operational excellence, being named in January 2016 
by OAG as among the top 20 airlines worldwide for 
punctuality in 2015. 85.4% of our flights over the 
past 12 months arrived within 15 minutes of their 
scheduled arrival time. We also continued to improve 
our schedule quality through frequency additions on 
47 existing routes. This delivered enhanced appeal to 
business travellers (c50% of our total customer base) 
who are time-sensitive and place a significant premium 
on convenience. Our customer satisfaction levels 
increased by 3 percentage points to 58% (top two box 
score: completely satisfied, very satisfied). In January 
2016, Flybe was named Best Short-Haul Airline at the 
2016 Business Travel Awards, beating, among others, 
easyJet and British Airways.
On the commercial front, we signed a landmark 
codeshare agreement with Virgin Atlantic involving 
14 Flybe routes connecting onto 20 Virgin routes 
(50% of their total) from the UK to the US and the 
Caribbean at Manchester, Glasgow and Gatwick. 
We also signed a new franchising agreement with Blue 
Islands which will operate flights to and from Jersey 
and Guernsey airports with effect from Summer 2016 
in Flybe branded aircraft. In October 2015 we also 
successfully launched a new White Label solution for 
SAS, Scandinavia’s largest carrier, flying regional routes 
in their livery out of Stockholm Arlanda. This operation 
is anticipated to grow to five aircraft in 2016/17.
In February 2016 we took ownership of three Q400 
aircraft, previously on operating leases, for a cash 
consideration of £24.4m in line with our stated strategy 
of rebalancing the aircraft fleet away from reliance 
on operating leases and towards outright ownership, 
which brings the associated margin uplift. We took out 
debt against these aircraft in May 2016, post year end.
We also delivered a strong year-end cash position  
with total cash of £171.4m and net funds of £62.2m  
at 31st March 2016.
People
We have worked hard to engage our people and 
embed our Purple values during our turnaround.  
This year’s employee satisfaction survey demonstrates 
the improvements made with an increase in our overall 
employee engagement score of 8 percentage points to 
63%. I would like to thank all Flybe employees for their 
hard work, passion and commitment. 
Public affairs
During the year, we continued to lobby the UK 
government on a number of fronts:
> > to allow Flybe to operate scheduled services into 
Northolt airport to provide much-needed regional 
connectivity into the capital until new runway capacity 
is built in the south-east of England in 15 to 20 years;
> > to reform, if not abolish, Air Passenger Duty as this  
is a discriminatory tax on regional travel on a per 
mile basis compared to international travel; and 
> > to drive, at EU level, reform of EU Regulation 
261/2004 on passenger rights which similarly 
discriminates against regional airline operators.  
The payment in the event of three-hour controllable 
delays under EU 261 is three times Flybe’s average 
ticket price; which we feel is disproportionate 
relative to Flybe’s principal competitors, the rail, 
road and ferry operators.
Flybe joined the European Regions Airline Association 
(ERA) last year to lobby the European Commission, 
Parliament and member states to promote the interests 
of regional aviation. One of ERA’s key priorities is the 
revision of EU261. ERA has 52 regional airline members 
across the EU.
strategy and outlook
Going into the third and final year of our transformation, 
our plan remains to establish Flybe as a world-class 
regional airline, occupying a distinctive niche in European 
aviation. There is a need for relatively short flights (up to 
around 90 minutes) from regional airports. Many of these 
routes are too short (less than 400 nautical miles) or too 
thin (i.e. they have too few passengers) for the standard 
short-haul jet aircraft format, such as an Airbus A320 
or Boeing B737, to operate profitably or with sufficient 
daily frequency. Furthermore, some of these routes use 
runways that are also too short for the effective operation 
of these aircraft. This makes such routes less attractive 
to a flag-carrying or low-cost airline, but means they are 
well suited to our preferred turboprop Q400 aircraft and 
our fleet of small regional jets.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement 
continued
Flybe’s strategy will therefore remain focused on 
delivering unrivalled regional connectivity with high 
frequency on low-volume, short-hop routes which 
mainstream airlines (be they low-cost carriers or national 
flag carriers) are unable to serve effectively or profitably. 
Flybe will also continue to promote its ‘one stop 
service to the world’ connecting regional customers 
to all continents with long-haul codeshare partners at 
key international hubs such as Manchester, Paris and 
Dublin. We currently have nine codeshare partners 
which include Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, 
Aer Lingus and Air France. 
Flybe currently connects Britain – one out of every 
two domestic flights in the UK is a Flybe flight. Our 
ambition is to connect Europe. A third of our seat 
capacity is already on UK to Europe routes and this 
coming year will see us increase that proportion to 
more than 40% as we cautiously build up our European 
density. In August we start our first intra-European 
flights flying from Hannover to both Milan and Lyon.
We expect double-digit seat capacity growth during 
2016/17. 40% of this relates to E195 capacity deployed in 
airport partnership deals which provide cost mitigation, 
and the other 60% on routes with additional frequency 
requirements or on new low-volume, short-hop routes 
which strictly adhere to Flybe’s business model.
summary
This year, Flybe returned to growth and made an 
adjusted profit before tax for the first time since the 
Company’s flotation in 2010, concluding the second 
full year of our three-year turnaround and setting down 
strong foundations for the future. We have made great 
progress in building a sustainable, scalable, world-class 
regional European airline.
We are well advanced in our transformation.

Flybe’s four chapter turnaround
 1
 
t urnaround Chapter 1: r estructuring
Chapter 1 focused on securing the survival of the 
business and comprised ‘Immediate Actions’ to 
maximise internal cash generation, double the 
cost reduction previously undertaken, reconfigure 
the network, fleet and organisation, improve 
commercialisation and rebuild stakeholder confidence. 
 2
 
t urnaround Chapter 2: r ebirth of f lybe
On the back of the successful delivery of Chapter 1, 
we entered Chapter 2 in March 2014. This involved a 
strengthening of our balance sheet through a £150m 
net capital raise and a brand relaunch. This included 
a new customer promise: ‘The fastest way from A to 
Flybe’ along with the introduction of purple as our new 
brand colour and a new code of conduct designed to 
maximise individual, team and business performance.
 3
  
t urnaround Chapter 3: r esolving legacy issues 
and laying foundations for profitable growth
With the business restructured, refinanced and 
relaunched, we entered Chapter 3 in early 2015.  
This focused on establishing growth platforms while 
addressing the Company’s key legacy issues. By the 
end of 2015, Chapter 3 was completed. All key legacy 
issues were tackled and c£750m of liabilities eliminated. 
The resolution of legacy issues comprised completion 
of our cost restructuring with £74m gross savings 
delivered over two years, £3m above the original 
commitment; securing Bombardier’s agreement to fund 
the upgrading of our Q400 fleet with 27 modifications 
designed to improve technical reliability; negotiating 
away a firm order for E175 aircraft (c$892m obligation 
removed) at no cost to Flybe; exit from the loss-making 
Flybe Finland joint venture (€125m potential liability 
eliminated) at no cash cost to Flybe; and resolution 
of our surplus E195 jet aircraft (reducing the financial 
burden to c£40m to the end of the aircraft leases). 
During Chapter 3, we also established future growth 
platforms: growth in UK capacity coupled with 
improved commercial and operational execution 
enabled us to drive growth in passenger volumes and 
revenue over five consecutive quarters; four new bases 
and 45 new routes were launched; five new codeshares 
were signed and launched (Cathay Pacific, Finnair, 
Emirates, Aer Lingus, Virgin Atlantic), more than 
doubling the number to nine; and a number of new 
commercial partnerships were signed and launched 
including with Airbus Military, through which Flybe 
provides airframe-related maintenance at Brize Norton 
for the RAF’s new fleet of A400M Atlas airlifters, and 
with SAS, for whom Flybe provides a White Label 
operation in Stockholm, flying regional routes on  
their behalf and in their brand livery.

With the completion of Chapters 1-3, Flybe entered 
Chapter 4 at the turn of the year. We achieved

flybe u K
Flybe UK made substantial progress in 2015/16  
in terms of revenue growth and adjusted profit of 
£8.8m in 2015/16, an improvement of £32.9m from  
a loss of £(24.1)m in 2014/15. The profit improvement 
excludes Group costs of £(5.8)m in 2015/16 (2014/15: 
£(3.6)m and US dollar loan revaluation losses of 
£(2.8)m, (2014/15: £(10.2)m). This profit was driven 
by a combination of network and commercial 
enhancements and improved operational delivery  
in addition to a focus on unit cost reduction.
Firstly we made significant investments to optimise 
and grow our network. On the optimisation front, c50% 
of our routes now have at least two daily frequencies. 
Multiple daily frequencies are important to business 
travellers, who are time-sensitive and require a choice 
of flight departure times. 
We also launched 52 new routes during the year of 
which only 14% had an airline competitor. These new 
routes focused on connecting our regional bases 
to important regional centres in Europe such as 
Rotterdam, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam, Paris and Milan, 
as well as some domestic route infilling, such as 
Edinburgh-Liverpool and Exeter-Glasgow.
In addition, we extended our ‘One Stop to the World’ 
programme which provides access to long-haul 
destinations for our customers through our international 
codesharing partners at key hubs within Flybe’s 
network. We renewed our Aer Lingus codeshare 
agreement, which provides feed for their transatlantic 
routes to North America through Dublin, and signed a 
new codeshare agreement with Emirates, which sees 
Emirates’ code added to 25 Flybe routes across the 
UK, seamlessly connecting regional UK customers 
with Emirates flights to Dubai and beyond from our 
Manchester, Glasgow and Birmingham gateways.
Secondly, we were able to drive passenger growth 
by a) improved marketing with more focus on digital 
channels, b) a more targeted sales programme 
through travel management companies focused on 
large travel buyers including corporates and public 
sector organisations, c) completing the automation 
of business rules in our revenue management systems, 
which enables us to optimise yield and load factor by 
type of route, and d) improved operational delivery 
with punctuality up versus prior year for both departure 
and arrival within 15 minutes of scheduled times. 
The improvements in Flybe’s commercial and 
operational execution were accompanied by 
enhancements in customer service delivery. During 
the year, we transferred our outsourced call handling 
operations from Exeter to Belgrade resulting in both 
cost reduction and improved service levels. The 
cumulative impact of the improvements across Flybe 
UK resulted in a 3 percentage points year-on-year 
increase in customer satisfaction to 58%. While pleased 
with this improvement, we are targeting to improve 
customer satisfaction further this year.
Flybe was recognised during the year for its 
improvements. It was named by OAG as one of the 
most punctual airlines in the world in 2015 and it won 
Best Short-Haul Airline in January 2016 at the Business 
Travel Awards in London.

Flybe was named as the Best Short-Haul Airline at 
the 2016 Business Travel Awards. Judged by top 
industry professionals, the awards are regarded 
as the highest recognition given by the UK travel 
industry and among the most valued in the business 
travel sector worldwide. 
Flybe beat off competition from legacy carriers 
British Airways and KLM, as well as other airlines 
such as Easyjet and Fastjet, and the win is seen as 
a validation of Flybe’s turnaround strategy over the 
past 18 months.
The judges commented that ‘new routes, especially 
those out of London City, and the fact that 50% of  
its passengers are flying for business-related reasons, 
highlight the fact that Flybe is very much geared to 
the corporate market’.
Flybe now occupies a distinctive niche in regional 
aviation providing a better alternative to rail, road 
and other airlines in providing time saving business 
travel for regional customers. The choice of frequent 
and conveniently timed flights, coupled with value 
pricing and a strong commitment to customer 
service, is clearly favoured by business travellers  
for short-haul flights.

structural change in fuel price
During 2015 fuel prices have continued to remain at a 
very low level, driving sustained pressure on yield and 
significant capacity growth from most airlines. Due to 
the level of hedging in place at Flybe, this year has seen 
the first benefit from the lower fuel price, improving 
our financial performance. However, since all airlines as 
well as road, rail and ferry operators benefit from lower 
fuel and energy prices, much of this cost reduction is 
competed away to the benefit of customers in terms  
of lower air fares.
Cash
Working with our credit card providers, we have 
reduced restricted cash even further from £18.0m in 
March 2015 to £7.8m at the end of March 2016 and 
we had a healthy £171.4m total cash at 31st March 
2016 (31st March 2015: £195.9m), in line with our cash 
strategy outlined at the time of the equity raise in 2014. 
The reduction in cash year-on-year is mainly as a result 
of the purchase of three Q400 aircraft for £24.4m.
Costs
We have continued to challenge our cost base. 
These efforts resulted in a reduction in cost per seat, 
excluding fuel, of 2.2%. In the face of a challenging 
environment, with additional pressure on revenue 
particularly in the fourth quarter, our focus on cost 
has enabled us to maintain our profitability in line with 
forecasts. This resilience is an indication of the strength 
of our business model and our ability to respond 
quickly to a changing environment. 
f lybe t raining a cademy
Flybe continues to develop and promote talent within 
the aviation industry through the training programmes 
it provides at its Exeter Training Academy. The state-
of-the-art building has 26 classrooms, a simulator 
hall with two full flight Level D simulators, cabin crew 
simulator hulls for safety and refresher training, and 
an engineering apprentice workshop. 
Qualifications offered include a flight deck Multi-
Crew Pilot’s Licence (under the first CAA-approved 
scheme for a UK airline), cabin crew and customer 
service NVQs, Foundation and Bachelor degrees, 
and engineering aircraft type approvals.
This asset has proved immensely beneficial in support 
of our training requirements for crew driven by 
capacity growth. 
White l abel
There are currently seven aircraft flying (six as at 31st 
March 2016) as part of the White Label operation. 
These aircraft operate under Flybe’s Airline Operating 
Certificate and are provided with Flybe flight and cabin 
crew, as well as maintenance. The aircraft operate 
short-haul services in Europe with five ATR 72-600 
aircraft based at Arlanda, Stockholm, flying on behalf 
of SAS, and two Bombardier Q400 based in Brussels 
flying for Brussels Airlines. 
Operations with SAS have been phased in since 
commencement in October 2015 with the fifth aircraft 
being introduced in May 2016. 
A two-year extension to the existing contract with 
Brussels Airlines commenced in October 2015. Flybe 
will be using local crew for these operations.

Strategic report
Flybe was one of only two UK-based carriers to 
feature in the top 20 global airlines punctuality 
league table, outperforming many major UK carriers 
for its on time performance (OTP) ratings in the 
Punctuality League 2015, published by the globally 
renowned air travel intelligence specialist, OAG. 
The annual report is regarded as the industry’s 
most comprehensive annual ranking of on time 
performance for the world’s airlines and airports. 
With an 87.47% on time performance record, Flybe 
was placed in 17th position on the global listing. 
We operate in excess of 450 flights a day so 
such official and independent recognition of our 
punctuality record is always extremely welcome.  
A good record for departing and arriving within the 
accepted 15-minute window is naturally one of the 
main considerations for travellers when deciding  
to which airline they will take their business. 
We aim to provide time-saving air travel in comparison 
not just with other modes of transport such as 
road or rail, but also other airlines. This positive 
benchmarking report affirms that we are on the  
right track. Punctuality remains at the forefront  
of our growth strategy. 
This latest report reinforces other high profile 
recognition received in recent years. In May 2015, 
the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) 2014 On-Time 
Performance Report confirmed that Flybe had 
outperformed many other major industry players 
(defined as those operating more than 25,000 
flights a year from CAA reporting airports), bucking 
the industry’s downward trend with an 82% on-time 
ranking, a full 3% above the industry average.  
This again exceeded that of such well-known  
names as British Airways (77%), Easyjet (78%)  
and Ryanair (79%).
This followed having been named as the UK’s most 
punctual airline in a report issued by the influential 
consumer watchdog ‘Which? in December 2014.

summary
2015/16 has been a year of returning to growth and 
achieving profitability for Flybe Group. Total revenue 
increased by 8.7% to £623.8m from £574.1m, as the  
UK business saw capacity increase by 9.7% to 11.3m 
seats, and passenger numbers increased significantly  
to 8.2m compared to 7.7m in the previous year through 
an improved route network and customer offering. 
Flybe has now created a platform to expand further  
in Europe.
During 2015/16 Flybe continued to reduce unit cost, 
both including and excluding fuel. We focused heavily 
on airport and aircraft ownership cost reduction. 
The resolution of the last key legacy issue, the nine 
remaining E195 aircraft, was a major achievement in 
the year. We absorbed c£20m of E195 related costs in 
2015/16 related mainly to lease and maintenance costs, 
insurance, margin dilution and ‘back in to service’ 
costs. The future costs related to these aircraft remain 
as communicated before: £10.0m in 2016/17, £6.0m 
in 2017/18 and £4.0m in 2018/2019. Overall, we have 
mitigated half of the outstanding financial burden to 
the end of the aircraft leases. 
Flybe invested in taking ownership of a further three of 
our leased Q400 aircraft in February 2016 for £24.4m 
as per the strategy of owning 50% of the fleet over 
time. During the year we started to benefit from the 
lower fuel cost as our hedges started unwinding.
The MRO business, Flybe Aviation Services, generated 
a profit before tax of £2.5m (2014/15: £2.3m).
Flybe made an adjusted profit before tax of £5.5m 
(2014/15: loss of £(25.4)m). This is adjusted by non-
cash revaluations on our US dollar loans that are 
intended to be natural hedges against the value of 
each aircraft, whose value is denominated in dollars. 
Including these revaluations, we made a profit before 
tax of £2.7m (2014/15: loss of £(35.6)m including 
discontinued operations).

Flybe has entered into a contract with Nordic Aviation 
Capital (NAC) to cancel obligations to lease nine used 
Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft, while taking 
ownership of 10 Q400 aircraft it was under contract to 
lease, for a cash consideration of c£86.0m, with delivery 
and consideration to take place over the next 12 months. 
The contract has a number of conditions that still remain 
to be satisfied as at 8th June 2016. This will leave 10 
Q400 aircraft to be delivered in 2016/17 (see page  
113 – post balance sheet event).
In support of White Label operations in Sweden, 
Flybe leased one additional ATR72 aircraft (increasing 
the total to five), which was delivered in May 2016.
One Embraer E195 aircraft was redelivered to its lessor 
in 2015/16. No other redeliveries have taken place  
in the year. Flybe also took ownership of three of  
its previously leased Q400 aircraft in 2015/16.
The following table shows the current number of 
aircraft that are contracted for delivery to the Group.

Strategic report
As discussed in the Business Review above, Flybe UK 
discontinued under-performing routes and drove load 
factors by yield investment and improved marketing. 
The 9.7% increase in seat capacity was offset by a 2.6 
percentage points decrease in load factor. This resulted 
in annual passenger numbers increasing to 8.2m. 
The increase in passenger numbers and the increase 
in passenger yield resulted in an 8.2% increase in 
passenger revenue to £571.7m. 
Due to the fact that the additional capacity was 
introduced recently, revenue per seat fell by 1.4% 
(to £50.64).
Other revenue in Flybe UK totalled £15.4m, a 46.7% 
increase on the £10.5m generated in 2014/15 driven 
mainly by an additional £5.7m contract receivables 
in association with our arrangement in Cardiff. 
Contract flying was up £2.3m to £13.9m reflecting 
the start of SAS operations in Sweden.

Operating costs 594.7 52.67 565.7 54.97
Operating costs, increased by 5.2% from £565.7m to 
£594.7m. The increase is significantly less than the 
increase in capacity growth of 9.7% as we have focused 
on cost control and cost savings.
Despite an increase in the number of aircraft from  
66 to 74, the total aircraft rental charges reduced from 
£80.6m to £79.3m as we purchased three aircraft from 
lease and reduced the number of E195 aircraft to nine.
A better mix between digital and traditional advertising 
and improved marketing execution enabled us to 
reduce the marketing and distribution cost by £2.2m, 
while continuing to support our growth.
With growth, variable cost will increase as well.  
We have seen this especially in staff costs, airport  
and en-route charges and ground operations.
The focus on technical reliability and applying best 
Bombardier practices have resulted in a reduction of 
the maintenance cost by £1m from £22.3m to £21.3m.
As outlined below, Flybe benefited from fuel hedges 
unwinding through the year. The reduction was partly 
offset by capacity increases.
Cost per seat including fuel reduced by 4.2% from 
£54.97 to £52.67.
Cost per seat excluding fuel reduced by 2.3% from 
£44.72 to £43.67.
fuel
The spot price of fuel has seen a decline in 2015/16 
from $822/MT to $481/MT (42% reduction). Flybe 
has a hedging policy to protect itself from short-term 
fluctuations in spot prices, and so, in line with most 
other airlines, our net fuel price decreased by only 
13.7%. Our net fuel costs decreased by 3.7% (net of FX 
adjustments) to £101.6m (£105.5m in 2014/15) with a 
9.2% increase in volume of flights offsetting some of 
the fuel price saving. Aviation fuel prices remain liable 
to large and unpredictable movements due to a variety 
of external factors, including changes in supply and 
demand for oil and oil-related products.
During the year to 31st March 2016, Flybe UK used 
some 173,254 tonnes of jet fuel, an increase on 2014/15 
of 8% from 160,702 tonnes. The average market price 
during the year was USD470 per tonne (2014/15: 
USD807), with the Group paying a blended rate (net 
of hedges) of USD826 per tonne (2014/15: USD949). 
Including ‘into plane’ costs, Flybe’s fuel costs in 2015/16 
of £101.6m (2014/15: £105.5m) represent an all-in cost 
of USD911 per tonne for 2015/16 (2014/15: USD1,041). 
Using constant currency, our fuel costs per seat 
decreased by 12.2% from £10.24 to £9.00.
Flybe UK operates a policy of managing fuel price 
volatility by entering into derivative contracts 
representing a portion (between 60% and 90%) of  
its aviation fuel requirements a minimum of 12 months 
forward from the current date. The intention of this 
programme is to provide a significant element of 
certainty over its fuel costs for any forthcoming IATA

season. As at March 2016, 90% of the year’s fuel 
requirement to March 2017 was hedged at an average 
price of USD569 per tonne. Further details are given 
in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Taking into account our hedged position, each USD50 
increase/decrease in the price of jet fuel reduces/
improves Group profits in 2016/17 by £0.6m.
n et finance costs
Net finance costs improved by £4.9m mainly due 
to a £7.4m non-cash, non-underlying movement 
on the retranslation of US dollar denominated debt 
used to fund the acquisition of aircraft, from a loss of 
£10.2m in 2014/15 to a loss of £2.8m in 2015/16. The 
movement in this US dollar liability cannot be naturally 
offset against the value of the aircraft as the latter is 
recorded in pounds sterling in order to comply with 
the requirements of International Financial Reporting 
Standards. This income statement charge of £2.8m  
has therefore been removed in arriving at adjusted 
profit before tax. Other finance costs increased 
by £2.5m including the release of £(0.3)m interest 
receivable and £1.5m recycling of foreign exchange 
losses on Flybe Finland.
f oreign exchange
The Group foreign currency hedging policy has an 
objective to reduce the volatility of costs. Flybe 
manages its foreign exchange positions based on 
its net foreign currency exposure, being foreign 
currency expenditure less associated revenue. Flybe 
UK currently has a relatively small net exposure to the 
euro, but has significant US dollar costs in relation to 
fuel, maintenance, aircraft operating leases and loan 
repayments. The Group generates no significant US 
dollar revenue and actively manages its US dollar 
position through a foreign exchange forward purchase 
programme similar to that outlined for fuel. As at 
31st March 2016, 90% of our anticipated US dollar 
requirements for the year to 31st March 2017 were 
hedged at an average exchange rate of USD1.5079.  
All existing derivative financial instruments are forward 
swap arrangements.
Taking into account our hedged position, each 
USD0.05 reduction/improvement in the US dollar 
exchange rate has the effect of reducing/increasing 
Flybe UK’s profits in 2016/17 by approximately £0.7m.
Carbon emissions
The Group is required to purchase carbon allowances 
for all flights departing from and arriving into the EU 
in order to offset its carbon footprint in each calendar 
year. Flybe manages its exposure by purchasing carbon 
emissions allowances through a forward purchase 
programme to top up the free allowances awarded to 
it under the scheme. The table below sets out Flybe 
UK’s emissions and carbon allowances for each of the 
periods under review:

fas
In November 2014 we created FAS, a stand-alone 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business 
which includes the MRO business that was part 
of Flybe Limited. The results for FAS in 2015/16 
(combined MRO and FAS for 2014/15) were as follows:

Profit before tax 2.5 2.3 8.7%
Revenue increased by 4.9% in 2015/16 to £42.8m 
(2014/15: £40.8m), of which £22.8m was for third 
party customers (2014/15: £23.2m). This increase 
was driven by the 2.6% increase in man-hours from 
534,000 in 2014/15 to 548,000 in 2015/16. The 
increase in revenue generating capacity led to a 4.7% 
increase in operating costs from £38.5m to £40.3m. 
FAS, despite being loss making in H1 as a result of 
delays of third party work from H1 to H2 and a focus 
on E195 solution preparation, increased its profitability 
by 8.7% to £2.5m for the full year.
group costs
Group costs of £5.8m (2014/15: £3.6m) include 
Group Board salary costs and Group related legal 
and professional fees. The increase year-on-year is 
primarily due to an accrual for a staff bonus of £2.4m 
(2014/15: £nil). The reduction in Group Board costs in 
the year has been offset by higher adviser, legal and 
professional fees.

(2014/15:£7.6m excluding the movement in restricted 
cash of £22.5m). See cash flow statement on page 85 for 
the breakdown of cash inflow from operating activities. 
Largely due to further negotiations, the restricted cash 
was reduced by £10.2m. £10.0m was due to reduction 
in the restricted cash for our card acquiring merchants 
and £0.2m due to changes in exchange rates on our 
outstanding restricted cash balances.
Financing activities of £14.1m included £12.8m of

and £0.8m of interest received, (2014/15: £6.5m 
including net borrowings of £7.0m and £0.5m of net

The £192.3m of net book value of aircraft represents 
owned aircraft, engines and aircraft modifications.  
The increase of £25.9m is mainly due to the purchase 
of three aircraft at £24.4m.
Net funds, representing cash offset by debt, at 31st 
March 2016 of £62.2m (2015: £76.7m) has reduced as 
outflows related to the purchase of three aircraft for 
£24.4m in February 2016. Net funds at 31st March 2016 
includes restricted cash of £7.8m (£18.0m at 31st March 
2015) which represents, predominantly, cash deposits 
held in favour of aircraft owners to secure operating 
lease arrangements. 
The mark-to-market valuation of derivative financial 
instruments increased from a liability of £7.2m at 
31st March 2015 to a liability of £9.9m at 31st March 2016,  
as foreign exchange rates and fuel prices moved 
against Flybe’s portfolio of contracts. Net negative 
other working capital increased from £(115.6)m to 
£(123.5)m, largely due to the increase in trade and 
other payables. 
The balance sheet also includes the impact of the 
defined benefit pension scheme deficit of £15.3m 
which is included in other non-current assets and 
liabilities above. This scheme, which is closed to future 
benefit accrual, had been in deficit by £21.0m at March 
2015. The year-on-year decrease of £5.7m in the deficit 
is primarily due to the change in the discount rates.  
A recovery plan of £0.5m contribution per annum from 
Flybe was agreed as part of the last actuarial review in 
2013. A new valuation commenced in March 2016.
Covenants
The Group has certain financial performance 
covenants in relation to some of its aircraft financing 
agreements. These specify performance, depending 
on the contractual terms, against a series of tests, 
which are performed either quarterly, half-yearly or 
annually. Flybe has met all the terms of the covenants 
tested since the inception of the arrangements to 
31st March 2016 (see note 22 to the consolidated 
financial statements).
Country and currency risk
Flybe’s UK business operates in a global marketplace. 
Most of Flybe’s customers are based in Europe, 
although the MRO business also has customers from 
Africa, the Middle East and the central Asian republics. 
Most of Flybe’s revenues are derived from UK-based 
customers (about 85% of Group revenue). Aircraft are 
bought and sold in US dollars as are other key costs 
such as fuel, lease costs, maintenance and aviation 
insurance. Airport and enroute charges are payable 
in a mix of sterling and euros and an expansion into 
Europe will mean greater exposure to euro revenues 
and costs. This is further considered in the Risks and 
Uncertainties section on pages 28 to 31 and note 34 
‘Financial instruments’.

Strategic report
going concern
Flybe’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position, are set out in the Chairman’s and Chief 
Executive Officer’s statements on pages 2 to 7.  
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and 
liquidity position, and events since the balance sheet 
date are described in the financial performance section 
of that statement on page 113 and in the Financial 
Review on pages 20 to 27. In addition, note 34 covers 
Flybe’s financial risk management objectives, details  
of its financial instruments and hedging activities and 
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Flybe had free cash balances of £163.6m at 31st 
March 2016, and has met all of its operating lease 
commitments and debt repayments as they have fallen 
due during the year.
Flybe faces trading risks presented by current 
economic conditions in the aviation sector, particularly 
in relation to passenger volumes and yields and the 
associated profitability of individual routes.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices 
and foreign exchange rates. The Group’s policy is to 
hedge between 60% and 90% of estimated exposures 
12 months in advance. As of 31st May 2016, we had 
purchased 90% of our anticipated fuel requirements 
and 90% of our anticipated US dollar requirements  
for 2016/17.
The Group increasingly purchases aircraft outright 
rather than leasing, and has access to a loan facility  
to part fund such purchases as described on page 113 – 
post balance sheet event note.
The directors have prepared a detailed trading budget 
and cash flow forecast for a period which covers at 
least 12 months after the date of approval of these 
financial statements. Having considered the forecasts 
and making other enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that Flybe has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual financial statements.
viability statement
The directors have assessed Flybe’s viability over a 
three-year period to March 2019. While the board 
believes that the Company will be viable over a longer 
period, three years is the period considered most 
appropriate to form a reasonable expectation of the 
Company’s viability. This period is supported by the 
three-year business plan enabling the forecasting 
assumptions to be aligned.
In making their assessment, the directors took account 
of Flybe’s current financial and operational positions. 
They also assessed the potential financial and 
operational impacts, in severe but plausible scenarios, 
associated with the principal Risks and Uncertainties 
set out on page 28 and the likely effect on the 
Company’s prospects and viability.
Based on this assessment, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group will be able to continue to operate, meet all their 
liabilities as they fall due and have a viable business 
model during the three-year period to March 2019.
In making this statement, the directors have also made 
the following key assumptions on the basis that it 
would not be meaningful to attempt to measure the 
impact of major events occurring in these areas:
> > Funding for capital expenditure in the form of capital 
markets debt, bank debt, or aircraft leases will 
remain available;
> > There will not be a prolonged grounding of the Flybe 
fleet or a substantial proportion thereof; and
> > There will not be a significant change in government 
regulation.

s afety and security management
Flybe continues to demonstrate its commitment to 
developing, implementing and constantly improving 
strategies and processes aiming to deliver our aviation 
activities to the highest level of safety and security 
performance, while delivering our services against the 
corporate goals.
Flybe’s Safety Promise recognises that safety and 
security are everyone’s personal responsibility whether 
a colleague, customer, contractor, visitor or supplier.  
All employees are accountable for the Group’s safety 
and security performance. In addition, managers 
ensure that our Safety Policy is implemented and 
understood by all employees and contractors. 
New reporting processes and systems have been 
implemented and company-wide encouragement 
has been given to all group members and service 
partners to further increase hazard and near-miss 
safety reporting. The increase in reporting has led 
to improved information in identifying hazards, 
quantifying the risks associated with these and 
taking actions to eliminate or mitigate these risks  
to acceptable levels. 
All personnel are encouraged to report any safety 
or security issue, irrespective of the cause, in the 
knowledge that Flybe operates in an open, fair and 
balanced way – a ‘Just Culture’ – with all incidents 
investigated objectively and thoroughly.
The priority of safety and security within Flybe was 
further demonstrated through the formation of a 
separate, and independent, Safety and Security 
Department during the year, headed by a new Director 
of Safety and Security. This team provides safety 
investigation, compliance monitoring (auditing), 
security management, flight data monitoring and 
health and safety expertise under one department. 
Key safety and security interfaces include the safety 
and quality management processes within the Flybe 
Aviation Services maintenance organisation, as well as 
other service providers.
The Flybe Safety and Security Committee (SSC), 
chaired by Sir Timo Anderson, an independent Non-
Executive Director, meets quarterly and is charged 
with holding the operational executive management 
team to account for all safety, security and compliance 
matters, reporting directly to the Board.

SAFETY PROMISE 
 
© Flybe 2016 Company Confidential & Proprietary 1 
Safety with no compromises is one of our core values.  
 
Everyone at Flybe promises to: 
•  Identify and report risks, ‘near misses’ and hazards before they become incidents. 
•  Report openly any safety event. 
•  Understand the risk to themselves and others before engaging in a task. 
•  Work as one Purple team to improve continuously our safety culture and 
performance. 
 
We pledge to support everyone reporting safety concerns; only if someone has acted 
recklessly, maliciously, or negligently would disciplinary action be considered; in such 
cases, the fact that a person has made a report will be taken into account.

Strategic report
The Flybe Safety Management System (SMS) co-
ordinates all safety activity across the Flybe operation. 
This allows safety data derived from both normal 
operations and safety events to be used in the review 
of operational procedures and training. The SMS is 
reviewed on a monthly basis at the Safety and Security 
Action Group chaired by the Accountable Manager, 
Flybe’s Chief Operations Officer, Luke Farajallah. The 
effectiveness of the SMS is reviewed at the Safety and 
Security Review Board which is chaired by the Chief 
Executive Officer, Saad Hammad.
Flybe as a member of IATA is required to maintain 
International Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) 
accreditation. The airline underwent its IOSA renewal 
audit during May 2015 and has subsequently had its 
accreditation extended to September 2017, having been 
on the registry since 2007. IOSA utilises internationally 
recognised standards and recommended practices 
(totalling more than 900) against which the airline is 
audited to demonstrate Flybe has both documented 
procedures and implemented practices.
Compliance monitoring (quality assurance) 
management
The establishment and maintenance of an effective 
compliance monitoring function ensures not only an 
effective and efficient operation, but also a safe one. 
The internal compliance monitoring function oversees 
all operational activity and consists of two teams. 
The first is dedicated to the airline, covering:
> > the Air Operator’s Certificate;
> > Approved Training Organisation;
> > EASA Part M, aircraft continuing airworthiness; and
> > Part 21J, for a design organisation. 
The second team is dedicated to the Flybe Aviation 
Services (FAS) maintenance organisation and covers:
> > Part 145, for an aircraft maintenance organisation;
> > Part 147, for an engineering licence type training 
organisation; and
> > Part 21G, for a production organisation.
Both the airline compliance monitoring manager and 
the FAS quality manager have a direct line of report 
to their respective accountable managers who have 
overall responsibility for the safe operation of Flybe and 
FAS activities under civil aviation legislation in the UK.
Health and safety management
The health and safety of customers, employees and 
contractors of Flybe receives equal focus, and as 
much attention as any other aspect of the business 
operations. Flybe has a commitment to deliver 
the highest level of quality in health and safety 
management. Flybe’s goal is for zero avoidable 
accidents to its workforce and customers. The Flybe 
management team continues to demonstrate its 
commitment to health and safety through proactive 
initiatives and close liaison with staff and union safety 
representatives. Managers undergo training in their 
roles and responsibilities in relation to health  
and safety. 
Health and safety is incorporated into the Flybe SMS 
and overseen by the Flybe Health & Safety Committee, 
which itself reports ultimately into the SSC. Flybe’s 
policy for health and safety is defined in the Health, 
Safety & Environment manual. In turn this shapes 
the procedures throughout the organisation which 
define how the policy is implemented within each 
department. The policies and procedures are drawn up 
with the involvement of union safety representatives 
and Flybe’s People team, and are subject to oversight 
by the Flybe Health & Safety Committee. 
During the year, all Flybe colleagues have been 
undertaking Purple Safety Training, an in-house 
training course, as part of the initiative to heighten 
awareness of hazards and their risks. This has 
supported a co-ordinated approach to all aspects of 
safety, security and health and safety management 
processes across the group. 
o ur people
As at 31st March 2016, Flybe employed 2,262 
employees across 10 regional UK bases. More than 20% 
of our UK employees worked part-time or flexibly to 
balance their lifestyle needs and now more than 55% of 
our employees have more than five years’ service, with 
an average attendance rate of more than 95%. 
People engagement
Flybe is only as good as the quality and engagement 
of its people. Our people strategy is to have the right 
people in the right jobs and to make Flybe an attractive 
workplace in which a long-term career can be built on 
equality of opportunity. Flybe is proud to be one of the 
very few airlines that enables many of its employees to 
live where they work – locally, within the regions.

In October 2015 Flybe ran a simple art competition 
for children aged between 4 and 14, with prizes of 
flights and a seven day holiday for the winner and 
their family up for grabs. The competition received 
entries from all over the UK from children young and 
old with entries visually interpretating the joy and 
fun of travelling by plane to see friends and family, of 
exploring the UK or flying on holiday with Flybe. The 
overall winner was four year old Meg Clark from Kent.
Meg and her family were invited to Flybe’s Exeter HQ 
to collect her prize and received a big surprise when 
an aircraft decorated with her picture was revealed! 
Seeing her picture blown up to fit the length of a 
jet was a wonderful birthday present as by a happy 
coincidence she was celebrating turning five that day.
Flybe chose Meg’s drawing as we felt it was a 
delightfully simple, innocent and joyful painting that 
perfectly represented not only the fun and passion 
of our own Purple brand but also the sentiments of 
hope behind Cancer Research UK’s Kids & Teens.
The jet with the special livery is currently flying families 
like the Clarks around Europe with Meg’s beautiful 
design on display for all to see, raising awareness 
of the wonderful work that Cancer Research UK is 
doing in the fight to beat cancer sooner.

Strategic report
We have adopted purple, not just as our new 
brand colour, but also as a signifier of a new set of 
behavioural norms within the organisation designed to 
maximise individual, team and business performance. 
These Purple norms are captured by the five Ps: People 
focus, Positivity, Performance driven, Playfulness and 
Passion. All employees and business partners have 
been trained through a structured engagement in the 
‘Purple Way’. 
As well as the Purple Way, we have launched a number 
of initiatives over the past 12 months to engage our 
people effectively, make Flybe a great place to work 
and reinforce the cultural change we are seeking. 
These include: 
> > Our second annual employee satisfaction survey. 
More than 57% of employees participated in the 
survey which reflects a 1% increase from 2014/15, 
providing a depth of insight which will inform and 
shape our people strategy as we move forward 
into 2016/17. The engagement of our people was 
measured at 63%, which reflects an 8 percentage 
point increase versus 2014/15.
> > Purple Heroes recognition scheme. This rewards 
our people for going the extra mile. During the year 
169 employees have become Purple Heroes with 
nominations from fellow colleagues.
> > Employee ‘Thank You’ events. During the year, we 
held two employee events: one in the Summer and 
one in the Winter to thank our employees for all of 
their hard work.
> > Continuous training initiatives including the Purple 
Managers Programme, a leadership course for 
managers and Purple Safety training in addition to 
the roll-out of annual objectives and appraisals to all 
office-based staff.
> > A two year pay deal across the Company (excluding 
senior management, whose pay was frozen). 
> > A base visit and back-to-the-floor programme for all 
directors, bi-monthly ‘Ask Saad’ CEO question time 
calls, a monthly CEO newsletter and a cascade of 
quarterly business updates via the Purple Leadership 
Team. Continued feedback to issues raised on the 
Purple Concierge staff helpline and via PurpleNet, 
our staff intranet.
> > Active senior management engagement with 
recognised unions and also with representatives of 
non-unionised staff.
> > Crew lifestyle improvement: While we need to do 
more in this area, we have made a start e.g. night 
stopping has been significantly reduced and we 
have improved the quality of crew food. We are 
also increasing our recruitment intensity given the 
current world-wide pilot shortage and bringing in 
third party capacity where appropriate to improve 
roster stability.
employee communication
Flybe continues to focus on active two-way 
communications with its dispersed workforce through 
line management. During the year five ‘Ask Saad’ CEO 
conference calls were held where all employees had 
direct access to ask the CEO and Board questions 
on any relevant topic. ‘Ask Saad’ has now become a 
bi-monthly event, complementing regular email and 
intranet updates, as well as a monthly CEO newsletter. 
In the UK, in addition to active engagement with 
its recognised trade union partners, Flybe uses its 
consultative body known as Open Channel for non-
unionised staff. Open Channel meets quarterly, is 
chaired by a member of the Executive Committee and 
is attended by up to 15 elected representatives.
Senior management has continued with back-to-the-
floor sessions as well as regular base visits across our 
network to engage with our people. In addition to this, 
our Purple Leadership Team meets on a regular basis 
to discuss, share and agree on the dissemination of 
information and key messages to our people. 
Benefits
Flybe aims to provide fixed and variable pay and short- 
and long-term benefits (including insured benefits) 
that, in the round, are affordable, competitive in the 
marketplace, performance-led and flexible. 
What the five Ps entail:
> > People focus = having empathy or putting 
oneself in the shoes of the other person and 
being caring with customers and colleagues alike
> > Positivity = having a can-do attitude and being 
optimistic and enthusiastic
> > Performance driven = being totally committed 
to key business and personal objectives and 
acting systematically to deliver these
> > Playfulness = having fun and being light-hearted 
without sacrificing safety or performance or 
causing offence
> > Passion = embracing the job and Company 
direction with a commitment to excel and go the 
extra mile where possible

Group Personal Pension Plan and more than 90% of 
employees have elected to participate and benefit from 
employer’s contributions to their personal fund. Flybe 
has salary sacrifice schemes to include pensions, and 
buying extra days off work and child-care vouchers.
In addition to this, we have also launched ‘Purple Take 
Off’, which is an online employee benefits portal where 
our employees can find attractive discounts and offers 
to help them save money on a range of products and 
services.
Development of our people
To engage a dispersed workforce, line management 
has been empowered to lead and the majority of 
our people managers attended a ‘Purple Managers’ 
development programme during 2015. In addition,  
a number of training programmes were launched  
or run during the year, including Flybe Loves Service 
and Purple Safety Training.
Flybe has also continued an annual performance 
management system for non-crew staff as well as an 
annual talent review and a succession planning process 
as part of its commitment to developing key talent, 
irrespective of religion, sex or ethnicity.
Human rights
Flybe operates entirely with staff employed in the 
EU and consequently has not developed a separate, 
human rights policy. Detailed policies and procedures 
exist, among others, around:
> > equality and diversity (see below);
> > grievances;
> > disciplinary procedures;
> > whistle-blowing;
> > harassment and bullying; and
> > bribery.
In addition, Flybe uses its relationship with its employees 
to raise, air and resolve issues, whether this is through 
‘Ask Saad’, Open Channel or its established, recognised 
trade unions.
During the year Flybe also launched an Employee 
Assistance Programme with a confidential helpline 
available with free advice on legal, health-related and 
financial issues.

equality and diversity
Equality of opportunity and valuing diversity are central to the regional activities of Flybe and it aims to ensure 
that all employment decisions are based on fairness and merit.
Applications for employment by an individual from any background, including disabled persons, are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that appropriate 
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of 
other employees.

Strategic report
Flybe has been the main shirt sponsor of Exeter City 
Football Club since 2002, meaning that is is now the 
longest running corporate shirt sponsorship in the 
football league.
In January 2016 the Club was drawn to play an FA 
Cup replay match against Liverpool so Flybe pulled 
out all the stops to ensure that the team and its 
supporters could travel to Liverpool ’faster than road 
or rail’ for the much anticipated game. 
Having overcome all the logistical challenges and 
made the necessary operational changes, Flybe 
made one of its E195 jet aircraft available for a 
special charter flight to make the convenient ‘day 
return’ flight direct from Exeter to Liverpool. This 
enabled the team to travel quickly in comfort without 
the need to travel 4-5 hours by coach immediately 
prior to taking to the pitch for this important fixture – 
and to return home again after the match.
To enable supporters to make the 374-mile round trip 
quicker and easier then travelling by road or rail, Flybe 
offered a limited time return fare to ensure as many as 
possible could make the historic trip to Anfield.

environment
Flybe has always made a commitment to environmental 
sustainability and operates one of the most 
environmentally sensitive fleets in aviation. Our goal  
is to reduce both noise and emissions for each flight. 
Although aviation accounts for around 2% of global 
CO 2 emissions, Flybe is committed to being an 
industry leader in minimising its environmental impact 
wherever possible while continuing to provide vital air 
services to our customers. Flybe’s main aircraft, the 
Bombardier Q400, is one of the most environmentally 
efficient ways to travel and we are proud to be at the 
forefront of the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce the 
environmental impact of air travel. The Q400 aircraft 
is as fuel-efficient as an eco-friendly car on a per-
seat basis. The Q400 aircraft uses less fuel, produces 
fewer emissions and is quieter than similar capacity jet 
aircraft, in some cases by up to 40%.
In this respect, Flybe’s policy continues to:
> > commit to a system for managing its environmental 
impact in order to comply with all applicable current 
legislation and, where practical, seek to meet future 
legislative requirements ahead of relevant deadlines;
> > implement training programmes for staff to enhance 
environmental awareness, constantly informing  
and motivating colleagues, to enlist their support  
in improving Flybe’s performance; and
> > integrate the Company’s environmental objectives 
into business decisions, where feasible, in a cost-
efficient manner.
Waste and energy management remains a key focus 
area for Flybe. Recycling policies are already in place  
at all major premises. 
Management of buildings has incorporated, wherever 
possible, environmentally friendly techniques such 
as rainwater harvesting and a ‘living’ roof on part 
of the Flybe Training Academy site. There is also a 
programme to replace light fittings in the offices 
and hangars with LED lighting as these become 
unserviceable.
Aircraft impact upon the environment in two key areas: 
locally at airports and over the course of a journey. 
In 2007, Flybe introduced an ‘Ecolabel’ rating for its 
aircraft which was designed to provide customers with 
a range of information regarding the noise and carbon 
emissions for each flight. The label identifies the noise 
rating and also the carbon emissions made during the 
normal take-off and landing cycle of a flight, as well 
as the carbon emissions for the total flight based on a 
range of distances.
energy s avings o pportunity s cheme (‘esos ’)
As part of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) 
the UK government introduced the ESOS which is 
a mandatory scheme for large organisations. The 
scheme is administered by the Environment Agency 
and applies throughout the UK and focuses on energy 
assessment and energy saving identification.
As part of the scheme Flybe has contracted a third 
party ‘ESOS Energy’ which has conducted a two stage 
audit of Flybe’s energy use and identified opportunities 
for potential energy saving. These opportunities are 
being assessed by an in-house team for their potential 
implementation.
f uel usage and emissions
The airline’s Flight Efficiency Programme, successfully 
introduced in 2009, has resulted in a 13.4% reduction 
over the average in-flight fuel burn before the 
programme was launched and continues to be a major 
area of focus for the Company. The programme relies 
on finely tuned strategies to reduce fuel consumption. 
These include lowering the aircraft’s maximum 
operational cruise speed by an average of 20 knots 
and optimising performance during each phase of 
flight (climb profile, approach from cruise altitude, low 
speed descent and auxiliary power unit use). There are 
also tankering strategies in place for refuelling from the 
lowest-cost vendor. 
A further development has been the use of single 
engine taxi-ing across the fleet to both economise on 
fuel burn and lower emissions.
While CO 2 emissions are identified as the primary 
contributor to global warming, other pollutants are 
also harmful to the environment and have dedicated 
limitations regulated by the International Civil Aviation 
Organisation (‘ICAO’). 
emissions t rading s cheme (‘ets’)
Since the introduction of aviation into the European 
ETS on 1 January 2012, Flybe has complied fully 
with the requirements of the scheme to submit an 
independently verified report of its CO 2 emissions 
and purchase equivalent carbon allowances under the 
scheme to offset its carbon footprint.

supplementary to, the European ETS. It remains 
concerned about the imposition of specific aviation 
taxes, some of which purport to be linked to 
environmental objectives. Flybe has campaigned for 
some time for the reform of UK Air Passenger Duty  
and for the per passenger tax to be replaced with a  
per plane tax which is linked to aircraft emissions and 
deployment. 
greenhouse gas (‘gHg’) emissions report
The directors of Flybe Group plc present the 
greenhouse gas emissions report for the Group 
for the year ended 31st March 2016. Flybe’s GHG 
emissions data is intended to comply with the 
reporting requirements of the Climate Change Act 
2008. Emissions include all data reported from its sole 
operating subsidiary, Flybe Limited, and 60% of data 
reported by our former joint venture partner, Flybe 
Finland, to the end of October 2014, using the financial 
control approach.
The information presented follows the 2013 UK 
government environmental reporting guidance. The 
Group has also adopted the GHG Protocol Value Chain 
(Scope 3) Standard, but Flybe is not as yet able to 
report on all categories that may be relevant. The 
figures relate to the required elements of each Scope 3 
category and some of the optional elements. 2013 
UK Government Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting were used in converting activity data into 
carbon emissions.

intensity measurements
The Group’s carbon emissions are principally made 
up of emissions from flying activities. In order to allow 
comparison between its peers, the chosen measurement 
is emissions per passenger kilometre flown. 
For 2015/16, the Group’s total emissions per passenger 
kilometre were 144.9 g/km (2014/15: 133.3 g/km).
Base year
Flybe has a fixed base year of 2014/15. This year was 
chosen as this was the first year for which Flybe has 
reliable data and is typical in respect of its operations. 
The Group’s policy on base year recalculation is to 
recalculate the base year and the prior year emissions 
for relevant significant changes which meet its 
significance threshold of base year emissions.
r ainwater harvesting
Flybe’s state-of–the-art Training Academy has a 
rainwater harvesting system for re-use within that 
building.

The Q400 is rightfully heralded as one of the quietest 
passenger turboprop aircraft in the world. Inside the 
Q400, the revolutionary Active Noise and Vibration 
Suppression system significantly reduces noise and 
vibration, making it as quiet and comfortable as a 
jet. Outside, it is considerably quieter than jets with 
a similar number of seats (10 decibels of exterior 
perceived noise quieter). 40 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
Chairman’s statement on corporate governance
simon l affin
Chairman
Dear s hareholder,
Flybe remains committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance, and will endeavour to 
continue to meet these standards at all times. 
We believe that it is an important component in 
achieving a high performing company that delivers 
value to its stakeholders, while taking account of our 
responsibilities to the wider community.
The board has reviewed its own structure and 
performance. We continue to believe that a small 
well-balanced board, with a high quality management 
team and a majority of committed, diverse, informed 
and energetic Non-Executive Directors, is the most 
effective leadership team for this Company. 
We reviewed our own performance, by asking directors 
to complete a questionnaire, followed by individual 
interviews with an external HR consultant, Andrea 
Gregory from People Business. Andrea also provides 
coaching to some of the Group board. She then 
presented her views to a full board meeting. The overall 
conclusion was that the board, while still relatively new, 
was settling down and becoming an effective team. 
It was agreed that directors remained independent in 
spirit and challenge, believing that both committee 
and non-executive meetings were effective, and that 
directors were kept well informed. The Non-Executive 
Directors are supportive to management, as well as 
challenging. There is a need to improve our succession 
planning process as well as to develop further our 
evaluation of directors’ contributions. One key 
recommendation was to seek a further non-executive 
appointment, especially to enhance further our board 
diversity. This is currently in hand.
a strong board
Committed to the highest standards  
of corporate governance.
“We believe that a small, well-
balanced board is the most 
effective leadership team for 
this company.” f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16  41
Governance
The other directors also reviewed my performance 
as Chairman. The feedback was that I was an 
effective leader of the board and board meetings, 
communicating well with, and supportive of, both the 
non-executives and management. It was suggested 
that there are some opportunities to improve further 
on communication.
We will continue to review our remuneration policies in 
the light of best practice and our shareholders’ views. 
Changes to our remuneration are listed in full in the 
Remuneration Committee Report.
Although not required to do so under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all directors will again 
submit themselves for re-election at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting (the ‘AGM’).
Board focus
  The Board focuses on key tasks, which 
include receiving reports on health, safety and 
security, business risks, long-term strategy, 
the Group’s trading performance, the work 
of its committees and the key actions of the 
Executive Committee and senior management.
  To enable the Board to function effectively 
and to assist the directors to discharge their 
responsibilities, a comprehensive set of papers 
is provided in advance of each Board and 
Committee meeting. These include regular 
business progress reports, budgets, financial 
statements and shareholder information. 
  The Board held nine scheduled meetings during 
the year. 
  The executive directors review and discuss with 
the Board all strategic projects and all material 
matters currently or prospectively affecting the 
Group and its performance. 
All shareholders are very much encouraged to attend 
the AGM in July where the directors will be available 
to meet shareholders directly and to discuss any 
matters of importance to them. Additional materials 
such as annual and interim reports, results and other 
announcements are available via Flybe’s website at 
www.flybe.com/en/corporate/investors.
The strategic report has been approved by the Board 
on 8th June 2016.

Governance
This report sets out how the Company applied 
the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2012 (the ‘Code’) in the year to 31st March 
2016. The Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules 
require the Company to set out how it has applied the 
main principles of the Code and to explain any non-
compliance. A copy of the Code can be found at  
www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode. 
statement of compliance 
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance and has fully 
considered the provisions of the Code. The Board 
considers that the Company is a ‘smaller company’ 
for the purposes of the Code which defines this as 
a company which has been below the FTSE350 
throughout the year immediately prior to the reporting 
year. Throughout the year ended 31st March 2016, 
and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report, 
the Board considers that it and the Company have 
complied with the best practice provisions set out in 
the Code as it applies to ‘smaller companies’. 
The following paragraphs explain how the Company 
has applied the principles of good governance and the 
code of best practice set out in the Code.

Corporate governance 
continued
The Board is led by the Chairman, Simon Laffin, 
who is responsible for ensuring its effectiveness in 
all aspects of its role. The Board’s key purpose is to 
provide the leadership and vision necessary to ensure 
the Company’s prosperity by collectively directing 
the Company’s affairs while meeting the appropriate 
interests of its shareholders and stakeholders. The 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
meet regularly with analysts, brokers and key investors. 
The Chairman and non-executive directors have met 
key shareholders and the Board receives analyst and 
broker briefings. The Board has consulted shareholders 
on remuneration issues. In addition to business and 
financial issues, the Board of Directors must deal with 
challenges and issues relating to corporate governance, 
corporate social responsibility and corporate ethics. 
It has the ultimate responsibility for setting the 
Company’s overall strategy and long-term direction 
and applies governance within a framework of effective 
controls which permit risk to be assessed and managed. 
The Board has responsibility for approving the financial 
statements, significant acquisitions and disposals, major 
non-recurring projects and major capital expenditures.
The directors’ biographies appear on pages 42 and 43 
and illustrate the range of experience which ensures an 
effective board to lead and control the Group. Further 
details of changes to the membership of the Board are 
given on page 49. We continue to believe that a small 
well-balanced board, with a high quality management 
team and a majority of committed, diverse, informed 
and energetic non-executive directors, is the most 
effective leadership team for this Company. The 
directors have a complementary range of financial,

experience which, in the opinion of the Board, provides 
it and its committees with the necessary balance of 
skills, diversity, independence and knowledge of the 
Group to enable them to discharge their respective 
duties and responsibilities effectively.
The Company has governance procedures in place to 
ensure that, on resignation, concerns, if any, raised by 
an outgoing non-executive director are circulated by 
the Chairman to the remaining members of the Board. 
No concerns were raised during the year..
Key activities of the Board
Aside from day-to-day management issues, the Board 
has focused on: 
> > the resolution of the legacy Embraer E195 issue, with 
agreements being reached with regional airports to 
operate E195s for particular routes; 
> > new White Label activity, operating aircraft on 
routes for SAS;
> > a new franchise agreement with Blue Islands, 
operating routes to the Channel Islands, effective 
April 2016;
> > purchase of three currently leased Q400 aircraft;
> > IT strategy, organisation and investments;
> > network development strategy;
> > people engagement; and 
> > safety culture.
In addition, the Board has supported the management 
team in its second full year of the three-year 
turnaround, in which the underlying performance of 
the business has significantly improved.
o peration of the Board
In carrying out its work, the Board focuses on key 
tasks, which include receiving reports on safety, 
security and health, business risks, long-term 
strategy, the Group’s trading performance, the work 
of its Committees and the actions of the Executive 
Committee and senior management. The Board 
delegates specific responsibilities, with written terms 
of reference, to its Committees, details of which appear 
below. The executive directors of the Company may 
attend meetings of the Committees at the invitation of 
the respective Chairmen.
The executive directors review and discuss with the 
Board all strategic projects and all material matters 
currently or prospectively affecting the Group and 
its performance. The Board delegates its authority 
for executive management to the Chief Executive 
Officer, who leads the Executive Committee, subject to 
monitoring by the Board and those items referred to 
above.
To enable the Board to function effectively, and to 
assist the directors to discharge their responsibilities, 
a comprehensive set of papers is provided in advance 
of each Board and Committee meeting. These include 
regular business progress reports, budgets, financial 
statements and shareholder information. The Company 
Secretary manages the provision of information to the 
Board in consultation with the Chairman.
The Board held nine scheduled meetings during the year, 
which all directors attended. One of those occasions was 
incorporated within a two day strategy session. 
The Board requires all directors to devote sufficient 
time to their duties and to use their best endeavours 
to attend meetings. The table on page 48 details the 
directors’ attendance at the scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings during the year.  48 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16

independence
The Board considers each of its non-executive 
directors to be independent in character and 
judgement and no one individual, or group of 
individuals, dominates the Board’s decision-making.
Each of the non-executive directors who served during 
the year has been identified as independent on the 
basis of the criteria specified in paragraph A.3.1 of the 
Code and, generally, is free from any business or other 
relationship which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement.
Diversity 
All recruitment for the Board is led by the Nomination 
Committee. There have been no new appointments 
during the year. We recognise that diversity, in 
its widest sense, is important for the Board’s 
effectiveness. However, the non-executive directors 
have been appointed on merit alone and specifically 
for their contributions from their knowledge and 
experience. Their wide-ranging experience and 
backgrounds ensure that they can debate matters 
in relation to both the development of strategy and 
performance against the objectives set by the Board. 
We believe that the diverse backgrounds of the 
individual directors ensure we have a Board with the 
optimum combination of skills and experience needed 
to support the business. As a result, no targets have 
been established for the composition of the Board, 
whether in terms of racial background or gender.
Overall information on the gender diversity of the 
Board and the Group as a whole is given on page 36.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board 
to consider and, if thought fit, to authorise actual 
or potential conflicts of interest which may arise 
and to impose such limits or conditions as it thinks 
fit. The Board has established a formal procedure 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of interest can 
be recorded by each director and authorised by the 
Board. The decision to authorise a conflict can only be 
made by non-conflicted directors (those who have no 
interest in the matter being considered) and in making 
such a decision the directors must act in a way they 
consider in good faith will be most likely to promote 
the Company’s success.
Directors’ indemnity and insurance cover
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, throughout the year the directors have 
been, and continue to be, indemnified to the fullest 
extent permitted by law. Appropriate Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance cover is arranged and 
maintained via the Company’s insurance brokers, Willis 
Towers Watson, and its terms are reviewed annually.

matters reserved for the Board
The Board has approved a schedule of matters 
reserved for decision by it. This schedule is available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office 
and on the Company’s website at www.flybe.com/

specific approval by the Board can be subdivided into 
a number of key areas including but not limited to:
> > reviewing the Group’s overall safety and security 
arrangements;
> > approving the Group’s long-term objectives  
and strategy; 
> > approving the Group’s annual operating and capital 
expenditure budget;
> > Group financial reporting and controls including the 
approval of interim and final financial statements,

> > ensuring a sound system of internal controls and  
risk management;
> > decisions relating to acquisitions, disposals and 
major items of capital expenditure;
> > Board and Committee membership and succession 
planning;
> > remuneration;
> > corporate governance matters; and
> > approving certain Group policies including tax  
and treasury.
Matters requiring Board approval are generally the 
subject of a proposal by the executive directors 
submitted to the Board, together with supporting 
information, as part of the Board or Committee  
papers circulated prior to the relevant meeting. 
Board performance and evaluation 
The Board has considered and supports the Code’s 
provisions on Board performance evaluation. A self-
evaluation of the Board took place within the period 
assisted by an external consultant, who conducted 
interviews with all of the directors. The non-executive 
directors meet regularly without the executive 
directors present, and the Senior Independent Director 
also carried out a performance evaluation of the 
Chairman within the period.
induction and continuing development of directors
There were no new appointments to the Board during 
the year and so no new induction. The Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer are responsible for reviewing 
the development needs of individual directors. The 
use of an external coach has been offered to assist 
directors. All of the non-executive directors have,  
during the course of the year, received updates on best 
practice, as well as bringing knowledge and information 
gathered from their other business interests. 
All directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary who is responsible to 
the Chairman on matters of corporate governance 
and provides the Board with updates on relevant 
legislation, regulations and governance best practice. 
The directors may, at the Company’s expense, take 
independent professional advice where necessary and 
appropriate to do so.
Directors’ election and re-election
All directors will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. A 
biography for each of these directors, together with a 
description of the skills and experience they possess 
that the Company considers relevant, will be included 
in the proposals put to shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
None of the non-executive directors has served more 
than nine years in office. 
Any changes to the commitments of any director 
are always considered by the Board to ensure they 
will continue to have sufficient time to enable them 
to fulfil their duties to the Company. The Board is 
satisfied that all of the directors continue to perform 
effectively and demonstrate commitment to their 
roles, including commitment of time for Board and 
Committee meetings and any other duties which may 
be undertaken by them from time to time. 50 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
o perational management of the group
Beneath the Board there is in place a clear and appropriate apportionment of responsibilities among the senior 
managers designed to ensure that the business can be managed and monitored effectively. Senior managers 
report to the Executive Committee which in turn reports to the Board. The Executive Committee is led by the 
Chief Executive Officer and comprises the Executive Directors together with the Chief Operations Officer, Chief 
Revenue Officer, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer and the General Counsel and Company Secretary. It has 
responsibility for implementing on a day-to-day basis the strategy that has been agreed by the Board. Executive 
Committee members report regularly to the Board on key issues. The management structure of the Company as 
at 31st March 2016 was as below:
The Audit Committee held five scheduled meetings during 
the year. The attendance of the individual members at 
meetings is detailed in the table on page 48. 
The current members of the Audit Committee are David 
Kappler (Committee Chairman), Simon Laffin, Elizabeth 
McMeikan and Sir Timo Anderson. Charlie Scott 
resigned during the year. The Group Company Secretary 
acts as secretary for the Audit Committee.
David Kappler, a Chartered Accountant, chaired the 
Audit Committee throughout the year. The Board 
considers he has the appropriate recent and relevant 
experience to enable him to fulfil this role. In addition, 
Simon Laffin, who is also a qualified accountant, serves 
on the Audit Committee. The Board is satisfied that the 
members of the Audit Committee are those who are 
best able to contribute to its objectives. 
The Audit Committee conducts regular reviews of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management systems and internal control systems, 
including a detailed evaluation of the risk register 
and internal audit’s assurance plans, all internal audit 
reports and the plans dealing with information security 
and business continuity.
Further details about the Audit Committee can be 
found on pages 54 to 57.

Remuneration Committee. 
The Group’s compliance with the provisions of the 
Code relating to directors’ remuneration is further 
explained on pages 61 to 76.
The Remuneration Committee may request relevant 
executive directors and senior management to attend 
meetings by invitation. During the year under review, 
the Committee received material assistance from the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Head of People and 
Culture. No director is involved in decisions relating to 
their personal remuneration package.

on page 48. 
The Nomination Committee’s purpose is to establish 
a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new directors to the Board. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary of the 
Nomination Committee.
The Nomination Committee complies with the Code 
recommendations that the majority of members of 
the Nomination Committee should be independent 
non-executive directors. Throughout the period

Governance
The Board fully supports diversity, recognising the 
benefits that diverse viewpoints can contribute 
to decision-making. Directors are committed to 
encouraging all of the Group’s employees, and its 
Board, to reach their full potential, irrespective of their 
gender, race, or sexuality. The Board is very mindful of 
the benefits of a diverse Board. It does not, however, 
believe that setting a quota is the most appropriate 
method for achieving a balanced Board and all 
appointments are therefore made on merit. The Board 
remains committed to developing talent throughout 
the Group, and to providing training, support and 
development to those identified as displaying potential.
The terms and conditions of appointment of all 
of the non-executive directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours, and at the AGM. Each letter 
of appointment sets out clearly what is expected in 
the role, the anticipated level of time commitment 
including, where relevant, additional responsibilities 
derived from involvement in Board Committees. Details 
of other material commitments are disclosed to the 
Board and a register is maintained by the Company 
Secretary.
s afety and security Committee
The members of the Safety and Security Committee as 
at 31st March 2016 were Sir Timo Anderson (Committee 
Chairman) and Elizabeth McMeikan. The CEO has 
a permanent invitation to attend meetings and the 
Accountable Managers and individual post holders 
are requested to attend as required. The Safety and 
Security Committee met on four occasions during the 
year. The attendance of the individual Board members 
at meetings of the Safety and Security Committee is 
detailed in the table on page 48. 
The Safety and Security Committee’s purpose is to 
establish, review and monitor formal policies and 
procedures and have oversight of performance in 
connection with the safe and secure operation of the 
Group’s business. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary of the Safety and Security Committee.
The duties of the Safety and Security Committee 
include:
> > reviewing all matters concerned with the safe and 
secure operation of any aircraft operated by the 
Group, or joint venture partners operating under 
Flybe Group plc’s Air Operator Certificate, in the 
air or on the ground; ensuring that appropriate 
procedures and processes are in place; encourage 
an open reporting culture;
> > considering, and, if necessary call for, reports on 
incidents, including accidents, involving any aircraft 
operated by the Group, its franchisees or partners or 
joint venture partners. In cases involving the Group’s 
aircraft, the Committee will ensure that appropriate 
and recommended remedial action is taken, and, in 
any other cases, that appropriate recommendations 
are made to, and implemented by, relevant third 
parties;
> > considering, and if necessary call for, reports on 
significant incidents concerning safety at airports 
and in engineering facilities and ensure remedial 
action or appropriate recommendations are 
implemented;
> > ensuring compliance with airworthiness 
requirements and meet with the relevant authority 
on an annual basis;
> > ensuring compliance with health and safety 
legislation in all relevant jurisdictions through regular

Dear s hareholder,
I write this report having joined the Flybe Audit Committee 
in March 2015 and taken over the chairmanship from 
Charlie Scott in June last year. Many thanks are due to 
Charlie for his leadership of the Committee over many 
years. The Committee now comprises four members 
and has met five times during the year. It is our plan 
to add an additional meeting in the financial year 
2016/17 reflecting the increasing responsibilities of the 
Committee and allowing an occasional in-depth review 
of controls in a specific area of the business.
This year has again been a busy one for the Committee 
as it has focused on monitoring the changes being 
introduced by the Finance team to a range of systems 
and processes. These will all improve the control 
environment and efficiencies.
The Committee has particularly encouraged work on 
the internal controls against cyber crime by the internal 
audit department, as its prevalence around the world 
has markedly increased in recent years.
From a personal perspective, a strong professional 
relationship has been established with both the 
external and internal auditors, as well as with the key 
members of the Flybe finance team; and I thank them 
for their support during my induction period.
role
The primary function of the Audit Committee is to 
assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. 
This includes reviewing the financial reports and other 
financial information before publication. In addition, 
the Committee also reviews the systems of internal 
controls on a continuing basis, with respect to finance, 
accounting, risk management, compliance, fraud and 
audit that management and the Board have established.
The Committee also reviews the accounting and 
financial reporting processes; along with the roles and 
effectiveness of both the internal and external auditors. 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the annual and other accounts remains with the Board. 
r esponsibilities
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee, further 
details of which can be found in its terms of reference 
at www.flybe.com/en/corporate/governance include:
> > monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements and formal announcements relating to 
Flybe’s performance and reviewing any significant 
financial reporting issues and/or judgements 
contained therein;
> > keeping under review the consistency of, and any 
changes to, accounting policies, both on a year-to-
year basis and across the Group and challenging, 
where necessary, the Company’s financial 
statements;
> > reviewing, and challenging where necessary, the 
strategic and business reviews, and the corporate 
governance statement insofar as it relates to audit 
matters or risk management;
> > considering management’s response to any major 
external or internal audit recommendations;
> > reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and risk management systems;
> > monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit 
process including the appointment, cost and 
independence of the external auditor – see Auditor 
Independence on page 57;
> > developing and implementing policy on the 
engagement of the external auditor to supply non-
audit services; and
> > ensuring that clear and effective channels are 
maintained for communication between the external 
auditor and both the Audit Committee and the 
Group’s financial and senior management.
The Audit Committee undertakes its activities in line 
with an annual work plan designed to ensure that it 
meets its responsibilities under its terms of reference 
set by the Board. The Audit Committee agrees the 
scope of the external audit work and discusses the 
results of the full-year audit and half-year review with 
the external auditor, the Chief Financial Officer and 
Chief Executive Officer. The ultimate responsibility 
for reviewing and approving the annual and other 
accounts remains with the Board; however, the Audit 
Committee reviews these documents and discusses 
them with the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officers, particularly areas where there is subjectivity 
or the application of judgement, before making 
recommendations to the Board.

membership and attendees
The Audit Committee met on five occasions during 
2015/16. Details of the attendance at its meetings are 
set out in the table on page 48.
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
Group Financial Controller, Head of Internal Audit and 
Risk and representatives from the external auditor are 
invited to attend all meetings of the Audit Committee. 
The external auditors have a private session with the 
Committee at the end of each meeting. 
The Head of Internal Audit and Risk and the external 
auditors may also request a meeting with the Audit 
Committee Chair or any other members.
main activities of the Committee during the year
During the year the Audit Committee’s business has 
included the following items:
> > reviewing trading updates and interim management 
statements;
> > reviewing the effectiveness and terms and 
conditions of the committee;
> > full-year results, including review of the Annual 
Report to ensure it is fair, balanced and 
understandable;
> > principal judgemental accounting matters affecting 
the Group based on reports from both the Group’s 
management and the external auditors;
> > external audit plans and reports;
> > reviewing reports from the Head of Internal Audit 
and Risk; 
> > approval of the annual Internal Audit and Risk Plan;
> > reviewing internal controls, policies and procedures;
> > review of compliance with the Bribery Act 2010;
> > approval of the Treasury Policy;
> > reviewing the deferred tax position; and
> > reviewing the changes to Corporate Governance.
r eview of the a nnual r eport
The Committee examined, at the request of the Board, 
the Annual Report to determine whether it was fair, 
balanced and understandable. The Committee did 
this by gaining an understanding of the drafting 
and preparation process and the level of review and 
challenge introduced to ensure balance and accuracy. 
After its review of the process, consideration of 
management and auditor papers on the financial 
statements and the Annual Report and its own 
review of the Annual Report, the Audit Committee 
concluded that the Annual Report was fair, balanced 
and understandable and recommended that the Board 
approve it on those terms.
Following the publication of our 2015 Annual Report, 
we have had an interaction with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (FRC) Conduct Committee. We 
have been able to clarify a number of queries and 
have applied any relevant improvements in this Annual 
Report. Unfortunately we had included an incorrect 
classification of a loan impairment, linked to the Finnair 
JV, of £18.5m in our parent cash flow statement. This 
resulted in a reclassification, with no impact on either 
profit, net assets or cash. We have restated the parent 
cash flow for 2015/2016. Details of the restatement are 
in note 38, page 117.
r eview of business risk and its reporting in the 
financial statements
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
business are discussed on pages 28 to 31. The Board 
has responsibility for determining the nature and 
extent of the risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives and for oversight of the risk 
management process. Flybe has used the experience 
gained over many years to develop structures and 
processes to identify, evaluate, manage and report 
on the significant risks faced by the Group. These 
structures and processes, which are embedded within 
Flybe’s operations, have been in place throughout 
the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report. The Board is satisfied that these structures 
and processes ensure that risks are adequately and 
appropriately addressed and corrective actions taken.
Mitigating controls for the key risks in the Group are 
regularly reviewed and monitored for accuracy and 
completeness. These monitoring controls are reported 
to the Executive Committee monthly, outlining events 
and mitigating actions taken.
In addition to the work of this Committee, the Safety 
and Security Committee chaired by an independent 
Non-Executive Director, meets quarterly, or more 
regularly where events require, to review the Group’s 
safety performance. 56 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16

The purpose of these workshops has been to review 
enterprise-wide the likely risks to business objectives 
so that the Board can update its understanding of how 
well risks are understood and managed. The findings 
are recorded in a risk register along with their potential 
impact, the mitigations and controls currently in 
place, and recommendations, where possible, for risk 
reduction. 
The Audit Committee and the Board review the risk 
register at the year end and half year and will do so 
more frequently if necessary. 
Regarding the financial statements the Committee 
considered the following significant issues:
> > The accounting for the E195s as a result of the 
fleet optimisation programme, with the removal of 
surplus aircraft costs from the financial accounts 
and to correctly account for the remaining E195s
> > During the year Flybe took delivery of four Q400 
and one ATR aircraft and has handed back one E195. 
The aircraft have been classified as being held under 
operating leases.
> > How Flybe should account for its deferred tax 
position. Advice has been sought on this and 
recommendations were made in relation to the 
governing rule in IAS12.
> > Maintenance provisions have been reviewed and 
remain unchanged.
> > The provision for EU261 Passenger Delay Compensation 
has been reviewed and amended to ensure the 
assumptions are in line with historical expenses.
> > A verification exercise was completed on fixed 
assets with any amendments being reflected in  
the balance sheet. 
r isks identified
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted and whether management 
have made appropriate estimates and judgements. The 
Committee reviews accounting papers prepared by 
management which provide details on the main financial 
reporting judgements at both the half and full years. The 
Committee also reviews reports by the external auditor 
on the half-year and full-year results which highlight any 
issues that have arisen as a result of their work.
The significant issues considered in the year are 
detailed below, while the wider set of risks that impact 
on the business are shown on pages 28 to 31:
> > The Committee regularly reviewed the progress 
of the back office system transformation 
project. In doing so any risks associated with the 
implementation of the new systems were considered 
and fed back to the project team for consideration.
> > The reporting of the results of Project Blackbird and 
the accounting of the specific deals and also the 
risks involved with the solutions.
> > The Committee also reviewed the possibilities 
regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset.
> > Information Security was a continuous focus for the 
Committee; an independent review of the holistic 
information security landscape of the business 
was commissioned. Any findings from this report 
have been addressed by the Information Security 
Committee. During the year Flybe joined the 
Information Security Forum, which has provided 
the business with tools and insight into the latest 
developments in this area. 
internal audit
Internal audit is independent of business operations, 
undertaking an on-going programme to provide 
assurance on the adequacy of internal control and risk 
management processes across the Group’s operations. 
It is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the 
effectiveness of internal controls and risk management 
to the Audit Committee. The Committee approved 
the annual Internal Audit and Risk Plan, designed to 
provide effective risk based coverage over the internal 
control environment, for the coming year. The Head 
of Internal Audit and Risk attends the Committee 
meetings to present the findings of such reviews and 
reports on internal audit’s performance against the 
agreed annual internal audit plan, such plan being 
agreed during the year by the Committee.

Governance
In addition, the Audit Committee considers the report 
prepared by Deloitte LLP highlighting any matters 
identified in the course of its statutory audit work, which 
is reviewed by the Audit Committee in the presence 
of Deloitte LLP, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Head of Internal Audit and Risk.
external audit process
During the year, the Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the overall audit process including 
review of:
> > The Annual Report and financial statements to 
ensure they are fair, balanced and understandable;
> > Papers on critical judgements, internal control and 
fraud prepared by management;
> > External auditor papers detailing their audit plans as 
well as the results of their full-year audit and half-
year review;
> > The independence and effectiveness of the external 
audit itself.
It is standard practice for the external auditors to 
meet privately with the Audit Committees without any 
member of management or the executive directors 
being present, at least once each year.
As a result of its reviews, the Audit Committee was 
able to recommend the reappointment of Deloitte LLP 
to the Board.
a uditor independence
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that 
an appropriate relationship is maintained between the 
Group and the external auditor. The external auditor 
provides some non-audit services, primarily in the 
provision of taxation advice and advice on corporate 
transactions that may arise from time to time. In order 
to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence 
are safeguarded, the following controls have been 
implemented:
(A)  A formal policy on the use of the external auditor 
for non-audit work has been agreed by the Audit 
Committee and is available on the Company’s 
website at www.flybe.com/en/corporate/
governance. In summary, this ensures that, 
usually, such work is only awarded when, by virtue 
of the auditor’s knowledge, skills or experience, 
the external auditor is clearly to be preferred 
over alternative suppliers. Any fees charged by 
the Group’s external auditor in respect of non-
audit services over a set cumulative value of, 
currently, more than £50,000 require the prior 
approval of the Audit Committee. Under the 
policy, the external auditor is specifically excluded 
from providing any work that may impair their 
independence and from providing internal audit 
services to Flybe.
(B)  The Audit Committee receives and reviews each 
year an analysis of all non-audit work awarded 
to the external auditor over the financial period. 
A breakdown of the fees paid to the Group’s 
external auditor during the year is set out in 
note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 
and further detail is highlighted below. 
(C)  The Audit Committee receives each year a report 
from the external auditor as to any matters that 
the external auditor considers have, or may have, 
bearing on its independence and which need to 
be disclosed to the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that, notwithstanding non-
audit work, Deloitte LLP have retained objectivity 
and independence during the year. The Audit 
Committee will continue to monitor its policy in this 
regard and accepts that non-audit work should be 
controlled to ensure that it does not compromise 
the independence of the external auditor.
a uditor rotation
Deloitte LLP audited the Annual Report and accounts for 
the first time for the year ended March 2007 and as a plc 
for the year ended March 2011. Under EU audit reform 
legislation, companies are required to have a mandatory 
rotation of auditors after 10 years from listing, or 20 
years if there is a compulsory retender at 10 years.

non-audit services to audit services over a four-year 
average was 62.4%.

annual statement
Dear s hareholder,
I am pleased to introduce this year’s Remuneration 
Report.
As required by the relevant Regulations, this Report is 
split into three sections:
(A) this Annual Statement
(B) the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report
(C) the Annual Report on Remuneration
Having sought and gained shareholder approval for 
certain changes to the policy, which was approved at 
last year’s AGM, we do not propose making any further 
changes to the policy this year.
Flybe has made good progress on a number of fronts 
during the past year. The significant improvement in 
profitability has been achieved despite the impact of 
the terrorist attacks in both Paris and Brussels, which 
depressed customer demand in the second half.
The last significant legacy issue of the turnaround, the 
future of surplus E195 jets, was satisfactorily resolved 
during the course of the year, halving the outstanding 
liability.
The Flybe team has been further strengthened; new 
routes have been identified and launched; and further 
cost has been taken out of the business.
The year ahead will be the final year of transformation 
of the business and it remains critically important 
that the business attracts, retains and motivates a 
strong and capable management team to complete 
the turnaround and deliver long-term value for 
shareholders.
Key Committee activities during the year
It is in this context that the Committee approached the 
following key issues during the year: 
> > Agreeing the bonus outturn for 2014/15 – as 
reported last year, no bonuses were payable 
> > Determining the executive directors’ base salary 
levels for 2015/16 – no changes were made
> > Setting the executive directors’ bonus targets for 
2015/16 – these were a mix of PBT and personal 
targets on a 70:30 weighting as explained more 
fully below, with the existing maximum bonus 
opportunities of 150% and 100% of salary retained 
for Saad Hammad and Philip de Klerk respectively
> > Overseeing the Performance Share Plan awards – 
also as reported last year, awards over shares worth 
150% of salary were granted, with vesting subject to 
challenging adjusted EPS and relative TSR targets
Since the year end, the Committee has also determined 
performance against the targets set under the 2015/16 
annual bonus plan referred to above. A full explanation 
is provided in this report of how the Committee 
determined this bonus outturn, including (i) an 
explanation of how the committee used the flexibility 
that shareholders encouraged it to reserve regarding 
the treatment of the one-off costs incurred in dealing 
with the E195 legacy issue to ensure that the executives 
were not disincentivised to find a solution to this issue 
and (ii) the deferral of a substantial portion of the bonus 
into shares. 
In addition, the Committee has agreed to make a 
further grant under the PSP to Saad and Philip over 
shares worth 150% of salary (albeit with the number of 
shares over which this award is made being calculated 
as set out on page 74). As was the case last year, 
these awards will vest subject to a mix of challenging 
relative TSR and EPS targets described more fully later 
in this report. Also, Saad and Philip’s base salaries will 
be increased (for the first time since their respective 
appointments) by 2% for 2016/17, which reflects typical 
salary increases across the Group.
The Committee welcomes, and carefully considers, 
feedback from shareholders. We were happy to receive 
strong levels of support for the remuneration-related 
resolutions tabled at last year’s AGM, with 93.36% of 
votes cast in favour of our new policy and 99.93% in 
favour of the Annual Report on Remuneration. We 
hope this support will continue. However, should 
you wish to contact me with any comments on our 
approach to executive remuneration, please feel free  
to email me at Liz.mcmeikan@flybe.com.

Governance
Directors’ r emuneration Policy
Compliance statement
This report, which has been approved by the Board, 
has been prepared in compliance with the Listing 
Rules, the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013. In accordance with the Regulations, the following 
sections of the Remuneration Report are subject 
to audit: the single total figure of remuneration for 
directors and notes (page 71), scheme interests 
awarded during the financial year (page 74), payments 
to past directors (page 72), payments for loss of 
office (page 68) and the statement of directors’ 
shareholdings and share interests (pages 73 to 74). The 
remaining sections of the report are not subject to audit.
Directors’ r emuneration Policy
Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2015 AGM 
for our directors’ remuneration policy. No changes 
are being made to this policy, which will continue to 
apply for the forthcoming year. For ease of reference, 
we have set out below the key features of our policy 
(although the full, formal policy will be as disclosed 
in last year’s report). This policy takes due account 
of the Corporate Governance Code and is felt to be 
appropriate to support the long-term success of the 
Company while ensuring that it does not promote 
inappropriate risk-taking. 
Policy table
The following table summarises the Group’s policies 
in respect of key elements of executive director 
remuneration:
Function Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Basic salary 
This is the core 
element of pay 
and reflects the 
individual’s role 
and position within 
the Group with 
some adjustment 
to reflect their 
capability and 
contribution.
Basic salaries are payable 
monthly in cash and are 
reviewed annually, taking into 
account the size and nature 
of the role, individual skills, 
experience and performance, 
with reference to pay and 
conditions elsewhere in the 
Group, and external market 
data for comparable positions 
at companies of similar sector 
and size to Flybe.
Any increase in basic salary is 
normally effective 1st April.
Salaries in respect of the year 
under review (and for the 
following year) are disclosed 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
It is anticipated that salary 
increases will generally be 
in line with those awarded 
to salaried employees as a 
whole. In certain circumstances 
(including, but not limited 
to, increases for other 
employees, changes in role and 
responsibilities, market levels, 
and individual and company 
performance), the Committee 
may make appropriate 
adjustments to salary levels 
to ensure they remain market 
competitive. The rationale 
for any such increase will be 
disclosed in the relevant Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
None.
Pension
To provide 
competitive 
retirement 
benefits.
Executive directors are eligible 
to participate in a contributory 
scheme and may elect on a 
cost-neutral basis for the Group 
to receive a monthly non-
bonusable cash supplement 
in lieu of pension above the 
pensions annual and lifetime 
allowances.
Salary is the only element 
of remuneration that is 
pensionable.
Executive directors receive a 
contribution, or equivalent cash 
supplement in lieu thereof, of 
up to 15% of salary.
None. 62 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
Function Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Benefits
To provide 
competitive 
benefits. 
Executive directors receive 
benefits which consist primarily 
of car/driver allowances 
(including tax on such benefit), 
private medical insurance and 
life assurance and, for the 
CEO only, membership of a 
London club (which operates 
as a base for work undertaken 
while in London together with 
tax on such subscriptions), 
although can include any such 
benefits that the Committee 
deems appropriate to ensure 
the benefits package is 
appropriately competitive and 
reflects the circumstances 
of the individual director 
including, but not limited to, 
accommodation/relocation 
allowances.
Benefits vary by role and 
individual circumstances; 
eligibility, the items offered 
and their cost are reviewed 
periodically.
Benefits in respect of the year 
under review are disclosed 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
It is not anticipated that the 
cost of benefits will vary 
significantly year-on-year, 
although the Committee retains 
the discretion to approve a 
higher cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. relocation) 
or in circumstances where 
factors outside the Company’s 
control have changed 
materially (e.g. increases in 
insurance premiums).
None.
si P, sa Ye
To align the 
interests of 
employees and 
shareholders by 
encouraging all 
employees to own 
Flybe shares.
SAYE – All-employee scheme 
under which all UK employees 
(including executive directors) 
may save up to the maximum 
monthly savings limit (as 
determined by legislation) 
over a period of three or five 
years. Options under the 
SAYE scheme are granted at 
a discount of up to 20% to the 
market value of shares at the 
date of grant.
SIP – All-employee scheme 
under which all UK employees 
(including executive directors) 
may (i) contribute up to 
the monthly maximum (as 
determined by legislation) to 
purchase shares monthly from 
pre-tax pay; and (ii) receive 
free shares up to the annual 
maximum value (as determined 
by legislation).
Savings, contributions and 
free shares are capped at the 
prevailing legislative limit or 
other such lower limit as the 
Committee may determine at 
the time UK employees are 
invited to participate.
None (reflecting HMRC rules).

a nnual bonus
Incentivise and 
reward executive 
directors for 
the delivery of 
business strategy.
The annual bonus is a 
discretionary scheme under 
which performance targets are 
agreed by the Committee at 
the start of each financial year. 
Payments (made following the 
end of each performance year) 
are based on the Committee’s 
assessment of the performance 
against these targets.
Once set, performance 
targets will generally remain 
unchanged for the year, 
except to reflect events such 
as corporate acquisitions or 
other major transactions where 
the Committee considers it to 
be necessary in its opinion to 
make appropriate adjustments.
Annual bonus outcomes are 
paid in cash. The Committee 
will keep under review whether 
it is appropriate for bonuses to 
be partly deferred into shares. 
Where such arrangements are 
operated, a payment equivalent 
to the dividends that would 
have accrued on the number of 
shares that vest may be made 
to participants on vesting, as 
cash or shares.
Clawback provisions apply 
to future annual bonuses as 
described more fully at note 4.
Maximum annual bonus 
opportunity:
CEO:
> > 150% of base salary
Other executive directors:
> > 100% of salary
Performance is assessed 
on an annual basis, based 
on the achievement of 
objectives relating to financial 
performance, progress of 
strategic priorities and/or 
personal targets. The specific 
measures used in the bonus 
and their weighting may 
vary each year depending on 
business context and strategy.
Attaining the threshold level of 
performance for any measure 
will not produce a pay-out 
of more than 20% of the 
maximum portion of overall 
annual bonus attributable to 
that measure, with a sliding 
scale to full pay-out for 
maximum performance. 
Further details on the bonus 
for the year under review and 
forthcoming year are provided 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. 64 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
Function Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
l ong-term 
incentives 
Incentivise 
creation of long-
term shareholder 
value, and support 
alignment with 
shareholders’ 
interests.
The primary ongoing long-
term incentive plan is the 
Performance Share Plan. 
Awards can be granted as 
conditional shares or a nil/
nominal cost option vesting 
subject to the achievement 
of three-year performance 
conditions. A post-vesting 
holding period also applies, 
such that vested shares are not 
receivable in full until the fifth 
anniversary of grant.
A payment equivalent to the 
dividends that would have 
accrued on the number of 
shares that vest may be made 
to participants on vesting 
(including any holding period), 
as cash or shares.
PSP awards are subject to 
malus provisions described 
more fully at note 4.
Awards of shares worth up to 
150% of salary can be granted 
each year (or such higher 
number as the Committee 
considers appropriate in 
exceptional circumstances, 
up to a maximum of 250%). 
Details of any awards granted 
in a year will be disclosed in 
the relevant Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
The Committee may set such 
performance conditions on 
PSP awards as it considers 
appropriate (whether financial 
or non-financial and whether 
corporate, divisional or 
individual).
Once set, performance 
measures and targets will 
generally remain unaltered 
unless events occur which, in 
the Committee’s opinion, make 
it appropriate to substitute, 
vary or waive the performance 
conditions in such manner as 
the Committee thinks fit.
Performance periods may 
be over such periods as the 
Committee selects at grant, 
which will not be less than 
(but may be longer than) three 
years.
No more than 20% of awards 
vest for attaining the threshold 
level of performance for each 
condition. Further details of 
measures, their weighting and 
targets will be disclosed in 
the relevant Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
n otes to the policy table
1.    stating maximum amounts for the remuneration 
policy
The DRR regulations and related investor guidance 
encourages companies to disclose a cap within which 
each element of the directors’ remuneration policy 
will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements 
of remuneration have been set within the directors’ 
remuneration policy, these will operate simply as caps 
and are not indicative of any aspiration.
2.  t ravel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider these to form 
part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, 
we have been advised that corporate hospitality 
(whether paid for by the Company or another) and 
product familiarisation through staff/business travel 
for directors (and exceptionally their families) may 
technically come within the applicable rules and so 
the Committee expressly reserves the right for the 
Committee to authorise such activities within its  
agreed policies.
3.  Past obligations
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any 
commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, 
the approval and implementation of this remuneration 
policy will be honoured. 
4. malus/clawback
A malus provision applies to the PSP, under which the 
Committee may lapse part/all of any unvested PSP 
award and/or any shares that are the subject of a post-
vesting holding period in certain circumstances (e.g. if 
information used to determine vesting was materially 
inaccurate and resulted in an overpayment, gross 
misconduct, material reputational damage caused by 
mismanagement etc.). There is a three-year time bar 
on this malus provision, i.e. no award can be lapsed if 
the trigger event comes to light more than three years 
after its occurrence.
Similarly, a clawback provision will apply to the annual 
bonus under which any future net bonus paid can be 
reclaimed in broadly the same circumstances as apply 
to the malus provision in the PSP (with a similar three-
year time limit).

Governance
5. Discretions
The Committee may exercise discretion in two broad 
areas for each element of remuneration:
> > To ensure fairness and align executive director 
remuneration with underlying individual and 
company performance, the Committee may adjust 
upwards or downwards the outcome of any short- or 
long-term incentive plan payment within the limits 
of the relevant plan. Any adjustments in light of 
corporate events will be made on a neutral basis, i.e. 
the intention of any adjustment will be that the event 
is not to the benefit or detriment of participants. 
Adjustments to underlying performance may be 
made in exceptional circumstances to ensure 
outcomes are fair both to shareholders and 
participants.
> > In the case of a non-regular event occurring, the 
Committee may apply its discretion to ensure 
fairness and seek alignment with business 
objectives. Non-regular events in this context 
include, but are not limited to: corporate 
transactions, changes in the Company’s accounting 
policies, minor or administrative matters, internal 
promotions, external recruitment and terminations.
Any use of discretion by the Committee during the 
financial year will be detailed in the relevant Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
6. s hareholding guidelines
Executive directors are required to retain 50% of any 
net vested shares received under any share plan until 
they hold shares worth 150% of base salary. Shares 
subject only to a holding period will, consistent with 
institutional shareholder guidelines, count towards the 
guidelines.
r emuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is 
based on broadly consistent principles as described 
above. Annual salary reviews across the Group take 
into account Company performance, local pay and 
market conditions and salary levels for similar roles in 
comparable companies.
Other members of the Group’s Executive Committee 
and certain key management participate in similar 
annual bonus arrangements to the executive directors, 
although award sizes vary by organisational level. PSP 
awards are also granted to a broader population than 
the executive directors. All other employees may be 
eligible to participate from time to time in an employee 
bonus scheme, under which a bonus is payable subject 
to the achievement of Group profit targets. All eligible 
employees may participate in the Company’s SAYE and 
SIP schemes on identical terms. 66 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16

a pproach to recruitment remuneration
The Company’s Recruitment Remuneration Policy, which is set out below, aims to give the Committee sufficient 
flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high calibre executives to strengthen the management 
team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for 
a new executive director, the starting point for the 
Committee will be to apply the general policy for 
executive directors as set out above and structure a 
package in accordance with that policy. Consistent 
with the Regulations, any caps contained within the 
policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, 
although the Committee would not envisage exceeding 
these caps in practice. Where a new appointee’s 
salary is initially set below market, the Committee 
may manage salary progression in a phased manner 
over a number of years, subject to the individual’s 
development in the role.
The Annual Bonus Plan and PSP will operate (including 
the maximum award levels) as detailed in the general 
policy in relation to any newly appointed executive 
director. Any recruitment-related PSP awards which are 
not buy-outs will be subject to the relevant plan terms, 
including performance conditions, and limits as stated 
in the general policy. Details of any recruitment-related 
awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect 
the new appointment, as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain 
relocation expenses as it considers appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make 
additional awards in connection with the recruitment  
to buy-out awards forfeited by the individual on leaving 
a previous employer. For the avoidance of doubt, buy-
out awards are not subject to a formal cap. 
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than 
is, in the view of the Committee, necessary and will in 
all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such 
awards under the terms of the Company’s existing 
incentive arrangements. It may, however, be necessary 
in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that 
are more bespoke than the existing arrangements. 
All buy-outs, whether under the Company’s existing 
incentive arrangements or otherwise, will take 
account of the service obligations and performance 
requirements for any remuneration relinquished by 
the individual when leaving a previous employer. The 
Committee will seek to make buy-outs subject to what 
are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect 
of service and performance. However, the Committee 
may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases 
(such as where the service and/or performance 
requirements are materially completed, or where such 
factors are, in the view of the Committee, reflected 
in some other way, such as a significant discount to 
the face value of the awards forfeited) and where 
the Committee considers it to be in the interests of 
shareholders. 68 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
service contracts and treatment for leavers and 
change of control
The Committee’s policy is to provide service contracts 
for executive directors with notice periods of 12 months 
or less. The Committee reserves flexibility to alter these 
principles if necessary to secure the recruitment of an 
appropriate candidate and, if appropriate, introduce 
a longer initial notice period (of up to two years) 
reducing over time.
Saad Hammad entered into a service agreement 
dated 8th July 2013 and Philip de Klerk into a service 
agreement dated 21st April 2014. Both service 
agreements are subject to 12 months’ notice  
by either party.
Upon termination, executive directors are entitled 
to salary and benefits (inclusive of pension/pension 
allowances) for the duration of their notice period. It 
is the Committee’s policy to seek to mitigate the need 
for such payments. Each executive director has post-
termination provisions which (among others) restrict 
the executive director from competing with Flybe for 
the duration of their notice period.
Executive director service contracts are available to 
view at the Company’s registered office.
In the event that a participant ceases to be an 
employee of Flybe, treatment of outstanding awards 
under the Group’s long-term incentive plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules. When 
considering any such payments, the Committee 
reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they 
are fair to both shareholders and participants. 
> > Executive directors will normally not be entitled to 
any bonus payment on termination of employment 
(or if notice of termination has been given) unless, 
for any period actually worked, the Committee 
considers it appropriate in its discretion. In certain 
‘good leaver’ circumstances, however, Saad 
Hammad will be eligible to receive an annual bonus, 
pro-rated for the portion of the financial year 
worked. 
> > Under the rules for the PSP, awards lapse on 
cessation of employment other than in certain 
prescribed ‘good leaver’ circumstances (e.g. death, 
ill health, redundancy, retirement) in which case 
awards vest either on cessation or on the normal 
vesting date, typically subject to the performance 
conditions and pro-rating (unless the Committee 
determines otherwise). In the event of a change in 
control, awards will normally be time pro-rated and 
vest subject to the performance conditions. Awards 
are not forfeitable during any subsequent holding 
period (but may be available for the application  
of malus).
> > Under the one-off recruitment long-term incentive 
plan for Saad Hammad (further details of which 
are set out on page 75), the award will normally 
lapse if Saad Hammad leaves Flybe before the 
end of the performance period. At its discretion, 
the Committee may vary this treatment in certain 
leaver circumstances, i.e. where Saad Hammad is 
a ‘good leaver’. In the event of a change of control, 
performance will be tested over a curtailed period 
based on the Company’s market capitalisation on 
the date of change of control.
> > Under the rules for the LTIP (under which Philip de 
Klerk received an award on joining Flybe, further 
details of which are set out on page 75), awards 
lapse in the event a participant leaves Flybe, unless 
for reasons including, but not limited to, death, ill 
health, permanent disability and redundancy. In 
these circumstances, awards will normally be pro-
rated for time and vest at the normal time, subject to 
the achievement of the performance condition over 
the complete performance period. In the event of a 
change of control, the award will normally be pro-
rated for time and vest based on performance over 
the period to the change of control. At its discretion, 
the Committee may vary these default treatments.
> > The Company has the power to enter into settlement 
agreements with directors and to pay compensation 
to settle potential legal claims. In addition, and 
consistent with market practice, in the event of the 
termination of an executive director, the Company 
may make a contribution towards that individual’s 
legal fees and fees for outplacement services as 
part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees will 
be disclosed as part of the detail of termination 
arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost  
of termination payments.

Non-Executive Directors (‘NEDs’) do not have service 
contracts. Instead, their services are provided for under 
the terms of a letter of appointment with the Group 
and are subject to six months’ notice by either party. 
Details of the terms of appointment of the current 
NEDs are provided above. 
The NEDs are not eligible for bonuses or participation 
in share schemes and no pension contributions are 
made on their behalf.

Details of the policy on fees paid to our NEDs are set out in the table below:
Function Operation Opportunity
Performance 
metrics
f ees 
To attract and 
retain non-
executive 
directors 
with broad 
commercial 
and other 
experience 
relevant to the 
Company.
Fee levels are reviewed annually, with 
any adjustments normally effective 
1st April in the year following review.
The fees paid to the Chairman are 
determined by the Committee, 
while the fees of the non-executive 
directors are determined by the 
executive directors.
Additional fees are payable for acting 
as Senior Independent Director and 
as Chairman of any of the Board’s 
Committees (Audit, Remuneration, 
Safety & Security).
Fee levels reflect the skills and 
experience of the NEDs, the market 
practice adopted in similar sized 
organisations and anticipated time 
commitments.
NEDs may also receive certain 
benefits from time to time.
Fee increases for the non-executive 
director (and the Chairman) are 
applied in line with the outcome of 
the annual fee review. Fees for the 
year under review (and the coming 
year) are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
It is expected that any increases  
to NED fee levels will be in line with 
salaried employees over the life of 
the policy. However, in the event 
that there is a material misalignment 
with the market or a change in the 
complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulfil the 
NED role, the Board has discretion to 
make an appropriate adjustment to 
the fee level. Aggregate fees (plus the 
value of any benefits) will not exceed 
the cap in the Company’s Articles of 
Association (currently £500k).
None.
To assist with product familiarisation, all Group Board 
directors are entitled to four complementary pairs of 
return plane tickets per annum, with the individual 
director paying any associated tax liability that arises. 
No other benefits are envisaged for the non-executive 
directors (including the Chairman) but the Company 
reserves the right to provide benefits (including travel 
and office support) within the overall limits on fees set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association. Currently, 
no such tax liabilities arise.
r ecruitment policy for n on-executive Directors
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the 
Committee will use the policy set out in the table 
above. A base fee in line with the prevailing market 
rates would be payable for Board membership, 
with additional fees payable for acting as Senior 
Independent Director or as Chairman of the Board’s 
Committees, where appropriate.
external appointments 
At the discretion of the Board, executive directors 
may be appointed as a non-executive director at other 
companies. Before granting permission, the Board will 
take into account, inter alia, the time commitment of the 
new role, the competitive status of the other company, 
the Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. Whether the executive director retains any 
associated fees, or whether they are remitted to the 
Company, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Saad Hammad has been granted permission to act as a 
non-executive director of Pegasus for which he received 
fees of £55k in 2015/16 which he has retained.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Company seeks to promote and maintain good 
relationships with employee representative bodies – 
including trade unions and employee representatives – 
as part of its employee engagement strategy and 
consults on matters affecting employees and business 
performance as required in each case by law and 
regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company 
operates. The Committee is also mindful of the salary 
increases applying across the Group when considering 
salary increases for the executive directors. The 
Committee does not, however, consult with employees 
specifically on the effectiveness and appropriateness 
of the executive remuneration policy and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder views received 
during the year and at each Annual General Meeting, 
as well as guidance from shareholder representative 
bodies more broadly, in shaping the Remuneration 
Policy. The Committee continues to keep its 
remuneration arrangements under regular review, to 
ensure the Remuneration Policy continues to reinforce 
the Company’s long-term strategy and aligns closely 
with shareholders’ interests. We will consult, and 
seek approval from, shareholders before making any 
significant changes to our Remuneration Policy.

2014 respectively.
2 Base salary includes a length of service increment of £50 for Saad Hammad. This approach is consistent with that of other employees.
3  Taxable benefits comprise private health care, car allowance, and (in the case of Saad Hammad), driver, and tax on certain of such benefit. 
As of 1st December 2015, compliant with the existing benefits policy, the executive directors ceased to receive a fuel card allowance, with a 
related increase made to their car allowance which has been increased to £20,000 for Saad Hammad and £12,500 for Philip de Klerk (from 
£14,500 and £7,000 respectively). The 2014/15 benefit value has been restated to include tax paid on the driver benefit after the year end.
4  Annual bonus outturn for performance during the 2015/16 year is described below. The above figure includes the portion of the bonus to be 
paid in deferred shares (amounting to 45% of the stated bonus).
5 During 2015/16, Saad Hammad received cash sums paid in lieu of pension contributions.
6 Charlie Scott stepped down from the Board on 21st July 2015.
The aggregate emoluments (being salaries/fees, benefits, cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions and 
annual bonuses) of all directors for the 2015/16 year was £1,951,313 (2014/15: £1,179,417).
2015/16 annual bonus
For the year ended 31st March 2016, the annual bonus 
was dependent on a mixture of financial targets based 
on adjusted PBT performance (70% of opportunity) 
and personal objectives (30%) based on the strategic 
priorities. The PBT targets, and related potential bonus 
payouts, were as follows:
2015/16 Adjusted PBT % of element of bonus that pays out
Below £5m 0%
£5m 20%
£15m 100%
Between £5m and £15m 20% – 100% straight-line
As stated above, last year Project Blackbird (which 
addressed solving the legacy E195 issue) was brought 
to a successful conclusion. Having announced solutions 
for five of the 14 E195s in 2014/15, the executive 
directors arranged the redeployment of the remaining 
nine aircraft. Overall, completion of Project Blackbird 
delivers a £40m mitigation versus Flybe’s previously 
indicated obligation of £80m over the remaining term 
of the aircraft leases. 
During the consultation exercise that was undertaken 
prior to shareholder approval being obtained for 
the remuneration policy at the 2015 AGM, investors 
encouraged the Committee to ensure that bonus 
schemes incentivised management to find solutions for 
the surplus E195s. Accordingly, as set out in last year’s 
remuneration report, flexibility was reserved to exclude 
one-off costs incurred in dealing with this legacy issue 
from the adjusted PBT when calculating the annual 
bonus pay out. The Committee is satisfied that a good 
solution was found by management and that the 
additional costs incurred in doing so in the year, which 
amounted to approximately £6.7m, should therefore 
be removed from the adjusted PBT used for bonus 
purposes, resulting in an adjusted PBT of £12.2m. 
A rigorous approach has been adopted to identify 
and verify these costs to be adjusted. Consequently,  72 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
bonuses equalling 78% and 52% of salary were earned 
by Saad Hammad and Philip de Klerk respectively in 
connection with this element of the bonus.
The CEO had six personal objectives: 
> > The resolution of the legacy E195 jets; 
> > Further improve employee engagement; 
> > Further improve safety performance; 
> > Further simplify the business; 
> > Continue to improve the quality and depth of 
management; and 
> > Further improve operational performance. 
The CFO also had six personal objectives: 
> > Deliver cost reductions, including the resolution of 
the legacy E195 jets; 
> > Further improve employee engagement; 
> > Further improve safety performance; 
> > Enhance the performance of the finance function, 
including his personal development; 
> > Enhance the performance of his reporting team; and 
> > Deliver free cash in line with budget. 
Based on an assessment of their performance against 
these objectives, and their overall performance 
and contribution during the year, the Committee 
determined that bonuses equalling approximately 41% 
and 26% of salary were earned by Saad Hammad and 
Philip de Klerk respectively in connection with this 
element of the bonus.
Also, as reported last year, bonuses would only be payable 
if (i) the Committee was satisfied that the Company had 
made satisfactory progress in resolving the E195 legacy 
issue and (ii) the Company’s aviation safety record 
warrants such payments. The Committee confirmed that 
these additional conditions had been satisfied. 
Therefore, in total a bonus equal to 122% of salary was 
payable to Saad Hammad, with 80% payable to Philip 
de Klerk. 
The Committee believes that these bonus payments 
properly reflect the executive directors’ contribution 
and performance during the year. However, mindful 
of the wish to adopt a considered approach when 
implementing our remuneration policy, the Committee 
and the executive directors have agreed that 45% of 
the bonus (being broadly equivalent to the amount 
of additional bonus triggered by the exclusion of the 
E195 solution costs) should be payable in Flybe shares, 
subject to a one-year deferral period.

Performance conditions will be measured over three financial years to 31st March 2018. The EPS condition looks 
at the EPS achieved in the final year only based on the reported adjusted EPS (subject to such adjustments as 
the Committee considers appropriate) and TSR compares the TSR over the three months prior to the start of 
the financial year in which the grant is made with the three months prior to the end of the financial year ending 
three years later. The Committee may scale back vesting based on performance against these targets (to zero 
if considered appropriate) if there has been a safety event that it considers warrants the use of such discretion. 
Furthermore, an additional underpin applies which states that awards will only vest to the extent that the 
Committee is satisfied that the Company has made satisfactory progress in resolving the outstanding legacy 
issue relating to the E195s in an appropriate manner. 
To the extent that awards vest, a holding period applies, such that 50% of the shares are receivable immediately, 
with the balance receivable in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.

r ecruitment awards
s aad Hammad’s recruitment award
As part of his remuneration arrangements on joining 
Flybe, and as approved by shareholders at the 2013 
Annual General Meeting, Saad Hammad received an 
award under the one-off LTIP which provides him 
with an entitlement to a cash payment based on the 
incremental growth in Flybe’s market capitalisation over 
a three-year period commencing on 1st August 2013.
Under the terms of his award, Saad Hammad will be 
entitled to a cash sum equivalent to a fixed percentage of 
the incremental increase in market capitalisation between 
1st August 2013 and 31st July 2016. Starting and ending 
market capitalisations for Flybe will be based on a three-
month average market capitalisation to the relevant date. 
Saad Hammad will receive a 4% share of any incremental 
increase in market capitalisation if the ending market 
capitalisation is £150m or less. If the ending market 
capitalisation is greater than £150m, Saad Hammad will 
receive 4% of the incremental increase between the 
starting market capitalisation and £150m and a 3% share 
of any incremental increase in market capitalisation 
above the £150m threshold.
As disclosed in the prospectus released on 20th 
February 2014 in connection to the Proposed Firm 
Placing and Placing and Open Offer, the Committee 
further agreed that the ending market capitalisation 
should be reduced by the value of the aggregate 
subscription price paid for any new shares in the 
capital of the Company which are issued after the date 
that the CEO joined the Company, but on or before the 
end of the performance period. Accordingly, £156m 
will be deducted from the ending market capitalisation, 
relating to the fundraising completed in March 2014.
To the extent the award vests at the end of the three-
year performance period, 50% of the award will be 
released after three years, with the remainder released 
after further deferral periods of six months (25% of the 
award) and 12 months (25% of the award).
Philip de Klerk’s recruitment award 
Philip de Klerk was granted a phantom option under the 
cash-based LTIP on 22nd August 2014 over 705,096 
notional shares with an ‘opening price’ of £1.2126. This 
award vests on the third anniversary of grant provided 
that the ‘closing price’ (i.e. the average share price over 
three months prior to the third anniversary of grant) 
is at least £1.6126. To the extent that this performance 
condition is met, an amount equal to the embedded 
gain (i.e. the difference between the opening price 
and the closing price) at the end of the three-year 
performance period will vest subject to an overriding 
cap which states that the vested amount cannot exceed 
300% of the opening price. Vesting will be on a phased 
basis between three and four years from grant (i.e. 50% 
on the third anniversary of grant, 25% six months later 
and the final 25% a further six months later).

1st a pril 2016
Base salary
For the coming year with effect from 1st April 2016, 
executive directors’ salaries will be increased by 2% 
(reflecting typical salary increases across the Group)  
as follows:
Saad Hammad  £433,500
Philip de Klerk  £290,700
Pension
Executive directors are eligible to receive a company 
pension contribution of up to 15% of basic salary and 
are also eligible to elect to join the main GPPP defined 
contribution scheme open to all UK employees. Should 
contributions exceed the relevant annual and/or lifetime 
allowance limits or if further pension contributions mean 
an individual exceeds such limits, then the executive 
director may elect on a broadly cost-neutral basis for 
the Group to receive a non-bonusable cash supplement 
equal to the pension contribution amount. 
Saad Hammad has elected to receive his pension 
contributions as a non-bonusable cash supplement. 
Philip de Klerk will receive a cash supplement in lieu of 
pension where it would otherwise be tax-inefficient for 
him to continue to receive a formal pension contribution. 
As with Saad Hammad, any cash supplement will be 
reduced by the employer’s NIC liability that arises to 
ensure the new approach is cost-neutral to Flybe.
a nnual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Messrs 
Hammad and de Klerk will be unchanged from last 
year at 150% and 100% of salary respectively. The 
proposed performance measures will also reflect the 
approach adopted last year, i.e. a mix of adjusted 
Group PBT targets (70% weighting, with PBT excluding 
any foreign exchange translation differences on US 
dollar loans, but with no adjustments made for surplus 
aircraft costs), as well as the achievement of personal/
strategic objectives (30% weighting) relating to a 
number of performance indicators. The bonus also 
includes an underpin that enables the Committee to 
scale back bonuses (to zero if considered appropriate) 
in the event that there has been an aviation safety 
event that it considers warrants the use of such 
discretion. Furthermore, going forward, no portion of 
the personal/strategic bonus will normally be payable 
unless adjusted PBT grows versus the prior year.
Given the competitive nature of the Company’s sector, 
the specific performance targets are considered to 
be commercially sensitive and accordingly are not 
disclosed. Following the conclusion of the current 
financial year, the Committee intends to adopt the 
same level of retrospective disclosure of bonus targets 
as has been applied this year. 76 f lybe group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
Directors’ remuneration

Ps P awards 
It is proposed that PSP awards be granted to Messrs Hammad and de Klerk in the forthcoming year. As was the 
case with awards made last year, the performance measures for these awards will be based on adjusted EPS and 
TSR growth, summarised as follows:
Adjusted EPS for FY 2018/19 (50% weighting) % of that part of the award that vests
15.9p or more 100%
Between 15.9p and 12.9p Pro-rata on straight-line basis between 100% and 0%
12.9p 0%
Less than 12.9p 0%
Three-year TSR (50% weighting) relative to the constituents, as at the 1st April 
prior to grant, of the FTSE SmallCap excluding investment trusts % of that part of the award that vests
Upper quartile or more 100%
Between upper quartile and median Pro-rata on straight-line basis between 100% and 20%
Median 20%
Below median 0%
Performance conditions will be measured over three financial years to 31st March 2019. The EPS condition looks 
at the EPS achieved in the final year only based on the reported adjusted EPS (subject to such adjustments as the 
Committee considers appropriate) and TSR compares the TSR over the three months prior to the start of the financial 
year in which the grant is made with the three months prior to the end of the financial year ending three years later.  
In addition, an underpin applies under which the Committee can scale back vesting (to zero if considered appropriate)  
in the event that there has been an aviation safety event that it considers warrants the use of such discretion. 
To the extent that awards vest a holding period applies such that 50% of the shares are receivable immediately, 
with the balance receivable in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The Committee is mindful of the fact that the EPS target range is lower in absolute terms than the 18.5p–22.2p 
target range employed for the 2015 grant. The Committee believes, however, that the 12.9p–15.9p target range is 
entirely appropriate as it is no less challenging in relative terms, due to evolving market conditions, than was the 
18.5p–22.2p range when set last year. The Committee strongly believes that the LTIP needs to be set at a level 
that motivates and incentivises management. This target range reflects Flybe’s forecast EPS growth and requires 
very substantial growth from current levels of profitability. It is consistent with analyst expectations as far as they 
are set into the future.
However, to adopt again a considered approach to remuneration, 0% of the EPS portion of the 2016 award will 
vest for achieving the threshold target, whereas 20% vested at threshold last year. In addition, while the CEO and 
CFO will receive a notional 150% of salary grant under the PSP in the forthcoming year (in line with last year’s 
grant), the Committee is mindful of the fall in the share price over the last year and feels it would be inappropriate if 
management were to gain benefit from this. Accordingly, when calculating how many shares are actually awarded, 
the higher of either the share price on grant or the 89.5p share price used for the 2015 awards will be used.

Governance
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, the directors are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS regulation 
and have also chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that directors:
> > properly select and apply accounting policies;
> > present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
> > provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance; 
and
> > make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
r esponsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
> > the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
> > the Annual Report, including the strategic report, 
and accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, strategy and business model; and
> > the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that they face.

Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the 
principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the 
directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness 
of the going concern basis of accounting and the 
directors’ statement on the longer-term viability  
of the group contained within the strategic report.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to:
> > the directors’ confirmation on page 27 that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
> > the disclosures on pages 28 to 31 that describe  
those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
> > the directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial 
statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them and their identification 
of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements;
> > the directors’ explanation on page 27 as to how they 
have assessed the prospects of the group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going 
concern basis of accounting and we did not identify 
any such material uncertainties. However, because not 
all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors 
and we confirm that we are independent of the group 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with those standards. We also confirm 
we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards. Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16  79

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Aircraft maintenance provisions
Management continue to recognise provisions for 
maintenance obligations in relation to leased aircraft. 
Their approach to recognising the provision of £71.4m 
(2015: £68.8m) is set out in the critical accounting 
judgements in note 4 and further detail is provided  
in note 25. 
The quantification of maintenance provisions requires 
complex judgements and estimates to be made 
including considerations of aircraft utilisation, expected 
maintenance intervals and associated costs, and any 
changes in terms with maintenance providers. 
We evaluated the methodology and key assumptions 
adopted by management in their calculation of the 
aircraft maintenance provisions and evaluated the 
design and implementation of the controls in this 
process. This evaluation included:
> > testing the integrity and arithmetical accuracy of  
the provision model through recalculations; and
> > consideration and challenge of the consistency 
and reasonableness of the assumptions adopted, 
including review of lease terms and conditions, 
testing of source data for the model to information 
from lessors, comparison of assumptions to contract 
terms, recent interval and cost experience. We have 
supplemented this work with corroborative inquiry 
of engineering management, in particular in relation 
to asset lives, the utilisation pattern of the aircraft 
and the consistency of the provisions with their 
assessment of aircraft condition. 
Revenue recognition and provisioning 
Group revenue includes £571.7m (2015: £528.6m) of 
passenger revenue for the year ended 31 March 2016.
Management have recorded certain provisions against 
revenue where revenue data derived from the revenue 
reporting systems, primarily arising from codeshare 
arrangements, needed amendment to properly reflect 
revenue in accordance with the Group’s revenue 
recognition criteria (as set out in note 3 to the financial 
statements). 
These provisions primarily arise from activities such as 
inter-airline charge backs, air passenger tax recharges 
and ancillary revenue. Their quantification can involve 
complex data flows and in some cases judgment on  
the likely volume of rejected transactions. 
We have evaluated the design and implementation of 
the key controls over revenue recognition combined 
with substantive tests and analytical procedures of 
related revenue and revenue provisions. We have 
also challenged the judgements made in valuing the 
required revenue provisions and comparisons of those 
judgments with historical experience. 
In addition, IT audit specialist members of the audit 
team have tested automated controls for those systems 
controlled by the Group and the reconciliation of data 
in the revenue reporting systems to the general ledger.
Deferred tax asset recognition 
A deferred tax asset of £11.3m (2015: £8.8m) is 
recognised at 31 March 2016. Further detail is set out 
in the critical accounting judgements in note 4 and 
further detail is provided in note 24. 
Management judgement is required in assessing the 
recoverability of the deferred tax asset, based on the 
likelihood of sufficient taxable profits arising in future 
periods and the likelihood that the tax assets will be 
utilised. In making their judgement, management 
consider the inherent volatility within the airline 
industry and its exposure to other circumstances 
beyond its control. 
We have evaluated management’s process to prepare 
the deferred tax calculation and evaluated the design 
and implementation of the controls in this process.
We critically assessed the judgements over the level 
of forecast taxable profits available to support the 
recoverability of the deferred tax asset.
We have involved tax specialists to assist with our 
assessment of the tax principles applied in the tax 
calculations, being the treatment of long funding 
leases, assessing capital allowances available on  
owned assets and treatment of financial instruments.  80 Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16

Passenger compensation claims
A provision of £1.1m (2015: £6.7m) has been recorded 
at 31 March 2016 in respect of claims made under 
passenger compensation rights under EU regulation. 
Further detail is provided in note 25.
There is an inherent level of complexity in estimating 
such provisions and management have made their best 
estimate based on the number of historical delayed 
flights and claims received to date.
We have obtained management’s calculation model 
underpinning the provision and evaluated the design 
and implementation of the controls in this process. We:
> > used IT audit specialist members of the audit team 
to test the completeness and accuracy of the 
underlying model; and
> > tested the key assumptions in the model including 
the history and level of passenger claims
> > reperformed management’s calculations.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key 
drivers of the provision. We benchmarked against 
other airlines and reviewed the provision against 
historical claims. 
We have also considered the compliance approach 
with the regulations. 
The description of risks above should be read in 
conjunction with the significant issues considered  
by the Audit Committee discussed on page 56.
These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide  
a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of 
misstatement in the financial statements that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results  
of our work.
In determining materiality we considered a number 
of measures and derived a blended figure of £1.67m 
(2015: £1.56m) based on revenue and statutory profit 
before tax. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess 
of £83,500 (2015: £31,000), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report  
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that  
we identified when assessing the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an 
understanding of the group and its environment, 
including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement at the group level. Based 
on that assessment, our group audit scope focused 
primarily on the audit work at the two components in 
the UK, being Flybe Limited (passenger operations) 
and Flybe Aviation Services (maintenance, repair and 
overhaul operations). Our audit work comprised a full 
scope audit on both UK components where the extent 
of our testing was based on our assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement and of the materiality 
of the Group’s operations in that component. These 
components represent the principal business units  
and, together with head office, account for 100% of  
the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax.
At the parent entity level and head office we also 
tested the consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
of the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit.

Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual report is:
> > materially inconsistent with the information in the 
audited financial statements; or
> > apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or
> > otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether 
we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider the annual report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we 
communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that 
we have not identified any such inconsistencies  
or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). We also comply with International Standard 
on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies  
we consider the implications for our report.

3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’). The financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the 
European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments that are recorded at fair value. The 
principal accounting policies adopted, which have 
been applied consistently in the current and the prior 
financial year, are outlined below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate 
the financial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up 
to 31st March each year. Control is achieved when the 
Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the investee. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further 
detail is contained in the Financial Review on page 27.
Revenue and revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable and represents 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided  
in the normal course of business, net of discounts,  
VAT and other sales-related taxes and comprises:
Passenger revenue
Scheduled and charter passenger ticket sales, net 
of passenger taxes and discounts, are recorded in a 
‘forward sales’ account and are included in current 
liabilities, within deferred income, until recognised as 
revenue when transportation occurs. This also includes 
revenue derived from flights operated by the Group’s 
codeshare partners.
1. General information
Flybe Group plc is a company incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. 
The address of the registered office is given on page 
59. The nature of the UK Group’s operations and its 
principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 14 to 39.
These financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates.
2. Adoption of new and revised standards
New and amended standards that are mandatorily 
effective for the current year
None of the standards, amendments and 
interpretations which are mandatory for the first time 
for the financial year ended 31st March 2016 are either 
currently relevant or material for the Group.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not 
yet effective
At the date of approval of these financial statements, 
the following new standards and interpretations, which 
have not been applied in these financial statements, 
were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases 
had not yet been adopted by the EU):
> > IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective for the 
Group’s 2018/19 financial year);
> > IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
(effective for the Group’s 2018/19 financial year);
> > IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective for the Group’s 2019/20 
financial year).
The directors do not expect that the adoption of IFRS 9 
and IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods. IFRS 9 
will impact both the measurement and disclosures of 
financial instruments. Beyond the information above,  
it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate  
of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ introduces a single lessee accounting 
model. The new standard will require lessees to 
recognise a lease liability reflecting the obligation to 
make future lease payments and a ‘right-of-use’ asset 
for all leases unless exemption is taken for certain 
short-term leases or for leases of low-value assets. At 
31st March 2016, the Group has significant outstanding 
commitments for aircraft operating leases and the new 
standard is expected to have a material impact for the 
Group. The Group is currently assessing the impact of 
the new standard and it is not practicable to quantify 
the effect of this standard until a detailed review has 
been completed.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16  87
Financial statements
Unused tickets are recognised as revenue when the 
right to travel expires and the Group’s obligation to 
refund ceases, which is determined by the terms and 
conditions of these tickets.
Ancillary revenue, comprising principally baggage 
carriage, advanced seat assignment, commissions, 
change fees and credit and debit card fees due to 
the Group, are recognised as revenue on the date the 
right to receive consideration occurs. In respect of 
credit and debit card fees and hotel and insurance 
commission, this occurs when each flight is booked 
and paid for. For the remaining ancillary revenue, this 
occurs on the date of transportation, as this is when 
the service is generally provided.
Commission received from the issue of Flybe branded 
credit cards by a third party provider is deferred 
to the extent that it relates to free flights which the 
Group is required to offer as part of the transaction. 
Commission received in excess of the sales value of 
free flights granted to card-holders is recognised 
immediately as revenue. Revenue associated with free 
flights is recognised when the related flights are taken.
Aircraft maintenance and other revenue
These represent the amounts derived from the provision 
of goods and services to customers during the year, 
including aircraft maintenance, overhauls and the 
associated rotable and consumable parts. The amount 
of profit attributable to the stage of completion of 
an engine and maintenance overhaul contract is 
recognised when the outcome of the contract can be 
foreseen with reasonable certainty. Revenue for such 
contracts is stated at the cost appropriate to the stage 
of completion plus attributable profits, less amounts 
recognised in previous years. Provision is made for  
any losses as soon as they are foreseen.
Other revenues, such as for cargo and contract flying, 
are recognised in the period when the services are 
provided.
Frequent Flyer Programme
During the 2014/15 financial year, Flybe moved to a new 
point purchasing agreement with Avios, a subsidiary of 
International Airlines Group. Flybe also allows customers 
to redeem their points on Flybe travel through the 
Avios.com website and BA Executive Club website.
For flights purchased by members of the Frequent 
Flyer Programme ‘Rewards for all’, an element of 
revenue representing the sales value of flights which 
these customers may take in future at no cost is 
deferred and recognised when the related free flights 
have been taken. The amount of deferral is based on 
the fair value of an equivalent flight. 
Flybe has entered into an agreement with Avios to 
enable passengers to accrue Avios points when flying 
on Flybe tickets. Flybe simply purchases points from 
Avios at a pre-agreed rate and the cost of purchasing 
the points is charged against the passenger revenues  
at the point that transportation occurs. In addition, Avios 
purchases passenger tickets from Flybe in order to 
include Flybe in its redemption network. Revenues from 
these tickets is accounted for as passenger revenue. 
Avios and BA Executive Club members can earn points 
by using Flybe’s network offering, including partners. 
The cost of the points is treated as a revenue reduction 
at the point of complete transportation provision in the 
income statement and at the point of sale recorded as 
a liability against deferred income.
Avios purchases the flights from Flybe on behalf of 
its customers and these are included in the deferred 
income and once transportation has been provided, 
in the income statement revenues. Currently Flybe is 
drawing down on a £1.5m prepayment made by Avios 
at the outset of the arrangement.
Interest revenue
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that 
the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Interest 
income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount on initial recognition.
Foreign currencies
Transactions arising, other than in the functional 
currency, are recorded using the rate of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated using the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at 
fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Non-
monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are not translated.
Exchange differences are recognised in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their cost, 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Aircraft and engines and other associated equipment 
are classified as aircraft. All other equipment is 
classified as plant and equipment. 88 Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. It is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over its useful economic life of five years.
Disposals of property, plant, equipment and 
intangible assets
The gain or loss on disposal of property, plant, 
equipment and intangible assets after deducting 
any costs associated with selling, disposing of or 
retiring the relevant asset is recognised in the income 
statement and reported under other operating gains  
or losses.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any).
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to 
be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there 
is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply 
with the conditions attaching to them and that the 
grants will be received. Once such assurance exists, 
government grants are either recognised in the 
income statement or, where related to property, plant 
and equipment, are treated as deferred income and 
released to the income statement over the expected 
useful lives of the assets concerned.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net 
realisable value as follows:
Aircraft consumables
These comprise aircraft parts which are non-repairable 
and non-renewable. These are valued at the lower of 
cost or net realisable value.
3. Significant accounting policies continued
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed 
on acquisition to prepaid maintenance of its engines 
and airframe and is amortised over a period from 
one to five years from the date of purchase to the 
date of the next scheduled maintenance event for 
the component. Subsequent costs, such as long-term 
scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft, 
are capitalised and amortised over the length of period 
benefiting from these costs. All other costs relating  
to maintenance are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
Advance payments and option payments made in 
respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options 
to acquire aircraft where the balance is expected to 
be funded by lease financing are recorded at cost in 
current or non-current aircraft deposits. On acquisition 
of the related aircraft, these payments are included as 
part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from 
that date.
Depreciation is provided by the Group to write off the 
cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed 
assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful 
economic lives as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold and short 
leasehold buildings
2% to 10% per annum or 
lease term where shorter
Plant, equipment and 
motor vehicles 10% to 50% per annum
Aircraft 4% to 20% per annum
Maintenance assets 25% to 50% per annum
Estimated residual values are reviewed annually at 
each period end with reference to current market 
conditions. Where estimated residual values are found 
to have changed significantly this is accounted for 
prospectively as a change in estimate and depreciation 
charges over the remaining useful life of the asset are 
adjusted to take account of the revised estimate of 
residual value.
Intangible assets
Computer software
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if 
the product or process is technically and commercially 
feasible and the Group intends to, and has the 
technical ability and sufficient resources to, complete 
development and if the Group can measure reliably the 
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during 
its development. The expenditure capitalised includes 
the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate 
proportion of overheads. Other development 
expenditure is recognised in the income statement  
as an expense as incurred.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16  89
Financial statements
Aircraft deposits
Aircraft deposits represent deposits made with aircraft 
manufacturers for future delivery of aircraft or deposits 
made with aircraft financiers or operating lessors to 
provide security for future maintenance work or lease 
payments.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the relevant instrument.
Classification of financial instruments issued  
by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated 
as equity only to the extent that they meet the 
following two conditions:
> > they include no contractual obligations upon the 
Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to 
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another party under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable to the Group; and
> > where the instrument will or may be settled in the 
Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a 
non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver 
a variable number of the Company’s own equity 
instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by 
the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or 
other financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the 
proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. 
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form 
of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented 
in these financial statements for called up share capital 
and share premium account exclude amounts in 
relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities 
are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance 
payments associated with financial instruments that 
are classified in equity are treated as distributions and 
are recorded directly in equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the 
financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates and commodity prices, and uses forward foreign 
exchange contracts and commodity swaps to hedge 
these exposures. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised 
and subsequently remeasured at fair value.
The Group designates hedges of foreign exchange and 
commodity price risks on firm commitments as cash 
flow hedges. Hedge accounting is applied to these 
instruments.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that are designated and are effective as 
hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income and any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item.
Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are 
recognised in the income statement in the same period 
in which the hedged item affects net income or loss. 
These amounts are recorded in the same line of the 
income statement as the hedged item. However, when 
the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial 
liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated 
in equity are transferred from equity and included in 
the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group 
revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at 
that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is recognised immediately  
in the income statement.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised  
on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a 
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the investment within the timeframe 
established by the market concerned. Initially they 
are measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, 
except for those financial assets classified as at fair 
value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) or at fair value 
designated and effective as hedges, which are initially 
measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following 
specified categories: financial assets at FVTPL, 
financial assets that are designated and effective as 
hedging instruments and ‘loans and receivables’. The 
classification depends on the nature and purpose of 
the financial assets and is determined at the time of 
initial recognition. The Group holds no ‘available-for-
sale’ or ‘held-to-maturity’ financial assets. 90 Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash, for the purposes of the cash flow statement, 
comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on 
demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Cash equivalents are current asset investments which 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash at, 
or close to, their carrying values or traded in an active 
market, without curtailing or disrupting the business.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash represents funds held by the Group in 
bank accounts which cannot be withdrawn until certain 
conditions have been fulfilled. The aggregate restricted 
funds balance is disclosed by way of a note to these 
financial statements and is classified as a current or 
non-current asset based on the estimated remaining 
length of the restriction.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either 
financial liabilities or equity instruments according  
to the substance of the contractual arrangements.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 
by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised as either financial 
liabilities at FVTPL, financial liabilities that are 
designated and effective as hedging instruments,  
or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when 
the financial liability is either held for trading or it is 
designated as at FVTPL. A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument is classified as held for trading if 
it is a derivative that is not designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument. A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument may be designated as at FVTPL 
upon initial recognition if the instrument forms part 
of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, 
or both, which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the 
Group’s documented risk management strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally 
on that basis.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, 
with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss 
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest 
paid on the financial liability and is included in the 
‘unrealised gains and losses on fuel hedges’ line item 
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when 
the financial asset is either held for trading or is 
designated as at FVTPL. A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument is classified as held for trading if 
it is a derivative that is not designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument. A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument may be designated as at FVTPL 
upon initial recognition if the instrument forms part 
of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, 
or both, which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the 
Group’s documented risk management strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally 
on that basis.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, 
with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in the income statement. The net gain or 
loss recognised in the income statement incorporates 
any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset 
and is included in the ‘unrealised gains and losses on 
fuel and foreign exchange hedges’ line item or ‘other 
gains and losses’ line item in the income statement 
depending upon the nature of the instrument. 
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that 
have fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market are classified as ‘loans and 
receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by 
applying the effective interest rate, except for short-
term receivables when the recognition of interest 
would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are 
assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there 
is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more 
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the 
investment have been affected.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
asset expire; or it transfers the financial asset and 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership and continues to control the 
transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated liability for 
amounts it may have to pay.

Financial statements
or ‘other gains and losses’ line item in the income 
statement. Fair value is determined in the manner 
described in note 34.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are 
initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest expense recognised on an effective yield 
basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability 
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant 
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, 
where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying 
amount on initial recognition.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and 
only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or they expire.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best 
estimate of the consideration required to settle the 
present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking 
into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding 
the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the 
cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its 
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to 
settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a 
third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is 
virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and 
the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Leased aircraft maintenance provisions
The Group incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in 
respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during 
the term of the lease. These arise from the contractual 
obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft 
when it is returned to the lessor. To discharge these 
obligations, the Group will either need to compensate 
the lessor for the element of the life of the component 
or maintenance intervals used, or carry out the 
maintenance check before return of the aircraft  
to the lessor.
The provisions recorded and charged to the income 
statement are dependent on the life of the component 
or maintenance interval used and the individual terms 
of the lease:
> > No charge is recorded during the initial period 
of lease agreements where no compensation or 
maintenance is required prior to hand-back.
> > After a component or maintenance interval passes 
its half-life (or another measure depending on the 
individual lease) and compensation would be due to 
the lessor in accordance with the terms of the lease, 
a provision and matching income statement charge 
is recorded equal to the amount of compensation 
that would be required based on the hours or cycles 
flown at the balance sheet date.
> > After a component or maintenance interval has 
passed the trigger point such that the Group is 
contractually obliged to carry out the specified 
work, a full provision for the cost of work is 
recorded. To the extent that this provision 
represents an increase to the half-life compensation 
provision already recorded, a maintenance asset is 
recorded within property, plant and equipment. The 
asset is depreciated over the expected period to the 
next half-life compensation point, or the end of the 
lease, whichever is sooner.
Where maintenance is provided under ‘power by the 
hour’ contracts and maintenance paid to maintenance 
providers to cover the cost of the work is deemed to 
be irrecoverable, these payments are expensed as 
incurred and maintenance provisions are reduced to 
reflect the fact that the Group has already paid for the 
related maintenance work. Maintenance deposits which 
are refundable are recorded as other receivables.
Estimates are required to establish the likely utilisation 
of the aircraft, the expected cost of a maintenance 
check at the time it is expected to occur, the condition 
of an aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts.  
The bases of all estimates are reviewed once each year 
and also when information becomes available that is 
capable of causing a material change to an estimate, 
such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, 
increased or decreased utilisation, or unanticipated 
changes in the cost of heavy maintenance services.
EU261 passenger delay compensation
Provision is made for passenger compensation claims 
when the group has an obligation to recompense 
customers under regulation EU261 where technical 
issues have caused flights to be delayed. Provisions are 
measured based on known eligible flights delays and 
historic claim rates and are expected to unwind across 
the claim window, which is six years.  92 Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
Onerous leases
Onerous lease provisions are made in respect of the 
present obligation arising under an onerous contract. 
The provision recognised is for any unavoidable net 
loss arising from the contract, being the lower of the 
cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation  
or penalties arising from failure to fulfil the contract. 
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current 
and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income 
statement, except to the extent that it relates to  
items recognised directly in equity, in which case  
it is recognised in equity.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for 
the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and it excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised, 
unless the deferred tax assets arise from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered.
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Leases
Operating leases
Rental charges on operating leases are charged to 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
life of the lease. In the event that lease incentives are 
received to enter into operating leases, such incentives 
are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit 
of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental 
expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
lease term. 
At 31st March 2016 77% of Flybe’s fleet was leased via 
operating leases from nine lessors. The aircraft are 
owned by the lessor (or a special purpose company 
they manage) and Flybe and the lessor enter into an 
operating lease agreement. Operating leases are less 
cash intensive at delivery – contrasted to a loan with 
an initial deposit requirement – and remove aircraft 
residual value risk.
During the lease term Flybe is responsible for paying 
rent to the lessor and for the operation, maintenance 
and insurance of the aircraft. At the end of the lease 
term the aircraft is redelivered to the lessor in a 
condition described in the lease. Some of the leases 
include extension rights which can be exercised to 
extend the lease by a further fixed term; the leases are 
not open-ended. Maintenance provisions are discussed 
in the accounting policy on page 94.
Sale and leaseback
The Group enters into sale and leaseback transactions 
whereby it sells aircraft, or rights to acquire aircraft, 
to a third party. Flybe subsequently leases the aircraft 
back, by way of an operating lease. Any profit or loss 
on the disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold 
for is not considered to be fair value, is deferred and 
amortised over the lease term of the asset.
Finance leases
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails 
taking substantially all the risk and rewards of 
ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a ‘finance 
lease’. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as 
property, plant and equipment, and is depreciated 
over the estimated useful life to the Group. The asset is 
recorded at the lower of its fair value, less accumulated 
depreciation, and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments at the inception of the finance lease. 
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance 
charges, are included as obligations under finance 
leases. Rental payments are apportioned between 
the finance element, which is charged to the income 
statement, and the capital element, which reduces  
the outstanding obligation for future instalments.  
The finance charge is allocated to each period during 
the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16  93
Financial statements
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited in the income statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current  
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Employee benefit costs
The Group operates defined contribution and defined 
benefit pension schemes.
For the defined contribution schemes, the assets of the 
schemes are held separately from those of the Group 
in independently administered funds. The amount 
charged to the income statement represents the 
contributions payable to the schemes in respect  
of the accounting period.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the Project Unit Credit 
Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out 
at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement 
comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of 
the asset ceiling and the return on scheme assets 
(excluding interest) are recognised immediately in 
the balance sheet with a charge to the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they 
occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement of 
comprehensive income is not recycled. Net-interest 
income (or expense) is recognised within finance costs 
and is calculated by applying a discount rate to the 
net defined benefit liability. The Group presents the 
administration costs of the scheme in other operating 
costs in its consolidated income statement.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the 
consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit in the 
Group’s defined benefit schemes. If a surplus resulted 
from this calculation it would be limited to the present 
value of any economic benefit available in the form 
of refund from the schemes or reduction in future 
contributions to the schemes.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees 
and others providing similar services are measured 
at the fair value of the equity instruments at the 
grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-
market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the 
determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-
based transactions are set out in note 32.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed  
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect 
of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact 
of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative 
expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated 
as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to 
the scheme. This results in accelerated recognition of 
the expense that would have arisen over the remainder 
of the original vesting period.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability 
is recognised for the good or services required, 
measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At 
each balance sheet date until the liability is settled and 
at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is 
remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised 
in profit or loss for the year.
4.  Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting 
policies, which are described in note 3, the directors 
are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and other factors that 
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s 
accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from 
those involving estimations (which are dealt with 
separately below), that the directors have made in the 
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies 
and that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in financial statements: 94 Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16
in October 2014 where the appeal cases of Dawson v 
Thompson Airways and Huzar versus Jet 2 concluded 
that technical issues should be included within the 
ambit of this regulation. In essence, airlines are 
required to compensate passengers where delays 
in arrival, greater than three hours, are deemed to 
have been under the control of the airline – including 
technical delays. Claims may go back six years.
We estimate the full liability associated with this 
regulation based on the number of passengers 
delayed and the average compensation due.  
The claim rate associated with this liability is  
then estimated based on historical experience  
and expected claim rates. This adjusted liability  
is then provide for in the period of the delay. 
In 2014/15, a historical catch up provision was created 
on the basis of the October 2014 appeal case. This 
has then been adjusted over the period as payments 
have been made for historical claims and an additional 
liability has been provided for associated with 
incremental compensation liability. The outstanding 
liability estimated at 31st March 2016 was £1.1m.
Employee benefits
Accounting for pensions and other post–retirement 
benefits involves judgement about uncertain events 
including, but not limited to, discount rates, life 
expectancy, future pay inflation and expected health 
care cost trend rates. Determination of the projected 
benefit obligations for the Group’s defined benefit 
scheme is important to the recorded amount of benefit 
expense in the income statement and valuation of the 
balance sheet. Details of the assumptions used are 
included in note 33. Any change in these assumptions 
could potentially result in a significant change to the 
pension assets/(liabilities), commitments and pension 
costs in future periods.
5. Discontinued operations
On 11th November 2014, the Group entered into a sale 
agreement to dispose of its share in the joint venture, 
Flybe Finland. The disposal was completed on 31st 
March 2015, on which date control of the Group’s share 
of Flybe Finland passed to the acquirer.
The loss for the year from discontinued operations  
was as follows:

operation (see below) – (2.2)

Interest received on joint 
venture associated loan – 0.2
– (12.0)
4.  Critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty 
continued
Aircraft maintenance
On acquisition of an aircraft, a proportion of the cost  
of the aircraft is allocated to engines and other material 
components with different useful lives to the airframe. 
Judgement is required to determine the amount of cost 
to allocate based on the estimated cost of overhauling 
the components, and the time between maintenance 
events. This judgement affects the amounts recognised 
as a depreciation expense given the different useful 
lives of the components.
For aircraft held under operating leases, the Group has a 
commitment to return the aircraft in a specific maintenance 
condition at the end of the lease term. Estimating the 
provision for maintenance costs requires judgement as 
to the cost and timing of future maintenance events. 
This estimate is based on planned usage of the aircraft, 
contractual obligations under lease agreements, industry 
experience, manufacturers’ guidance and regulations.  
Any change in these assumptions could potentially result 
in a significant change to the maintenance provisions and 
costs in future periods.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities 
based on the temporary differences between the 
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets 
are reviewed regularly to assess potential realisation, 
and where the directors believe that realisation is not 
probable, that portion of the asset is not recorded. 
In performing this review, Flybe makes estimates 
and assumptions regarding projected future taxable 
income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing 
temporary differences and the implementation of tax 
planning strategies. A change in these assumptions 
could cause an increase or decrease in the amount 
recognised resulting in an increase or decrease in 
the effective tax rate, which could materially impact 
the results of operations. As a result of the Group’s 
performance, the net deferred tax asset has increased 
from £8.6m to £11.3m at 31st March 2016 (see note 24).
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other 
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance 
sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below.
Passenger delay compensation 
In 2005, EU261 was promulgated, requiring airlines 
to provide flight delay compensation for passengers 
at predetermined rates. Uncertainty over the types 
of delay leading to compensation was finally clarified

Financial statements
No gain or loss arose on the disposal of the Group’s 
share of Flybe Finland, being the difference between 
the proceeds of disposal and the carrying amount of the 
Group’s investment in the joint venture. The investment 
had been written down to €1 as at 30th September 
2014, and an impairment of £10.0m recorded.
The results of the discontinued operations, which 
have been included in the 2015 consolidated income 
statement, were as follows:

6. Business and geographical segments
During the previous financial year, the Group’s divisions 
were removed and the business was refocused into 
One Flybe. Under IFRS 8, Flybe reports two business 
segments in order to comply with accounting 
standards. 
The chief operating decision-maker responsible 
for resource allocation and assessing performance 
of operating segments has been identified as the 
Executive Committee. Operating segments are reported 
in a manner which is consistent with internal reporting 
provided to the chief operating decision-maker:
Flybe UK This business segment comprises the 
Group’s main scheduled UK domestic and 
UK-Europe passenger operations and 
revenue ancillary to the provision of those 
services.

For the purposes of monitoring segment performance 
and allocation of resources between segments, the 
Executive Committee monitors the tangible, intangible 
and financial assets attributable to each segment. All 
assets are allocated to reportable segments with the 
exception of revalued open fuel and foreign exchange 
derivatives, and tax assets and liabilities. Assets used 
jointly by reportable segments are allocated on the basis 
of the revenue earned by individual reportable segments.

1   Assets with a net book value of £0.1m were reclassified between 
aircraft, plant, equipment and motor vehicles and land and buildings 
in the year. There was no impact on the income statement or the 
balance sheet.
2  Assets with a net book value of £0.4m (2015: £nil) were reclassified 
to intangible fixed assets. There was no impact on total balance 
sheet or the income statement.
An impairment review was performed at the balance 
sheet date to determine whether these assets 
were impaired. Separate cash-generating units are 
established for Flybe UK and FAS. For Flybe UK, the 
recoverable amount was calculated using a value in  
use model and determined to be higher than the 
assets’ recoverable amount by £62.6m and no 
impairment was required. The key assumption in the 
review of Flybe UK was the weighted average cost of 
capital used of 10.0%. Only when the weighted average 
cost of capital is increased to 15% does the recoverable 
amount equal its carrying amount.
Included above are fully depreciated assets with an 
original cost of £24.8m (2015: £25.1m).
In 2014/15 aircraft additions, disposals and 
depreciation costs have been restated to show the 
gross movement on the maintenance assets. These 
were previously reported as a net cost movement of 
£3.9m and a net depreciation movement of £2.2m.

Academy building, a national training centre for the 
airline industry. 
Government grants were provided by the South West 
of England Regional Development Agency and the 
Learning Skills Council (and its successor). These 
institutions may be entitled to claw back all or part 
of the grant up to 31st December 2020 if the Group 
ceases to operate the building as a training centre 
providing education and training to internal and 
external delegates.
18. Trade and other receivables continued
An amount of £2.1m was reclassified in 2015 between 
trade receivables and amounts recoverable on 
contracts in line with 2016. There is no impact on the 
total income statement or balance sheet.
Other receivables include maintenance debtors under 
one year and other debtors.
Trade receivables disclosed above are classified as 
loans and receivables and are therefore measured at 
amortised cost.
Trade receivables include amounts (see below for 
aged analysis) which are past due at the reporting date 
but against which the Group has not recognised an 
allowance for doubtful receivables because there has 
not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts continue to be considered recoverable.
No impairment was recognised in the year to

Where carried forward losses or unclaimed capital allowances are available, they are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group recognised deferred tax assets primarily on previously unrecognised 
losses or unutilised capital allowances. The recognition of an asset, as well as the composition of that asset, was 
a result of management’s judgement that it was probable that it would realise such deferred tax assets in future 
periods, when taking into consideration the availability of feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future 
taxable income in which these operating losses and other tax attributes exist.
The Group has significant deferred assets due to the accumulation of accelerated capital allowances in prior 
periods. The realisation of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable 
income in the future. The directors have exercised judgement in determining the extent of the realisation of these 
losses based upon estimates of future taxable income. Where there is an expectation that on the balance of 
probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilise these assets, they have not been recognised.
£13.0m of deferred tax assets have not been recognised in the year (2014/15: £13.0m). If actual events differ from 
the directors’ estimates, or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future, any recognition in the 
future of previously generated assets would have a material impact on the Group’s effective tax rates.

Aircraft maintenance provisions are made in respect 
of contractual obligations to maintain aircraft under 
operating lease contracts. The amount and timing of 
the maintenance costs are dependent on future usage 
of the relevant aircraft. Typically this will be utilised 
within two years. The additional provision in the year 
is included within maintenance charges shown in the 
consolidated income statement.
Onerous lease provisions are made in respect of the 
present obligation arising under an onerous contract. 
The provision recognised is for any unavoidable net 
loss arising from the contract, being the lower of the 
cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation  
or penalties arising from failure to fulfill the contract. 
The £0.7m onerous lease provision at 31st March 2015 
was in respect of an E195 aircraft. This provision was 
utilised in the year. The £0.7m onerous lease provision 
at 31st March 2016 is in respect of office buildings. 
Provision is made for passenger compensation claims 
when the group has an obligation to recompense 
customers under regulation EU261 where issues have 
caused flights to be delayed. Provisions are measured 
based on known eligible flights delays and historic 
claim rates and are expected to unwind across the 
claim window, which is six years. The majority of 
claims paid in the year were as a result of court rulings 
clarifying the liability; these included current and prior 
period claims.

the market value of an ordinary share on the third 
anniversary of grant. Market value on a particular 
date will be calculated by reference to an average of 
the closing price of an ordinary share for the three 
months prior to such date. The closing price at the 
third anniversary of the grant date in respect of an LTIP 
Award may not exceed 400% of the opening price and 
therefore will be capped at the amount equal to 400% 
of the opening price.
The vesting of LTIP Awards granted will be conditional 
upon the achievement of an objective performance 
target set at the time of grant. It is intended that the 
performance target will be that the closing price in 
respect of an LTIP Award at the first vesting date must 
exceed a predetermined level.

At 31st March 2016, all members of the Flybe LTIP 2013 
had left the Company and therefore all share awards 
have been forfeited. Less than £0.1m was credited to 
the income statement (2015: less than £0.1m charge) 
and the LTIP liability fully released (2015: £0.1m liability).
The Saad Hammad LTIP (‘SH Plan’)
Mr. Hammad is the sole participant under the SH Plan, 
which is specifically designed in order to incentivise 
him to grow the market capitalisation of the Company 
over a three-year performance period commencing on 
the date that he joined the Company.
The award made under the terms of the SH Plan 
entitles Mr. Hammad to receive a cash payment 
depending upon the extent to which the performance 
conditions have been satisfied, over a three-year 
performance period commencing on the date that 
he joined the Company. The performance condition 
is that the market capitalisation of the Company at 
the end of the performance period must be greater 
than the market capitalisation of the Company at the 
start of the performance period. If this condition is not 
satisfied, no payment will be made. See the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 75 for further details.
The LTIP award was granted on 1st August 2013. 
Fair value of the award at 31st March 2016 has been 
calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model.  
The inputs into the valuation are as follows:
30. Operating lease arrangements

The 2015 aircraft numbers were previously reported  
at budget rate. These have been restated to reflect the 
actual exchange rate as at 31st March 2015. There is no 
impact on the income statement or balance sheet.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The Flybe LTIP 2013
All employees of the Group may be granted Flybe LTIP 
2013 Awards (‘LTIP Award’). No directors of the Company 
may be granted an LTIP Award under this scheme.
Awards granted take the form of a conditional right to 
receive a cash amount, the value of which is calculated 
by reference to the number of ordinary shares which 
are notionally subject to an LTIP Award multiplied 
by the increase in the market value of an ordinary 
share between the date of grant (unless determined 
otherwise by the Remuneration Committee) and

remaining at 31st March 2016 was 1.3 years.
The Philip de Klerk LTIP 
Mr. de Klerk is the sole participant under the Philip 
de Klerk LTIP. On 22nd August 2014, Philip de Klerk 
was awarded a notional number of Flybe shares that 
entitle him to a cash payment equivalent to the gain 
in share price over a three-year period, subject to the 
three-month average share price at the end of the 
three-year period exceeding 161.26p. See the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 75 for further details.
To the extent the award vests, 50% of the cash 
payment will vest immediately at the end of the three-
year performance period, 25% will vest six months 
after the end of the performance period, with the 
remaining 25% vesting 12 months after the end of 
the performance period.
The LTIP award was granted on 22nd August 2014. 
Fair value of the award at 31st March 2016 has been 
calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The

Less than £0.1m was credited to the income statement 
(2015: less than £0.1m charge) as a result of the movement 
in the LTIP liability from less than £0.1m at 31st March 2015 
to be less than £0.1m at 31st March 2016. Contractual life 
remaining at 31st March 2016 was 2.4 years.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The Company has a share award scheme under which all employees of the Group may be granted awards. 
Awards are exercisable at nil consideration. The vesting period is three years and awards are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the awards vest. 
The vesting of these awards is subject to the performance of a Flybe share price hurdle at the end of the three-
year period. Awards will vest in full if Flybe’s three-month average share price at the end of the three-year 
performance period has met the performance hurdle.

all employees with a length of service more than 
three months at 14th April 2014 and provided for an 
employee to be granted an option when entering into 
a savings contract (‘SAYE Contract’). The eligible 
employees are able to save a regular sum each month 
for a three-year period of not less than £5 and not 
more than £100. An option to acquire ordinary shares 
will be granted to each eligible employee who entered 
into the SAYE Contract. On 8th August 2014, 1,659,467

Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit scheme operated by the Group 
was acquired on 5th March 2007 as part of the 
acquisition of BA Connect. The scheme was closed to 
contributions during that year and its members now 
contribute to the Group’s defined contribution scheme. 
The estimated amount of contributions expected to be 
paid to the scheme in the next financial year is £0.5m 
(current year: £0.5m). At 31st March 2016, the net 
deficit has been recognised in the balance sheet.
The triennial valuation is carried out for the Trustee by 
a professionally qualified independent actuary. The 
purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to 
ensure that the scheme has sufficient funds available 
to meet future benefit payments. The latest funding 
valuation was performed as at 31st March 2013 and 
showed a deficit of approximately £7.0m. The Group is 
currently paying deficit contributions of £0.5m which, 
along with the investment returns from return-seeking 
assets, is expected to make good this shortfall by  
31st March 2023. A valuation at 31st March 2016  
is underway and is expected to be completed by 
Summer 2017.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the 
actuarial valuation were as follows:

Key assumptions used:
Discount rate 3.7 3.5
Future pension increases 3.5/2.0 3.5/2.1
RPI inflation 3.1 3.1
The post-retirement mortality rate assumed at 31st 
March 2016 was based on the Small Area Population 
Statistics (‘SAPS’) tables with a minus one year age 
rating and the Continuous Mortality Investigation 
(‘CMI’) 2015 long-term rate projections of 1.5% p.a. for 
males and 1.25% p.a. for females (2015: the mortality 
rate was also based on SAPS).

Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
> > The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded  
on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
> > The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined 
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable 
current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
> > The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, 
a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments 
for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward 
contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future  
cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16  109
Financial statements
Financial instruments recorded at fair value at 
31st March 2016
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to 
initial recognition at fair value are grouped into Levels 
1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is 
observable:
> > Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived 
from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities;
> > Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived 
from inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices); and
> > Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived 
from valuation techniques that include inputs for the 
asset or liability that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs).

Foreign exchange derivatives 8.8 14.3
Margin calls 1.3 8.3
Fuel derivatives (20.0) (29.8)
At 31st March (9.9) (7.2)
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from 
banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under 
finance leases, as well as other non-current financial 
liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows 
using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, 
credit risk and remaining maturities. 
Financial risk management objectives
The Group is exposed to financial risks in respect of:
> > liquidity and management of working capital;
> > foreign currency;
> > interest rates;
> > credit risk; and
> > commodities.
A description of each risk, together with the policy for 
managing risk, is given below. To manage these risks, 
the Group uses various derivative financial instruments, 
including foreign currency forward contracts and 
commodity contracts. These derivative financial 
instruments are generally held to maturity and are 
not actively traded. The Group enters into these 
arrangements with the goal of hedging its operational 
and balance sheet, income statements and cash flow 
risk. However, the Group’s exposure to commodity 
price and currency exchange fluctuations cannot  
be neutralised completely.
Liquidity and working capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities 
in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns 
while maximising the return to stakeholders through 
the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.  
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings (see note 22), cash and 
cash equivalents (see note 19) and equity attributable 
to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued 
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and  
notes 26 to 28.
Capital management and gearing ratio
The Group Board reviews the capital structure on 
a regular basis. As part of this review, the Board 
considered the cost of capital and the risks associated 
with each class of capital. The gearing ratio at the year-
end is as follows:
2016 
£m
2015

Debt (109.2) (119.2)

restricted cash 171.4 195.9
Net cash 62.2 76.7
Equity 154.2 140.0
Net debt to equity ratio (40.3)% (54.8)%
Debt is defined as long-term and short-term 
borrowings as detailed in note 22. Equity includes all 
capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity 
holders of the parent. 110 Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16

Liquidity risk management
The directors believe that the Group has adequate cash holdings to meet its short-term creditors as they fall 
due. The Group also arranges to borrow funds in order to finance purchase of aircraft and engines. The following

Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the leasing and purchase 
of aircraft, spare parts and fuel in US dollars. Hence, significant exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise to 
US dollars. In addition, certain sales and airport costs are incurred in euros. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved parameters by entering into a series of foreign exchange 
forward contracts. These contracts are used in conjunction with fuel derivatives to mitigate fuel procurement 
price risk. In addition, foreign exchange forward contracts are matched to planned purchases of aircraft, spare 
parts and lease costs. It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover 
specific US dollar payments to cover up to 90% of the exposure generated.
The Group does not enter into significant euro foreign exchange forward contracts as the euro payment exposure 
is largely, though not entirely, offset by euro revenue receipts. There were no euro contracts at 31st March 2016 or 
31st March 2015.

Cash flow hedge effectiveness
The Group designates certain hedges of foreign 
exchange and fuel price risks on firm commitments 
as cash flow hedges. At 31st March 2016, the Group 
has identified 166 (2015: 99) contracts for foreign 
exchange purchases and 151 (2015: 102) contracts for 
fuel purchases which have been designated as cash 
flow hedges. For these hedges, the changes in the fair 
value of the financial instrument were compared to 
market movement in the underlying hedged item and 
were found to be an effective offset. As a result an 
increase in the fair value of these financial derivative 
instruments of £4.2m (2015: decrease £7.9m) was 
taken to equity through the hedging reserve.
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group 
borrows funds in order to finance the purchase of 
aircraft and engines at both fixed and floating interest 
rates. The risk is managed by the Group maintaining an 
appropriate mix that varies from time-to-time between 
fixed and floating rate borrowings based on current 
year conditions and debt levels.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates in financial 
assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the liquidity 
risk management section of this note.
It is estimated that a general increase/(decrease) in 
interest rates would (worsen)/improve the Group’s 
result before tax and (decrease)/increase its equity  
by approximately:
2016 2015
Percentage increase 1% 1%
Impact on profit/(loss) before 
tax and equity (£m) (1.1) (1.2)
Credit risk management
Disclosures in respect of credit risk management for 
trade and other receivables are provided in note 18.
The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from cash 
and deposits, derivative financial instruments and 
trade and other receivables. The risk of loss of value 
due to a counterparty default is minimised by entering 
into transactions with counterparties that have a 
minimum credit rating of A (or equivalent) as awarded 
by Moody’s, Fitch or Standard and Poor’s. In addition, 
counterparties with a credit rating of B or above can be 
used provided the exposure to that institution does not 
exceed £5.0m.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is all financial 
assets plus any financial guarantees.
Commodity price risk management
The Group purchases fuel on the open market from 
recognised fuel suppliers in order to operate its fleet 
of aircraft and this constitutes a substantial portion of 
the Group’s activities (approximately 17.1% and 18.7% of 
Flybe UK segment costs in the years ended 31st March 
2016 and 2015 respectively). The Group engages in fuel 
price hedging and foreign exchange transactions from 
time to time to meet its policy of entering into forward 
fuel price exchange contracts and other related financial 
instruments to cover a significant percentage of its 
anticipated requirements for fuel over a 12-month period.
Aviation fuel is a variable cost which has had a material 
impact on the Group’s results during the period under 
review. A variety of external factors, such as changes 
in supply and demand for oil and oil-related products 
and the increasing role of speculators and funds in 
the futures markets, have played their part in making 
aviation fuel prices highly volatile. It is fuel price 
volatility which is the main driver of variances in the 
Group’s overall fuel costs.
The Group operates a policy during normal trading 
conditions of managing this volatility by entering into 
derivative contracts representing a portion of its aviation 
fuel requirements a minimum of 12 months forward.
The actual amount covered by such contracts 
amounted to 90% of the following year’s budgeted fuel 
consumption as at 31st March 2016 (2015: 70%).

The actual number of emissions credits purchased 
for calendar year 2015 amounted to 503.7 tonnes, 
including free allowances of 222.8 tonnes; the average 
price of the purchased allowances was €6.33.
Carbon emissions requirements for calendar year 2016 
are currently expected to amount to 507.2 tonnes 
including free allowances of 222.8 tonnes. So far the 
Group has purchased 100% of its requirement for 2016 
at an average cost of €7.36.

The Group uses fuel derivatives to mitigate those

37. Post balance sheet event
Flybe’s stated strategy, as announced in our capital 
raise two years ago, is to rebalance its aircraft 
fleet away from operating leases towards outright 
ownership, which brings cost savings. In line with this, 
Flybe took ownership in February 2016 of three Q400 
aircraft, previously on operating leases, from Rand 
Merchant Bank (RMB) for a cash consideration of 
£24.4m. Flybe took out debt against these aircraft  
in May 2016 of USD 23m.
Flybe has entered into a contract with Nordic Aviation 
Capital (NAC) to cancel obligations to lease nine used 
Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft, while taking 
ownership of 10 Q400 aircraft it was under contract 
to lease, for a cash consideration of c£86m, with 
delivery and consideration to take place over the next 
12 months. The contract has a number of conditions 
that still remain to be satisfied at this time. 114 Flybe Group plc Annual report and Accounts 2015/16

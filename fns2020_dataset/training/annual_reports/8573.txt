Content for the future
ITV continues to attract the largest commercial audiences in 
the UK because of the high quality, range and popularity of 
the programmes it broadcasts. 
ITV1 has had a strong year in drama and entertainment. 
Coronation Street continues to be the nation’s favourite
programme attracting, on average, more than 11 million viewers.
Emmerdale is outperforming its rivals, beating EastEnders each
of the six times they went head to head in 2005.
I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! and The X Factor returned

Customer focused
We reorganised the Company in 2005 so that we are now able 
to serve the needs of our advertisers better than ever before. 
ITV continues to lead the UK TV advertising market and works 
with Thinkbox, the marketing body for all the UK commercial
broadcasters, to demonstrate to advertisers the unrivalled
strengths, value and effectiveness of television as an 
advertising medium.  The average viewer
watches 3.6 hours of
television per day, with
the potential exposure 
to 15 minutes of adverts
per day, or 4 days of
adverts per year or 
300 days of adverts in 
a lifetime.
Television is the UK’s 
no. 1 leisure activity. In an
average week commercial
TV reaches 92% of adults,
compared to only 64% 
for commercial radio. 
On average there are 
4 million admissions to
the cinema each week,
whilst in an average 
week ITV1 alone reaches
25 million viewers by the
end of Monday.
ITV Commercial has
launched more than 500

New revenue streams
Our viewers increasingly want to engage directly with ITV and 
its programmes. In 2005 we created a team to focus on developing
services that consumers value, giving them more ways to connect
with ITV and generate new revenue streams. ITV’s online presence
was greatly strengthened by the acquisition of Friends Reunited. 
It brings online expertise and a portfolio of popular and proﬁtable
online businesses to ITV. ITV also acquired the Freeview multiplex
SDN. ITV now operates 38% of the valuable commercial digital
terrestrial capacity. ITV Mobile screens video clips of popular shows
such as Coronation Street, The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity…Get
Me Out Of Here!
In 2005 we began broadcasting a number of “participation TV”
formats on ITV1 and ITV2, including Quizmania and Play Sudoku.
These programmes invite viewers to call in to take part in a variety
of quizzes, puzzles and games to win cash prizes, and have proved
very popular with viewers. Building on this success, ITV will launch
the ITV Play brand in 2006 with its own TV channel and presence
on ITV.com and ITV Mobile.
The ITV Local trial, delivering quality local television content over
broadband, also began in the Meridian region in 2005.

TV for toddlers to pre-teens Building new businesses 
and revenue streams
We have made real progress in:
• expanding the audience for our growing
television channels;
• building our production business 
and exploiting our content across 
all platforms and media; and
• developing new businesses and revenue
streams in pay and consumer areas.
Every part of the Group has contributed 
to this success.
In broadcasting we have seen tremendous
success for our new channels and growing
sponsorship and interactive revenues.
In production we have continued to grow
our UK sales to other broadcasters and we
are expanding our proﬁtable US and
Australian production businesses with
commissions for network broadcasters.
Our new consumer team has launched
a number of successful ventures in
2005, which will enable us to grow our
non-advertising revenues. In 2005 we
acquired SDN and Friends Reunited.
These acquisitions support our strategy;
with SDN providing long term digital
terrestrial transmission capacity and
already growing in value, and Friends
Reunited increasing customers for its
content based services and building
communities through cross promotion
from television. Organic growth is increasing
from our interactive revenues, with ITV Play
making a very promising start.
Chairman’s statement
16 ITV plc 2005 annual report
In ITV’s second year as a single Company
we have continued to build on last year’s
progress, further improving our structure
and our proﬁtability.
2005 results
After a good ﬁrst half our operating proﬁt
before amortisation and exceptional items
continued to grow in the second half of the
year, and for the full year is up by 42% on
last year to £460 million before exceptionals
and amortisation. Earnings per share
(before amortisation and exceptional items)
increased by 25% to 8.0 pence (up 54% to
5.4 pence after amortisation and
exceptional items).
Your Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of
1.8 pence per share payable on 3 July 2006
to shareholders on the register on
21 April 2006. The ex-dividend date will be
19 April 2006. This will increase the full year
dividend by 30% to 3.12 pence compared
to 2004, and will help achieve our stated
aim of rebalancing the levels of interim and
ﬁnal dividend over the medium term such
that the interim will ultimately represent
approximately one-third of the total
dividend.
Cash return to shareholders
In 2005 we reviewed the possibility of
returning cash to our shareholders and
concluded that before doing so we should:
• complete the process of renewing the
ﬁnancial terms of our ITV1 licences; and
• address the deﬁcit funding of our deﬁned
beneﬁt pension schemes.
We have now completed those processes
and have the capacity to return
£300 million to shareholders. We propose 
to do this over the coming few months by
way of market purchase of ordinary shares.
We are making real progress in:
• expanding the audience for our 
growing channels;
• building our production business 
and exploiting content; and
• developing new businesses and 
revenue streams.
  Regulation
We have made some signiﬁcant progress in
bringing regulation up to date; but we still
have a long way to go before we are as free
of regulation as our main competitors.
Our licence payments to the government
were reviewed in 2005 by our regulator,
Ofcom, and as a result were reduced from 
a pro forma ﬁgure of £207 million in 
2004 to £75 million in 2005. Over the
period to digital switchover they will
continue to reduce towards £4 million 
in constant prices.
Our Public Service Broadcasting (“PSB”)
obligations still cost nearly £250 million 
a year including programme costs and
revenue foregone during lower rating 
PSB programmes. Whilst we have recently
received some dispensation to reduce our
commitments to, for instance, the hours 
of religious and regional programming, 
we still have to bear costs which are both
disproportionate to the ratings achieved
from such material and almost unique 
to ITV as a commercial broadcaster. It is
essential that we are able to reduce these
PSB costs further over the medium term.
Contract Rights Renewal (“CRR”) is a 
further burden that has had the unintended
consequence of changing the way that 
our advertising market works. Our ITV1
advertisers now contract to deliver to us 
the share of broadcast expenditure
calculated under CRR and we therefore
have fewer opportunities to take advantage
of strengths in our schedule such as the
Football World Cup during 2006. We will
continue to lobby for CRR, which has
become a disproportionate remedy, to 
be relaxed as the share of the market that
ITV1 attracts is reduced by the growing 
multichannel universe. 
Corporate governance and CR
We are publishing a corporate responsibility
report for 2005 which sets out the detail of
our activities across the Group. ITV was the
highest contributor to charitable causes in
both the 2005 Guardian Giving List and
Business in the Community Percent Club,
ranking contributions to charitable causes
as a percentage of proﬁts of FTSE 100
companies. A large part of ITV’s giving 
is supplied as airtime across our family 
of channels.
Pension schemes
We are in a period of unprecedented
pressures on companies’ deﬁned beneﬁt
(“DB”) pension schemes.
Over recent years the factors to which
scheme deﬁcits have been exposed have
included increasing life expectancy of
members and falling world equity markets.
The most material factor now is the level 
of UK long term real interest rates where 
a small reduction can have a large impact
by increasing the net present value of a
scheme’s liabilities.
Our work on the DB pension schemes has
continued during 2005:
a) Scheme mergers
We have merged six DB schemes in the
Group into a single scheme with savings 
in cost and improved focus.
b) Deﬁcit funding and IAS 19 valuations
We have completed the £325 million of
deﬁcit funding that we announced in
September 2005, with the last tranche 
of £207 million paid early in 2006. Our IAS
19 aggregate deﬁcit has reduced during
2005 from £672 million to £532 million 
and the last £207 million reduces that 
to £325 million.
c) Tax simpliﬁcation
We have considered how we should deal
with aspects of the tax simpliﬁcation
regime coming into effect on 6 April 2006.
We will not separately compensate any
executives for this change, but will establish
alternate arrangements designed to leave
both individuals and the Group in a broadly
similar position.
Further details relating to the Group’s
pension schemes are given later in 
these accounts.
People
Henry Staunton will be stepping down from
the Board on 31 March 2006 after 13 years
as Finance Director, ﬁrst of Granada and
then of ITV. The Board would like to thank 
Henry for his contribution to the Company
and for his expertise in the mergers and
acquisitions that have formed it.
John Cresswell, our Chief Operating Ofﬁcer
since 2005, joined the Board in January and
is now our Finance Director. John has 
18 years of experience in operational and
ﬁnancial roles in television companies which 
will be of great assistance to us as we deal
with the many changes facing our industry.
I am pleased to welcome Mike Clasper, 
who joined the Board in January, as a
non-executive director. Mike has experience
in running service businesses, as well as in
advertising and marketing, that will be
valuable to us. David Chance stepped down
from the Board in February 2006. As his
involvement in other television ventures
has developed over recent months, he
decided that it was appropriate for him to
resign from the Board. We wish David well
with his future ventures.
Once again I would like to extend the
Board’s thanks to our management and
employees whose continued commitment
and drive make ITV the nation’s favourite
commercial broadcaster.

The Company will commence 
a programme of returning £300m
cash to shareholders over the
coming months by way of market
purchase of ordinary shares. During 2005 we have continued with our
programme of developing our business
and changing our operations to enable us
to take advantage of the rapidly evolving
digital television world. In early 2006 we
re-branded our operations, from a fresh
new look onscreen for our channels
through to new signage and logo for our
ITV production business. The feedback
from our viewers has been very positive.
Improving and simplifying our structure
During 2005 we made some changes to
simplify our management and structure,
and increase the focus on our core business.
Simon Shaps as Director of Television now
heads up our channels operations and he
has brought in a number of key new
commissioning executives. He is also
increasing the emphasis on US programme
acquisitions across all our channels.
Ian McCulloch heads up the commercial
operations, contracting with our
advertisers and marketing our channels 
and programmes. His role is to build
relationships directly with our advertising
customers, and to address the challenge 
of reducing the burden that CRR places
upon us.
Owning content and intellectual property
rights is key to ITV’s future success and
John Whiston, amongst our most talented
of programme makers, now heads up the
ITV production operation.
Jeff Henry has been developing our
consumer operations with a number of
successful organic developments and
acquisitions which are explained later.
We are also recruiting for a new head 
of our international production and
distribution operations.
Freeview growth
Freeview was the fastest growing
broadcasting platform across 2005 with
three-quarters of all households that went
digital choosing Freeview. We are actively
promoting our channels, both on air and in
other display media, and expect Freeview
rapidly to become the UK’s number one
digital television platform in 2006.
We acquired SDN in April 2005 for
£136 million. This acquisition boosts our
digital strategy (ITV now operates 38% 
of commercial DTT bandwidth). SDN
contributed £16 million of revenue in eight
months of 2005. The market rate for a
videostream in DTT has been increasing
and videostream contract renewals for SDN
begin in 2008. SDN has been an extremely
proﬁtable acquisition for our shareholders.
Channel schedule performance
Our new digital channels continued to grow
their audience share and in November 2005
we launched our latest channel, ITV4. This
channel is aimed at a male demographic
and its schedule includes a higher
proportion of US acquired material than our
other channels. ITV4 has attracted a 0.5%
share of multichannel viewing in its early
months on screen. ITV2 and ITV3 have
increased their viewing share in 2005 and
our share of commercial viewing across all
our channels in multichannel homes
increased by 7% to 32%.
As viewers move to the greater channel
choice available on digital television, the
viewing share of ITV1 inevitably decreases.
Under the CRR undertakings, agreed with
the Ofﬁce of Fair Trading as part of the 
ITV merger, the consequence of that is 
a proportionate decrease in the ITV1 
share of television advertising revenue.
During 2005 our ITV1 advertising revenue
was £50 million lower than in 2004.
The success of our new business operations
helped to increase our pro forma revenues
outside ITV1 advertising by £144 million
in 2005, more than offsetting the ITV1
reduction and increasing our revenues
from these sources from 27% of the total
last year to 33% of the total in 2005.
Chief Executive’s review
We are simplifying our operational
structure to increase the focus on
our core business, introducing key
new commissioning executives.
18 ITV plc 2005 annual report As digital television approaches universal
takeup in the near future, the downward
pressure on ITV1 viewing share and
revenues will slow, enabling ITV1 to return
to growth alongside our rapidly growing
digital channels.
In December, we took the difﬁcult decision
to close the ITV News Channel, as the
increasing opportunity cost of digital
transmission capacity made running a
commercial 24 hour news channel
economically unviable.
Developing non-ITV production assets 
in the UK and overseas
ITV productions had a very successful year,
we created Sex Trafﬁc for C4, Casanova for
the BBC, another series of Brainiac for Sky
and Countdown for C4.
International production (part of ITV
Worldwide) had another excellent year. 
In America we made Hell’s Kitchen and
Nanny 911 for Fox, both US primetime
shows that will return, Hit Me Baby for NBC,
Airline and 1st 48 for A&E and Roomraiders
for MTV. In Australia and Germany we
made a number of primetime shows for
the top broadcasters. We are able to create
and produce hits for international
broadcasters, increase our market share
and add the new material to our media
catalogue and distribution business.
We have increased the proﬁtability of
Granada International and extended our
third party distribution sales worldwide.
This includes such clients as HBO, Aardman,
CNN and Chorion. We have begun the
digitisation of our media catalogue and
have been trialling video-on-demand which
should develop into a new means of
content exploitation.
Growing consumer revenues
A major focus for ITV is the development 
of our consumer operations; those parts 
of our business that deliver products and
services directly to viewers who pay for
them through subscription, transactional 
or interactive revenues.
ITV Play is the brand name for a portfolio 
of “participation” TV formats designed to
engage our mass-market audiences in
high-quality original interactive
programming. ITV Play has been trialling
across our Channels in night time. We will
be launching a dedicated channel in April.
This has proved to be very popular and 
we are currently developing more Play
programming and formats which will be
shown across our family of channels
including online and mobile.
We have acquired Friends Reunited, the
UK’s leading reunion website. There are 
ﬁve separate business strands: the Schools
reunion site; Genes Reunited; dating and
jobs sites; and Connections, a general chat
room and message board site. The dating
and jobs sites can already be found within
our existing itv.com environment and we
are seeing increased trafﬁc as a result.
itv.com is ITV’s broadband site. Our aim
is to create a content-rich multimedia
proposition. itv.com will be restructured 
and relaunched as a broadband content 
on demand portal later in 2006; improving
functionality and consumer experience.
This will increase dwell times and stickiness
to drive subscription and advertising
revenues. Internet advertising is increasing
rapidly, and is likely to have overtaken radio
and outdoor in 2006.
ITV is a producer-broadcaster. We believe
that there will be an increasing competition
in Local Loop unbundling and that prices for
bandwidth will be driven towards marginal
cost. Consumers will pay for content, and
we will strive to ensure that in this world 
of convergence, where viewers may be able
to receive content via cable, satellite, DTT,
broadband or mobile, that ITV’s brand and
content are available for them to enjoy.

Outlook
In 2005 our ﬁrst quarter advertising revenue
was particularly strong with Easter falling 
in March.
In 2006 both Easter and the Football World
Cup fall in the second quarter and will move
money into that period. As a result
advertising revenue has been lower in the
ﬁrst few months of 2006 and total ITV
advertising revenue will be down by
approximately 10% in the ﬁrst quarter.
In April we expect that ITV1 advertising
revenue will be up 2% year on year and 
our total advertising revenue will be up 
6% year on year.
People
I would like to join with Sir Peter Burt and
the rest of the Board in thanking all of our
employees for their continuing work and
dedication to the Company and to our
programmes and services. The broadcasting
world is seeing more change than many
other industries and we continue to lead
and embrace that change as we move
towards a fully digital environment in
which viewers are able to increase the level
of personalisation of their viewing from
more channels and prospectively from
delivery systems such as broadband.
We look forward to these changes and to
remaining the producer and broadcaster 
of many of the nation’s favourite shows.
Charles Allen CBE
Chief Executive Operating review 
In 2005 ITV celebrated its 50th anniversary.
It was a year not only to look back on 50
years of broadcasting but to celebrate the
success and quality of programming on ITV
today. We celebrated this landmark year
with some special 50th anniversary
programming including The Story of ITV:
The People’s Channel – a documentary
presented by Melvyn Bragg; 49 Up – a
special programme about the lives of a
group of people and their expectations for
the future. The programme was ﬁrst shown
as Seven Up when they were children and
has been revisited every seven years
including 2005 as they approach their 
half century.
2005 has seen ITV successfully adapt to the
demands of a digital world. We have moved
away from a business focused on a single
analogue channel to one that is capable 
of delivering content through different
methods and across different platforms. 
In a world where we are seeing an
increasing consolidation, convergence and
commoditisation of technology, quality
content is becoming increasingly valuable.
Content
As a producer-broadcaster ITV generates 
a signiﬁcant amount of content in-house
(65% of original commissions for ITV1). 
ITV Production is one of the world’s leading
television production houses. In the UK 
we create approximately 3,200 hours of
original programming each year including
eight out of the top ten performing
programmes (non-sport) on ITV1 in 2005.
ITV Production is responsible for producing
some of the strongest brands on television
including Coronation Street, Emmerdale,
I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!,
Jeremy Kyle, Cracker, Prime Suspect
and Marple.
ITV owns one of the largest English
language TV media catalogues in the world.
One of the great advantages of being a
vertically integrated producer broadcaster 
is that we control the rights to a signiﬁcant
number of our most successful programme
brands and formats. These rights are the
key to maximising returns. In a digital
world, where content can be accessed
through an increasing number of
technologies, rights are becoming a key
method of differentiation. We also exploit
those rights through international sales
and merchandising.
Our content has had a large number of
successes including I’m A Celebrity…Get Me
Out Of Here!, A Touch of Frost and Ant and
Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway. We have
also delivered a number of exciting new hits
including Vincent, Ahead of the Class and
Gameshow Marathon.
Sales to other UK broadcasters have 
grown signiﬁcantly. We have had many
successes for those broadcasters, who
include the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky One,
with Casanova, Sex Trafﬁc and Brainiac
highlighting the depth and breadth of
creativity within our business.

a number of hit series in the US which

great success selling formats around the
world. For instance, Nanny 911 has been
sold to more than 60 countries and both
Coronation Street and Emmerdale have
been sold to the Middle East for the ﬁrst
time. Our international catalogue sales
continue to grow and in light of recent
technological developments, which include
trialling broadband downloads, we are
beginning to digitise our library. This will
enable our content to be exploited and
generate additional revenues across
different distribution networks.
In addition we have a signiﬁcant number
of high proﬁle sports rights including World
Cup football which we will be broadcasting
in 2006, the Rugby World Cup which will
be broadcast in 2007 and the Champions
League football and Formula 1 motor racing
which ITV viewers enjoy each year. These
rights provide further opportunities to
create value across different distribution
networks. For example, we will be offering
interactive and online services around the
Champions League.
Granada Ventures exploits secondary rights
from our large portfolio of hit properties,
including DVD/video, books, music and
merchandise. In 2005 Liverpool Football
Club’s DVD of their UEFA Champions’
League ﬁnal has sold extremely well,
as have Sharpe and Inspector Morse.
Projects for the future include
merchandising rights for Pocoyo, an
innovative new show for toddlers.
Distribution
As we move towards digital switchover,
more and more people are migrating away
from the analogue platform towards digital
television. As part of our strategy for future
growth in the digital world we acquired 
SDN Limited in April 2005 for cash
consideration of £136 million. 
SDN is a UK digital terrestrial television (DTT)
multiplex operator which manages
Multiplex A, one of the six multiplexes on
the DTT platform that make up Freeview.
This is a key acquisition as not only is it a
new source of revenue but critically it
ensures that ITV has the maximum
opportunity for future capacity on the
rapidly growing digital platform. Freeview is
the fastest growing digital platform with
10 million boxes sold and is the platform 
on which ITV performs best. We currently
have ﬁve channels on Freeview with ITV2
and ITV3 being the most watched digital
commercial channels on the platform.
Through the acquisition of SDN, ITV now
operates 38% of the commercial DTT
capacity. With video streams on DTT in
demand, increasing the prices paid by
channels, this puts SDN in a strong 
position when the video streams come up
for renewal.
This summer, we will be broadcasting the
World Cup in HDTV (High Deﬁnition
Television) format, on DTT and DSAT.
In October ITV plc joined the Freeview
consortium which owns and markets
Freeview. We have joined as an equal
shareholder (20%) alongside the BBC,
BSkyB, National Grid Wireless and 
Channel 4. As part of this consortium 
we will be contributing towards the
marketing of the platform which will
enable us to take a more formal role in
driving the takeup of Freeview.
Channels
As part of ITV’s evolution from a single
channel to a family of successful digital
channels with different programming,
personalities and target audiences, we have
launched a series of new channel identities.
This new look on and off air is a dramatic
modernisation of ITV’s brand that moves
each channel towards a clearly deﬁned
personality. The re-branding is the result of
a comprehensive and wide-reaching project
including a major segmentation study
commissioned by our marketing team to
understand the changing entertainment
needs and attitudes of the UK consumer.
This will also support our commissioning
and sales processes.
ITV’s family of channels has had an
excellent 2005 with share of viewing
increasing from 22.6% in 2004 to 22.7% 
in 2005. ITV1, the UK’s most watched
commercial channel, continues to offer
mass appeal. In an average week ITV1
reaches 80% of the population. In 2005
ITV1 spent over £900 million on network
programming and it is this substantial level
of investment which enables us to offer a
varied schedule of quality programming
including drama and must see television
events such as The X Factor. In 2005 ITV1
was the only commercial channel to
achieve audiences greater than 7.5 million.
ITV also broadcast eight out of the top ten
programmes on UK television in 2005.

Operating review
We continued to be the home of original
quality drama with many new programmes
proving successful, particularly in the all
important Autumn schedule. We have
received widespread critical acclaim across
the drama portfolio, particularly for our
one-off dramas. Notable strong offerings
were Ahead of the Class which drew in 10.1
million viewers and a 40% viewing share and
returning series such as Doc Martin with an
average audience of 9.3 million viewers
(38% viewing share) and Poirot averaging
7.9 million (31% viewing share). New
detective series Vincent(6.4 million, 27%
viewing share) was highly regarded and has
been recommissioned. Afterlife proved a
popular addition to our Saturday night
schedule with an average audience nearing
6 million viewers.
Entertainment remains at the heart of the
ITV1 schedule and we have seen great
success with returning shows The X Factor
and I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! as
well as new formats such as Ant and Dec’s
Gameshow Marathon.
Our banker shows have continued to
deliver. Coronation Street was again the
best performing programme of the year
on any channel, in terms of volume, and
Emmerdale has continued to go from
strength to strength. On occasion
Emmerdale has gone head to head with
Eastenders and beaten it.
2005 was a remarkable year for our news
team. It started with our widely acclaimed
reporting of the South East Asia tsunami
disaster, in which we gave extensive airtime
to coverage of the impacts on lives
throughout the region and to the disaster
appeal. We continued our programme of
investment in digitising our newsrooms and
now have the most advanced integrated
set of regional and national newsrooms in 
Europe. We were able to use this capability
to the full on and following the 7/7 terrorist
bombings in London. The team was
delighted to be awarded the prestigious
Royal Television Society awards for
coverage of the Pakistan Earthquake and
for the country’s best news programme –
in the Early Evening News.
ITV is also home to a number of successful
free to air digital channels – ITV2/3/4 and
soon, CITV. ITV2 is now the biggest non-
terrestrial station by adult impact delivery
taking 2.8% of impacts putting it ahead of
Sky One on 2.3%. The channel has been
enjoying signiﬁcant year on year impact
growth with impacts in 2005 up 39% for
adults and up 41% for 16-34s. 
ITV2 offers a range of original commissions,
acquisitions and brand extensions.
Footballers’ Wives Extra Time and 
Jordan and Peter: Marriage and Mayhem
were both ITV2 original commissions and
proved very popular with the 16-34
audience. In terms of brand extensions we
have seen continued success with The Xtra
Factor which was ITV2’s top performing
show in December closely followed by 
I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here Now!,
both reaching audiences of more than
1 million.
ITV3, which launched in November 2004,
has also proved very successful and is now
the fourth biggest non-terrestrial station in
terms of Adults and ABC1 Adults impacts
with a 1.6% share of Adults and a 1.8%
share of ABC1 Adults. This is a very
impressive achievement given the relative
youth of the channel. On Freeview, ITV3
performs even better, being the second
biggest non-terrestrial channel beaten only
by ITV2. ITV3 beneﬁts from the extensive
ITV library of high quality drama available
and we have seen strong performances
from favourites such as Inspector Morse
and Poirot.
ITV4 is our latest digital channel offering
and is targeted at male viewers. On its
launch night on the 1 November 2005 ITV4
averaged 335,000 viewers and a 3.23% share
across its transmission hours (19.00 – 02.30)
and peaked with an audience of 1.2 million
viewers, making it the most successful
digital channel launch to date. Sport has
proved a popular part of the schedule with
the UEFA Champions’ League Match
between Liverpool and Benﬁca in 2006
peaking at 1.2 million and averaging
702,000 and the match between Real Betis
and Chelsea averaging 695,000 viewers.
From its launch in November to the end 
of 2005, ITV4 ranked 10th in its target
market, the male demographic, during
transmission hours.
On 11 March 2006 we will be launching 
our new children’s channel, CITV. CITV will
initially be transmitted on Freeview and
cable, rolling out on satellite later in the
year. The channel will be targeted at
younger viewers (pre-school and 4–9 year
olds) as part of our multichannel strategy
to offer more targeted programming to
different demographics. As part of our
Public Service Broadcasting (PSB)
obligations we already spend £29 million
on children’s programmes which we will be
able to utilise on the channel. This will give
more exposure to our key children’s brands
such as Pocoyo and offer further brand
extension and merchandising opportunities.
ITV is collaborating closely with Ofcom and
other industry bodies on the review of the
codes on food advertising to children.
In 2005 ITV1 was the only
commercial channel to regularly
achieve audiences greater than 
7.5 million.
March 2006 sees the launch 
of the new CITV children’s channel. 23
In 2006 we aim to increase further the
programme investment in our successful
family of digital channels to £84 million.
We are ahead of our target of £150 million
of multichannel advertising revenue in
2007, and may achieve this run rate by the
end of 2006. We now aim to achieve a run
rate of £250 million of advertising and
interactive revenue from our digital
channels by the end of 2008.
New platforms bring 
commercial opportunities
The world is changing and our viewers are
now able to consume content in an
increasing number of ways. We believe that
this presents an exciting opportunity to
develop direct consumer revenues and
reduce our reliance on traditional advertising
revenues. We aim to generate 50% of our
revenues from outside ITV1 advertising by
the end of 2010.
ITV is home to the most popular brands in
television and each year we broadcast
some of the biggest “event” shows. 
We have been successful at generating
additional transactional revenues through
PRTS and SMS interactivity focused around
brands such as I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out
Of Here!, The X Factor and This Morning.
ITV has a number of exciting new initiatives
which are focused on further monetising
our consumer relationships. Towards the
end of 2005 we began broadcasting a
number of “participation TV” formats, on
ITV1 and ITV2, including Quizmania which 
is studio based and invites viewers to call 
in to take part in a variety of quizzes,
puzzles and games to win cash prizes.
These have proved popular and
commercially successful. We are looking
forward to launching the ITV Play channel
in April, with a variety of participation
formats that are entertaining, high quality
and appeal to our mass-market 
ITV audiences.
With broadband penetration forecast to
increase signiﬁcantly, passing 50% of
homes by 2010, consumers will increasingly
be able to receive audiovisual content via
their phone line. TV over ADSL is likely to
become more widely available and with it
comes the ability of the consumer to view
content on demand and pay-per view. 
ITV’s premium content will become
increasingly valuable during this period of
platform proliferation. To harness this
growing revenue stream and enable our
content to be easily distributed through
different digital viewing technologies we
have begun the process of digitising our
media catalogue. We are also ensuring 
that our new content is available in
digital format.
Online is an important part of our future
business for both consumers and
advertisers alike and ITV has moved to
increase its online content presence both
organically and by acquisition. Our main
website itv.com is currently undergoing 
a signiﬁcant functionality upgrade which
will enable us to further monetise our
relationships with both consumers and
advertisers. The new look site will be rolled
out later in the year and we aim to offer
a seamless user experience with easier
navigation and rich content across our
programme sites and news services.
We will also be launching an online
electronic programme guide and improved
online interactive functionality and
content. Technology upgrades mean 
that we will have the capability to offer
downloadable programme catch-ups,
on-demand viewing and highlights of
forthcoming shows.
ITV acquired community-based website
Friends Reunited in December 2005 for an
initial consideration of £120 million. Friends
Reunited is a proﬁtable, rapidly growing
content rich site with ﬁve key segments
each driven by user generated content.
These are Friends Reunited – a schools and
colleges alumni site; Genes Reunited – 
a genealogy site; Friends Reunited Dating,
Friends Reunited Jobs and Connections – 
a social networking site. Across their sites
Friends Reunited has 15 million registered
UK members and more than 1 million
paying subscribers. Combining Friends
Reunited and ITV’s family of sites gives ITV
the eighth largest online presence in terms
of unique users, offering a powerful
consolidated online advertising sales
proposition which provides a one-stop shop
for media agencies in the internet
advertising space. We have already begun
to cross promote our various online sites
and leverage the Friends Reunited brand.
Friends Reunited’s sponsorship of hit show
Soapstar Superstar drove a 70% year on
year uplift in unique users across the
month of January and a similar increase 
in proﬁt. Friends Reunited brings with it a
highly successful management team with
unrivalled online expertise, product
development and database management
skills. We are integrating both the skills and
underlying technology afforded to us by
this acquisition into our own online
propositions ITV.com and ITV Local.
3 million news highlights 
were viewed online on ITV’s
I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of
Here! website.

EBITDA We have extended the trial of ITV Local
which is a broadband based television
project currently operating in the 
Meridian region. The ITV Local website
(www.itvlocal.tv) offers news, weather,
documentaries, classiﬁed advertising and,
since the beginning of January, viewer
generated content, including videos and
adverts. We launched the trial in October.
The site has attracted 10,000 users each
week in phase two of the trial, and is
generating signiﬁcant interest both
nationally and internationally. 
In January 2006 a new channel for
educational professionals called Teachers’
TV launched on ITV Local having already
proved successful on satellite and cable.
The ITV Local trial will allow the project
team to reﬁne the consumer proposition
and give the local community a lengthened
period of time to interact with the site. 
If the trial proves successful we aim to roll
out ITV Local across the nation allowing ITV
to generate further value from our regional
content infrastructure.
ITV Mobile launched in September 2005
to offer our viewers access to ITV content
whilst on the move. With consumers’
appetite for video content growing, we
have successfully offered downloads of
video clips from popular shows such as
Coronation Street, I’m A Celebrity…Get Me
Out Of Here! and The X Factor, as well as
news updates, ringtones, wallpapers and
games. ITV has also signed output deals 
for our content with mobile operators
including 3, a leading mobile media
company. This allows us to talk directly to
the company’s 3 million customers and
generate revenues from 3G-enhanced
extras like streamed video and clips.
Regulation
In 2005 ITV had a review of its licence
payments, settled on 29 June, which saw 
a change in the ﬁnancial terms for our
Channel 3 licences. In 2004 licence
payments (on a pro forma basis) were 
£207 million net of the digital rebate. In
2005 we paid £75 million, a reduction of
64% or £132 million. This payment will
continue to fall as digital penetration
increases and is likely to reduce to around
£4 million in constant prices by the time
analogue transmission ends. These reduced
ﬁnancial terms reﬂect the declining value of
the analogue broadcasting spectrum and
will allow us to continue to invest in high
quality programming.
In December 2005 the EC published its
legislative proposal for the revision of the
“Television without Frontiers” Directive. 
The proposal addressed the commission’s
liberal stance on product placement and
advertising rules, which ITV and the other
European commercial broadcasters have
lobbied for. The consultation is likely to 
run for some time, with the ﬁnal directive
unlikely to be adopted before 2007.
However, in anticipation of changes to the
EU framework, Ofcom is already consulting
on possible relaxation of the UK rules
regarding product placement. This could
allow the UK to see change as soon as the
new EU rules are conﬁrmed. We would
welcome this change as it would offer
further opportunities for our advertisers.
Values and behaviours
In order to drive our digital growth in the
future and make sure ITV plc continues to
be a successful and vibrant media
company we have introduced a set of
values and behaviours for our employees
from the top to the bottom of the
organisation. We have also conducted a
number of employee surveys in order to
establish a base from which we can
monitor our improvement. These core
competencies and values will encourage
and strengthen ITV’s commercial success 
in the digital age.

Net advertising revenue (“NAR”)
Total ITV plc NAR increased by 2.7% during
the year to £1,631 million (2004: £1,588
million). This result includes a full year
contribution of £58 million from GMTV
(2004: £18 million), which became a
subsidiary in October 2004.

Financial review
ITV continues to develop its effective
multichannel strategy, which has seen ITV2
establish itself during the year as the most
popular digital channel in multichannel
homes and strong performances from ITV3
and the recently launched ITV4. 2005 was a
difﬁcult year for the television advertising
market, with growth of 2.6% compared to
6.0% in 2004. The market was adversely
affected by a slowdown in economic
growth combined with a fall in consumer
conﬁdence, resulting in reductions in
advertising spend, particularly in the
household stores and motoring sectors.
The 2006 advertising trading season 
is now substantially complete, with
the majority of agency deals concluded.
Our ITV1 negotiations are within the
framework of the Contracts Rights Renewal
(“CRR”) remedy agreed with the Ofﬁce of
Fair Trading as a condition to the merger
creating ITV plc.
Other sales
Other broadcasting sales of £140 million
(2004: £133 million) principally comprise
sponsorship income, fees for airtime sales
on behalf of third parties, and sales of ITV
programming by the Network Centre to
Channel 3 licencees not owned by ITV plc.
Other revenue within our producer/
broadcaster segment of £67 million 
(2004: £30 million) includes interactive
transactions and online advertising sales 
of £45 million (2004: £21 million) of which
£19 million (2004: £5 million) relates to
GMTV, and revenue from the SDN business
which we acquired during the year of 
£16 million (2004: £nil).
Production revenue includes original
productions for the UK and international
markets, the distribution and exploitation
of internally generated and acquired rights,
and studios and facilities revenue.
Programming made by ITV for ITV channels
is not included in Group revenue as it
represents an internal programming cost 
of sale. In 2005, total external sales of 
£247 million (2004: £233 million) included
original productions for other broadcasters
of £121 million (2004: £108 million),
distribution and exploitation sales of 
£99 million (2004: £103 million) and
revenue from the hire of studio and
technical facilities of £27 million (2004: 
£22 million).
Other operations revenue comprises
cinema advertising sales of £61 million
(2004: £65 million), revenue from education
sales of £30 million (2004: £34 million) 
and revenue from Friends Reunited which
was acquired during the year, £1 million
(2004: £nil).
ITV schedule
The cost of the ITV1 network schedule 
(ITV plc share) in 2005 was £776 million
(2004: £796 million). Regional programme
costs for ITV1 were £125 million (2004:
£142 million). Ofcom’s reduction in our
non-news regional programming
commitment has resulted in a cost saving
of £7 million to ITV plc. In addition to this,
we have achieved savings of £10 million 
on last year from increased efﬁciencies
across our regional production centres. 
Schedule costs for ITV2 were £38 million
(2004: £26 million) and the ﬁrst full year
schedule costs of ITV3 were £9 million
(2004: £2 million). ITV4 schedule costs 
were £6 million (2004: £nil) in its launch
year. The increased investment in these
digital channel schedules has been a key
factor in attracting new advertisers and
viewers to our multichannel offering. 
The ﬁrst full year schedule cost of GMTV,
which became a subsidiary in October
2004, was £29 million (2004: £7 million).
Licence fees
Licence fees comprise both a ﬁxed annual
sum (the cash bid) and a variable element
representing a percentage of our NAR and
sponsorship income (PQR Levy). The PQR
Levy is reduced by the percentage of
homes which receive ITV1 in digital format. 
The digital licence rebate for 2005 is based
on a digital penetration of 61%. In 2004 
the licence fee payment including a full 
12 months of GMTV was £215 million.

2005 has seen the setting of new ﬁnancial
terms for our Channel 3 licences which 
has resulted in a reduction in the net
licence fees paid of 64% to £75 million. 
The payment will continue to fall as digital
penetration increases and will reduce to
around £4 million in constant prices by the
time analogue transmissions cease. 
Together with the tax charge of £85 million,
the licence fee of £75 million produces a
combined tax and licence fee rate of 41%
on our proﬁt before tax and licence fees of
£386 million.
Exceptional items
The operating exceptional items in the year
total £29 million and primarily represent
reorganisation and integration costs,
partially offset by liquidation dividends
received. Reorganisation and integration
costs include costs associated with the
consolidation of regional news production
centres as part of the ongoing efﬁciency
gains following the merger between
Granada and Carlton. Further such projects
are planned for 2006. 
Non-operating exceptional items show 
a £10 million charge recognised in 
respect of the education business after 
its classiﬁcation as a disposal group held 
for sale. 
Net ﬁnancing costs
The net ﬁnancing charge is £35 million.
Financing income of £144 million includes
the expected return on pension scheme
assets (£112 million), interest income 
(£21 million) and net gains on
remeasurement of interest rate swaps to
fair value (£11 million). Financing costs of 
£179 million includes the interest on
pension scheme liabilities (£125 million)
and interest expense of £54 million 
arising on our principal debt instruments
and interest payments under ﬁnance 
lease obligations.

Dividend
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of
1.8 pence per share which represents an
increase of 38% over the 2004 ﬁnal
dividend. The total dividend proposed 
for the period is therefore 3.12 pence which
is covered 2.56 times by the adjusted
earnings per share (before amortisation

Acquisition of businesses
ITV made two material acquisitions during
2005: SDN and Friends Reunited. Friends
Reunited has been acquired for an initial
consideration of £120 million with
additional consideration of up to
£55 million based on future performance.
SDN was acquired at a total cost of 
£136 million.
As required under IFRS 3 (Business
combinations) the net assets of the
businesses have been adjusted to reﬂect
their fair value at the date of acquisition
and goodwill has been calculated based on
the fair value of the consideration.
For SDN, intangible assets of £82 million 
(in respect of the multiplex licence and
customer contracts) have been recognised
with an associated deferred tax liability of
£25 million. Goodwill is £77 million.
The principal adjustments for Friends
Reunited are to recognise additional
intangible assets of £34 million (in respect
of brands and customer relationships), 
with an associated deferred tax liability of
£10 million, and to recognise a tax asset of
£21 million in respect of the exercise of
share options. Goodwill of £100 million has
been recognised based on the expected
total consideration taken at a fair value 
of £145 million.
Further details on both acquisitions are
given in note 28 to the accounts.
Intangible assets
Total intangible assets at 31 December
2005 are £3,947 million being principally
goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
Additions during the year arise principally
from the acquisitions of SDN and 
Friends Reunited and total £294 million.
Goodwill balances are not amortised but
are instead subject to annual impairment
testing. No impairment has been
recognised in 2005. Other intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful lives.
The total amortisation charge for the year
is £102 million (2004: £111 million).
Cash ﬂow and net debt
The cash generated from operations was
£456 million reﬂecting strong trading.
Exceptional cash payments of £28 million
reﬂect restructuring and integration costs
offset by a receipt from the liquidators 
of ONdigital.
Property, plant and equipment expenditure
was £46 million and £29 million was raised
from sales. A net debt movement of 
£230 million in respect of the acquisitions
of SDN and Friends Reunited is recognised.
In January 2005, B125 million of the
Exchangeable bond was repaid while in
April the remaining £8 million of the
Carlton Communications Limited
Preference shares were called. In October,
ITV issued £325 million Eurobonds with a
maturity of October 2015 and carrying a
coupon of 5.375% in order to secure long
term ﬁnancing for the Group at a very
attractive ﬁxed rate.
As described in more detail under pensions,
a £118 million deﬁcit funding payment into
the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes is reﬂected in
cash ﬂows.
Treasury operations and policies
A central department in London following
policies and procedures laid down by the
Board, manages the Group’s treasury
operations. The most signiﬁcant treasury
exposures faced by ITV are raising ﬁnance,
managing interest rate and currency
positions and investing surplus cash in high
quality assets. Treasury policies have been
approved by the Board for managing each
of these exposures including levels of
authority on the type and use of ﬁnancial
instruments. Transactions are only
undertaken if they relate to underlying
exposures. The treasury department reports
regularly to the Audit Committee and
treasury operations are subject to periodic
independent reviews and internal audit.

ITV has established and retains strong
relationships with a number of banks to
ensure a balanced spread of risk and to
facilitate future funding requirements.
Set out below are ITV’s principal treasury
policies:
– Financing: ITV’s ﬁnancing policy is to fund
itself long term using debt instruments
with a range of maturities. It is
substantially funded from the UK and
European capital markets and has bank
facilities from the UK syndicated market.
– Interest rate management: the Group’s
interest rate policy is to have ﬁxed
interest rate debt of between 30% and
70% of its total net indebtedness over 
the medium term in order to provide a
balance between certainty of cost and
beneﬁt from low ﬂoating rates. ITV uses
interest rate swaps and options in order
to achieve the desired mix between ﬁxed
and ﬂoating.
– Currency management: the Group’s
foreign exchange policy is to hedge
foreign currency denominated costs at
the time of commitment and to hedge 
a proportion of foreign currency
denominated revenues on a rolling 
12 month basis. The policies signiﬁcantly
reduce the Group’s earnings and 
balance sheet exposures to changes 
in exchange rates.
– Investment in cash: ITV operates strict
investment guidelines with respect to
surplus cash and the emphasis is on
preservation of capital. Counterparty
limits for cash deposits are largely based
upon long term ratings published by 
the major credit rating agencies. 
Deposits longer than three months
require the approval of the Management
Committee of the Board.
Pensions
The Group’s pension schemes are run
independently by the schemes’ trustees. 
All pension scheme assets are administered
separately by the trustees using a number
of external fund managers and custodians.
The deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are funded 
on a long term basis with advice from the
scheme actuaries. Actuarial valuations of
the assets and liabilities of the schemes 
are carried out every three years with the
most recent valuation of the main scheme
having been conducted by the actuaries at 
31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2005, the make up of the
membership of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt
schemes was:
000’s
Active employees 3
Deferreds 14
Pensioners 12
29
This is a mature proﬁle and the active
employees therefore have a relatively small
impact on changes in scheme liabilities
compared to deferreds and pensioners.
i) Scheme merger
At the beginning of 2005 there were six
separate deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes
in the Group, a legacy of the company
mergers that created ITV. Terms were
agreed with the trustees to merge those
into a single scheme and that process
completed at the end of January 2006.
This will save signiﬁcantly on the costs of
administration and professional advice, and
also enable a clearer focus on the issues for
a single scheme than was possible with
separate schemes.
ii) Deﬁcit funding
It was announced in September 2005 
that ITV plc would make a £325 million
contribution into the deﬁned beneﬁt
pension schemes as part of a plan to
address the deﬁcit. The amount had been
calculated so that, together with estimated
future investment returns on the schemes’
assets, it would enable the schemes to
move towards being fully funded (on an
ongoing basis) over an appropriate period
of time.
The funding was made in cash with 
£118 million paid in December 2005 and
£207 million in January and February 2006.
iii) IAS 19
IAS 19 accounting for the Group’s deﬁned
beneﬁt schemes does not affect the
ongoing funding of those schemes.
In 2005 the IAS 19 operating charge for
deﬁned beneﬁt schemes was £24 million
(2004: £24 million). The charge within net
ﬁnancing costs for the net of the expected
return on scheme assets and the interest
cost on liabilities was an additional 
£13 million (2004: £6 million). The Group’s
deﬁned contribution schemes gave rise to
an operating charge of £2 million (2004: 
£2 million).
The IAS 19 deﬁcit on the deﬁned beneﬁt
schemes was £672 million at 31 December
2004. The valuation at that date reﬂected
the recognition of improving mortality
rates which had been assessed on a
scheme speciﬁc basis and there has been
no need to make any further adjustment
to those mortality rates in 2005.
The principal movements in assets and
liabilities of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension
schemes during the year have resulted
from the signiﬁcant reduction in the long
term real interest rates which have
increased liabilities, and the very strong
investment returns (especially on the
equity portfolio) which have provided a
compensating increase in scheme assets.
28 ITV plc 2005 annual report The IAS 19 deﬁcit at 31 December 2005
was £532 million reﬂecting the £118 million
lump sum payment in December 2005 and
an improvement of £22 million in the
underlying funding position during the year
before that lump sum payment. A net
actuarial gain of £35 million has been
recognised as a credit to reserves.
Following the £207 million lump sum
payment in early 2006 that £532 million
deﬁcit would reduce to £325 million pre tax
on a pro forma basis (or £228 million after
a deferred tax asset of £97 million).
The pension schemes are funded on a 
long term basis and therefore the IAS 19
disclosures are not relevant to the ongoing
funding of the schemes. The last ongoing
actuarial valuations of the deﬁned beneﬁt
schemes (at 31 December 2004 for the
main ITV Scheme and other dates for 
some of the remaining schemes) showed 
a deﬁcit of £586 million compared to 
the IAS 19 deﬁcit of £672 million at 
31 December 2004.
Over 2005 the difference in real long term
interest rates applied to our IAS 19
valuations was 0.5%. If this reduction had
not occurred then our year end liabilities
would have been over £200 million less
than reported.
As a result of the improved funding
position it is expected that the net return
on scheme assets and liabilities in 2006 
will give rise to a credit to the net ﬁnancing
costs of the Group.
iv) Pension tax simpliﬁcation
The new tax regime for pension funds
comes into effect on 6 April 2006. 
This change, referred to as “A” Day, will
have signiﬁcant consequences for senior
executives for whom tax relief on pension
accruals will change from that time. ITV 
has taken professional advice and has
concluded that it should not separately
compensate any executives for this change,
but should establish alternate pension
arrangements for those immediately
impacted which leave both the individual
and the Group in positions broadly similar
to the present.
Individuals whose pension arrangements
are wholly within an approved scheme 
will remain in that scheme up to the
maximum permitted without adverse tax
consequences, and will have any accrual
above that level provided from a secured
unfunded unapproved retirement 
beneﬁt scheme.
Individuals currently subject to the earnings
cap within an approved scheme, and
having additional beneﬁts provided through
an unfunded unapproved retirement
beneﬁt scheme, will accrue beneﬁts under
the approved scheme up to the maximum
permitted without adverse tax
consequences, and will have any accrual
above that level provided from the
unfunded unapproved retirement beneﬁt
scheme.
International Financial 
Reporting Standards
ITV plc adopted IFRS for group reporting on
1 January 2005 and has presented its
group ﬁnancial statements under IFRS for
the ﬁrst time in this report. The basis of
preparation, along with the Group’s
signiﬁcant accounting policies, is set out in
note 1. The 2004 comparative ﬁnancial
information has been restated and
represented under IFRS. Details of this
conversion are given later in this report on
pages 70 and 71 and further information is
given in ITV plc’s Preliminary International
Financial Reporting Standards Financial
Statements for 2004 which is available on
the corporate website www.itvplc.com.
The ITV plc parent company accounts
continue to be presented under UK GAAP.
They have been included in this report
following the results of the consolidated
group.
Risks and uncertainties
ITV has an established programme of 
risk assessment, which is described in 
more detail in the corporate governance
section on page 80. Key risks, mitigating
controls and actions required to enhance
controls are identiﬁed and monitored by
the management, executive directors 
and Audit Committee. ITV currently
considers its key risks and uncertainties 
to be as follows:
• The total level of advertising expenditure
is driven by conditions within the UK and
global economies over which ITV has 
no control;
• The high level of competition between
media owners for share of the total
display advertising market;
• The increasingly competitive market for
television viewers in the UK and the
impact of new technologies that may
change viewing behaviour;
• Adherence to UK broadcasting
regulations;
• Exposure to the risk that pension scheme
assets are insufﬁcient to meet the
present and future scheme liabilities;
• Exposure to increasing cost of
programmes, talent and rights acquired
from third parties; 
• Exposure to counterparty credit risk; and
• Reliance on third party technology for the
operation of key activities.

Corporate 
responsibility
ITV considers corporate responsibility (CR)
to be a major factor in maintaining good
relationships with key stakeholder groups.
These include viewers, advertisers,
employees, the regulator Ofcom, investors,
artistes and local communities.
The media collectively has a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence over social values and ITV is
committed to exercising responsibility in 
all of its programme output from soaps
to dramas, current affairs and news. 
We believe that it is important to maintain
ITV’s established reputation for editorial
standards during a period of increasing
competition in television.
Recognising the signiﬁcant role of television
in society, the industry and its regulators
have developed detailed rules and
regulations administered by Ofcom. 
The experience gained over 50 years of
broadcasting has enabled ITV to establish a
strong culture of responsible programming. 
In 2004, ITV plc’s ﬁrst year of existence, 
we established a new structure for
managing CR issues. A CR Operational
Group has been appointed reporting to 
the CR and Operational Risk Steering Group,
chaired by the Company Secretary. 
The Group has broad representation 
from all the main company functions.
The prime function of the CR Operational
Group is to co-ordinate management of
issues already well established within
operational functions. The Group also
identiﬁes any areas in need of closer
scrutiny or a new approach. 
The focus of the Group’s meetings in 2005
was on improving the measurement of
ITV’s CR performance in different spheres
and establishing targets and objectives
where possible. The Group is in the process
of a review of ITV’s CR Policy. In 2005, the
Group initiated a viewer survey of ITV’s 
CR issues and performance and launched
an intranet site on CR topics. This is part of
our well used ‘Watercooler’ intranet, one of
the prime ways ITV communicates with
employees.
In common with other FTSE 100 
companies, ITV receives regular enquiries
from institutional investors about CR. 
We respond constructively to all such
requests and ITV is included in both the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (where 
we are rated as the sector leader) and 
the FTSE4Good Index.
CR issues relevant to ITV
ITV’s diverse CR issues divide into two 
main categories: those to do with what 
we broadcast and those to do with how 
we operate. 
Our principal ‘On air’ issues relate to
programme standards, our role as a provider
of news and current affairs programmes,
social and community issues in other
programmes and advertising standards.
‘Behind the scenes’ ITV’s main CR issues 
are our role in fostering creative talent,
employment, regional partnerships and 
the environment. 31
Performance in 2005
CR on air
ITV provides the most popular family of
channels in the UK, and spends around
£1 billion a year on programming – the
biggest spend of any European commercial
broadcaster. We strive for strong editorial
and creative values as well as high
programme standards.
This is underpinned by broadcast licensing
and regulation which is among the most
rigorous in the world. That regulation offers
signiﬁcant protection for the community as
a whole, for minority groups within it and
for individuals. Compliance is mandatory. 
In 2005 Ofcom implemented a new
Broadcasting Code. Along with other 
major broadcasters, ITV was heavily
involved in Ofcom’s consultation and
welcomed the result.
To ensure ITV achieves the required
standards across its channels, ITV’s
Compliance Unit was expanded in 2005 to
a total of 27 specialists who guide
programme makers and broadcasters.
Compliance specialists advise programme
teams on every aspect of broadcast output,
apart from advertising and network news. 
A separate team checks TV commercials for
compliance with the Television Advertising
Code prior to broadcast.
News and current affairs are key facets of
ITV’s public service function and role in
society. Part of ITV’s corporate responsibility
is to produce balanced, informative,
impartial news and documentaries. 
ITV has a budget of £100 million for
production of national and regional news
programmes. Its global reach is aided by
ofﬁces in London, Bangkok, Brussels,
Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Moscow,
Washington and a new bureau in Beijing.
In 2005, Ofcom dealt with complaints
about 799 ITV programmes. Of these, 
772 were not upheld. Complaints about 
19 programmes were resolved to Ofcom’s
satisfaction. Complaints about eight
programmes were upheld (compared 
with 17 in 2004). Ofcom publishes 
details of its rulings on its website at
www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/.
ITV’s licences contain quotas for certain
types of programme and for accessibility
services for blind and deaf people. ITV
achieved all its quotas.
Diversity on screen
Britain is a diverse nation and ITV believes
its contribution to social cohesion is to
ensure a balanced representation for all
parts of the community in all types of our
programmes. We have begun monitoring
on-screen diversity and will be using this
data in internal programme reviews and
assessing what our target levels should be.
CR behind the scenes
Employment ITV employs 5,952 people
worldwide, the majority of whom are in 
the UK. We aim to treat our employees
fairly and with respect and have systems 
in place to provide a safe working
environment for all. A new team was
assembled in 2005 to co-ordinate our
training strategy across the business,
improving all skill levels and emphasising
leadership development throughout the
organisation. Every permanent employee
receives an annual career development
review that focuses progress during the
year and identiﬁes any development needs.
We are promoting diversity in ITV’s
workforce with several initiatives to 
recruit people from minority groups. 
During 2005 ITV increased ethnic minority
representation from 4% (in 2004) to 6%.
Women account for 47% of our workforce
and 42% of management grades.
Environment ITV’s main impacts on the
environment are the energy and water we
use at our sites and on location and the
waste we produce. We aim to manage 
and reduce these impacts. We are in the
process of reviewing and updating our
environmental policy, procedures,
objectives and targets. 
We collect data on energy use, water
consumption and waste. Our CR report
contains details of reduction in ITV’s climate
impact, water use and waste generation.
Community ITV’s social investment 
comes in two different ways: as airtime
donated to good causes; and as cash
donations to charities and social and
environmental projects. 
In 2005, ITV came ﬁrst in the Guardian’s
Giving List, a ranking of FTSE100 companies
by the percentage of proﬁts donated to
community investment (based on 2004
data). Our total social investment in 2005
was worth £19.3 million.
Details of ITV’s approach to CR, performance
during 2005 and targets are included in ITV’s
2005 CR report which is available in the
Responsibility section of the Company
website at www.itvplc.com or in hard copy

BSc, ACA Principal activities of the Group and review of the year
A review of the results and activities of the business is included in the f ﬁnancial review on pages 25 to 29 Proﬁt after tax was £226 million 
(2004: £143 million).
Principal transactions and post balance sheet events
On 27 April 2005 the Group acquired the UK digital terrestrial television multiplex operator SDN Limited from United Business Media plc and S4C
Digital Media Limited. The total cost of the acquisition was £136 million.
In September 2005 the Group announced the intention to provide lump sum funding of £325 million to the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme to reduce the deﬁcit in those schemes. £118 million was contributed in December 2005 and £207 million was contributed in January and
February 2006. Further details are included in the Financial Review on pages 28 and 29.
On 6 December 2005 the Group acquired community website Friends Reunited from the founders and employees of the Friends Reunited
business. The Group acquired the holding company of the Friends Reunited group for an initial consideration of £120 million satisﬁed by a mixture
of cash from existing facilities and the issue of notes and ITV plc ordinary shares plus deferred consideration of between £nil and £55 million.
Further details are set out in note 28 of these ﬁnancial statements.
Post balance sheet events are described in note 34 of these ﬁnancial statements.
Convertible shares
At the time of the merger creating ITV the former Carlton shareholders were issued with ITV convertible shares. These were intended to provide
those shareholders with an additional 2% in aggregate of the combined Group in the event of strong growth in advertising revenue for free to 
air television, to which Carlton had been more highly operationally geared than Granada.
Two triggers were set out in the terms of issue as measures of such growth. One of those triggers was that the share price of ITV plc should
exceed 140 pence for 60 of the last 90 dealing days in 2005. That trigger was not achieved and the convertible shares were therefore of no further
value. They have been converted into deferred shares and will shortly be cancelled without any payment.
Dividends
A ﬁnal dividend on the ordinary shares is proposed for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 1.8 pence per share payable on 3 July 2006 to
shareholders on the register at the close of business on Friday 21 April 2006. The shares will be quoted ex-dividend from Wednesday 19 April 2006.
The total dividends paid and proposed for the year ended 31 December 2005 are therefore as follows:
2005 2004
Interim dividend 1.32p 1.10p
Final dividend 1.80p 1.30p
Total 3.12p 2.40p
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan is being offered to the holders of ordinary shares in respect of the ﬁnal dividend and further information about
the Plan is given on page 90.

Going concern
The directors are satisﬁed that the Company has sufﬁcient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Properties
Note 12 to the accounts gives details of the valuations of the Group’s operational properties as at the balance sheet date.
Donations
The Group made contributions to charities and equivalent organisations amounting to £19.3 million (2004: £22.3 million).
It is ITV’s policy not to make cash contributions to any political party. However, the Political Parties, Election and Referendums Act 2000 
(“the Act”) requires companies to obtain shareholder approval for any donations to political organisations or political expenditure in excess of an
aggregate of £5,000. Within the normal activities of the Group’s national and regional news gathering operations there are occasions when the
Group may provide some hospitality at functions where politicians are present. The Group, as part of its normal industry activities, is also keen to
maintain contact with all political parties to ensure that they are aware of the key issues affecting its business. Under the Act the deﬁnition of
political expenditure and donations to political organisations is extremely wide and may be construed as covering such areas of the Group’s normal
activities. Shareholder authority for such expenditure was given at the Annual General Meeting held in May 2005 and a similar resolution will be
proposed at the 2006 Annual General Meeting. During the year the Group made the following payments totalling £31,406 (2004: £24,850) to cover
the cost of hosting receptions at the Autumn party conferences: Labour Party £17,710; Conservative Party £7,557; Liberal Democrat Party £6,139.
Employment policies
The Group’s programme making, commercial, management, technical and administrative talent are key to its success. The Group’s Diversity Policy
aims to ensure equality of opportunity during the entire career cycle of an individual irrespective of sex, marital status, race, origin, nationality,
religion, religious belief, disability, age, gender, sexual orientation, or gender reassignment. It also covers arrangements for the continued
employment of and appropriate training for employees who become disabled whilst working for the Group. The policy includes a range of
measures such as training in recruitment and selection, portrayal monitoring and entry level bursaries, traineeships and foundation schemes that
are led by both the diversity and learning and development strategies. The Group consistently reports on-screen portrayal performance for both
News and Network productions with new technology launched in 2005 to improve the process. The work-place proﬁle is also monitored and
reported on extensively from recruitment through to an individual’s development and remuneration. The inauguration of 25 Diversity champions
enables the various diversity action groups that exist throughout the business to align diversity strategy with participants being representative 
of most business areas and diverse in their make-up. The Company is chairing the Cultural Diversity Network for 2005 and 2006 and is an active
participant in the major diversity forums whose focus is the employment and development of minority groups – Opportunity Now, the Employers’
Forum on Disability, the Broadcasters’ Disability Network and the Cultural Diversity Network.
Communication and consultation with employees is a high priority and the Group has a framework for consultation and information under
which Communication Groups on each site have joint responsibility for maintaining a regular dialogue on all issues concerning the employees 
and the business. Where there is support from employees, there is a regular dialogue with recognised Trades Unions.
During a year of intensive change, our communication with employees has been crucially important. We have increased our support to
managers with a series of management brieﬁngs from the leadership team at key points of change throughout the year together with monthly
written brieﬁngs and action points for all employees. Every effort was made to inform and update employees on change ﬁrst, before this was
reported externally – a considerable feat in a media organisation. There was extensive collaboration between the Marketing, Communications 
and HR teams, in order to engage employees in the development of our new on-air and employer brand, including the deﬁning of our mission 
and values. Much of this work was brought to life for employees with our new intranet which was also developed in consultation with them.
Working with our elected employee representatives, we also introduced a new cycle of top-down and bottom-up communication between 
the leadership team and employees. Evaluation has already indicated the positive impact these initiatives have had, collectively, on morale,
engagement and alignment with ITV's vision of the future.
35 Directors’ report
Learning and development opportunities are vital to attract and retain the best talent and television's reliance on ever-changing technology also
requires that we keep our employees well-trained. Training is offered across a wide range of activities from technical and managerial to programme
making. We also maintain the philosophy that internal development is encouraged and monitored.
A new team was assembled in 2005 to co-ordinate our training strategy across the business, improving all skill levels and emphasising leadership
development throughout the organisation. 
All employees receive an annual career development review that focuses on progress during the year and identiﬁes any development needs.
Managers and employees can then refer to the Development Guide on the intranet. The Development Guide is a one-stop interactive source for
information about all the training available to employees which was completely overhauled during the year. The result has been better
communication and a higher uptake of training opportunities.
Training includes both off-the-job courses, such as technical and programme courses in camera operations, presentation skills for journalists,
script writing and copyright law; and on-the-job training such as coaching and mentoring. Our own internal training courses include Researching 
for TV, ITV Production, Technology Seminars and DV Camera Training.
In 2005, we launched the 'Creating Strong Leaders Programme' offering a development programme for all our leaders across the Group from 
the Management Board to our First Level Leaders. In total, 385 managers have attended one of the three management development programmes. 
The aim is for all managers to undergo this training within three years. Online inductions were available on the new Development Guide from
January 2006. 
The Company chairs and is represented at board level on Skillset, which is the industry Sector Skills Council and contributes substantially both to
its core funding and the freelance training fund it manages. This means that we are fully represented to ensure we are part of both designing and
helping to implement the training strategy for the Broadcasting industry at large.
It is vital for the Group to offer the right reward and incentivisation in order to attract and retain the best talent. Since 2004, the Group has 
been offering new employees a consistent, competitive and attractive range of beneﬁts. The Group’s incentive programmes are structured to 
give our employees a stake in the future success of the Group. As well as a SAYE scheme which is open to all staff and enables them to save for
shares in the Company, the Group runs a bonus scheme which ensures that those with the brightest and best ideas are encouraged. The Prime
Mover Scheme allows the originators of programme formats that have the potential for international and UK exploitation to have a substantial
stake in the success of those formats. In 2005, the Group also introduced an all-employee annual bonus scheme which will allow employees to
receive a bonus when the Group is successful.
The health and safety of employees, contractors and visitors is considered as a priority. There are well established health and safety policies 
and procedures in place throughout the business and these are supported by an effective training programme.
Financial instruments
Note 25 to the accounts gives details of the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management policies and related exposures. 
Creditor payment policy
The Company’s policy, in relation to all its suppliers, is to settle the terms of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction, ensure
awareness of the terms and to abide by those terms provided that it is satisﬁed that the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance
with the agreed terms and conditions. The Company does not follow any code or standard on payment practice. The number of days’ purchases
outstanding for payment by the Company as at 31 December 2005 was nil days (2004: nil days).
Share capital
Full details of the movements in the authorised and issued share capital of the Company during the year are set out in note iv to the ITV plc
Company ﬁnancial statements on page 74. 
The Company has the authority to purchase up to 409 million of its ordinary shares. The authority remains valid until the 2006 Annual 
General Meeting or, 25 August 2006 if earlier. A resolution will be put to shareholders to renew the authority at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
As explained in the Chairman’s statement, the Company intends to return £300 million to shareholders during 2006 by way of market purchase
of shares.
The Group has a number of discretionary trusts funded by loans to acquire shares for the potential beneﬁt of employees of the Group. Details
of shares held by the trusts at 31 December 2005 are set out in note 29 to the accounts. During the period shares have been released from these
trusts in respect of share award schemes for employees.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on Wednesday 10 May 2006 at 11.00 am in the Whittle Room at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference
Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE. Notice is sent to shareholders separately with this report together with an explanation 
of special business to be considered at the meeting.
Auditor
A resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditor to the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

36 ITV plc 2005 annual report The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements, in accordance with
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the
directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the
parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
The Group ﬁnancial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the ﬁnancial position and performance of
the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such ﬁnancial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to ﬁnancial
statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation. 
The parent company ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
– for the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
– for the parent company ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company ﬁnancial statements; and 
– prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will
continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the
parent company and enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and
Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
37 We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial statements’’) of ITV plc for the year ended 31 December 
2005 which comprise of the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and parent company balance sheets, the consolidated cash ﬂow
statement, the consolidated statement of recognised Income and expense and the related notes. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as
having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 37. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether, 
in addition, the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you if,
in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required 
to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
– the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 December 2005 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended; 
– the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; 
– the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005; and 
– the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1 Accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate those of ITV plc and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in
associates and jointly controlled entities.
As required by EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) the Group’s accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and interpretations issued by the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB, as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”). These are the Group’s ﬁrst consolidated ﬁnancial statements to 
be prepared under IFRS and IFRS 1 (First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards) has been applied.
The accounts are principally prepared on the historical cost basis. Areas where other bases are applied are identiﬁed in the accounting 
policies below. Details of accounting estimates and judgments made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have 
a signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnancial statements are discussed in note 36.
The comparative information presented in these accounts has been restated and represented under IFRS. In respect of ﬁnancial instruments,
the Group’s policy, as permitted under IFRS 1, has been to adopt IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) and IAS 39 (Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) from 1 January 2005. Comparatives have therefore not been restated to reﬂect the requirements of
IAS 32 and IAS 39 and continue to be presented in accordance with UK GAAP. Note 37 sets out the impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 
at 1 January 2005. Further details on the restatement of comparative information and conversion to IFRS are given later in these accounts on
pages 70 and 71.
The parent company’s individual accounts continue to be presented under UK GAAP.
The accounting policies set out below, except as noted above, have been applied consistently in presenting the consolidated ﬁnancial
information. 
b) Revenue recognition
Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and consists of sales of goods and services to third parties. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised 
when the Group has transferred the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership and control of the goods sold and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably. Key classes of revenue are recognised on the following basis:
Advertising and sponsorship on transmission
Programme production on delivery
Programme rights when contracted and available for exploitation
Revenue on barter transactions is recognised only when the goods or services being exchanged are of a dissimilar nature.
c) Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial
and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently
exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more 
other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the 
equity method.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is the
power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating decisions of an entity but is not control or joint control over those policies. These investments
are accounted for using the equity method.
d) Current/non-current distinction
Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for
sale or consumption in, the course of the Group’s operating cycle. All other assets are classiﬁed as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Group’s operating
cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date. All other liabilities are classiﬁed as non-current liabilities.
e) Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Certain items of property,
plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of
deemed cost, being the revalued amount less depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Assets held under such leases 
are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciation is provided as appropriate. Outstanding ﬁnance lease obligations, 
which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included within borrowings. The ﬁnance element of the agreements is charged to the
income statement over the term of the lease on a systematic basis.
All other leases are operating leases the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual value on a straight line basis
over their estimated useful lives. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows:
Vehicles, equipment and ﬁttings 3 to 13 years
Plant and machinery 10 to 20 years
Properties:
television studios 40 to 60 years
leaseholds shorter of residual lease term or 70 years
Freehold land not depreciated
Freehold buildings up to 60 years

  Notes to the accounts
1 Accounting policies (continued)
f) Intangible assets
Business combinations and goodwill All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the
purchase method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identiﬁable net assets 
acquired. Subsequent adjustments to the fair values of net assets acquired made within 12 months of the acquisition date are accounted for from 
the date of acquisition.
For business combinations prior to this date, but after 30 September 1998, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, which represents the amount
recorded under UK GAAP at that time less amortisation up to 31 December 2003. The classiﬁcation and accounting treatment of business
combinations occurring prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as permitted under IFRS 1. Goodwill is
stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to cash generating units.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 September 1998 was recognised as a deduction from equity.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation except those identiﬁable
intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination which are shown at fair value at the date of acquisition (in accordance with IFRS 3
(Business combinations)) less accumulated amortisation. Identiﬁable intangible assets are those which can be sold separately or which arise from
legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable.
Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indeﬁnite.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. The useful lives and amortisation methods for each major class
of intangible asset are as follows:
Film libraries Sum of digits 20 years
Licences Straight line 11 to 17 years
Brands Straight line up to 11 years
Customer contracts Straight line up to 6 years
Customer relationships Straight line 5 to 10 years
g) Distribution rights
Programme rights acquired primarily for the purposes of distribution are classiﬁed within the balance sheet as non-current assets. They are
recognised initially at cost and charged through the income statement over either a three or ﬁve year period depending on genre.
h) Equity investments
Equity investments comprise equity securities which do not meet the deﬁnition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and are stated at fair
value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised directly in the available for sale reserve in equity. Prior to the Group’s adoption of IAS 32 (Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) and IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) from 1 January 2005, investments 
in equity securities were held at initial cost less any impairment subsequently recognised. The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 is shown 
in note 37.
i) Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiﬁable
cash ﬂows (cash-generating units). Where an asset such as goodwill relates to more than one cash-generating unit, impairment is tested against
the cash ﬂows of the group of cash-generating units related to that asset.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks speciﬁc to the asset.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Impairment losses in respect of
goodwill are not reversed. No reversal of impairment has been booked by the Group.
44 ITV plc 2005 annual report 1 Accounting policies (continued)
j) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling 
at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
measured at historical cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling
during the ﬁnancial period. Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in the translation reserve in equity.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken directly
to the translation reserve within equity.
In respect of all foreign operations only those translation differences arising since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as 
a separate component of equity as permitted under IFRS 1. On disposal of an investment in a foreign operation the associated translation reserve
balance is released to the income statement.
k) Exceptional items
Exceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the income statement, are items which due to their material and non-recurring nature have been
classiﬁed separately in order to draw them to the attention of the reader of the accounts and to show more accurately the underlying proﬁts
of the Group.
l) Programme rights
Where programming, sports rights and ﬁlm rights are acquired for the primary purpose of broadcasting these are recognised within current assets.
An asset is recognised when the Group controls, in substance, the respective assets and the risks and rewards associated with them. For acquired
programme rights an asset is recognised as payments are made and is recognised in full when the acquired programming is available for
transmission. Programming produced internally either for the purpose of broadcasting or to be sold in the normal course of the Group’s operating
cycle is recognised within current assets at production cost.
Programme costs and rights are written off to operating costs in full on ﬁrst transmission except certain ﬁlm rights which are written off over a
number of transmissions. Programme costs and rights not yet written off at the balance sheet date are included on the balance sheet at the lower
of cost and net realisable value.
m) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits with maturity of less than or equal to three months and cash held to meet
ﬁnance lease commitments.
n) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation arising from past events and it is
probable that an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected
future cash ﬂows by a rate which reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the liability based on 
an appropriate gilt rate.
o) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost. The difference between cost and redemption value
being recorded in the income statement over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Where the Group has identiﬁed that any such liabilities result in a mismatch between the accounting liability and the related derivative, the
Group has adopted early the fair value option provision of IAS 39 (revised). The effect of this is that the Group recognises any such ﬁnancial
liabilities at fair value in all periods subsequent to initial recognition, with resultant gains or losses recorded in the income statement.
p) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations (IFRS 5) 
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than 
continuing use, they are available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable.
On initial classiﬁcation as held for sale, non-current assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and
fair value less costs to sell.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets (including those in disposal groups) classiﬁed as held for sale. Assets classiﬁed 
as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet and classiﬁed as current assets or liabilities with disposal groups being
separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.
IFRS 5 applies prospectively for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and has therefore not been adopted for the comparative period. 
45 Notes to the accounts
1 Accounting policies (continued)
q) Taxation
The tax charge for the period comprises both current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for ﬁnancial
reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; 
the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt other than in a business combination, and differences
relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to utilise the temporary
difference. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group
has the right of set off.
r) Employee beneﬁts
Deﬁned contribution schemes Obligations under the Group’s deﬁned contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement
as incurred.
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes The Group’s obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by
estimating the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that beneﬁt is
discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of scheme assets is deducted. The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date
on high quality corporate bonds. The calculation is performed by a qualiﬁed actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The Group has taken the option of adopting early the amendment to IAS 19 (Employee Beneﬁts) issued on 16 December 2004. As a result,
actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Share based compensation The Group operates a number of share based compensation schemes. The fair value of the equity instrument is
measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value
of the share options and awards is measured using either a Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes model as appropriate taking into account the terms and
conditions of the individual scheme. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the actual vesting except where forfeiture is due
only to market based criteria not being achieved.
s) ITV shares held by Employee Beneﬁt Trusts (EBTs) 
Transactions of the Group-sponsored EBTs are included in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. In particular, the EBTs’ purchases of shares in ITV plc 
are debited directly to equity.
t) Derivatives and other ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses a limited number of derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge its exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest and other foreign exchange
rates. The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with the movement recorded
in the income statement.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair
value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking
into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Prior to the Group’s adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 interest receipts and payments under interest rate swap and option
agreements were accrued so as to match the net income or cost with the related ﬁnance expense. No amounts were recognised in respect of
future periods. The difference between the fair value and book value of bonds and derivative instruments arising on the acquisition accounting 
for Carlton was amortised through net interest over the remaining life of the instruments. The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 is shown in
note 37.
u) Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity in the period in which they are declared.
v) Investment income
Investment income comprises dividends received from the Group's investments. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the
date the Group's right to receive payments is established.
w) Net ﬁnancing costs
Net ﬁnancing costs principally comprise interest payable, ﬁnance charges on ﬁnance leases, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses
on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement and the expected return on pension scheme assets net of the interest cost
on liabilities.

In 2005 a charge of £40 million was incurred in respect of reorganisation and integration costs including the consolidation of regional news
production centres and technical facilities. The largest element of this (£25 million) was staff related. Also included in 2005 is an £11 million receipt
from the liquidators of ONdigital. A £10 million loss has been recognised in relation to the education business after its classiﬁcation as a disposal
group held for sale.
Reorganisation and integration costs in 2004 of £65 million were principally costs associated with the integration of the Carlton, Granada and
new subsidiary businesses into ITV plc. The largest element of these costs (£41 million) were staff related with further costs incurred arising as a
result of integrating our IT systems and infrastructure, property portfolio and ﬁxed asset base.
6 Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution pension schemes.
Deﬁned contribution schemes
Total contributions recognised as an expense in relation to deﬁned contribution schemes during 2005 were £2 million (2004: £2 million).
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes

The expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is assessed by considering the current level of expected returns on risk free
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is
invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the asset
allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on plan assets in the year ended 31 December 2005 was £331 million (2004: £163 million).
The principal assumptions used in the scheme valuations at the balance sheet date were:
2005 2004
Rate of general increase in salaries 4.00% 4.25%
Rate of increase in pension payment 2.75% 2.75%
Rate of increase to deferred pensions 2.75% 2.75%
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.90% 5.40%
Inﬂation assumption 2.75% 2.75%
For mortality rates the Group has used PA92 tables with mortality projected to 2015 for pensioner members and to 2030 for non-pensioner
members. Using these tables a male member currently aged 40 is expected to live for a further 45 years, while a male pensioner aged 60 is
expected to live a further 24 years. The Group reﬂected this recognition that mortality rates have reduced in its 2004 valuation. The tables above
have been used for both 2005 and 2004 and reﬂect published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the results of investigations into 
the mortality experience of scheme members.
Normal contributions into the schemes in 2006 are expected to be in the region of £20 million based on contribution rates agreed with scheme
trustees. Payments totalling £207 million have been made in early 2006 as part of the announced £325 million lump sum payment to address the
schemes’ deﬁcit being the balance following the £118 million payment in December 2005.

Share schemes
Full details of the ITV Commitment Scheme, Performance Share Plan and Deferred Share Award Plan can be found in the remuneration report 
on page 82.
The Granada Media and Granada Commitment schemes mirror the ITV scheme summarised in the remuneration report on page 82. The main
differences are as follows:
25% of the Matching Awards will vest for median ranking, and maximum vesting will occur only for ﬁrst or second position out of a comparator
group of sixteen companies (set out in the remuneration report on page 87). The performance condition is tested in respect of 50% of the
Matching Award on the second anniversary of the date of grant. Any portion of the Matching Award which does not vest at that time may vest
when the condition is again tested on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. Performance conditions were adjusted to take account of 
the merger.
The Granada Media, Granada, Carlton and ITV Sharesave schemes are Inland Revenue Approved SAYE schemes.
The Granada Media, Granada and Carlton Executive Option schemes are Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved schemes with three year
performance periods. For all options granted before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisﬁed on the merger 
of Carlton and Granada. The performance conditions for options granted from December 2002 measure TSR against a comparator group of
companies permitting exercise only if ITV is ranked above the median of this group. The comparator group for Granada is set out in the
remuneration report on page 87. The comparator group for Carlton is the FTSE 100 at date of grant. Performance conditions were adjusted 
to take account of the merger.
The Carlton Equity Participation Plan operated under similar terms to the ITV Commitment Scheme summarised in the remuneration report 
on page 82. For all awards made before December 2002 the performance conditions were deemed to be satisﬁed on the merger of Carlton and
Granada. For awards made from December 2002, 33% of the Matching Award vests at median with maximum vesting occurring when ITV ranks 
in the upper quartile against a comparator group of UK media companies. The performance condition is tested on 1 April following the third
anniversary of the date of grant. Any proportion that does not vest at this time may vest when the condition is tested on 1 April following the
fourth anniversary of the date of grant. Performance conditions were adjusted to take account of the merger. 
The Granada Deferred Share Award Plan mirrors the ITV scheme summarised in the remuneration report on page 82.The Carlton Deferred 
Annual Bonus Plan operated as a share award scheme. Shares were purchased from bonus entitlements and held in trust for a three year period.
Matching shares were awarded and released after four years.
Exercises can be satisﬁed by market purchase or by new issue shares. No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of 
the Deferred Share Award Plan or nil-cost options under the Commitment Scheme. However it is now Company practice to satisfy all option
exercises where possible by using shares purchased in the market and held in the Granada, Carlton and ITV Employees’ Beneﬁt Trusts rather 
than by issuing new shares.

The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of ITV plc. ITV plc was formed on the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications
Plc on 2 February 2004. 
The Executive Option Schemes, Commitment Schemes and Performance Share Plans all have market based performance conditions which 
are taken into account in the fair value calculation using a Monte Carlo pricing model. The Black-Scholes model is used to value the Sharesave
Schemes as these do not have any market performance conditions.
Share-based payment charges totalled £21 million in 2005 (2004: £15 million). Of these £4 million have been shown within exceptional items
(2004: £nil).

In the year ended 31 December 2005 the effective tax rate on proﬁts is lower (2004: lower) than the standard rate of UK corporation tax primarily
as a result of the utilisation of tax losses on which deferred tax assets were not previously recognised, offset by exceptional items which are not
deductible for corporation tax purposes. The underlying tax rate on operating proﬁts, after adjusting for exceptional items, overprovisions in prior
years, and excluding associates and joint ventures is 28% (2004: 27%).
A tax expense totalling £8 million (2004: credit of £37 million) has been recognised directly in equity representing a current tax credit of 
£2 million (2004: £nil) and a deferred tax expense of £10 million (2004: credit of £37 million).

At 31 December 2005 total deferred tax assets are £232 million (2004: £228 million) and total deferred tax liabilities are £158 million (2004: £162 million).
Potential deferred tax assets estimated at £0.7 billion, primarily in respect of capital losses and loan relationship deﬁcits, have not been
recognised due to uncertainties as to amount and whether gain or income will arise in the appropriate form and relevant territory against which
such losses could be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are also not recognised because the Group controls
whether the liability will be incurred and is satisﬁed that it will not be incurred in the foreseeable future.

Amortisation of intangible assets is shown within operating costs in the income statement. In 2004 an impairment of £5 million was recognised
within exceptional items as a result of an impairment review on elements of goodwill attached to the education business.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill
The following units have signiﬁcant carrying amounts of goodwill:
2005 2004
£m £m
Broadcasting 2,963 2,889
Multiple units without signiﬁcant goodwill 462 402
3,425 3,291
The recoverable amount of the Broadcasting cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations. Those calculations use cash ﬂow
projections based on actual operating results and the ﬁve year business plan. Cash ﬂows in perpetuity are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate
and are appropriate because broadcasting is a long term business. The growth rate used is consistent with the long term average growth rate for
the industry. A pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% has been used in discounting the projected cash ﬂows.
The key assumptions and the approach to determining their value are:
Assumption How determined
Total advertising market Long term trends, industry forecasts and macro-economic outlook
Television share of advertising market Long term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates
Digital penetration Industry forecasts and government stated objectives
ITV1 share of commercial impacts Impact of digital penetration and historic viewing shares by platform

25 Financial instruments 
Financial instruments disclosures 2005
a) Treasury operation and policy
The most signiﬁcant treasury exposures faced by the Group are raising ﬁnance, managing interest rate and currency positions and investing surplus
cash in high quality assets. Treasury policies have been approved by the Board for managing each of these exposures including levels of authority
on the type and use of ﬁnancial instruments. Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures. The treasury department
reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board and treasury operations are subject to periodic independent reviews and internal audit.
Financing
The Group’s ﬁnancing policy for long term funding is to use debt instruments with a range of maturities. It is substantially funded from the UK 
and European capital markets and has bank facilities from the UK syndicated market.
Interest rate management
The Group’s interest rate policy is to be between 30% and 70% ﬁxed on its forecast net indebtedness over the medium term in order to provide 
a balance between certainty of cost and beneﬁt from low ﬂoating rates. The Group uses interest rate swaps and options in order to achieve the
desired mix between ﬁxed and ﬂoating.
Currency management
The Group’s foreign exchange policy is to hedge foreign currency denominated costs at the time of commitment and to hedge a proportion 
of foreign currency denominated revenues on a rolling 12 month basis. It is also the Group’s policy to hedge major balance sheet exposures. 
The policies signiﬁcantly reduce the Group’s earnings and balance sheet exposures to changes in exchange rates. 
61 Notes to the accounts
25 Financial instruments (continued)
Investment in cash
The Group operates strict investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash and the emphasis is on preservation of capital. Counterparty limits for
cash deposits are largely based upon long term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies. Deposits longer than three months require
the approval of the Management Committee of the Board.
b) Measurement
Equity investments
Equity investments are detailed in note 15. The fair value is based on year end quoted prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales
proceeds for other investments.
Cash equivalents
The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments.
Loans
The £200 million and £250 million Eurobonds have book and fair values of £207 million and £253 million respectively based upon their bid price
valuations at 31 December 2005. The bonds are being carried at fair value with the resultant gains or losses recorded in the income statement in
accordance with our accounting policy which prevent an accounting mismatch with the related swaps.
The d356 million Exchangeable bond is accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method. At 31 December 2005 its
book value was £245 million and its fair value based upon bid price was £243 million.
The Yen 2 billion loan note is accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method. At 31 December 2005 its book value
was £11 million and its fair value based upon bid price was £10 million.
The £325 million Eurobond is accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method. It had a book value of £321 million
and a fair value based upon bid price of £327 million at 31 December 2005. 
The fair value of all other loans and ﬁnance leases were the same as book value at 31 December 2005.
Interest rate swaps and options
All interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon termination prices. The fair value of these instruments at 
31 December 2005 was £19 million.
Other current assets and liabilities
No disclosure of fair value has been made as the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Sterling ﬁxed rate liabilities
Sterling ﬁxed rate liabilities comprise Carlton Communications Limited Preference shares, the £200 million Eurobond and ﬁnance lease creditors.
The liabilities have a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% after taking account of interest rate swaps and have a weighted average term of
six years.
Interest rate swaps matched against the £200 million Eurobond are described below:
In April 2003 the £200 million Eurobond was swapped such that the Group receives the bond coupon of 7.625% and pays six month sterling
LIBOR plus 3.19%. The bank has the option to cancel the swap for nil value at each six monthly rate ﬁxing date. In May 2004 the Group entered into
a one year swap for £75 million, a two year swap for £75 million and a three year swap for £50 million under which it receives six month sterling
LIBOR plus 3.19% and pays ﬁxed rates of 8.41%, 8.65% and 8.68% respectively. 
The Group also has a further swap matched against this Eurobond which was dormant as at 31 December 2004. Under the terms of this
dormant swap if six month dollar LIBOR exceeds 3.75% the Group receives the bond coupon of 7.625% and pays the higher of six month dollar
LIBOR plus 0.75% set in arrears or in advance (payable in sterling) or 6 month sterling LIBOR minus 0.1% set in arrears or in advance. If six month
dollar LIBOR set in advance sets above 6.5% a further 1% margin for that period is payable. This swap is not designated as a hedge for accounting
purposes and as such the Group’s policy is to provide to the extent that the swap represents an onerous contract. As at 31 December 2004 there
was no provision against this swap.
Sterling ﬂoating rate liabilities
Sterling ﬂoating rate cost of borrowing mainly comprises the post swap costs of various debt instruments described below:
The a639 million Exchangeable bond was swapped with effect from May 2002 from its ﬁxed rate cost of 2.25% into a ﬂoating rate cost of 
one month sterling LIBOR minus 2.81% on a notional amount of £395 million until January 2005. In September 2004 the Group repurchased 
a158 million of the Exchangeable. In December 2004 a125 million of the bonds were put for settlement in January 2005. At this time the Group
entered into a forward starting 2 year swap commencing January 2005 whereby it receives 2.25% annually matched to the remaining a356 million
bonds and pays 3 month sterling LIBOR minus 0.23% on a notional £252 million.
The £250 million Eurobond was swapped in July 2003 with subsequent amendments in May 2004 and December 2004 from its ﬁxed rate
coupon of 5.625% into the higher of six month sterling LIBOR set in arrears plus 1.045% or the payment rate used in the previous 6 month period.
The Group also has a further swap matched against this Eurobond which was dormant as at 31 December 2004. Under the terms of this
dormant swap if six month dollar LIBOR exceeds 3.75% the Group receives the bond coupon of 5.625% and pays the higher of six month dollar
LIBOR plus 0.75% set in arrears or in advance (payable in sterling) or six month sterling LIBOR minus 0.1% set in arrears or in advance. If six month
dollar LIBOR set in advance sets above 6.5% a further 1% margin for that period is payable.
Yen 2 billion of private placement notes were swapped in September 2001 into sterling LIBOR plus 0.48% on a notional amount of £11 million. 
£6 million of loan notes were issued in consideration for repurchasing Carlton Communications Limited preference shares paying a coupon of 
LIBOR minus 0.5%.

63 Notes to the accounts
25 Financial instruments (continued)
Loans
The £200 million and £250 million Eurobonds have book values of £208 million and £249 million respectively based upon their mid market
valuations at merger and straight line amortisation to par over their remaining lives. The fair value of these bonds discounting at LIBOR was 
£212 million and £257 million respectively. Similarly the book value of the Yen 2 billion loan note was £11 million at 31 December 2004 which
compares to its fair value calculated by discounting at LIBOR of £10 million.
The book value and the fair value of the Exchangeable bonds at 31 December 2004 was par on the basis that the holders of these bonds did not
exercise their put option in December 2004.
The fair value of all other loans and ﬁnance leases were the same as book value at 31 December 2004.
Preference shares
The fair value of the Carlton Communications Limited Preference Shares was not materially different from the book value at 31 December 2004
due to the proximity of the issuer’s call option on 30 April 2005.
Interest rate swaps and options
The interest rate swaps and options that were held by Carlton Communications Limited at merger and which were still outstanding at 
31 December 2004 have an aggregate book value provision of £24 million based upon their mid market valuations at merger and straight line
amortisation over their remaining lives. The fair value of these contracts along with new contracts entered into post merger on the basis of
termination cost totalled £22 million at 31 December 2004.

Foreign exchange contracts are valued at the 31 December 2004 spot rate of exchange to match the treatment applied to the item hedged.

Currency risk
It is the Group’s policy to hedge trading activities in non-functional currencies into the functional currency at the time of commitment. After taking 
such hedges into account, the Group had no material ﬁnancial exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary
liabilities in non-functional currencies at 31 December 2004.

27 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
The Group is in the process of selling its education business and in January 2006 sold the 021 business. As such these are classiﬁed as disposal
groups held for sale. The businesses are being sold as they are not core to the Group’s main activities. It is expected that the education business 
will be sold within the next year. Additionally four freehold properties are also classiﬁed as held for sale. These properties are being sold as they are
deemed to be surplus to future operating requirements and disposal is anticipated to be completed within one year. On classiﬁcation as held for
sale a £1 million loss was recognised. In summary the following are classiﬁed as held for sale in the balance sheet:

Acquisitions and disposals in 2005
SDN
On 27 April 2005, the Group acquired 50.1% of the shares in SDN Ltd and 100% of the shares in United Media & Information Ltd (which held the
remaining shares in SDN Ltd) for a total consideration of £83 million in cash. As part of the acquisition, loan amounts due by these companies,
totalling £53 million, were repaid bringing the total cash outﬂow of the Group to £136 million. SDN holds the licence to operate Multiplex A on
digital terrestrial television.
In the period to 31 December 2005 SDN contributed £8 million to the consolidated operating proﬁt of the Group (before additional amortisation
of £4 million). Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2005, the estimated revenue for the Group would have been £7 million higher at 
£2,184 million and operating proﬁt before amortisation and exceptional items £2 million higher at £462 million (additional amortisation is
£2 million) for the year ended 31 December 2005. The acquired net assets of SDN are set out in the table below.

The intangible assets recognised at a fair value of £82 million include the Multiplex licence and customer contracts. A deferred tax liability of 
£25 million has been recognised in respect of these intangible assets.
The goodwill recognised represents the wider strategic beneﬁts of the acquisition to ITV plc and the value of those assets not requiring valuation
under IFRS3 (Business combinations). The strategic beneﬁts are principally the enhanced ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business
relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex A and the additional capacity available from 2010. These, in combination with existing Group
assets including the ITV brand and programming, generate the goodwill on acquisition.
Friends Reunited
On 6 December 2005, the Group agreed to acquire 100% of the shares in Friends Reunited Holdings Limited for a total initial consideration of 
£120 million and deferred consideration of up to £55 million payable in 2009 contingent upon the future performance of the acquired business.
The initial consideration consisted of £75 million cash, £21 million loan notes and £24 million ITV plc shares. Of the initial consideration £94 million 
was paid in 2005 with the balance of £26 million paid in 2006 (being the 21 million (£24 million) ITV plc shares and £2 million loan notes).
The fair value of the consideration is £145 million. This takes into account the initial consideration, the present value of the expected deferred
consideration and other costs associated with the acquisition.
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2005, the estimated revenue for the Group would have been £12 million higher at £2,189 million and
operating proﬁt before amortisation and exceptional items £6 million higher at £466 million (additional amortisation would have been £4 million)
for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The acquired net assets of Friends Reunited are set out in the table below.

The intangible assets recognised at fair value include the brands and customer relationships. A deferred tax liability of £10 million has been
recognised in respect of these intangible assets. A current tax asset of £3 million and a deferred tax asset of £18 million has been recognised in
respect of the exercise of share options.
The goodwill recognised represents the beneﬁts of the acquisition across the Group when combined with existing Group assets and businesses
and the value of those assets not requiring valuation under IFRS 3 (Business combinations).

28 Acquisitions and disposals of businesses (continued)
Valuation of acquired intangible assets methodology
Valuation of acquired intangibles has been preformed in accordance with industry standard practice. Methods applied are designed to isolate
the value of each intangible asset separately from the other assets of the business. The value of brands are assessed by applying a royalty 
rate to the expected future revenues over the life of the brand. Licences are valued on a start-up basis. Customer relationships and controls are
valued based on expected future cash ﬂows from those existing at the date of acquisition. Contributory charges from other assets are taken as
appropriate with post tax cash ﬂows then being discounted back to their present value. Typical discount rates applied in the valuation of intangible
assets acquired in the period are 8%-11%.
Disposal
During the year the Group disposed of Superhire Ltd for gross consideration of £2 million.

*Reclassiﬁcation of ITV2, LNN, ITFC, ITV News Channel and ITV Network Limited to subsidiaries on combination of Granada and Carlton. These were previously held within investments in joint
ventures and associates.
The most material acquisition accounted for during 2004 results from acquisition accounting for the combination with Carlton Communications Plc
on 2 February 2004. Consideration comprised 1,308 million ordinary shares and 124 million convertible shares in ITV plc. The fair value of the
consideration at the date of merger was £1,897 million.
In the period to 31 December 2004 Carlton contributed £82 million to the consolidated operating proﬁt of the Group (before additional
amortisation of £101 million). Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2004, the estimated revenue for the Group would have been £30 million
higher at £2,083 million and operating proﬁt before amortisation and exceptional items £1 million higher at £325 million for the year ended 
31 December 2004.
The principal fair value adjustments to the book values (under IFRS) of the acquired assets and liabilities are as follows:
• Recognition of acquired intangible assets at fair value. These are principally brands, customer contracts, customer relationships, licences and
acquired ﬁlm libraries.
• Acquired properties stated at market value.
• Revaluation of investments to estimated market value.
• Write down of inventories to estimated selling price less reasonable proﬁt margin.
• Assets held for sale shown at expected net proceeds discounted back to their present value at the date of acquisition.
• Revaluation of ﬁnancial instruments to market value.
• Deferred tax provided on acquisition accounting adjustments as appropriate.
Disposals
During 2004 the Group disposed of The Moving Picture Company Holdings Ltd and Carlton Books Ltd (which were classiﬁed as held for resale) for
respective gross considerations of £59 million and £nil.

37 Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39
In accordance with the option allowed by IFRS 1 the Group has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 1 January 2005. The impact on the
Group’s opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005, by balance sheet category, is outlined below:

c) Reclassiﬁcation of currency option relating to Exchangeable bond from borrowings.
d) Revaluation of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to 1 January 2005 fair values.
e) Reclassiﬁcation of currency option to trade and other receivables (see c above), revaluation of loans and loan notes to 1 January 2005 fair values
and reclassiﬁcation of Carlton preference shares from minority interests.
The nature of the effects on the primary statements in 2004, had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been adopted, would have been similar to those stated above.
69 Conversion to International Financial Reporting Standards
Following the Group’s adoption of IFRS, the 2004 comparative ﬁnancial information in these accounts has been restated and represented under
IFRS. The reconciliations below highlight the key impacts on both the proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders and on total equity. The Group has
produced Preliminary International Financial Reporting Standards Financial Statements for 2004 which set out in greater detail the impact of IFRS
on the Group’s 2004 results and include more detailed reconciliations from UK GAAP of the balance sheets at 1 January 2004, 30 June 2004 and 
31 December 2004 and the income statements for the six months ended 30 June 2004 and the year ended 31 December 2004. This document is

* Includes related deferred tax effect
The principal IFRS adjustments are as follows:
a) IAS 19 – Employee beneﬁts
The principal impact of IAS 19 (Employee beneﬁts) on the Group is in relation to accounting for deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes.
IAS 19 (as amended) requires deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme accounting to be based on fair values at the balance sheet date. Separate 
charges for operating and net ﬁnancing costs based on actuarial assumptions in place at the start of the year are required through the income
statement while in the balance sheet under the accounting policy adopted the deﬁcit is recognised in full with actuarial gains and losses arising
taken through the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they arise. The treatment and impact is broadly in line 
with that previously disclosed in accordance with FRS 17 under UK GAAP. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the balance sheet deﬁcit.
The operating charge through the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2004 reduces by £5 million while the net ﬁnancing 
cost, for which there was no equivalent under UK GAAP (SSAP 24), is £6 million. The reduction reﬂects the different measurement basis and the
recognition of a short term curtailment gain on the Group’s pension schemes which had a signiﬁcant drop in active members as a result of the
merger between Granada and Carlton. There is a related increase in the deferred tax charge of £2 million.
The balance sheet shows a total IAS 19 pensions deﬁcit of £672 million at 31 December 2004 (1 January 2004: £422 million) of which, under 
UK GAAP, the unfunded element of £27 million (1 January 2004: £22 million) was previously recognised within creditors and an amount of 
£95 million (with associated deferred tax asset of £28 million) was included within provisions under acquisition accounting for Carlton. A movement
through the statement of recognised income and expense for the year of £123 million reﬂects the actuarial gains and losses. The deﬁcit is shown
before a deferred tax asset of £202 million (1 January 2004: £127 million) recognised within non-current assets in the balance sheet giving a net
deﬁcit of £470 million (1 January 2004: £295 million). These and other smaller adjustments lead to a net decrease in net assets of £389 million at
31 December 2004 (1 January 2004: £274 million).
70 ITV plc 2005 annual report b) IFRS 2 – Share-based payments
Under IFRS 2 (Share-based payments) the charge through the income statement is based upon the fair value of share options and awards granted.
The fair value of the equity instrument is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period through the income statement with a
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either a Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes model 
as appropriate taking into account the terms and conditions of the individual scheme. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect
changes to the expected vesting except where forfeiture is due only to changes in the expected achievement of market based criteria.
IFRS 2 requires a charge for all such grants including awards, options and SAYE schemes unlike 2004 UK GAAP which based the charge on the
intrinsic market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant and so, for the Group, a charge arose on awards only.
The Group has applied IFRS 2 only to share options and awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 as
permitted under IFRS 1. As the Group has not previously presented the fair value of share options and awards granted, the IFRS 1 option to apply
IFRS 2 to all share options and awards granted, including those granted before 7 November 2002, cannot be taken by the Group.
The charge under IFRS is £5 million higher in 2004 than under UK GAAP. There is no impact on the net assets of the Group as the charge to 
the income statement is matched by an equal credit through reserves (barring the deferred tax impact discussed under point e)).
c) IFRS 3 – Business combinations
The Group has taken the IFRS 1 exemption from applying IFRS 3 to combinations occurring before 1 January 2004. Consequently there is no
impact on goodwill recognised before that date and so no impact on the 2004 opening balance sheet.
Business combinations occurring after 1 January 2004 have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3. This impacts on the acquisition
accounting for Carlton Communications Plc and the purchase of additional stakes in GMTV and GSkyB, which occurred during 2004. The principal
impact is that intangible assets (which meet the deﬁnition for recognition under IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) and whose fair value can be measured)
are recognised separately from goodwill. These assets are then amortised over their useful lives. Additionally the fair values identiﬁed under UK
GAAP must be revisited under IFRS. The main impact of this is that the pensions deﬁcits are brought onto the balance sheet using an IAS 19
(Employee Beneﬁts) valuation rather than the SSAP 24 (Accounting for Pension Costs) valuation used under UK GAAP. Both the intangible assets
and pensions adjustments lead to associated deferred tax balances being recognised. The net of these reduces the goodwill recognised.
IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill instead requiring that it is subjected to annual impairment testing. This causes a reduction in 
the Group's amortisation charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 of £72 million. Additionally goodwill balances held within investments in
joint ventures and associates are also no longer amortised leading to a credit of £5 million to the share of proﬁt of associates and joint ventures.
The balance sheet shows corresponding increases to goodwill and investments in associates and joint ventures.
The net impact on the income statement is to increase the amortisation charge in 2004 by £33 million, reduce the tax charge by £33 million
and increase share of proﬁts from joint ventures and associates by £5 million, giving a net increase in proﬁt of £5 million.
On the balance sheet at 31 December 2004, goodwill is lower than previously reported under UK GAAP by £255 million, other intangible assets
increase by £435 million, investments in joint ventures and associates increase by £5 million which together with an additional deferred tax liability
of £146 million gives a net increase in net assets of £39 million.
d) IAS 10 – Events after the balance sheet date
Under IAS 10 (Events after the balance sheet date) dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared. The impact on the balance
sheet is to reduce liabilities by £53 million at 31 December 2004 (1 January 2004: £20 million).
e) IAS 12 – Taxation
IAS 12 (Income taxes) requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences rather than timing differences which are considered under
UK GAAP. The deferred tax impacts of IAS 19 and IFRS 3 are discussed in a) and c) above. The remaining deferred tax impact is in respect of a
number of smaller items such as, share-based payments and properties which were revalued historically.
f) Cash ﬂow statement
The material adjustments to the cash ﬂow statement are principally presentational with cash ﬂows now classiﬁed under the three main categories
of operating activities, investing activities and ﬁnancing activities. Additionally the deﬁnition of cash and cash equivalents is wider with liquid
resources now being included in both the opening and closing balances and the cash ﬂows.

72 ITV plc 2005 annual report Notes to the ITV plc company ﬁnancial statements
i Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
As permitted by section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985, a separate proﬁt and loss account, dealing with the results of the parent company, 
has not been presented.
The Company has adopted FRS 21 (IAS 10) ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ for the ﬁrst time in these accounts. The principal impact 
of this standard is on dividend recognition. Previously dividends were recognised in the period for which they were declared as relating to, now
dividends are recognised during the period in which they are declared. The impact on the 2004 comparatives is to reduce the dividend creditor 
by £53 million and the dividend recognised within the proﬁt and loss account by the same amount.
The Company has adopted FRS 26 (IAS 39) ‘Financial Instruments: Measurement’ and FRS 25 (IAS 32) ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure 
and Presentation’ for the ﬁrst time in these accounts. As permitted under these standards the 2004 comparatives have not been restated and
continue to be presented under previously applicable accounting standards. The impact of adopting FRS 25 and FRS 26 is discussed in note viii.
The Company has adopted FRS 28 (Corresponding amounts) for the ﬁrst time in these accounts.
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain assets and liabilities and in
accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. Control exists where the Company has the power to govern 
the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency
monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date. Foreign exchange
differences arising on translation are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are
translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, and in subsequent periods at amortised cost. The difference between cost and redemption value
being recorded in the proﬁt and loss account over the period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Where the Company has identiﬁed that any such liabilities result in a mismatch between the accounting liability and the related derivative, 
the Company has adopted early the fair value option provision of FRS 26. The effect of this is that the Company recognises any such ﬁnancial
liabilities at fair value in all periods subsequent to initial recognition, with resultant gains or losses recorded in the proﬁt and loss account.
Derivatives and other ﬁnancial instruments 
The Company uses a limited number of derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge its exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest rates. The Company does
not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently remeasured at fair value with movement recorded in the
proﬁt and loss account.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair
value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date,
taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Prior to adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 from 1 January 2005 interest receipts and payments under interest rate swap and option agreements
were accrued so as to match the net income or cost with the related ﬁnance expense. No amounts were recognised in respect of future periods.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared.

deferred shares a transfer of such holder’s entire holding of deferred shares to such person as the Company may determine as custodian thereof

On 11 March 2005 the Company undertook a reorganisation of its share capital by way of a scheme of arrangement under section 425 of the
Companies Act 1985 and the amendment of its Articles of Association, which had the effect of reducing the number of US resident holders of
each class of shares to below 300 enabling it to suspend its registration and reporting obligations to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Accordingly, 28,122,373 ordinary and 483,612 convertible shares were cancelled on 11 March 2005. In order to maintain the level of the Company’s
issued share capital and reduce the cost of the Scheme, the Company conducted a cash placing with institutional investors of 30,000,000 new
ordinary shares of 10 pence each in the capital of the Company on 16 March 2005. As a small number of convertible shares were cancelled no 
new convertible shares were placed.

74 ITV plc 2005 annual report vi Contingent liabilities
Under a group registration, the Company is jointly and severally liable for VAT at 31 December 2005 of £37 million (31 December 2004: £49
million). The Company has guaranteed certain ﬁnance and operating lease obligations of subsidiary undertakings.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation and guarantees and in respect of warranties given in connection with certain
disposals of businesses and in respect of certain trading and other obligations of certain subsidiaries.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate allowance has been made in respect of these matters.
Where the Company enters into ﬁnancial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the ﬁnancial statements for the period commencing 1 January 2006.
vii Capital and other commitments
There are no capital commitments at 31 December 2005 (31 December 2004: none). There are commitments in respect of forward foreign
exchange contracts entered into the ordinary course of business.
The Company has not adopted amendments to FRS 26 in relation to ﬁnancial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing 
on or after 1 January 2006.
viii Adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26
The Company has applied FRS 25 and FRS 26 prospectively from 1 January 2005. The impact on the Company’s opening balance sheet at 
1 January 2005, by balance sheet category, is outlined below:

Corporate governance
The Board of ITV plc is committed to business integrity and high 
ethical values across the Group’s operations. As an essential part of 
this commitment, the Board supports high standards of corporate
governance and has a policy of seeking to comply with the
recommendations of the Combined Code and voting guidelines of 
our major institutional investors.
Compliance
As required by the Listing Rules issued by the UK Listing Authority, this
report describes how the Company has applied the principles set out in
Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. It also
discloses the extent to which the Company has complied with the
Code’s provisions.
The Board considers that, throughout the year (and subsequently 
up to the date of this report), the Company complied with the
provisions of the Combined Code.
The Board
Composition: The Board currently comprises eleven members, the
Chairman, seven non-executive and three executive directors.
Biographical details for each of the directors are set out on pages 
32 and 33.
Chairman: Sir Peter Burt is Chairman and is responsible for leadership of
the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. Details of
his professional commitments are included in his biography on page 32.
The Board is satisﬁed that these are not such as to interfere with the
performance of his duties for the Company. The Chairman is committed
to working for the Company for approximately 52 days per annum.
Senior Independent Director: Sir George Russell is Deputy Chairman 
and the senior independent non-executive director. He acts as a conduit
to the Board for communication of shareholder concerns when other
channels of communication are inappropriate and ensures that the
performance evaluation of the Chairman is conducted effectively. 
Details of his professional commitments are included in his
biography on page 32. The Board is satisﬁed that these are not such 
as to interfere with the performance of his duties for the Company. 
His job description is available on the Company website at
www.itvplc.com.
Chief Executive: Charles Allen is Chief Executive and has responsibility 
to the Board for leadership and management of the Company and
management of the day-to-day operations of the Company.
The respective job descriptions of the Chairman and the Chief
Executive are set out in writing and have been agreed by the Board.
Copies are available on the Company website at www.itvplc.com.
Election and re-election: All directors are required by the Company’s
articles of association to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual
General Meeting after their appointment by the Board. Subsequently,
all directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at least every
three years. Directors who reach the age of 70 will retire annually.
The directors who will be seeking re-election at the Annual General
Meeting on 10 May 2006 are set out in the Directors’ report on page 34.
The reasons why the Board believes they should be re-elected are set
out in the explanatory notes to the notice of the Annual General
Meeting sent with this document.
External directorships: With the speciﬁc approval of the Board in 
each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as
non-executive directors of other companies and retain any related fees
paid to them. Charles Allen served as a non-executive director of Tesco
plc throughout the year and Henry Staunton served as a non-executive
director of Legal & General Group plc throughout the year and of
Standard Bank plc from 1 December 2005. They both retained the fees
from these appointments. Details of the amounts retained are set out
in the Remuneration report on page 85.
The non-executive directors 
The non-executive directors constructively challenge and help 
develop proposals on strategy. They bring strong, independent
judgement, knowledge, and experience to the Board’s deliberations. 
The independent directors are of sufﬁcient calibre and number that
their views carry signiﬁcant weight in the Board’s decision making.
Independence: The Combined Code recommends that at least half 
of the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise “independent” 
non-executive directors. The ITV Board considers each of its current
non-executive directors to be independent.
Meetings of non-executives: The non-executive directors meet regularly
as a group.
Terms of appointment: Subject to the Company’s articles of association,
the Companies Act and satisfactory performance evaluation, non-
executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years
from commencement of appointment. Before the third and sixth
anniversary of the non-executive directors’ ﬁrst appointment, the
director will discuss with the Board whether it is appropriate for a further
three year term to be served. The re-appointment of directors who 
have served for more than nine years will be subject to annual review.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive
directors are available on the Corporate Information section of the
Company website at www.itvplc.com.
Time commitment: The Board is satisﬁed that each of the 
non-executive directors commits sufﬁcient time to the business 
of the Company.
Company Secretary: The Company Secretary, James Tibbitts, is
responsible for advising the Board through the Chairman on all
governance matters. The directors have access to the advice and
services of the Company Secretary. The Company’s articles of
association and the schedule of matters reserved to the Board for
decision, provide that the appointment and removal of the Company
Secretary is a matter for the full Board.

Non attendance has been due to ill health and unavoidable commitments. Corporate governance 78 ITV plc 2005 annual report
How the Board operates
Board meetings: The Board is scheduled to meet 10 times in 2006
(including two meetings devoted to discussion of strategic matters) 
and may meet at other times as and when required.
Board Programme: The Board approves annually a schedule of matters
to be considered at each meeting and at each meeting of the
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees.
Directors’ attendance: Attendance of directors at Board and Committee
meetings during 2005 is set out in the table on page 77.
Board responsibility and delegation: The speciﬁc responsibilities are set
out in a schedule of matters reserved to the Board. These include:
setting long term objectives and corporate strategy and approving an
annual budget; approving major acquisitions, divestments and capital
expenditure; approving Board appointments; reviewing systems of
ﬁnancial control and risk management; and approving policies relating
to directors’ remuneration. The full schedule of matters reserved to the
Board is available on the Company website at www.itvplc.com.
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to board
committees, the key committees being the Remuneration Committee,
the Audit Committee and the Nomination Committee. Further
information is provided below and copies of the terms of reference 
for each Committee are on the Company website at www.itvplc.com.
Information ﬂow: Regular reports and papers are circulated to the
directors in a timely manner in preparation for Board and Committee
meetings. These papers are supplemented by other relevant
information when applicable or if requested.
The non-executive directors receive monthly management accounts
and regular management reports which enable them to scrutinise the
Group’s and management’s performance against agreed objectives. 
ITV has developed a website for the use of its directors. The website is
regularly updated with information about the Company and other
corporate governance matters.
Independent professional advice: Directors are given access to
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense, when the
directors deem it necessary in order for them to carry out their
responsibilities. Details of the process are available on the Company
website at www.itvplc.com.
Insurance cover: The Company maintains liability insurance for its
directors and ofﬁcers with a cover limit of £50 million.
Indemnities: The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity with
its directors. A copy of the form of deed of indemnity is available on 
the Company website at www.itvplc.com.
Board effectiveness
Performance evaluation: The Board has established a formal process, 
led by the Chairman, for the annual evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its Committees, and individual directors with particular
attention given to those who are due for re-election. The directors are
made aware, on appointment, that their performance will be subject 
to an annual evaluation.
The ﬁrst evaluation took place in 2004 and some of the actions
taken during 2005 from this evaluation included the establishment 
of an internal communications function, strengthening of the strategic
planning resource internally, increased communication of business data
to directors, implementation of a more detailed induction programme
and establishment of a defence committee.
The evaluation for 2005 was undertaken in November. 
The evaluation process required each director to complete a detailed
questionnaire designed to provide the Chairman with a means 
of making year-to-year comparisons. The questions covered a range 
of issues such as board processes, board roles and responsibilities, 
board agendas, committee processes, individual effectiveness, 
training, continuing professional development and effectiveness
of the Chairman.
The results were collated and the consolidated results were presented
to the Chairman. Individual director assessments were discussed by the
Chairman with the relevant director together with goals for the
following year. The results of the evaluation together with
recommendations for the year were discussed at Board level.
Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors
conducted their annual evaluation of the Chairman’s performance; a
similar method to that described above was employed. The views of the
executive directors were also considered. The outcome of the evaluation
was highly positive.
The performance of individual executive directors is appraised
annually by the Chief Executive, to whom they report. The performance
review of the Chief Executive is conducted by the Chairman, taking into
account the views of other directors.
Induction and continuing professional development: ITV has a policy
and programme for induction and continuing professional development,
which is reviewed annually. 
On appointment, each director takes part in an induction programme
when he or she receives information about the Group in the form of
presentations by executives from the business and on the regulatory
environment. They also meet representatives of the Company’s key
advisers. In addition they receive information about the role of the
Board and the matters reserved for its decision, the terms of reference
and membership of Board Committees, and the powers delegated to
those Committees, the Group’s corporate governance practices and
procedures and the latest ﬁnancial information about the Group. This is
supplemented by visits to key locations and meetings with key senior
executives and meetings with major shareholders. Throughout their
period in ofﬁce, the directors are continually updated on the Group’s
businesses, the competitive and regulatory environments in which they
operate, corporate social responsibility matters and other changes
affecting the Group and the markets in which it operates. This is
provided by written brieﬁngs and meetings with senior executives across
the Group and from meetings with key advisers. Directors are also
advised on appointment of their legal and other duties and obligations
as a director of a listed company, both in writing and in face-to-face
meetings with the Company Secretary. They are briefed regularly on
changes to the legal and governance requirements of the Group and in
relation to their own position as directors.
Board Committees
The terms of reference for the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and
Management Committees are available on the Company website at
www.itvplc.com. The terms of reference are reviewed annually.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all of the Board
Committees and minutes of meetings are circulated to all Board
members.
Audit Committee
Composition:
During 2005 the Audit Committee comprised the following members:
– John McGrath (Chairman of the Committee)
– James Crosby
– Baroness Usha Prashar (from 7 February 2005)
– Sir Robert Phillis (from 7 February 2005 until 1 May 2005)
– Sir Brian Pitman (until 1 May 2005)
– Sir George Russell (until 1 May 2005)
Mike Clasper became a member of the Committee on 16 January 2006.
The Committee normally meets four times a year.
The Combined Code requires the Board to be satisﬁed that at least
one member of the Audit Committee has recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience. The Board has considered this requirement, and has
concluded that the wide range of business and ﬁnancial experience of
the Committee members as a whole, gained at the highest level of UK
FTSE 100 companies and other blue-chip organisations, is sufﬁcient to
enable the Committee to fulﬁl its terms of reference in a robust and
independent manner. Biographical details of the members of the
Committee are set out on pages 32 and 33.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Finance
Director, the Director of Internal Audit and representatives of the
external auditors regularly attend Audit Committee meetings. 
The Committee as a whole has the opportunity to meet privately 
with the internal and external auditors at any time they consider
appropriate. In 2005 one private meeting was held with each of the
internal and external auditors. 79
Terms of reference: In accordance with the Committee’s terms of
reference the Committee’s main role and responsibilities include: 
• monitoring the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the
Company;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control and
risk management systems;
• reviewing the Company’s arrangements for its employees to raise
concerns, in conﬁdence, about possible wrongdoing in ﬁnancial
reporting or other matters;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal audit function; and
• considering and making recommendations to the Board in relation 
to the appointment, re-appointment, removal and remuneration of
the Company’s external auditor.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to seek any information 
that it requires from any employee and to obtain, at the Company’s
expense, independent legal or professional advice on any matter within
its terms of reference and to call any employee to be questioned at 
a meeting of the Committee as and when required.
The Committee works to a structured programme of activities 
with agenda items focused to coincide with key events of the annual
ﬁnancial reporting cycle, together with standing items that the
Committee is required to consider at each meeting.
Activities in 2005: The Audit Committee met four times and
discharged its responsibilities by:
• reviewing the Group’s draft ﬁnancial statements (including detailed
disclosures) prior to Board approval;
• reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies;
• performing a speciﬁc review of the Group’s accounting policy in
relation to goodwill, the methodology and assumptions in relation 
to goodwill impairment testing and the impact of IFRS on 
goodwill reporting;
• reviewing and approving the annual external audit plan; 
• reviewing the external auditors’ reports on their work, considering 
the ﬁndings of that work and conﬁrming that all signiﬁcant matters
had been satisfactorily resolved;
• monitoring regularly the non-audit services being provided to the
Group by its external auditors. The Committee has approved a formal
policy governing the independence of the Company’s external
auditors and deﬁning those non-audit services that may 
be provided to the Group, including those which require the prior
approval of the Committee. This policy provides for a cap in 
non-audit fees to be charged by the external auditor. Details of the
statutory audit and non-audit services are set out in note 4 of the
ﬁnancial statements;
• reviewing and approving the internal audit plan and resources for the
internal audit function. The internal audit plan is constructed taking
a risk based approach with the review cycle ensuring that ﬁnancially
material operations are reviewed annually and all activities are
reviewed at least once every three years;
• considering internal audit reports and the actions taken to
implement the recommendations made in those reports;
• reviewing the results of the annual Group risk assessment process,
and considering a rolling programme of risk and internal control
presentations made by each operating team and central service
functions;
• reviewing an annual report on the Group’s system of internal control
and its effectiveness and reporting to the Board on the results of
that review;
• considering the impact of IFRS on the Company’s ﬁnancial reporting;
and
• approving the Group’s arrangements for its employees to raise
concerns, in conﬁdence, about possible wrongdoing in ﬁnancial
reporting or other matters.
Auditor’s independence and objectivity
The Audit Committee regularly monitors the non-audit services being
provided to the Group by its external auditors, and has developed a
formal policy to ensure this does not impair their independence or
objectivity, and that the Group maintains a sufﬁcient choice of
appropriately qualiﬁed audit ﬁrms. The policy sets out four key principles
which underpin the provision of non-audit services by the external
auditors: the auditor should not audit its own ﬁrm’s work, make
management decisions for the Group, have a mutuality of ﬁnancial
interest with the Group, or be put in the role of advocate for the Group.
The policy sets a maximum 1:1 ratio for the annual split between 
audit and non-audit fees charged by the external auditor. The Audit
Committee has pre-approved the categories of non-audit services that
may be performed by the external auditors and explicitly set out the
categories of work that they may not perform. The Audit Committee
believes that these policies accord with governance best practice. Audit
Committee approval is required for any engagement of the external
auditors where the fee is likely to be in excess of £0.1 million.
The Audit Committee reviews all services being provided by the
external auditors to review the independence and objectivity of the
external auditors, taking into consideration relevant professional and
regulatory requirements, so that these are not impaired by the provision
of permissible non-audit services. The Audit Committee has also
performed a speciﬁc evaluation of the performance of the external
auditors, through assessment of the results of questionnaires completed
by relevant executive management in addition to Committee members’
own views of auditor performance. Such evaluations will be carried out
annually and the Company will carry out market testing or a form of
audit tender every ﬁve years from appointment of external auditors.
Internal control
The Combined Code requires that companies review, at least
annually, all material internal controls including ﬁnancial, operational,
compliance controls and risk management systems. The Turnbull
Report provided guidance to directors in complying with these
internal control requirements and in the opinion of the Board the
Company has complied with this guidance throughout the year,
maintaining an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
minimising risk. In October 2005, the Financial Reporting Council
issued revised guidance to directors in complying with the internal
control requirements of the Combined Code for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2006. The Board will apply this
revised guidance for the Company’s 2006 ﬁnancial year.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of
internal control and for regularly reviewing the effectiveness of those
systems. The primary responsibility for the operation of these
systems is delegated to line management. Such systems can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. Key control procedures are designed to manage
rather than eliminate risk and can be summarised as follows:
• Strategy and ﬁnancial reporting: The Group performs a
comprehensive annual strategy review and budgeting process.
The executive directors review budgets and strategies and the Board
approves the overall Group budget as part of its normal
responsibilities. The results of operating units are reported monthly,
compared with their individual budgets and forecast ﬁgures are
reviewed on a month by month basis.
• Organisational structure and authorisation procedures: The Group
has an established organisational structure with clearly stated lines
of responsibility and reporting. Authorisation procedures in respect
of matters such as purchase commitments, capital expenditure,
investment limits and treasury transactions are clearly deﬁned.
• Control environment: Financial controls and procedures are
considered as part of the Group’s ongoing risk assessment process. Corporate governance
• Risk assessment: Management has responsibility for the
identiﬁcation of risks facing each of the Group’s businesses and for
putting in place controls and procedures to mitigate and monitor
those risks. A formal annual risk assessment process has been
established, the results of which are reported to the executive
directors and Board. Key risks, mitigating controls and required
actions are identiﬁed and monitored by the executive directors and
Audit Committee. Risks are also reviewed at least annually by the
executive directors, who meet with the senior management of each
business team and with the heads of signiﬁcant central service
functions speciﬁcally to discuss the risks facing their areas.
In addition, presentations are made to the Audit Committee to
enable it to review the risks in these areas at least once a year.
• Reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of internal controls:
Controls are monitored by management review, Internal Audit, the
executive directors and the Audit Committee. Directors of each
business team are required to conﬁrm annually compliance with
internal ﬁnancial control in their area. Serious control weaknesses 
(if any) are reported to the Board as appropriate. The Board has
conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal controls for the period ended 31 December 2005.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration report can be found on pages 81 to 89. Terms of
engagement of the remuneration consultants are available on the
Company website at www.itvplc.com.
Nomination Committee
Composition:
During 2005 the Nomination Committee comprised Sir Peter Burt
(Chairman) and all the non-executive directors.
Terms of reference: The principal responsibilities of the Committee
include:
• reviewing the structure, size and composition required of the Board;
• identifying and nominating for Board approval candidates to ﬁll
Board vacancies;
• evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the
Board; and
• considering succession planning for directors and other senior
executives.
Activities in 2005: The Committee initiated the search for a new
Finance Director. After consideration of a number of candidates 
John Cresswell was appointed on 16 January 2006. In addition the
Committee began the process of identifying suitable additional 
non-executive candidates, again using a professional search ﬁrm. 
Mike Clasper was appointed as a director on 3 January 2006.
On appointment he met the independence criteria set out in the
Combined Code and is expected to continue to do so.
The Committee considers the composition of the Board on an
annual basis to ensure the appropriate balance of skills and experience.
Management Committee
The Management Committee comprises the executive directors and
meets as required to conduct the Company’s business within the clearly
deﬁned limits delegated by the Board and subject to those matters
reserved to the Board.
Relations with shareholders
The Board attaches a high priority to communications with
shareholders. In addition to the preliminary and interim results
presentations and the Annual General Meeting, a series of meetings
between institutional shareholders, the Chairman, the senior
independent director and the executive directors is held throughout the
year. In fulﬁlment of the Chairman’s obligations under the Combined
Code, the Chairman gives feedback to the Board on issues raised with
him by major shareholders.
The Group maintains a corporate website containing a wide range of
information of interest to institutional and private investors. The Group
has frequent discussions with institutional shareholders on a range of
issues affecting its performance. These include meetings following 
the announcement of the annual results with the Group’s largest
institutional shareholders on an individual basis. In addition, the 
Group responds to individual ad hoc requests for discussions from
institutional shareholders.
Save in exceptional circumstances, all members of the Board 
will attend the Annual General Meeting and shareholders are invited 
to ask questions during the meeting and to meet with directors prior 
to the formal proceedings. At the meeting the Chairman reviews the
Group’s current trading. Notice of the Annual General Meeting, together
with any related documents, is mailed to shareholders about seven
weeks before the meeting and separate resolutions are proposed on
each substantially separate issue. At the meeting all resolutions are
taken on a poll. The level of votes lodged on a resolution is announced
to the meeting following voting and is made available on a regulatory
news service the following day and on the Corporate Information
section of the Company website at www.itvplc.com within 48 hours
following the meeting.

80 ITV plc 2005 annual report Remuneration report
The Remuneration Committee is governed by formal terms of reference and is comprised entirely of independent non-executive directors. 
The Committee meets as required during the year, but not less than twice a year. All members of the Committee have no personal ﬁnancial
interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the Committee, no potential conﬂicts of interest arising from
cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the Company’s businesses.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and senior executives of the
Company. The Committee also has responsibility for the Company’s performance related pay schemes and share incentive plans, and the levels 
of awards made under them as they apply to the senior executives. Details of the full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the
Company website at www.itvplc.com.
During 2005 the Remuneration Committee comprised the following members:
– Sir George Russell (Chairman of the Committee)
– Sir Robert Phillis from 7 February 2005
– James Crosby until 1 May 2005 
– John McGrath until 1 May 2005
– Sir Brian Pitman 
– Baroness Usha Prashar from 7 February 2005 until 1 May 2005
The Chief Executive is generally invited to attend meetings of the Committee to advise on policy for executive remuneration except when matters
relating to his own remuneration are discussed. Similarly, the Chairman of ITV plc may also attend. Internal and external advisers to the Committee
may also be invited to attend all or part of meetings where appropriate. No individual is involved in decisions relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee has appointed Deloitte and Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) as external independent advisers. In addition, Deloitte provided the Group with
tax and corporate ﬁnance advice under separate engagement terms. Advice on legal matters is provided by Lovells. The Committee’s internal
advisers are the Group Human Resources Director and the Company Secretary, supported by their colleagues in the Human Resources and
Secretariat functions.
Remuneration policy
These pages set out how the Remuneration Committee operated the various elements of remuneration in 2005 and intends to operate them
going forward, subject to the approval by shareholders of the Remuneration report at the forthcoming AGM.
General policy
The Board is committed to building the most appropriate remuneration policy for ITV. In doing this the Committee has designed a remuneration
policy which is intended to address ITV’s operational requirements while taking into account prevailing best practice.
The remuneration policy is based on the following key principles:
• To provide competitive total remuneration opportunities which will attract, retain and reward the best executive talent necessary to drive ITV’s
successful future in the highly competitive media market. This must respond to the pressures that ITV faces from both other commercial and
publicly owned broadcasters and producers.
• The majority of total long term remuneration for all senior executives should be variable/at–risk and tied to the achievement of speciﬁc
stretching performance conditions and objectives which align executive remuneration with shareholders’ interests. The schemes encourage
executives to adopt the attitude of owners and true entrepreneurs and build up meaningful and substantial shareholdings in ITV.
• Performance should be measured over clearly speciﬁed, varying periods (i.e. short, medium and long term). The Committee does not believe 
that retesting is appropriate in such a framework, and no ITV arrangements contain this feature.
• Individuals should be rewarded for success, and steps should be taken, within contractual obligations, to minimise rewards for failure. The Board is
unanimously of the view that service contracts for executive directors should be no longer than twelve months.
• The Committee should take its decisions being fully aware of the wider context in ITV as a whole, and as part of this process, the Group Human
Resources Director, as the Committee’s main internal adviser, provides an update on wider remuneration, employee relations and human resource
issues in ITV as a regular agenda item. Updates on the external remuneration environment are provided by Deloitte.
• A remuneration policy needs to evolve over time to adapt to commercial demands, changing market practice and shareholder expectations.
Investors will be consulted about any key issues that arise and be provided with the opportunity to endorse the Company’s remuneration policies
on a regular basis through the vote on the Remuneration report.
Components of reward
The reward package for senior members of staff consists of a combination of incentive schemes intended to provide motivation and reward 
for short, medium and long term performance and to retain the necessary talent over the longer term. Each component is intended to fulﬁl a
different function within the remuneration framework.
Salary and approach to competitive positioning
Market positioning of salary and other elements of reward is approached on an individual by individual basis. The aim is to identify the most
appropriate competitive positioning for each role and for the individuals best capable of ﬁlling it. 
Once the appropriate competitive positioning has been determined, the emphasis is on providing a high ratio of variable pay opportunities to
ﬁxed elements of reward. Variable pay opportunities are wholly performance driven, and performance as a whole is tightly managed within ITV’s
performance management framework.
The application of this policy is monitored to ensure that all assessments of competitive positioning keep pace with changes in the relevant
remuneration environment. Typically, changes in remuneration opportunity will track the market for the given role and individual. 
Following the changes in the executive team announced in September 2005, a job sizing and market positioning review was undertaken in
respect of individuals in the senior team whose role or responsibilities had changed. No material change was found to have taken place which would
affect the positioning of the executive director roles, and consequently during 2005 and going into 2006 their salaries will have been increased in
line with the cost of living rises provided to all staff.
81 Remuneration report 82 ITV plc 2005 annual report
Short term and deferral incentives
Annual incentives are provided for the most senior executives and other key management talent through the ITV Deferred Share Award Plan
(“DSA”). 50% of any pre-tax bonus entitlement will automatically be deferred into shares under the DSA, vesting after 12 and 24 months.
Participants may elect to take the balance of the bonus in cash. Any of this 50% not taken in cash will be deferred into shares.
Awards made under the DSA, as well as any cash bonus payments, will be based on the achievement of a combination of corporate, and
speciﬁc business and individual targets. For 2006 the corporate element includes demanding targets based on proﬁt, revenues and share of
commercial impacts. For the executive directors, the targets will be weighted towards corporate performance. 
The total annual bonus opportunity (including awards made under the DSA) for executive directors will not normally exceed 150% of a
participant’s annual salary.
Long term incentive plans
During the year the Committee has kept the Company’s long term incentive plans under regular review to ensure they remain appropriate 
and are fulﬁlling their objectives. No changes have been made to the operation of the schemes other than to spread opportunities under the
Commitment Scheme (further details provided below). In 2006 the Committee intends to continue to monitor and review the performance 
criteria for the plans to ensure these continue to represent the best way to drive the creation of value in line with shareholders’ interests.
Annual long term opportunities
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2004. It is the main long term incentive and,
as such, the awards replace grants that would otherwise have been made under the ITV plc Unapproved and Approved Executive Share Option
Schemes (“Option Schemes”). There have been no option grants made under the Option Schemes and following the adoption of the PSP the
Committee does not intend to operate the Option Schemes for individuals receiving PSP awards. However, options subsist from earlier grants under
the Granada and Carlton schemes. The performance conditions applying to PSP awards are described below. In the event of a change of control,
performance is measured over the foreshortened performance period and any resulting amounts vesting are pro-rated to reﬂect the proportion
that this period represents of the full performance period. Early vesting may be permitted if the individual leaves in certain compassionate
circumstances. The maximum award that can be made under the PSP is 150% of salary in respect of any year.
Vesting of the awards is currently dependent on TSR performance of the Company, against the customised FTSE 100 comparator group
(described below). There is no vesting for performance below median. 35% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile. 
Awards have a three-year performance period. There is an exercise window of 12 months from the date of vesting, after which period 
they expire.
Long term scheme requiring capital commitment 
The ITV plc Commitment Scheme (the “Scheme”) requires invitees to commit and retain a signiﬁcant amount of capital in the form of ITV shares –
in essence, the invited participants are encouraged to adopt the attitudes of owners and “commit” their own funds.
Under the Scheme, participants must commit and retain shares of up to a maximum value of 300% of salary at the date of commitment.
A matching award will be granted, composed of an award of free shares and/or a market value option to acquire an equal number of shares.
The maximum matching award can be over no more than three times the number of committed shares for each component part of the matching
award.
Vesting of the matching award is currently dependent on TSR performance of the Company, against the customised FTSE 100 comparator
group (described below). There is no vesting for performance below median. 25% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile. 
Matching awards will vest (subject to achievement of the performance condition) no earlier than the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
The performance period will be set by the Committee when the award is made. Up to 50% of the initial awards will vest at the third anniversary 
of the date of grant and the remainder at the fourth. Any portion of the award that has not vested at the end of the relevant performance 
period will lapse (i.e., either year three or year four in respect of the initial awards). There is no provision for ‘retesting’ in this or any other 
ITV arrangement.
In the event of a change of control, awards may vest based on the extent to which the performance condition has been met in the period since
the awards were made, unless it is determined that exceptional ﬁnancial circumstances have occurred. As a condition of accepting the invitation to
participate, each participant has formally acknowledged the independent directors’ absolute discretion in this matter.
In 2004 the Committee decided to operate the Scheme according to the following additional parameters: 
• a participant who chooses to participate above an investment of 100% of salary (maximum investment is 300%) may not receive a PSP award
in the year in which they participate in the Scheme;
• executive directors may participate up to a maximum investment of 100% of salary per annum (but with eligibility for a PSP award in that
year); and
• the level of (performance related) payout in the event of a change of control is capped to a multiple of the original ﬁnancial amount a
participant invests (twice investment if a change of control occurs in the ﬁrst year, three times if it occurs during the second year and four times
if change of control occurs in the third or fourth year).
From 2005 onwards, the Committee has resolved to further limit awards under the Scheme by reducing invitations to all participants to a
maximum investment of 100% of salary per annum, except in exceptional circumstances. 83
Performance conditions
Targets for awards made under the DSA, as well as any cash bonus payments, are explained above.
All long term incentive awards, i.e. those made under the PSP or under the Commitment Scheme will currently vest subject to ITV’s relative TSR
performance against a comparator group, which the Committee considers to be the most appropriate measure of the creation and maintenance
of shareholder value. The effectiveness of relative TSR as a measure of performance for the TSR based ITV plans is dependent on the selection of
an appropriate comparator group. The Committee has given careful consideration to the way in which such a group should be derived and has
identiﬁed the following criteria:
• the performance of the companies should be driven by similar macro-economic factors as ITV and, particularly given the widespread participation
in plans dependent on TSR within ITV, any comparator group must be meaningful, for both investors and participants;
• the group should be of a sufﬁcient size to accommodate de-listings and mergers that may occur within the comparator group and to ensure that
the vesting schedule does not result in large increases in vesting for small changes in rank; and
• it should be easy to identify the appropriate comparators at any point in time on an objective basis.
Given these criteria, and after considering a number of alternatives, the Committee decided that the initial comparator group for ITV’s TSR based
plans should be a customised FTSE 100 group, excluding those sectors which do not provide a benchmark of performance that would be relevant to
ITV. The remaining companies in the comparator group consist of the FTSE 100 constituents at each individual grant/award date of the following
sectors: Media and Entertainment, Telecom Services, Support Services, General Retailers, Transport, Beverages and Leisure and Hotels. On this basis,
in respect of the PSP and Commitment Scheme awards made in 2004 and 2005 the comparator companies were:
Allied Domecq* Compass Intercontinental Hotels Rexam
BAA Daily Mail Kingﬁsher SAB Miller
Boots Diageo Marks & Spencer Scottish & Newcastle
British Sky Broadcasting DSG International O
2
Vodafone
British Airways Emap* Next Whitbread
BT Enterprise Inns Party Gaming *** William Hill
Bunzl* Exel Pearson WPP
Cable and Wireless GUS Reed Elsevier Yell
Capita** Hays* Rentokil Initial
Carnival Hilton Reuters
*Included in comparator group for 2004 Commitment Scheme, 2004 PSP and 2005 Commitment Scheme awards only.
**Included in comparator group for 2004 PSP, 2005 Commitment Scheme and 2005 PSP awards only.
***Included in comparator group for 2005 PSP awards only.
Both the PSP and the Commitment Scheme provide for a reduction of the vesting result produced from the TSR calculation if the Committee,
together with the other independent directors, consider that exceptional circumstances have prevailed, including failure to achieve real earnings per
share growth over the performance period. The Committee may consider the appropriate comparator group for future awards and whether any
secondary performance criteria may be applied, and would consult with investors should such changes be contemplated.
All TSR measurement for the purposes of calculating vesting is performed by a third party (in 2005 this was Deloitte). The results are circulated
to the members of the Committee for their conﬁrmation.
The performance condition applicable to awards made under the Granada Media Commitment Scheme is TSR relative to Granada’s
international media comparator group companies (as set out on page 87 in relation to share option schemes). 25% of awards vest at median; full
vesting occurs at upper decile. Up to 50% of these awards are capable of vesting after two years, with the remainder subject to performance over 
a four year period. Performance graph
The graphs below show the TSR performance of ITV against the FTSE 100 index. The FTSE 100 has been selected for comparison as it represents a
broad equity market index of which ITV was a member during the full ﬁnancial year.
This graph shows TSR performance from 16 October 2002 (the date of the announcement of the merger) as this is considered to be the most
appropriate basis on which to assess ITV’s performance. Prior to the listing of ITV the graph tracks the performance of a synthetic stock which
shows the combined TSR performance of Granada and Carlton, weighted on the basis of their respective market capitalisation at 16 October 2002.
This additional graph is provided to mirror as closely as possible the normal basis for TSR performance graphs. The graph therefore shows 
TSR performance over a ﬁve-year period to present, with the performance of Granada and Carlton shown separately prior to the listing of ITV. 
The TSR holdings have been rebased to 100 at the date of listing to reﬂect the requirement to show performance from this date onwards.
In both graphs one-month averaging has been applied throughout, with the exception of the month following the merger. To ensure that 
the portion of the graph from the date of listing reﬂects solely the performance of ITV plc, the data for ITV in this period has been averaged 
from 2 February 2004 to each date, with the effect that the averaging period lengthens until it reaches one month.
Financing of share based awards
The Board seeks to ﬁnance all share based awards in ways which minimise the cost of such awards to the Company and its shareholders, 
including the impact of dilution. Most awards are satisﬁed through the use of ITV shares acquired in the open market by employee beneﬁt trusts.
Details of the shares held by the trusts are set out in note 29 to the accounts on page 67. For awards made under long term incentive plans
shareholders have granted ﬂexibility to ﬁnance awards using either newly issued shares or shares held in treasury. This ﬂexibility provides the 
Board with the ability to make best use of corporate tax relief made available by HMRC in respect of share based arrangements and to manage
effectively the spreading of the cost of awards across the employing companies whose employees receive awards.

Carlton ITV Service contracts
The executive directors of ITV plc have service contracts which provide for 12 months’ notice on either side.
As an alternative to serving notice, ITV may terminate the service agreement by paying the executive a sum (the “Prescribed Sum”)
representing the aggregate of salary and the value of all other beneﬁts, excluding pension beneﬁts, for the 12 month period. Alternatively the
Company may elect to provide such beneﬁts in kind for 12 months. Where the Prescribed Sum is payable, the Company will procure that the
executive is put in the same position in respect of the pension scheme and other pension beneﬁts as if he had remained in pensionable service 
for an additional 12 months from the date of termination. The payment of the Prescribed Sum will normally be made in monthly instalments. 
Where the Prescribed Sum is payable the executive is also entitled to:
(a) an award under the DSA over shares equal to between a minimum of 75% and a maximum of 100% of salary dependent upon a share price
performance related ratchet, up to one half of which may be taken as a cash payment; and
(b) where the executive has been nominated for an award in accordance with the terms of the DSA in respect of the ﬁnancial year in which the
Prescribed Sum is payable, the value of the award shall be determined in accordance with the same share price performance related ratchet.
Henry Staunton will step down from the Board of ITV plc on 31 March 2006. Up until that time his remuneration and other beneﬁts will continue 
at the current rate. Upon his departure he will receive, under the terms of his contract of employment, the following: one year’s basic salary
including payment in lieu of accrued holiday (£595,400) and beneﬁts in kind (£37,800) and an award under the Deferred Share Award Plan
with a value at that time of between 75% and 100% of basic salary (the percentage to be calculated by reference to the share price performance
of ITV plc compared to the FTSE 100 index between 4 December 2003 and 31 March 2006 in accordance with the formula in his contract of
employment), 50% of which will be paid in cash and 50% in the form of a nil cost option over ITV plc shares. The Company will publish details 
of the number of shares subject to such option in due course on its web site at www.itvplc.com. For the period of 2006 during which he is in post, 
he has a maximum bonus opportunity of 50% of salary, subject to performance. The Company will also make contributions towards his pension
arrangements for the period from April to October 2006 in an aggregate amount of £260,760. All of the above reﬂect the terms of Henry
Staunton’s service agreement which was signed in December 2003 at which time the notice period was reduced from 24 months to 12 months.
The requirements for performance testing of Henry Staunton’s pre-existing awards of shares and options under the ITV plc Performance Share Plan
and Commitment Scheme, and under the legacy Granada schemes, remain in place. As at 28 February 2006 performance testing of his awards
under the ITV plc Performance Share Plan and Commitment Scheme would have resulted in none of those awards vesting.
The non-executive directors have contracts of service with the Company. Sir Peter Burt receives an annual fee of £200,000 and Sir George Russell
receives an annual fee of £115,000 (from 30 June 2005). The other non-executive directors receive an annual fee of £45,000 (from 31 March 2005)
plus an additional sum of £5,000 for membership of the Audit Committee and £5,000 for membership of the Remuneration Committee. 
John McGrath receives an additional sum of £15,000 (from 30 June 2005) as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Retirement and other beneﬁts
The Board has conducted a full review of the pension commitments of ITV and executive directors’ arrangements formed part of this review. 
No changes to executive directors’ arrangements are currently contemplated. No additional remuneration will be paid to executive directors as 
a result of the introduction of the tax simpliﬁcation regime for pensions being introduced on 6 April 2006.
Impact of International Accounting Standards
Where the Committee is overseeing arrangements which involve ﬁnancial metrics which require year on year comparisons and the base and end
ﬁgures are derived on different bases, because of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, the Remuneration Committee will
seek the view of the Audit Committee on the most appropriate interpretation. 
External appointments
Charles Allen was a non-executive director of Tesco plc throughout the year and received fees of £58,000 for this position. Henry Staunton was a
non-executive director of Legal & General Group Plc during the year and received fees of £73,334 for this position. He was a non-executive director
of Standard Bank plc from 1 December 2005 and received fees of £3,875 in the year for this position.

Merger adjustment
Following the merger of Granada with Carlton, ordinary shares in Granada were converted on a one-for-one basis into ordinary shares in ITV plc.
All rights under the various Granada and Granada Media share schemes, other than those granted after 1 January 2003, became exercisable as
a result of the merger up to 1 August 2004. Any Granada ordinary shares acquired on exercise were converted immediately on exercise into
ordinary shares of ITV plc and all outstanding Granada and Granada Media options unexercised at 1 August 2004 were exchanged into options over
ITV plc ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
Granada ESOS, SAYE and Granada Media Commitment Schemes: As part of the merger Granada shareholders on the register of members on 
28 January 2004 received Granada Redeemable Shares. In order to maintain the value of the options, a ratio adjustment of 1.04 was agreed with
the Company’s auditors and the Inland Revenue using the share price of Granada on the day before the Granada shares became ex-bonus issue
and the share price on the ﬁrst dealing day after the shares became ex-bonus issue. For every one Granada ordinary share under option each
optionholder became entitled to options over 1.04 Granada and Granada Media ordinary shares. To ensure that the aggregate amount payable 
on the exercise of options under the Granada and Granada Media schemes remained the same, the exercise price per share was also adjusted by
dividing the original exercise price by 1.04. On exercise, optionholders receive shares in ITV plc in exchange for the Granada shares under option. 
Granada Deferred Share Award Plan: Participants received the redeemable shares on the shares under award held by the Granada Employees’
Beneﬁt Trust.
The numbers in the tables above are in ITV plc shares and have been adjusted as explained above.
88 ITV plc 2005 annual report Share price information
The market price of the ITV plc ordinary shares at 31 December 2005 was 112.5 pence and the range during the year was 101 pence to 130 pence. 
The market price of the ITV plc convertible shares at 31 December 2005 was 0.75 pence and the range during the year was 0.75 pence to 63 pence. 
The ITV plc convertible shares did not attain their conversion terms and in January 2006 were cancelled from the ofﬁcial list of the UK Listing
Authority and converted into deferred shares of no economic value.
Directors’ pension entitlements
Two directors are members of the Company’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme. The following directors had accrued entitlements under the
schemes as follows:
Accrued Increase in Accrued
pension accrued pension

2005 in the year 2005
Name of director £000 £000 £000
Charles Allen 439 49 488
Henry Staunton 327 29 356
The following table sets out the transfer value of the directors’ accrued beneﬁts under the scheme calculated in a manner consistent with
“Retirement Beneﬁt Schemes – Transfer Values (GN 11)” published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The pension beneﬁts of Charles Allen and Henry Staunton are provided on a deﬁned beneﬁt basis. The accrued pension shown is that which
would be paid annually based on service to the end of the year. The increase in the accrued pension during the year reﬂects an increase in the
pension entitlement as a result of one year’s additional accrual and increases in pensionable earnings.

The increase in the transfer value includes the effects of ﬂuctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the directors 
and the Company, in particular the reduction in long term real yields, as well as the additional beneﬁts accrued by the director over the year.
The following additional information is given to comply with the requirements of the Listing Rules which differ in some respects from the
equivalent statutory requirements.

Convertible shares
The ITV plc convertible shares were issued to Carlton shareholders as part 
of the merger between Granada and Carlton which created ITV plc in 2004.
The particular reason for their issue was to address the fact that Carlton was
more highly geared to potential strong growth in the television advertising
market than was Granada. As a consequence, had there been such strong 
growth it was recognised that Carlton shareholders might have expected a
greater share of the combined group; and the convertible shares would have, 
if they had converted, delivered an additional 2% of the combined group to
Carlton shareholders.
The terms of conversion were therefore set so that the shares would only be 
of value if a particular earnings and share price target was attained by ITV plc 
in the course of 2005, reﬂecting such television advertising market growth. 
If those targets were not met then it would be because the potential television
advertising market growth had not materialised.
In the event the ITV ordinary share price target (140 pence or more for 60 of 
the last 90 dealing days in 2005) was not met and the convertible shares were
therefore not of any value after that time. The mechanics by which those shares
were withdrawn from the market are quite standard in such circumstances and
were very clearly set out in the terms of issue at the time. ITV plc has been in
contact with both the London Stock Exchange and the UK Listing Authority to
inform them of the process. Five year ﬁnancial record

PERFORMANCE
Strategy
With the housebuilding expansion plan now 
complete, the board intends to continue to 
focus this business on the regions and 
market segments where it has signiﬁcant 
expertise and experience. This will deliver 
disciplined growth and allow us to expand 
margins, while at the same time increasing 
the Group’s cash generation and supporting 
the new, higher dividend. The housing market 
remains robust in the South East and the 
board believes the new strategy will stand  
us in good stead in these conditions.
The strategy in construction is unchanged. 
With markets remaining challenging, we will 
continue to focus on delivering margin and 
cash, with a view to resuming growth when 
markets recover.
Our hybrid business model – operating both 
housebuilding and construction businesses –  
has been highly successful for us in recent 
years. As always, the board will ensure that the 
way our business model develops and adapts 
to meet the changing business environment 
continues to deliver best value to shareholders.
Governance
I am pleased to report that the standard  
of corporate governance in Galliford Try 
remains high. Although the Company was  
not a member of the FTSE 350 at the start of 
the ﬁnancial year, we were already following 
best practice for FTSE 350 companies  
and complying with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Our subsequent return  
to the FTSE 350 in October 2011 did not 
therefore require us to make any changes  
to our governance practices.
During the year, the board spent considerable 
time considering the Group’s approach to risk 
management. An experienced internal audit 
 helping us to enhance our risk management 
processes. Risk will remain an important 
focus for the board going forward.
We continue to follow the debate regarding 
executive remuneration and ﬁrmly support  
the view that pay should reﬂect performance. 
The board believes that Galliford Try has the 
right structures in place to align our executive 
team’s rewards with shareholders’ interests 
and the long term success of the business.
People
Galliford Try could not have achieved its 
recent performance without the skills,  
hard work and dedication of our people.  
The growth in housebuilding and the 
continued good performance in construction 
reﬂect their efforts, and I thank them on the 
board’s behalf.
During the year, our company secretary 
Richard Barraclough retired after 22 years 
with the Group. Frank Nelson, our ﬁnance 
director, also announced his intention to retire 
at the end of September 2012, by which time 
he will have completed 25 years with us. 
Both have made a signiﬁcant contribution  
to Galliford Try and we wish them well for  
the future.
The board was delighted to welcome  
Kevin Corbett as company secretary and 
legal director, and a member of our executive 
 where he was Chief Counsel, Global.
Later in the ﬁnancial year, Graham Prothero 
 have put interim arrangements in place until 
 Securities PLC, where he is Finance Director.
Conclusion and outlook
This year’s excellent performance sets  
the baseline for the future. The board has  
a clear strategy in both housebuilding and 
construction, which will serve us well in the 
market conditions we expect to face in the 
coming years.
The Group is ﬁnancially robust, has a  
unique business model and real competitive 
strengths throughout its operations. This 
gives us a sound platform from which we  
can make further progress.
Ian Coull 
Chairman
Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
04
With excellent performance, a disciplined 
strategy and an increased and sustainable 
dividend, Galliford Try is well placed to 
generate further value for shareholders.
Performance and dividend
The Group achieved an outstanding ﬁnancial 
performance during the year, with signiﬁcant 
increases in revenues and proﬁts and a 
strong ﬁnancial position at the year end.
This is the result of our three-year 
housebuilding expansion plan coming to 

many considered this plan to be ambitious.  
Its successful delivery is testament to the 
vision and skill of Greg Fitzgerald and our 
executive team. It also reﬂects our prudent 
approach in construction, where we continue 

acceptable margins and generate cash.
The Group’s strong ﬁnancial performance has 
 This higher level of earnings, coupled with the 
expected rise in cash generation resulting 
from the new housebuilding strategy 
discussed below, gives us the opportunity to 
signiﬁcantly increase the dividend payout.
The board is therefore recommending a  
ﬁnal dividend of 21 pence per share, to be 
paid on 16 November 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at 5 October 2012. Together 

this gives a total dividend of 30 pence for  

The total dividend is approximately twice 
covered by earnings. The board will pursue  
a progressive and sustainable policy for future 
dividend payments.

PERFORMANCE
This strategy will enhance the quality of our 
earnings and improve our cash ﬂow, enabling 
us to pay the substantially increased dividend 
described by the chairman on page 04.
 
Sustainability
The importance of sustainability to our 
business is reﬂected in our vision: ‘to be 
leaders in the construction of a sustainable 
future’. We recognise that our long term 
success depends on contributing 
economically, environmentally and socially  
to the communities in which we operate.
More and more, the innovative solutions  
we offer to our construction clients make  
an important contribution to their 
sustainability. In housebuilding, we help 
create vibrant communities and provide 
properties that meet or exceed strict 
environmental standards. As in previous 
years, we received excellent feedback in  
our customer surveys in both businesses.
Sustainability also means that we must  
work in the right way. Galliford Try has 
industry leading levels of health and safety 
and we continue to look for ways to do 
better. During the year, for example, we 
launched a dynamic new brand, toolkit  
and coaching for our behavioural safety 
programme called ‘Challenging Beliefs, 
Affecting Behaviour’.
We also made further progress with our 
environmental performance. Having set  
 emissions intensity by the end of 2013,  
we were pleased to have achieved an  
 More information about our approach to 
sustainability and performance can be found 
on pages 36 to 41 and in our separate 
sustainability report.
People and culture
I want to sincerely thank everyone in Galliford 
Try for their hard work and contribution to  
our success this year. Conditions have often 
been tough but the Group is resilient and 
ﬁnancially sound and our reputation is as 
strong as it has ever been. I believe that the 
Group is a good place for our people to 
develop their careers. We value long service 
and have numerous employees who have 
been with us for many years.
Part of our attraction as an employer is our 
straightforward, people-oriented culture. We 
aim to treat our people and clients fairly, and 
to live by a strong set of values: excellence, 
passion, integrity and collaboration. The most 
effective way of embedding these values is 
for our employees to see them in action, in 
the day-to-day decisions we take throughout 
the business and in the way we interact with 
each other. We also make sure that we share 
our success stories, to reinforce our values 
and spread good practices.
Outlook
Both housebuilding and construction are in 
strong positions with clear strategies going 
forward and are well placed to beneﬁt from 
opportunities in their respective markets.  
At the year end, housebuilding had secured 
all the land it will need for 2013 and around 
 also had a good level of sales in hand, at 
 
for 2013 whilst maintaining its order book at 
 years for work in the water sector under the 
AMP5 frameworks, which will help offset 
lower activity in other construction markets.
We welcome the Government’s initiatives  
to stimulate housebuilding and the 
construction market.
Overall, we are pleased with the Group’s 
position as we enter the next ﬁnancial year 
with the board conﬁdent about the 
opportunity to deliver further growth  
and create further shareholder value.

maximising the efﬁciency and effectiveness 
of our operations. We are aiming to add  
an incremental three percentage points to 
our housebuilding operating margin by the 
end of 2015. This will be mainly realised on 
new sites with the margin beneﬁt coming 
through more strongly in the ﬁnancial year 
2014/2015 and beyond.
In construction, we expected conditions to be 
difﬁcult and we were proved right. Our strategy 
continues to be based on winning work in 
markets where there are barriers to entry and 
we are able to add value for our clients, thus 
earning an appropriate margin. In the context 
of difﬁcult markets, construction had an 
encouraging year and met our expectations, 
winning a number of important contracts.  
We believe that we are well positioned to 
resume growth when markets allow.

PERFORMANCE
The main risk arising from our ﬁnancial 
instruments is interest rate risk, which the 
board reviews regularly. Our policy is to 
accept a degree of interest rate risk, as long 
as the effect of rate changes remains within 
prescribed ranges. During the year the Group 
entered into a swap agreement which has the 
 replaced a previous swap, which expired in 
February 2012.
All of our material activities take place in the 
United Kingdom, so we face little direct 
exchange risk other than payments to 
overseas suppliers who require settlement in 
their currency. If there is any material foreign 
exchange exposure, the Group’s policy is to 
enter into forward foreign currency contracts. 
The Group had no material currency 
 Critical accounting policies and 
assumptions
Goodwill and intangibles
The Group’s carrying values for goodwill and 



intangibles during the year reﬂects the 

management systems, less amortisation.
Our ﬁnance team tests these carrying  
values for impairment on an annual basis. 
The calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow 
 budgets approved by our divisional 
management teams.
The key assumptions within these budgets 
relate to the discount rate, revenue growth 
and proﬁt margins. The calculations were 
carried out following the year end and found 
no need to record any impairment of these 
assets. Further information about impairment 
testing is provided in note 10.
Shared equity
The Group’s carrying value for shared equity 
receivables, shown within available for sale 
 
 The shared equity receivables largely have 
non-ﬁxed repayment dates and variable 
repayment amounts, and are secured by a 
second legal charge on the related property. 
They are stated at fair value as described in 
note 14.
In determining the fair value, the key 
assumptions we use are the date of ﬁnal 
repayment of the receivable, house price 
inﬂation and the discount rate. These 
variables are largely outside our control  
and we monitor them on a regular basis,  
to ensure that we change the assumptions  
if required.
There were no signiﬁcant changes to  
the Group’s critical accounting policies  
or assumptions, which are set out in note 1 
to the ﬁnancial statements on page 66.
Going concern
The Group’s statement of going concern,

 We continue to forecast that Group gearing

Treasury management and risks
The Group operates under treasury policies 
and procedures approved by the board.  
Our ﬁnancial instruments principally comprise 
bank borrowings, together with cash and 
liquid resources that arise directly from our 
operations. We do not trade in ﬁnancial 
instruments.
The Group ﬁnances its operations through  
a mixture of retained proﬁts and bank 
borrowings. We have rigorous controls in 
place to ensure we maintain borrowings  
at an acceptable level. On a daily basis, we 
aggregate the bank balances or borrowings 
in all the Group’s operating companies into  
a total cash or borrowing ﬁgure, so we can 
obtain the most advantageous offset 
arrangements and interest rate.

PERFORMANCE
 
The availability and terms of ﬁnance, whether 
through mortgage facilities for individuals  
or through grants or other ﬁnancing for 
affordable housing providers, can also  
have a considerable effect on demand.
At the same time that underlying demand is 
rising, supply is relatively constrained. The 
availability of development land is ﬁnite across 
the UK and competition for alternative use is 
highest where the economy is strongest.
Government policy, and the support for 
affordable homes to meet regeneration 
 regulatory framework within which the 
industry operates. The process for securing 
planning consents for housing developments 
can be complex, lengthy and expensive, and 
while the National Planning Policy Framework 
is designed to make the process simpler and 
more accessible, it has only recently been 
published. As a result, its impact is yet to be 
fully realised.
The housing market’s operation during the 
year is discussed further in the housebuilding 
review on page 18.
Construction
The construction market is driven by our 
clients’ investment programmes.
In the public sector, the volume of work 
depends on the need to improve the 
country’s infrastructure and the Government’s 
ability to ﬁnance it, either directly or by 
 are long term, such as the Forth Replacement 
Crossing, which will provide work for the 
Group until 2016. Other programmes drive 
expenditure through bodies such as the 
Environment Agency, with which we have a 
long term framework. Our PPP investments 
business is dependent on both the need for 
private sector ﬁnancing to deliver public 
investment plans, and the availability of a 
politically acceptable ﬁnancing model.
The investment plans of regulated utilities are 
driven by the need to deliver agreed service 
levels to their customers, as well as the 
demands of their regulators and European 
policy directives. Much of this work is delivered 
through long term asset management 
programmes, such as the AMP5 programme 
in the water industry, providing steady work for 
chosen contractors such as Galliford Try.
Private sector work depends on companies 
having the conﬁdence to invest, which is 
linked to the strength of the economy and 
issues such as the Eurozone crisis, as well as 
the availability of ﬁnance. Large organisations, 
such as those in the property, retail and 
leisure sectors, have long term development 
plans that need consistent, high-quality 
delivery that Galliford Try can provide.
Current conditions in the building, infrastructure 
and affordable housing contracting markets are

 Business review: Overview

Our business model
The Group’s activities are spread across  
two different but complementary industry 
sectors, housebuilding and construction.  
This gives us a number of ﬁnancial and 
operational advantages, mitigates business 
risk and offers the ﬂexibility to maintain and 
develop our business through economic 
cycles, optimising our ability to deliver  
returns to shareholders.
Reduced reliance on any one sector
Housebuilding and construction serve different 
markets. Housebuilding sells directly to the 
public, and to housing associations and local 
authorities. Construction’s clients range from 
Government departments to regulated utilities 
and private sector companies. The ﬁnancing 
that supports our home purchasers and 
construction clients comes from different 
ﬁnance models and sources. This reduces  
our reliance on any one sector.
Complementary financial profiles
Our businesses have complementary  
ﬁnancial proﬁles. Housebuilding requires cash 
to buy land and to pay for development, 
before the homes can be sold to generate 
cash and proﬁt. All effectively run construction 
businesses generate cash from clients’ 
monthly or milestone payments for work 
completed.
Housebuilding therefore generates attractive 
proﬁt margins while managing the cash 
locked up in the business, while construction 
produces relatively low margins but generates 
investment cash. Together, the two 
businesses minimise our need for external 
debt ﬁnance.
Competitive advantage through business 
diversity
The diversity of our businesses gives us a 
competitive advantage. For example, we can 
 remediating land, putting in the site 
infrastructure and designing and constructing 
public or commercial buildings. Our 
housebuilding business can then develop 
private or affordable homes on the same site, 
thereby offering a complete package to our 
development partners. 
Our construction business also increasingly 
supports housebuilding, enabling it to build 
on attractive but complex sites and those that 
involve signiﬁcant commercial elements. 
Construction also provides sustainability 
expertise to housebuilding through its 
renewable energy business Regeneco, and 
offers construction services, for example the 
piling services that prepare sites for 
development.
Reduced impact of economic cycles
The construction and housebuilding markets 
operate in different economic cycles. 
Housebuilding is an early-cycle business, as 
the market adapts quickly to changes in the 
economy. Construction is late cycle, as the 
impact of clients’ purchasing decisions is 
typically made over a much longer timeframe 
and most contracts last for well over a year. 
This means that when one of our businesses 
turns down, the other remains strong, 
reducing the impact of the economic cycle on 
our performance. This has been particularly 
beneﬁcial in recent years.
Our markets
Housebuilding
The balance of supply and demand drives the 
housing market. The UK housing shortage is 
well documented by the Government and 
other forecasting agencies, with an estimated 
250,000 new homes needed each year to 
meet rising demand. However, total industry 
completions are well below this level and 
have averaged around 100,000 units in the 
last few years.
The long term demand for housing is driven 
by demographic changes, with the UK’s 
population both increasing and living longer, 
and the proportion of single-person 
households growing. The market is 
geographically sensitive, with the strongest 
demand in areas where the economy is

Business review: Overview
Strategy
Our long term aim is to secure a top ﬁve 
position in housebuilding and grow the 
construction business when markets allow. 
Currently we are a top ﬁve housebuilder and 
top 10 in construction.
Housebuilding
Our strategy is to follow a disciplined approach 
to land acquisition and housebuilding, in 
regions and market segments where we  
have signiﬁcant expertise and experience.  
This allows us to:
 focus on further margin improvement 
rather than volume growth, improving the 
 preserve Linden Homes’ brand position, 
based on quality, individually designed 
developments, further grow its strategic 
land development and maintain minimal 
 retain the housebuilding division’s 
predominantly Southern bias, so it 
maintains its strength in its existing, more 
robust markets and reduces execution risk 
for future developments.
Construction
In construction, our emphasis is on delivering 
an upper-quartile proﬁt margin and industry 
leading cash balances, accepting that 
revenues will be lower during the downturn in 
the economic cycle. Our aim is to maintain 
the business’s structure and resources at a 
level that will allow us to resume growth when 
markets improve.
The construction business will therefore:
 aim to maintain a sustainable and 
 ensure robust risk management across  
 focus on emerging large-scale 
 initiatives in Scotland, and private sector 
 further develop our existing long term client 
relationships.
Strategic strengths
The Group has a number of strengths that 
underpin our ability to deliver our strategy. 
These are outlined below.
Financial position
 bank facility, which is committed until 2015. 
This gives us the ability to invest in land and 
work in progress in housebuilding, and 
provides the covenant strength that 
construction needs to undertake the 
 Client focus
We understand the importance of maintaining 
our leading customer satisfaction levels in 
housebuilding. In construction, we have a 
track record of building long term 
relationships with clients across our markets. 
We aim to further develop our strong links 
with organisations that look for best-value 
services and that will work with us to deliver 
 are rarely achieved through selection based 
solely on price.
Innovation and sustainability
Our sustainability agenda encompasses 
working with construction clients to deliver 
their environmental and sustainability 
 building homes that either meet or exceed 
the sustainability standards required from the 
industry.
Effective supply chain management
 relationships with consultants, subcontractors 
and suppliers are crucial in maintaining the 
continuity and quality of our services.
Group performance 
measurement
We measure our performance against 
strategy through a number of ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial key performance indicators 
 board.
Financial KPIs
Our ﬁnancial KPIs are:
 pre-exceptional proﬁt before tax and 
earnings per share, which demonstrate the 
 the dividend per share, which shows our 
 year end net cash or debt, showing our 
ability to generate cash in construction and 
to manage housebuilding’s use of capital.
Non-financial KPIs
Our non-ﬁnancial KPIs are:
 the accident frequency rate, which shows 
our health and safety performance, and is 
 the level of voluntary staff churn, which 
measures employee retention and reﬂects 
our need for high-quality, motivated people 
to deliver our strategy. Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

Overview
Galliford Try develops homes predominantly across the 
South and East of England. Our activities encompass 
private housing for sale to the public and developments 
for affordable housing providers, who require homes for 
sale, to rent or for intermediate forms of ownership. We 
also carry out large scale regeneration projects, many in 
partnership with the Homes and Communities Agency.
Housebuilding is a near market business, and we 
operate on a regional basis with local management 
teams that have in-depth knowledge of their markets 
and the factors that drive the requirement for homes 
within them. We produce distinctive designs that meet 
local needs and set the standard in their areas.

PERFORMANCE PERFORMANCE
Strategy
We have outlined our new strategy for 
housebuilding, which is described on  
page 06. Over the next few years this will 
deliver disciplined revenue growth and an 
increase in margins.
We have a number of advantages that help 
us to deliver this strategy. These include our:
 ability to create bespoke developments 
 Southern focus on prime sites in prime 
locations, together with a diminishing 
 ability to develop brownﬁeld and more 
challenging sites, aided by the skills and 
 ability to design and build sustainable 
homes, supported by the specialist skills  
 reputation for quality and innovation, and 
the strength of the Linden Homes brand, 
which has seen its recognition grow since 
we consolidated all our operations under 
 reputation in the land market, where we  
are viewed as an attractive company to do 
business with and have an established 
record of completing transactions.
Performance
The culmination of our three-year  
expansion plan led to a signiﬁcant uplift in 
housebuilding’s ﬁnancial performance. 
 proﬁt margins were both materially higher at 
 effect of land sales during the year. We 
 on our ﬁnancial performance can be found in 
the ﬁnance review on page 08.
 
 housing completions accounted for 2,272  
 housing completions totalled 767, up  
from 724, with an average selling price  
 The number of active selling sites increased 
 per week of 0.50, compared with 0.40 last 
year. Cancellation rates remained broadly 

 2011. The gross development value of our 
 remaining at historical prices, on which proﬁt 
margins and return on capital are lower, has 
therefore continued to decline. Our strategic 
land holdings stood at 1,285 acres at the 
year end, up from 1,200 acres a year earlier.
Throughout the year, we commissioned 
regular independent surveys of customer 
 said they would recommend us to their family 
 industry leading performance. In the Home 
Builders Federation annual customer 
satisfaction survey, we achieved a four star 
award for the quality of our new homes.  
We continue to target the top ﬁve star level.
Affordable housing  
and regeneration
An affordable home is one that can be 
afforded by people who would not be able to 
access homes on the open market. These 
homes can be provided through affordable or 
social rent, or through shared ownership and 
shared equity, where the buyer acquires a 
percentage of the property and pays rent or 
interest on the remainder. An important part 
of delivering affordable housing is creating 
balanced communities. Developments 
increasingly include a mix of housing for sale, 
intermediate housing and housing on 
affordable rents.
Affordable housing is a vital sector for 
Galliford Try, representing around one quarter  
of the homes we develop. During 2012, we 
cemented our position as a leading player  
in the market by securing direct funding 
 2011-15 Affordable Homes Programme.  
This was one of the largest awards made  
to a private developer. >

PERFORMANCE
Outlook
At present there is no clear trend in house 
prices and, without external stimuli, the 
housing market is likely to broadly track the 
underlying economy. This means that we 
need to remain vigilant about where we invest 
and the types of product we provide. 
We are pleased by the resilience of the 
housing market in the South East and this 
remains our primary area of focus. In addition 
to our strong position in the South, we are 
well placed in selected parts of the North and 
East. Our business is also focused on the 
middle market, where equity and affordability 
are greatest.
We must also keep abreast of changes  
in the mortgage market and, where 
necessary, continue to work with lenders  
to develop products that help buyers to 
purchase a home.
Longer term, the drivers of the housing 
market remain positive, with a signiﬁcant 
imbalance between demand and supply.  
The number of new homes being built in  
the UK is well below the number required  
to meet demand. This makes us positive 
about the long term prospects for the new 
homes markets.
In affordable housing, we expect sustained 
activity under the affordable housing 
programme, to ensure schemes are delivered 
by March 2015. The Delivery Partner Panel is 
being renewed, to facilitate land releases 
beyond March 2013. Despite increased 
competition, we will seek to continue to play 
a leading role in accessing surplus public 
sector land under the new framework.
Creating sustainable 
communities
We work with local communities  
to ensure our developments meet 
their requirements as at Northﬁelds 
in Colchester, Essex; Ogwell Brook in 
Newton Abbott, Devon and Thornbury 
Park in Osterley, Middlesex.

We are one of only six organisations on all 
three regional clusters of the Delivery Partner 
Panel. This is the route by which the Homes 
and Communities Agency, Government 
departments and many local authorities 
dispose of public land. Only organisations  
on the relevant cluster are allowed to bid.  
We continued to be highly successful with 
our bids, winning around one in three of 
those we took to the ﬁnal stage. Our 
developments on those sites have a value  
 delivering around 1,250 homes.
Another important factor during the year was 
 be increasingly signiﬁcant to our clients, as 
they accept sales risk to cross-subsidise their 
future investment programmes, and they 
provide an opportunity for our housebuilding 
and partnership expertise to add value in 
optimising development solutions.

We continue to look for new ways to support

handed over the properties.

Business review: Construction
Market
UK construction markets remained 
challenging throughout the year.
Our strong position in the regulated sector 
continues to stand us in good stead. 
Regulated organisations such as water 
companies have capital expenditure cycles 
which commit them to levels of work over 
three to ﬁve years. This work – which 
 – continues to come through as planned.
The public sector construction market in 
England has declined. However, while 
 been cut, we have seen some reassessment. 
The Government has acknowledged the need 
to return the economy to growth and 
numerous studies show that infrastructure 
investment is one of the fastest ways to 
boost the economy.
In Scotland, we are part of the consortium 
constructing the Forth Replacement Crossing 
 commissioned by the Scottish Government.
The private sector is typically the ﬁrst part of 
the construction market to experience the 
effects of a downturn. Domestic and overseas 
businesses have cash to invest in the UK but 
economic uncertainty and the Eurozone crisis 
are deterring procurement. There is however 
some activity in leisure and tourism, including 

Strategy
Our long term strategic aim is to grow the 
business and we have therefore positioned 
ourselves to take advantage of economic and 
market recovery. In the current conditions and 
while our markets remain difﬁcult, we continue 
to focus on margins and cash, accepting 
lower revenues as we turn away work with 
unrealistic margins or risk proﬁles. >
Overview
Our construction business delivers whole-life solutions 
to projects for the built environment, with its activities 
covering the full spectrum of building and infrastructure. 
The business operates mainly under the Galliford Try and 
Morrison Construction brands, and it is organised into 
building, partnerships and infrastructure divisions.
Building provides a UK-wide service to the health, 
education and private commercial markets from 
operating centres in London, the South West, the 
Midlands, the North of England and Scotland.
Partnerships, our specialist affordable housing 
contractor, has strong businesses in the South East  
and North East, and a growing presence across the  
rest of the country.
Infrastructure carries out civil engineering projects, 
primarily in the water, highways, remediation and 
renewable energy markets, through sector-focused 
businesses operating across the UK.

A healthy land market provides us with the raw material on which to build.

a training and development programme designed to optimise career satisfaction. 
We have a programme to develop sustainable homes in accordance with

Each functional team has policies and procedures designed to identify and 
manage risks appropriate to their remit. Regular board meetings facilitate 
cross-functional communication of anticipated potential issues. The Group  
also operates disaster recovery policies speciﬁcally to address incidents likely

Funding is provided by equity and bank borrowings. We constantly monitor 
levels of available funding and compliance with our bank covenants, and  
have facilities in place until May 2015. Our focus on margin enhancement, 
construction cash resources and using existing landbanks should also help us 
to generate increased cash ﬂows within the business.
We monitor published statistics on mortgage approvals and lending, analysing 
the impact on potential customers across the different market sectors and the 
 purchaser incentives, such as part exchange facilities and shared equity. We

Business review: Principal risks
Identifying, evaluating and managing our 
principal risks and uncertainties is integral  
to the way we do business. We have policies 
and procedures throughout our operations 
that enable us to do so, embedded within  
our management structure and our operating 
processes.
We maintain registers at Group, divisional  
and business unit level that detail identiﬁed 
 and rate them based on their likelihood and 
their potential impact should they materialise.  
This is then linked to how the risk is managed, 
the responsibility for its management and the 
way in which this is monitored. The registers 
show the levels of residual risk, enabling the 

We regularly update the registers as risks 
change. In addition, we carry out an annual 
review of market developments, Group 
 context of our risk management processes, 
to ensure they adapt to changing 
requirements. Carrying out this exercise, in 
co-ordination with the board’s annual review 
of internal controls and their effectiveness, 
helps to ensure that our management of risk 
remains up to date and relevant. Details of 
the work undertaken in this area during the 
year are given in the corporate governance

initiative that enables subcontractors, our 
operatives and management to engage in 
and directly inﬂuence site safety. We also 
involve key supply chain supervisors in 
creating our four-weekly site safety plans.
Our behavioural safety programme, 
Challenging Beliefs, Affecting Behaviour, is 
vital to our approach. More information is set

Constructing  
a sustainable  
future
Our vision is to be leaders in the construction 
of a sustainable future. We therefore follow  
a sustainability strategy which requires us  
to consider, prioritise and manage 
sustainability issues. We have identiﬁed  
six fundamentals of sustainable business,  
as shown in the diagram above. 
The Group policy statement deﬁnes our 
 them across the business. We share and 
adopt best practice and look for initiatives 
that add value and help us to build 
partnerships with our stakeholders. 
Governance of sustainability
The Group board delegates authority for 
sustainability to the chief executive, who is 
responsible for the Group policy statement. 
The executive board has overall responsibility 
for sustainability, with a board director 
accountable for each element. This ensures 
we implement our policies and make 
sufﬁcient resources available.
Each month, our corporate responsibility  
 on our progress. There are also regular 
presentations to, and interactions with,  
the divisional boards. This ensures divisions 
prioritise sustainability and create plans in  
line with the Group’s approach.
The Group CR steering committee is chaired 
by the company secretary and legal director 
and includes representatives from across the 
business. It meets quarterly to review progress, 
discuss sustainability developments and best 
practice, and advise on sustainability across 
the Group. We include sustainability risks in 
the Group risk register, which the audit 
committee reviews on a regular basis.
We also have a carbon task force, which 
implements our carbon reduction and energy 
efﬁciency strategy, reviews training initiatives 
and engages with supply chain partners.  
Our CR manager chairs the task force. 
Attendees include the chief executive, key 
divisional representatives and procurement.
Engaging our stakeholders
Our stakeholders include communities, 
employees, shareholders, customers,  
supply chain, regulators, Government and 
industry bodies.
We aim to raise awareness of sustainable 
solutions and services, to inﬂuence our 
stakeholders and address sustainability in 
their dealings with us. We want to learn from 
and consult with others, share ideas and help 
deliver a sustainable economy.
We are active in industry working and policy 
groups, including: ‘Doing Business Responsibly’, 
which was set up by the UK Contractors 
 partnership that co-ordinates delivery of low 
 NextGeneration, which drives sustainability 
best practice in the UK’s residential 
development sector.

that both wants and has the ability to learn 
new skills and take on new tasks.
The company secretary and legal director  
is responsible for Group HR matters at 
executive board level, with the Group HR 
director having day-to-day responsibility.  
Our HR function embeds HR managers  
in the business units to deliver business-
speciﬁc solutions, while ensuring that we 
comply with Group policies and procedures. 
Training and development
Every year, we invest heavily in training and 
development. The annual performance and 
development review is key to this, creating 
personalised plans for growth.
Our management development framework 
has six ‘stepping stones’, starting at trainee 
and graduate level and rising to executive 
coaching. The framework covers skills 
ranging from effective communication to 
leadership and customer service.
Most of our management training is either 
accredited or endorsed by the Institute of 
Leadership and Management, enabling our 
people to achieve recognised qualiﬁcations. 
We also run programmes through Warwick, 
Henley and Cranﬁeld business schools.
The Galliford Try Academy offers study 
programmes ranging from practical learning 
for BTEC qualiﬁcations through to degrees 
and graduate schemes. The Academy also 
provides networking and support through 
mentors and training supervisors, ensuring 
we deliver learning and development 
consistently. 
We offer sponsorships to full-time students 
through the Loughborough University 
consortium and the Institution of Civil Engineers 
QUEST Scholarship Scheme. We currently 
sponsor 23 students, with six graduating and 

Our apprentice scheme takes on around  
30 people each year, which we hope to 
increase to 500 through our new Apprentice 
Academy. This provides learning 
opportunities for young people and helps  
give us the skills we need for the future.
During the year, we made the Galliford Try 
Academy’s e-learning platform available to all 
employees. E-learning helps us to reach large 
numbers of people and is particularly useful 
for compliance training.
Employee engagement
We keep our people informed through  
our employee magazine, staff brieﬁngs,  
news alerts and intranet articles. The chief 
executive’s roadshow allows him to explain 
our performance and strategy directly to 
employees.
Our annual employee survey gives our people 
a voice and tells us where we are doing well 
and where we can improve. Each business 
unit publishes the results and the actions it 
intends to take. For future surveys, we are 
looking to add more detailed questions to 
draw out further areas for improvement.
The Group prioritises positive relationships 
with employees and has not needed to 
establish a trade union negotiating 
framework.

Business review: Sustainability
Challenging Beliefs,  
Affecting Behaviour
Health and safety traditionally focuses on 
processes and procedures but Challenging 
Beliefs, Affecting Behaviour recognises that 
safety is ultimately about behaviour. The 
programme compels everyone to think about 
their actions and the possible consequences.
More than 4,000 people have attended at 
least one of the safety leadership workshops 
which communicate the programme’s ethos. 
There are several tailored courses, providing 
real-life examples that attendees can relate to.
This year, we appointed a Group health and 
safety development manager to maintain the 
programme’s momentum. We then launched 
a dynamic new brand for Challenging Beliefs, 
Affecting Behaviour in March 2012, to ensure 
behavioural safety has the highest possible 
proﬁle throughout the business, and with our 
subcontractors and clients. This has given 
the programme new impetus.
The programme includes a comprehensive 
toolkit to help sites implement it, as well as  
a Group-wide roadshow led by the Group 
 bespoke coaching programme, which  
gives practical training in implementation.
Protecting health
We want to look after our people’s health. 
During the year, we ran a pilot across 
Scotland, providing medical screening for 
safety-critical staff. This included checking 
lung function, hearing, blood pressure, 
eyesight, musculoskeletal health and the 
effects of vibration, as well as drug and 
alcohol screening.
Our HS&E management system
 management reporting system that we 
constantly review and improve. This is based 
on the Health and Safety Executive’s HSG65 
framework and complies with the OHSAS

We aim to minimise our impact on the 
environment and the community at large.  
This means that we:
 assess our operations’ environmental 
impact during planning, design and 
 incorporate sustainability into our design 
 adopt a risk-based approach to training 
our employees in environmental issues.
 are described in the health and safety section 
above. At the operational level, our policy 
document provides guidance on the

manage their environmental performance.
Our environmental management system
The Group’s environmental management 
 and has been certiﬁed by the British 
Standards Institute. The EMS deﬁnes and 
communicates our environmental standards, 
including process and technical standards. 
We further developed the system during the 
year, including improving our waste transfer 
note system and introducing bespoke 
environmental ‘toolbox talks’.
Providing environmental training
We offer environmental training to our 
employees and have a bespoke four-day 
course on managing environmental 
awareness, accredited by the Institute of 
 During the year, 61 people completed our 
IOSH course, equating to 224 training days.

Carbon
 by the end of 2013, against 2008 levels.  
The divisions create plans for reducing their 
carbon emissions, which set out a wide range 
of actions. Recent examples include replacing 
vehicles with more efﬁcient models and using 
energy-efﬁcient cabins at sites. This helps us 
to save money, develop products and 
services, and change behaviours.
Waste
Increasing the proportion of waste diverted 
from landﬁll is another important focus. In 
recent years, we have made signiﬁcant 
progress, improving our data capture and 
taking action to reduce waste going to landﬁll. 
Our waste forums discuss performance and 
initiatives which are reported at divisional board 
meetings, giving waste high visibility for senior 
management. We also work with the Waste 
Resources Action Programme, which helps 
businesses and other organisations to reduce 
waste and increase recycling. Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

Building long term supplier 
relationships
The Group has relationships with architects, 
engineers, consultants, subcontractors and 
materials providers. By working closely with 
them, we improve service quality for our 
clients, increase our efﬁciency and address 
key areas such as health, safety and the 
environment. We also have signiﬁcant 
relationships with providers of corporate 
services, such as surety bonding, insurance 
and ﬁnance.
Managing procurement
Our policy is based on developing long term 
relationships. Where possible, we leverage 
economies of scale for products that we buy 
across the Group or a division. In doing so, 
we try to optimise the mix of centralised and 
local procurement. 
The Group procurement team identiﬁes 
central procurement opportunities and puts in 
place agreements with suppliers. We also 
have central agreements for commodities 
that our subcontractors use regularly. Each 
business unit, or group of business units, also 
has a dedicated procurement team, providing 
buying specialists and resources to all our 
operations. The business unit teams 
administer our central agreements and 
organise local procurement.
We make sure we are accessible to our 
supply chain and have regular forums.  
Our technical, commercial and construction 
teams get together with key suppliers to 
identify where processes can improve and  
to help us manage risks. Feedback from  
our suppliers shows that they value  
this engagement.
While our suppliers are often large 
companies, we also work with many small 
 
Any supply category outside our trading 
agreements is open to SMEs and our local 
subcontractors are frequently small 
businesses.
Managing sustainability in the  
supply chain
Many of our suppliers are either national 
businesses or the local branches of these 
businesses. This means they generally have a 
robust approach to sustainability, with 
appropriate processes and accreditations 
covering areas such as health and safety, 
environmental management and responsible 
sourcing.
When a supplier or contractor is anticipated 
to be on site, then health and safety is a  
key issue. We have a  comprehensive 
prequaliﬁcation questionnaire, which is 
reviewed by both our procurement and health 
and safety teams, to ensure our suppliers 
have a suitable approach. 
Our performance in 2012
During the year we:
 continued to ensure the integrity of the 
housebuilding timber supply chain, with 


 trialled our new business and ﬁnancial 
management systems in three locations. 
These systems will enhance visibility of our 
supplier base and procurement spend, 
improve communication across the  
Group and help us gather feedback  
about suppliers.

Supporting and engaging our 
communities
We aim to beneﬁt the communities in which 
we work. We help build communities through 
well-designed housing and affordable homes, 
and by providing essential facilities such as 
schools, healthcare and transport 
infrastructure.
We engage with the communities around our 
developments, so they understand what we 
are doing. This also allows us to obtain local 
 community needs.
The Group also delivers wider beneﬁts. We 
create employment directly and through our 
supply chain, and donate time, money and 
materials to charity. We also run safety 
campaigns, education programmes, school 
 The Linden Homes Foundation
We have created the Linden Homes 
Foundation to support communities, the 
people living there and the local environment. 
Through the Foundation, Linden Homes 
invests time and money to deliver community 
 construction and beyond when the last 
property is sold. The Foundation encourages 
Linden Homes’ employees, contractors and 
local people to get involved and underpins 
the business’s commitment to beneﬁting the 
places where it secures new housing.
Considerate construction
We are an Associate Member of the 
Considerate Constructors Scheme and abide 
by its Code of Practice. We register all sites 
with a duration of more than six weeks and 
operate them to minimise disruption to 
people who live and work around them. The 
scheme monitors our performance against 
the Code of Practice, which encourages best 
practice beyond statutory requirements. It 
requires competent management, efﬁciency 
and awareness of local environmental and 
community responsibilities. 
Charitable giving and employee 
volunteering
The Group is a patron of CRASH, a charity 
that improves buildings used by homeless 
people. As a patron, we commit to making  
an annual contribution to the charity for  
a minimum of three years. We have an 
employee volunteering scheme with  
CRASH, which allows our people to help  
with its construction and renovation  
 
through donations of cash and materials.
Our performance in 2012
During the year we:
 achieved an average overall score of 33.7 
out of 40 in the Considerate Constructors 
Scheme, compared to an industry average 
 materials to charities. Help we gave to 
 included analysing cost proposals for 
restoring an almshouse in Salisbury and 
offering technical and design advice for 
new premises for Shiloh, which provides 
food, support and information to vulnerable 
people in Rotherham.
Offering total commitment to our 
customers
Across the Group, we have several different 
types of customer and a range of approaches 
to delivering service that meets their needs.
Housebuilding
Our customers are key to every decision  
we make, from the land we buy to the  
homes we design. We look to maximise  
their satisfaction throughout the purchasing 
process and with our after-sales care.  
This includes providing our customers with  
a Customer Charter, outlining the service  
they can expect, a rigorous multi-point  
check of each home and a quality assurance 
certiﬁcate. To monitor customer satisfaction, 
we use an independent research body to  
ﬁnd out how many customers would 
recommend us to a friend.
Our affordable housing division builds 
partnerships with local authorities and 
 lead development partner with the Homes 
and Communities Agency, we are partners 
with more than 60 RPs and in long term 
frameworks with more than 45. Through 
these partnerships, we have gained clear 
insight into the sector’s priorities, helping us 
to earn a reputation for innovative 
regeneration and bringing low and zero 
carbon schemes to fruition. 
We also increasingly offer post-occupancy 
monitoring for affordable housing, for 
example helping residents to understand their 
utility use. The detailed feedback we receive 
also helps us to identify how we can build 
better homes in the future.
Construction
We build long term relationships with our 
construction clients, some of which span 
nearly 40 years. We recognise the value  
of working together to identify the best 
solutions, share best practice and transfer 
knowledge. This helps us to deliver some of 
the most complex schemes in the industry. 
Most of our work for public sector and 
regulated organisations is delivered through 
frameworks and long-established 
collaborative relationships. 
Our expertise enables us to achieve outstanding 
results for clients, as we offer bespoke solutions 

experience enables us to deliver throughout the 

through to implementation and maintenance. 
We also want to provide long-lasting solutions 
that ensure best value now and in the future.

GOVERNANCE
The chairman and the chief executive meet 
regularly to discuss the Group’s performance, 
operations and any matters arising that merit 
the attention of the wider board.
Senior independent director
Amanda Burton continues to be the Group’s 
senior independent director and as such 
remains available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through normal 
channels has failed to resolve, or for which 
such contact is inappropriate. Amanda was 
not approached during the year.
Non-executive directors 
The role and responsibilities expected of a 
non-executive director are detailed in their 
individual letters of appointment, and each 
non-executive conﬁrms prior to appointment 
that they have sufﬁcient time to commit to the 
Group. The letters of appointment are 
available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered ofﬁce during normal ofﬁce hours 
and prior to the annual general meeting.

 The chairman held additional meetings with 
the non-executives during the ﬁnancial year 
without the executives present, including a 
speciﬁc performance review day at which 
individual board appraisals were completed. 
The company secretary also attended part  
of those meetings by invitation. The senior 
independent director separately led a meeting 
of the non-executives to assess performance 
of the chairman during the year without him 
being present.
Board: remit
There is a formal schedule of matters 
reserved for prior authorisation by the board. 
The board takes responsibility for the Group’s 
 material investments, acquisitions and 
 sustainability, environment and health and 
 ﬁnancial matters and reviewing the Group’s 
system of internal control. 
The board has established reporting 
mechanisms which simultaneously ensure 
that it receives timely and appropriate reports 
and proposals from senior management in 
advance of its scheduled meetings, and is 
immediately informed of signiﬁcant 
developments affecting the business.
The board’s annual strategy away-day in 
October 2011 focused on the Group’s future 
strategy following completion of the three 
year housebuilding expansion plan during  
the ﬁnancial year. Detailed market analysis, 
 advisers, including representatives from the 
Group’s ﬁnancial advisers Rothschild and 
 decision to focus on a disciplined approach 
to margin enhancement and a progressive 
dividend policy to maximise returns to 
shareholders. The board subsequently 
considered and approved the Group 
Business Plan for 2012-15 in line with the 
forward strategy. Throughout the year the 
board also receives regular Group, divisional 
and business unit speciﬁc presentations 
covering strategy, operational performance, 
market analysis, health and safety and  
people matters. 
The board may, provided the quorum and 
voting requirements are satisﬁed, authorise 
any matter that would otherwise involve a 
director breaching his duty to avoid conﬂicts 
of interest. These procedures have operated 
effectively throughout the ﬁnancial year,  
and during the year the board speciﬁcally 
authorised a retiring member of the executive 
board, formerly a trustee, to be appointed as 
an independent trustee of the Group’s Final 
Salary Scheme.
Board: information and advice
The company secretary, at the request of the 
chairman, ensures that all directors receive 
appropriate and timely information and 
brieﬁng papers in advance of board and 
committee meetings.
All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the company secretary, and there is 
an agreed procedure whereby directors can 
take independent professional advice, if 
necessary, at the Company’s expense in 
furtherance of their duties. No directors sought 
independent advice during the ﬁnancial year.
Board: insurance and indemnity
In accordance with the requirements of the 
Code, the Company maintains appropriate 
directors and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance and 
similarly provides an indemnity to the 
directors and company secretary which is a 
qualifying indemnity for the purposes of s.234 
Companies Act 2006.
Board: performance evaluation
The process of monitoring and evaluating the 
performance of the board and its committees 
was reviewed during the ﬁnancial year to 
ensure appropriate application of the Code. 
The process generally followed the format 
established in 2011 with updates incorporated 
for relevant changes occurring during the 
ﬁnancial year. All directors completed the 
conﬁdential questionnaires which rigorously 
address themes including board mechanics 


responsibility, as well as incorporating a 
separate review of the evaluation process.  
The questionnaires invited recommendations 
regarding any areas of concern or potentially 
meriting greater board attention.
The tailored committee questionnaires covered 
areas such as committee mechanics and 


external audit. Each aspect of the questionnaire 
sought to gauge opinion on detailed aspects of 
the committee’s workings, recent Group 
developments and market practice.
The company secretary collated results from 
the questionnaires and prepared a report on >

Maintaining  
high standards
Governance
Introduction:  
Ian Coull, Chairman 
The Group takes its governance 
responsibilities extremely seriously  
and I am pleased to report that the 
Group was fully compliant with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code 
throughout the ﬁnancial year. 
I was formally appointed as chairman 
with effect from 1 July 2011, following 
David Calverley’s retirement from the 
board, and there were otherwise no 
changes during the year. The board  
met ten times in the course of the 
ﬁnancial year, focusing time and 
attention on the future strategy for the 
Group as it approached the end of its 
successful three year housebuilding 
expansion plan. The board also spent 
time considering the Group’s approach 
to risk as well as following the debate 
on executive remuneration and fully 
supports the view that pay must  
reﬂect performance.
The board is aware of proposed  
updates to the Code anticipated in  
2012, and will ensure the Group evolves 
to appropriately meet any enhanced

GOVERNANCE
During the ﬁnancial year, the audit committee 
otherwise discharged its responsibilities as 
set out in its terms of reference by undertaking 
the following calendar of prioritised work:

 reviewing the Group’s implementation and 
 reviewing the committee’s own terms  
of reference.
No signiﬁcant non-audit related services  
were provided during the ﬁnancial year. 
However, policy mechanisms ensure that the 
committee satisﬁes itself beforehand that any 
services involving a fee material in the context 
of the statutory audit fee are most efﬁciently 
provided by the external auditor. Details of the 
fees incurred by the external auditor during 
the ﬁnancial year are given in note 5 to the 
ﬁnancial statements on page 76.
The committee separately operates a policy 

of the external auditor. The policy sets out 
certain disclosure requirements by the external 
auditor to the audit committee, restrictions on 
the employment of the external auditors’ former 
employees, and partner rotation requirements. 
It is committee policy to review the need to 
enter into a competitive tender for the external 
audit engagement, which would include the 
incumbent, at least as frequently as audit 
partner rotation is required. The Company’s 
current auditors were originally appointed in 
2001 following a formal tender process.  
The audit partner is required to rotate at  
least every ﬁve years. The committee  
remains satisﬁed with the performance of 
 audit partner appointed in 2010, and accordingly 
recommended to the board that a resolution 
to reappoint PwC be proposed at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting. There 
are no contractual obligations that restrict the 
committee’s choice, and the committee is 
satisﬁed that PwC remains independent. The 
committee will review and implement any future 
requirements with respect to auditor services.

internal controls can be found in the 
consideration of audit, risk and internal

Audit committee report
Introduction: Andrew Jenner, 
Audit Committee Chair
During the year the committee focused 
on maintaining close scrutiny of the 
Group’s key accounting policies and 
assumptions, business and risk 
management systems and compliance
with banking covenants. Since his 
appointment in late 2010, the director of 
risk and internal audit has established a 
robust methodology for reviewing and 
identifying improvements to the Group’s 
processes and procedures, and risk 
registers. These changes are reﬂected 
in the changes this year to the Group’s 
principal risks on page 34. The risk and 
internal audit team has been instrumental 
in leading and co-ordinating the response 
to a small number of non-material 
attempts to criminally defraud the Group, 
and our clients, during the ﬁnancial year. 
The committee remains conﬁdent in the 
Group’s system of internal controls and 
the checks and balances in place to 
safeguard your interests as shareholders. 
The committee, in having reviewed this 
Annual Report, considers that the report 
is fair, balanced and understandable. 
The report is clear and concise in its 
summary of performance in the ﬁnancial 
year, and particular attention is given  
to the changes to future strategy that 
the board has carefully deliberated.  
All material matters of interest to 
shareholders and external stakeholders 
have been reported to provide the 
information required to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy. There were no signiﬁcant 
accounting issues in the report or 
ﬁnancial results that required the 
committee to question or overrule the 
judgement of executive management.

Reporting, risk, internal audit 
and controls
In presenting this report and having monitored 
and reviewed, or approved all key shareholder 
communications during the ﬁnancial year, the 
board is conﬁdent it has consistently 
presented a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s performance.
The board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. The board regularly reviews 
 its operations and the management controls 
and processes that are in place to manage 
them. Such systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure and  
do not provide absolute assurance against 
misstatement or loss. The board reviewed the 
operation and effectiveness of the material 
internal controls during the ﬁnancial year and 
has taken any necessary action to remedy 
any signiﬁcant weaknesses or ﬁndings 
identiﬁed. The controls have remained in 
place throughout the period under review  
and up to the date of the approval of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
The material controls, and key foundations,  
of the Group’s established internal control 
framework are:
 organisational structure organised into a number of divisions, under 
which there are clearly deﬁned business 
units. Each division has its own management 
board and each business unit is led by a 
 contractual review and commitments Group has clearly deﬁned policies and 
procedures for entering into contractual 
commitments which apply across its 
business units and operations. A legal 
authorities matrix is in place to ensure the 
controls are clearly communicated

board meetings held to consider strategy. 
A detailed annual budget is prepared for 
each ﬁnancial year which is approved by 
the board. An exacting proﬁt and cash 
reporting and forecasting regime is in place 
across the Group. As well as the emphasis 
placed on cash ﬂow, income and balance

environmental matters form key aspects of 
the operational reports included with the 
 pension plan administration administration of the Group’s fully closed

Group’s ﬁnal salary schemes have an 
independent scheme secretary and a

assurance in areas including, but not 
 construction industry regulation.
The risk and internal audit team has 
continued to reﬁne the Group risk registers 
 an annual risk assessment and programme of 
divisional workshops. The register is 
continuously reviewed and updated as 
signiﬁcant risks develop or are anticipated 
and includes, but is not limited to, key risks 
associated to the divisional operations of the 
Group, as well as environmental, social, 
governance, ﬁnancial and human resource 
factors, and those related to the evolving 
markets in which the Group operates. 
During the ﬁnancial year, a programme of 16 
internal audits was completed across the 
Group’s operations and progress checks were 
completed against previous recommendations. 
All signiﬁcant internal control failings or 
weaknesses have been rectiﬁed either during 
the ﬁnancial year or to the date of this report. 
The head of risk and internal audit reports 
directly to the audit committee in detail on  
the team’s ﬁndings and recommendations.
 
The Group Corporate and Finance Manuals, 
which summarise the policies, procedures 
and authority matrices by which the central 
functions and divisions operate, were reviewed 
and updated during the ﬁnancial year.  
The latest versions of both manuals reﬂect 
changes in personnel, amended authority 
levels under the Group’s delegated authority 
matrix as approved by the board, and certain 
process and procedural improvements. It is 
the responsibility of relevant directors to ensure 
compliance with the provisions of the manuals,

 The committee has delegated responsibility 
for determining all elements of remuneration 
of the executive directors and senior 
management. The committee oversees all 
aspects of the performance related elements 
of executive remuneration. In authorising 
executive remuneration, the committee is 
sensitive to the structure and level of 
remuneration elsewhere in the Group and 
general remuneration levels within the 
Group’s different markets. The committee 
also reviews its terms of reference annually 
and is responsible for approving the 
remuneration related aspects of the Group’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
Further information regarding the work of the 
committee during the ﬁnancial year can be 
found in the remuneration report on page 50.
Governance policies 
The Group continues to maintain a suite of 
Bribery Act, Competition Act, Consumer 
 programmes, all of which address obligations 
arising under the relevant legislation. 
Compliance with the Bribery Act policy was 
speciﬁcally reviewed by the audit committee 
during the ﬁnancial year. The Group’s 
e-learning platform is developing integrated 
Bribery Act and Competition Act modules to 
supplement training programmes for staff in 
relevant divisional and business unit roles. 
The Group’s AML committee, established in 
2011, continues to develop and oversee the 
Group’s approach to AML matters.
Diversity – The Group is aware of its 
responsibilities to diversity as an employer, 
and has taken measures to strengthen its 
approach to people. This is particularly 
evidenced by the phased completion by all 
staff of comprehensive e-learning courses 
aiming to facilitate diversity and increase 
awareness of discrimination issues across the 
Group. The nomination committee is already 
applying the spirit of related 2012 changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and is 
actively considering female candidates for 
board positions when they become available, 
while continuing to recruit on merit. Several 
senior Group positions were ﬁlled by women 
during the ﬁnancial year. The Group continues 
to support initiatives aimed at raising the 
proﬁle of civil engineering as a career among 
women. 
Whistleblowing – the Group’s whistleblowing 
policy, which puts in place a conﬁdential 
channel of communication for employees to 
bring matters of concern, whether operational 
or personal, to the attention of senior 
management, enables the Company to 
investigate fully and take whatever corrective 
action is deemed appropriate. During the 
ﬁnancial year the Group continued to operate 
a conﬁdential external whistleblowing hotline. 
The audit committee reviews both these 
arrangements regularly. It also has 
responsibility for ensuring independent 
investigation of such matters and appropriate 
follow-up action where necessary.
Shareholder relations
The Company continues to prioritise 
maintaining effective relationships with  
all its shareholders and seeks to frame its 
communications accordingly. During the 
ﬁnancial year the chairman successfully held 
meetings with several of the Group’s largest 
institutional shareholders. The chief executive 
and the ﬁnance director have their own 
programmes of regular meetings with all 
 Feedback from all such meetings, and 
shareholder views generally, are formally 
communicated to the board as a whole, and 
brokers’ reports are regularly circulated to all 
directors for consideration. The non-executive 
directors have met with the Company’s 
brokers to independently receive updates  
 shareholders during the ﬁnancial year, thereby 
ensuring that they further develop their 
awareness and understanding of any 
changes in the views of the Group held by 
 including the senior independent director,  
will also attend meetings with shareholders 
on request. While the focus of dialogue is 
 
care is exercised to ensure that any 
price-sensitive information is released to  
all shareholders, institutional and private,  
at the same time in accordance with the 
requirements of the FSA’s Listing and 
 Every effort is made to ensure that annual 
general meetings are informative and 
meaningful occasions, and the full board, 
including the chairmen of the audit, 
remuneration and nomination committees, 
are available to answer questions in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Code. All directors were available at the 2011 
annual general meeting. It is customary for 
opportunities to answer questions to follow  
a presentation from the chief executive on 
operational performance during the ﬁnancial 
year. The notice of annual general meeting is 
sent to shareholders at least 20 working days 
in advance of the meeting and includes a 
substantially separate resolution on each item 
of business to be considered. The proxy form 
includes options to vote for or against any 
resolution, or for this to be withheld, making it 
clear that any votes withheld will not be 
counted in the calculation of votes for and 

general meeting, held in November, is 
conducted by way of a poll.
The Company has a comprehensive investor 
relations area of its Group website to provide 
all current and prospective shareholders with 
relevant information. Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

GOVERNANCE
The remuneration policy continues to be 
shaped by environmental, social and 
governance factors, which help determine the 
design of incentive structures to ensure that 
irresponsible behaviour is not encouraged. 
Furthermore, recognising that even well 
designed incentives cannot cater for all 
eventualities, should any unforeseen issues 
arise that would make any payments 
 discretion to address such outcomes. 
In line with corporate governance best 
practice, clawback provisions have been 
incorporated within both the Annual Bonus 
and Long Term Incentive Plans, which enable 
the committee to claw back payments made 
in circumstances of error, ﬁnancial 
misstatement or misconduct.
In addition to determining executive 
remuneration, the committee has delegated 
responsibility for making recommendations 
concerning the remuneration of the level of 
senior management immediately below the 
executive directors. To ensure executive 
remuneration is considered in the context of 
the Group as a whole, the committee reviews 
policy on the pay and beneﬁt structure, 
including bonus schemes for all employees of 
the Group. The committee keeps itself fully 
informed of developments and best practice 
in the ﬁeld of remuneration and obtains 
advice from independent external consultants 
when required on individual remuneration 
packages and on executive remuneration 
practices in general.

and framework
Remuneration report
The remuneration report has been prepared in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 


Services Authority’ s Listing Rules. The auditors 
are required to report on the ‘auditable’ part of 
this report and to state whether, in their opinion, 
that part of the report had been properly 
prepared in accordance with relevant provisions 

report is therefore divided into separate sections 
comprising unaudited and audited information.
Committee: composition
 is chaired by Amanda Burton, the senior 
independent director, and during the ﬁnancial 
year the other members comprised Peter 
 
Ian Coull. The company secretary acts as 
secretary to the committee and the chief 
executive has a standing invitation to attend 
all committee meetings, although the 
committee regularly starts the meetings 
without the chief executive being present.  
No director, or the company secretary, is 
present when his or her own remuneration  
is being considered.
Remuneration strategy
The Group’s remuneration strategy remains  
to appropriately incentivise future executive 
performance, reward successful performance 
delivery and to ensure that we keep our most 
talented and experienced executives. 
Remuneration policy
During the year the committee reviewed the 
policy, which is:
 to ensure that remuneration packages are 
structured so that they can attract, retain 
and motivate the executives required to 

 to engender a performance culture which 
will position Galliford Try as an employer of 
 to deliver a signiﬁcant proportion of total 
executive pay through performance-related 
 to position performance related elements 
of remuneration so that upper quartile 
reward may be achieved in circumstances 
where outstanding results and peer sector 
outperformance have been delivered.
Letter from the Committee Chair 
Dear Shareholder 
Against a background of ever greater need for transparency and the importance  
of linking executive remuneration with company performance, I am pleased to be 
able to introduce this remuneration report supported by outstanding executive 
performance. 
The remuneration report has been structured for 2012 to show Galliford Try’s 
approach to remuneration and to clarify the strong links with corporate strategy.
The key elements of the Group’s remuneration strategy are to incentivise and  
reward successful delivery of corporate strategy with the aim of maximising long 
term shareholder returns on a sustainable basis. In 2011/12 the committee has 
focused on:
 reviewing and determining the appropriateness of the overall remuneration  
of the executive directors;
 approving the quantum of performance related remuneration payable to the 
executive directors during the ﬁnancial year;
 authorising, in accordance with the scheme rules, the vesting of Long Term 
Incentive Plan awards; payments and further grants under the Annual Bonus Plan; 
and the vesting of awards under the Group’s Long Term Bonus Plan, which 
incentivises the senior management group immediately below the Long Term 
Incentive Plan population;
 approving 2011/12 bonuses and 2012/13 salary increases for the executive 
directors, in line with increases across the Group;
 agreeing the speciﬁc terms and conditions of retirement arrangements for certain 
departing long serving executive board members;
 agreeing the terms and conditions for the appointment of the incoming ﬁnance 
director and newly appointed company secretary;
 reviewing and adjusting the performance metrics for future Long Term Incentive 
Plan awards.
The committee has continued to prioritise active engagement with signiﬁcant 
institutional shareholders on key remuneration issues and I hope that you will give 
the report your support at the annual general meeting.

committee at the beginning of each ﬁnancial 
year. Where the bonus earned and payable 
 salary in any ﬁnancial year, two thirds of the 
 threshold is required to be deferred into 
restricted shares. Although beneﬁcially held 
by the participants, the allocated restricted 
shares are legally retained by the trustee of 
the Galliford Try Employee Beneﬁt Trust for a

employment with the Group terminates 
before the end of the three year deferral 
period, unless otherwise agreed by the

participants on the third anniversary of 
allocation. From 2011/12 onwards, clawback 
provisions will apply to both cash and

measure exceeds budget then the bonus is 
calculated on a straight line basis, up to a 
predetermined target. Senior management

Executive Long Term Incentive Plans

ﬁnancial year to any individual will not exceed

calculated based on the average of the 
Company’s mid-market closing share price 
for the 30 dealing days immediately prior  
to the date of grant. Future vesting of

payments under that agreement are due to commence 
from September 2012. Under the terms of the agreement, 
approved by the committee, Frank Nelson will receive an 
amount in lieu of notice equivalent to 12 months’ salary

LTIP awards, with performance measured at the end of the 
vesting period and awards scaled back to the proportion 
of the three year performance period completed, and an 
entitlement, as a taxable beneﬁt, to his company car.

in existence for the foreseeable future. This 
has been reviewed during the ﬁnancial year, 
taking into account the Group’s continuing 
access to its core revolving credit facility 
agreed in 2011, and the directors have 
concluded that there are no material 
uncertainties that may cast signiﬁcant doubt 
on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Furthermore, the Group has 
adequate resources and visibility as to its 
future workload, as explained in this Annual

information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with section 418 of 
the Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ report and other statutory information
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the directors’ 
remuneration report and the ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial 
year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Group and parent company 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the 
directors have also elected to comply with 
IFRSs, issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB). Under company law 
the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁed that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company and of the 
proﬁt or loss of the Company and Group for 
that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and IFRSs issued 
by IASB have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements;
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements 
and the directors’ remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, 
Article 4 of the International Accounting 
Standards Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of ﬁnancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed in the directors and 
executive board section of the Annual Report 
conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 the Group ﬁnancial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial 
position and proﬁt of the Group; and
 the directors’ report contained in pages 06 
to 59 of the Annual Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

express an opinion on the ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable  
law and International Standards on Auditing

directors; and the overall presentation of the 
ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all 
the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
2012 to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.

The Group has yet to assess the full impact of the remainder of these new standards and amendments. Initial indications are that they will not 
significantly impact the financial statements of the Group.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
 application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form 
 may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
1 Accounting policies continued
Material estimates and assumptions are made in particular with regards to establishing the following policies: 
(i) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The determination of the value of any impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from 
these cash-generating units including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs and requires the determination of a suitable discount rate 
to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Details of the goodwill impairment review calculations and sensitivity analysis performed are 
included in note 10.
(ii) Estimation of costs to complete
In order to determine the profit and loss that the Group is able to recognise on its developments and construction contracts in a specific period, 
the Group has to allocate total costs of the developments and construction contracts between the proportion completing in the period and the 
proportion to complete in a future period. The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation. However, Group 
management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates made.
(iii) Retirement benefit obligation valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit schemes assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. The key 
assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group:
 Details of the assumptions used are included in note 33.
(iv) Shared equity receivables
Shared equity receivables are largely with repayment dates that can vary and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of the sales 
transaction and are secured by a second legal charge on the related property. They are stated at fair value as described in note 14.  
In determining the fair value, the key assumptions, which are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group are:
 Details of the sensitivity analysis carried out in respect of the shared equity receivables are set out in note 28.
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements incorporate the results of Galliford Try plc, its subsidiary undertakings and the Group’s share of the results of 
 operating policies. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing 
whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group until the 
date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition are expensed to the income statement. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of any non-controlling interest. 
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with policies adopted by the Group.
In addition to total performance measures, the Group discloses additional information including performance before exceptional items, profit 
 trends. This additional information is not defined under IFRS, and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported 
by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit. Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

Exceptional items
Material non-recurring items of income and expense are disclosed in the income statement as ‘exceptional items’. Examples of items which may 
give rise to disclosure as exceptional items include gains and losses on the disposal of businesses, investments and property, plant and 
equipment, cost of restructuring and reorganisation of businesses, asset impairments and pension fund settlements and curtailments.
Segment reporting
Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s business segments, which are the primary 
basis of segment reporting. The business segment reporting reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. Segment results 
include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Revenue and profit
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser. Revenue comprises the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable net of rebates, discounts and value added tax. Sales within the Group are eliminated. Revenue 
 Revenue and profit are recognised as follows:
(i) Housebuilding and land sales
Revenue from private housing sales is recognised at legal completion, net of incentives. Revenue from land sales is recognised on the 
unconditional exchange of contracts. Profit is recognised on a site by site basis by reference to the expected result of each site. Contracting 
development sales for affordable housing are accounted for as construction contracts.
(ii) Facilities management contracts 
Revenue is recognised on an accruals basis once the service has been performed with reference to value provided to the customer. Profit is 
recognised by reference to the specific costs incurred relating to the service provided.
(iii) Construction contracts
Revenue comprises the value of construction executed during the year and contracting development sales for affordable housing. The results for 

 is arrived at after due consideration of the performance against the programme of works, measurement of the works, detailed 
evaluation of the costs incurred and comparison to external certification of the work performed. The amount of profit to be recognised 
is calculated based on the proportion that costs to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete. Revenue and profit are not 
 customers or third parties in respect of work carried out and claims and variations on customers or third parties for variations on the 
original contract. Provision for claims against the Group is made as soon as it is believed that a liability will arise, but claims and 
variations made by the Group are not recognised in the income statement until the outcome is virtually certain. Provision will be made 
against any potential loss as soon as it is identified.
 price consideration is given to the impact on revenue of the mechanism for distributing any savings or additional costs compared to 
the target price. Any revenue over and above the target price is recognised once the outcome is virtually certain. Profit is recognised 
on a constant margin throughout the life of the contract. Provision will be made against any potential loss as soon as it is identified.
Amounts recoverable on contracts and payments on account are calculated as cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses and cash 
received to date and are included in receivables or payables as appropriate.
(iv) Housing grants 
Grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will 
be received. The grants are recognised as revenue or cost of sales, as appropriate, over the periods necessary to match them with the related 
costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis.

has received an indemnity in respect of the investment or costs, and regards recoverability of the costs as virtually certain. Costs that are carried 
on the balance sheet are included within amounts recoverable on contracts within trade and other receivables.
1 Accounting policies continued
Rent receivable 
Rental income represents income obtained from the rental of properties and is credited to the income statement on a straight line basis over the 
period of the lease within revenue.
Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Income tax
Current income tax is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation recorded in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible. The liability 
for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is accounted for on an undiscounted basis. A deferred tax 
asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits 
from which the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of  
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited through the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited through the 
statement of comprehensive income, when it is charged or credited there.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the net assets acquired. 
It is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event by considering the net present 
value of future cash flows. Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts following impairment 
 Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or 
groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include brands, customer contracts and customer relationships acquired on acquisition of subsidiary companies and computer 
software developed by the Group. The intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is a triggering event. 
Intangible assets are stated at amortised cost less any impairment. Cost is determined at the time of acquisition as being directly attributable 
costs or, where relevant, by using an appropriate valuation methodology.
Intangible assets are being amortised over the following periods:

Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items. Land and buildings comprise mainly offices.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of each asset to estimated residual value over its expected useful life. Freehold land is not 
depreciated. The annual rates of depreciation are as follows:

 statement. The Group recognises its share of associated assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the assets within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  
On initial recognition the asset is recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Available for sale financial assets are measured at subsequent 
reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the asset is disposed  
of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss 
for the period.
The Group operates schemes under which part of the agreed sales price for a residential property can be deferred for up to 25 years. The fair 
value of these assets is calculated by taking into account forecast inflation in property prices and discounting back to present value using the 
effective interest rate. Provision is also made for estimated default to arrive at the initial fair value.The unwind of the discount included on initial 
recognition at fair value is recognised as finance income in the year. 
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rentals 
under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Inventories and developments
Inventories and developments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, including 
direct costs and directly attributable overheads, and net realisable value. On initial recognition, land is included within developments at its fair 
value, which is its cost to the Group. Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised which is generally after the exchange of 
conditional contracts once it is virtually certain the contract will be completed.
Where a development is in progress net realisable value is assessed by considering the expected future revenues and the total costs to 
complete the development including direct costs and directly attributable overheads. To the extent that the Group anticipates selling a 
development in its current state then net realisable value is taken as its open market value at the balance sheet date less any anticipated  
selling costs.

Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
 be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that 
 considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset 
is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within ‘cost of sales’. 
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the impairment provision for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited against ‘cost of sales’ in the income statement. Short term trade receivables do not carry any interest 
and are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at nominal value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are also 
included as they are an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
Bank deposits with an original term of more than three months are classified as short term deposits where the cash can be withdrawn on 
demand and the penalty for early withdrawal is not significant. Cash held in escrow accounts is classified as a short term deposit where the 
escrow agreement allows the balance to be converted to cash if replaced by a bond repayable on demand.
Bank and other borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are originally recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Such 
borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between initial fair value and redemption value recognised in the 
income statement over the period to redemption.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the 
income statement using the effective interest rate method. Re-financing costs associated with new borrowing arrangements are included within 
the borrowing amount and amortised over the period of the loan.
Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in 
respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate. The discount to nominal value is 
amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate.
Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions for onerous leases and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result  
of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. 
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination costs and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using the pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as an interest expense. 
Derivative financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision of  
the instrument.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group 
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges, mainly comprising interest rate swaps, are measured at fair value. 
Changes in the fair value are recognised directly in reserves. 
Derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are initially accounted for and measured at fair value at the point the 
derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income 
statement.  Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution schemes operated by the Group, amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the excess of the present value of scheme liabilities over the fair 
value of the schemes’ assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows 
using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income. Gains and losses 
arising on curtailment and settlements are taken to the income statement as incurred.
Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan
 deduction from retained earnings. The charge made to the income statement for employee share awards and options is based on the fair value 
of the award at the date of grant spread over the performance period. Where such shares subsequently vest to the employees under the terms 
of the Group’s share option schemes or are sold, any consideration received is included in equity. 
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange 
for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference  
to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions such as growth in earnings per share.  
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, 
the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
 the options are exercised.
Dividend policy
Final dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Consideration paid for shares in the Group held by The Trust are deducted from total equity.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries, held by the Company, are recorded at cost less any impairment in the Company’s balance sheet. The directors 
review the invesments for impairment annually.
2 Segment reporting
Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s business segments, which are the primary 
basis of segment reporting. The business segment reporting reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure. Segment results 
include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. As the Group has no material 
activities outside the UK, segment reporting is not required by geographical region.

on these reports as housebuilding, building, partnerships, infrastructure and PPP investments. 
 exceptional items and taxation. This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure from the operating segments, such 
as restructuring costs and impairments when the impairment is the result of an isolated, non-recurring event. Interest income and expenditure 
are included in the result for each operating segment that is reviewed by the CODM. Other information provided to them is measured in a 
manner consistent with that in the financial statements.

8 Earnings per share
a) Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
 Under normal circumstances, the average number of shares is diluted by reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held 
under option in the period. The dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate 
difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option price. Only shares that have met their cumulative performance 
criteria are included in the dilution calculation. The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to 
employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and the contingently 
issuable shares under the Group’s long term incentive plan. A loss per share cannot be reduced through dilution, hence this dilution is only 
applied where the Group has reported a profit. 
The earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Key assumptions
 
based on future financial budgets approved by the board based on past performance and its expectation of market developments. The key 
assumptions within these budgets relate to revenue growth and the future profit margin achievable. Future budgeted revenue is based on 
management’s knowledge of actual results from prior years, latest forecasts for the current year along with the existing secured work and 
management’s future expectation of the level of work available within the market sector and expected changes in selling volumes and prices  
 inflation rates in each cost category and to reflect the current market value of land being acquired. 
Cash is monitored very closely on a daily, weekly and monthly basis for the purposes of managing both treasury and the business as a whole. 
Details of the Group’s treasury management are included within the finance review on page 10 and 11 of the Annual Report. The assumptions 
used are reviewed regularly and differences between forecast and actual results are closely monitored with variances being investigated fully. 
The knowledge gained from this past experience is used to ensure that the future assumptions used are consistent with past actual outcomes 
and are management’s best estimate of the future cash flows of each business unit.

 applied to the future cash flows. 
Sensitivities
The fair value of the goodwill in all CGU’s are substantially in excess of book value. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken on each goodwill 
impairment review, by changing the discount rates, profit margins, growth rates and other variables applicable to each CGU. Taking into 
account current market conditions within the construction and housebuilding markets, none of these sensitivities, either individually or combined, 
resulted in the carrying value of these businesses being reduced to its recoverable amount.
The impairment review relating to Linden Homes goodwill, which is included within the housebuilding segment, could be impacted by the 
 
 
 
the infrastructure CGU could give rise to an impairment.

The available for sale assets comprise PPP/PFI investments and shared equity receivables. The shared equity receivables largely have 
repayment dates that can vary and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of the sales transaction and are secured by a second legal 
charge on the related property. The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated future receivable by the Group, discounted back to 
present values. The fair value of the future anticipated receipts takes into account the directors’ view of future house price movements, the 
expected timing of receipts and credit risk. These assumptions are reviewed at the end of each financial reporting period. The difference 
between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited over the estimated deferred term to finance income, with the financial 
asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date. Credit risk, which is largely mitigated by holding a 
second charge over the property, is accounted for in determining the fair values and appropriate discount rates that are applied. The directors 
review the financial assets for impairment at each balance sheet date. 
 Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 28.

 liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group operates within financial risk policies and procedures approved by the board. It is, and has been throughout the year, the Group’s 
policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as 
written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and 
non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity. The Group’s financial instruments principally comprise bank borrowings, 
cash and liquid resources, receivables and payables, and interest rate swaps that arise directly from its operations and its acquisitions.

Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by 
 Financial risk factors
(a) Market risk
   All material activities of the Group take place within the UK and consequently there is little direct exchange risk other than payments to 
overseas suppliers who require settlement in their currency. If there is any material foreign exchange exposure, the Group’s policy is to 
   The Group is affected by the level of UK house prices. These are in turn affected by factors such as mortgage availability, employment 
levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and availability of land with planning. Whilst it is not possible to fully mitigate such risks the 
Group continues to monitor its geographical spread within the UK concentrating its operations in areas that management believe

   The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk as investments held by the Group are classified on the consolidated balance 
sheet either as available for sale or at fair value through the income statement. The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk. 
  The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
   The Group’s interest rate risk arises from movement in cash and cash equivalents and long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at 
variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk as long as 
the effect of various changes in rates remains within prescribed ranges. Details of the interest rate swaps entered into by the Group 
are set out below. 
   The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. On a regular basis, the Group calculates the impact on the income 
statement of a defined interest rate shift on the Group’s borrowing position. 
 (b) Credit risk
  Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits and 
borrowings with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and 
committed transactions. The Group has a credit risk exposure to the providers of its banking facilities. These are primarily provided by 
HSBC Bank plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Barclays Bank PLC, being three of the UK’s leading financial institutions. Further

(c) Liquidity risk
  Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an 
adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility 
in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
  The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The contracting operations of the Group 
generally generate cash. The housebuilding operations, however, utilise cash and any future downturn in the housebuilding market may 
require additional borrowings in addition to retained earnings to finance the maintenance of the land bank and associated work in 
 operating companies of the Group in accordance with practices and limits set by the Group. These limits vary by location to take into 
account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates. On a daily basis throughout the year, the bank balances or borrowings in 
all the Group’s operating companies are aggregated into a total cash or borrowings figure in order that the Group can obtain the most 
advantageous interest rate.

Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected

Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such 
assets at the balance sheet date. A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments, which is based on more realistic future expectations 
than on the returns that have been available historically. The overall expected long term rate of return on assets is then the average of these 
rates taking into account the underlying asset portfolio of the pension scheme.

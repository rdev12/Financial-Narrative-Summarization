Chairman’s statement
Chairman Phil White in discussion with chief executive Paul Sheffield  5
i am pleased to report strong results for Kier Group 
plc for the year ended 30 June 2010. underlying 
profit before tax, before the amortisation of intan-
gible assets and exceptional items, grew 10.6% 
to £58.4m (2009: £52.8m); and earnings per 
share on the same basis grew 18.3% to 121.3p 
(2009: 102.5p) enhanced by a 6% reduction in the 
effective tax rate. Overall revenue remained solid at 
£2,098.7m (2009: £2,145.6m) with marginal growth 
in uK construction revenues offset by a reduction 
in overseas construction revenues together with 
growth in revenue in each of our Support Services 
and Partnership Homes divisions; an excellent 
achievement in the current environment.
Operating margins remained strong in our 
Construction division at 2.6% (2009: 2.6%) and 
grew in our Support Services division to 4.5%  
(2009: 4.1%). The Partnership Homes division also 
saw an increase in operating margin to 6.3% (2009: 
0.7%) benefiting, in particular, from land disposals 
and transfers during the year.
The cash performance, one of our key measures, 
was exceptionally strong, particularly within our 
Construction businesses, with £111.4m generated 
from operating activities during the year. Net 
funds at 30 June 2010 were a record £175.2m  
(2009: £92.5m).
Having maintained the total dividend at 55p 
for two years the Board has demonstrated its 
progressive dividend policy by proposing to increase 
the total dividend for the year by 5.5% to 58.0p 
(2009: 55.0p) which is more than twice covered by 
adjusted earnings per share. The final dividend of 
39.5p will be paid on 26 November to shareholders 
on the register on 24 September and there will be 
a scrip dividend alternative.
Board changes
in March 2010 we said farewell to our chief execu-
tive John Dodds who had been with the Group for 
nearly 40 years, seven of them as chief executive. 
John has been succeeded as chief executive by 
Paul Sheffield, who was managing director of the 
Construction division and who has been with Kier 
for over 25 years. The role of managing director of 
the Construction division has now been assumed 
by Steve Bowcott who we welcomed to the Board 
in July 2010.
Deena Mattar, our Group finance director, 
announced in July 2010 that she would be leaving 
the Group at the Company’s annual general meeting 
on 12 November 2010 after nine years in her current 
role and 12 years at Kier. Haydn Mursell joined the 
Group on 18 August 2010 as Group finance director 
designate and is expected to take over the role of 
Group finance director upon Deena’s departure. 
Haydn joins the Group from Balfour Beatty plc where 
he was deputy finance director.
in September 2010 we announced that Simon 
l eathes, non-executive director and chairman of 
the Audit Committee, would also be stepping down 
from the Board at the Company’s annual general 
meeting after nearly ten-years. He will be succeeded 
by Richard Bailey who will join the Board on  
1 October 2010.
On behalf of the Board i would like to thank John, 
Deena and Simon for their contributions to Kier and 
i welcome Paul, Steve, Haydn and Richard to their 
new roles.
Prospects
We enter the new financial year with healthy 
order books in our Construction and Support 
Services divisions at a combined level of £4.2bn  
(2009: £4.5bn) together with a strong pipeline of 
further opportunities for both of these businesses. 
Our Partnership Homes division is responding well 
to opportunities in the social housing market and 
our land bank is a valuable asset, becoming more 
so as planning restrictions tighten further. We intend 
to develop or sell plots over time in order to realise 
our cash investment. Our Developments business 
is seeing improvement in the appetite for property 
development sites and continues to provide property 
solutions to clients supported by all the divisions 
within the Group.
Our integrated business model continues to 
provide us with competitive advantages by providing 
a total solutions offering to both private and public 
sector clients.
Market conditions in 2011 will remain challenging 
for all our businesses. However, with our strong 
track record of delivery and our innovative financing 
and planning skills, we expect to continue to grow 
our uK market share, particularly in Construction 
and Support Services. i therefore anticipate that 
the Group will make further progress in the new 
financial year.

Our four divisions work together to deliver services across 
the entire built environment process. Our integrated

DEVEl OP
For both public and private sector 
customers, we have the track record 
and resources to help plan, manage 
and discharge investment
requirements, whether for 
commercial, industrial, retail, 
residential or local authority property 
requirements. The Developments 
division via its property, project 
investment (our business for PFi 
projects) and asset partnership 
business teams can offer a range 
of possible property development 
solutions to maximise customers’ 
asset values.
Development is what we do. As an 
independent property developer, in 
joint venture with other operational/
financial partners, or as part of major 
third-party regeneration or mixed-use 
schemes. The Developments division 
combines with the Construction, 
Partnership Homes and Support 
Services divisions to offer customers 
a complete property development 
and infrastructure service for any 
scheme in the uK.
Planning, whether for local authority 
consent or in project planning itself, 
is the first series of hurdles to any 
building or infrastructure project. 
The Developments division, through 
its property development arm, 
has strategic property planning at 
the heart of its operations, whilst 
the Partnership Homes division 
undertakes planning solutions for all 
of its residential schemes across the 
uK. Our in-house expertise in design 
and build is backed by our 3D and 4D 
modelling and visualisation tools.

We have an enviable track record 
in refurbishing, converting and 
modernising existing building stock, 
whether inner-city commercial 
and retail units, local government 
buildings, mixed-use schemes or 
residential projects. We are also 
recognised as one of the leading 
contractors for refurbishing and 
renovating listed and historic 
buildings, with many examples 
across the uK.
Turning full circle in the property 
life-cycle, we have the experience
and capabilities to completely 
regenerate brownfield sites or 
redundant buildings, including 
demolition, remediation of 
contaminated land, planning, 
ground and civil engineering,  
design & build services for 
commercial, residential, retail 
and/or industrial redevelopment. 
Whether full turnkey management 
and delivery or individual  
packages, we can provide any  
redevelopment solutions.
With 32 regional offices and the 
experience and expertise provided by 
some 5,200 employees worldwide in 
our construction businesses, major 
projects unit and civil engineering 
business, we can construct just 
about anything anywhere in the uK 
and overseas. When allied to the 
expertise of our Partnership Homes 
division, these resources and track 
record of building across every major 
market sector ensure that we can 
meet any customer’s requirements.
Already maintaining over 240,000 
homes across the uK and providing 
facilities management services 
to a wide range of both private 
and public sector customers, we 
are better placed than most of 
our peers to provide the complete 
range of both reactive and planned 
maintenance services as well as 
waste collection and recycling, street 
scene and grounds maintenance. 
These services, together with the 
design, installation and maintenance 
of full-scale M&E projects, give

Kier has the ability to offer customers a completely integrated 
turnkey solution to the built environment by providing the full 
range of investment (property development or PFi), planning and 
design, construction, including M&E design and installation, 
infrastructure provision, building maintenance, soft and hard 
facilities management and regeneration, by combining the 
appropriate resources of our four divisions.
 
Key projects:

HQ at Adanac Park – multi Kier business unit delivery through 
Kier Property; the Kier Project investment PFi Norfolk & Suffolk 
Police investigation units; Reading Central – a Kier Property & 
Kier Regional delivered project.
STRATEGiC Alli ANCES
Kier combines the resources of its various business units  
to deliver coordinated and consistent services bespoke to  
key market sector customers (and the specific needs and 
specialisations of their sector requirements). These strategic 
alliances are usually delivered nationwide or regionally  
through framework agreements or other forms of  
partnering with customers.
 
Key alliances:
Airports, custodial, education, health, retail, leisure, power, rail, 
water, public services, greening & carbon reduction retrofitting. 
ADDiNG VAlu E
in partnership with customers, any part of the Kier business 
delivering an existing project or service is able to provide  
added value to customers by bringing in other parts of the  
Group both upstream and downstream in the property process.  
in this way our offering can be broadened by bringing planning, 
investment, general construction, housebuilding, FM and/or 
other resources to help a customer whose needs may change, 
expand or diversify.
Recent service contracts leading to value-added additional 
services to meet customer requirements:
Kier North Tyneside building maintenance project;  
Kier Sheffield ll P with associated Kier Asset Partnership 
Services in Sheffield.
EVOl ViNG NEW SERViCES
Kier has the financial strength, the ability and the resources  
to adapt its offering of services to meet any customer’s 
requirements in the built environment. Whether through 
acquisition or through creating and developing new areas of 
expertise and resources within the Group, we are proactive in 
providing solutions where a customer’s need has been identified. 
Recent examples of new Kier services:
Kier Waste – acquisition of Pure Recycling facility and  
waste services.
Kier Energy innovations – retrofitting carbon reduction solutions  
in the built environment.
Kier Public Sector Services – bundled services to support  
local authorities.

3  14 KiER GROuP Pl C ANNuAl R EPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2010
Overview
The year to 30 June 2010 has been another 
successful one for the Group. underlying profit before 
tax is ahead of last year, revenues are at similar 
levels to last year and cash generation has been very 
strong, closing the year at a record level.
Our integrated business model continues to 
provide Kier with many unique opportunities brought 
about by our financing and planning skills as well 
as our strong track record of construction delivery 
and client service.
f inancial performance
Revenue for the year at £2,098.7m was slightly 
below last year’s £2,145.6m. Support Services and 
Partnership Homes both achieved growth in revenues 
and in Construction uK revenue grew marginally 
offsetting a decline in overseas revenues as a conse-
quence of a contraction in our overseas markets. 
underlying operating profit for the Group, after 
the amortisation of intangible assets, was 12.8% 
ahead of last year at £56.5m (2009: £50.1m), again 
achieved from growth in Support Services together 
with Partnership Homes which benefited from land 
disposals in the year.
Exceptional items amounted to a net gain of 
£2.2m for the year (2009: net charge of £27.3m) 
as follows:
•   a gain of £16.0m arising from changes announced 
in the recent Budget which apply to local authority 
pension schemes and in our particular case 
to the South Yorkshire Pension Fund in which 
employees of Kier Sheffield ll P participate;
•   a £4.2m gain arising from the sale of two PFi 
investments; offset by
•   a provision of £18.0m in respect of a fine levied 
by the Office of Fair Trading following its inves-
tigation into the construction industry. We have 
appealed against the amount of the fine.
Profit before tax for the year was 9.7% ahead 
of last year’s at £55.5m (2009: £50.6m) after 
the amortisation of intangible assets and 
before exceptional items and on the same basis 
earnings per share were 17.7% ahead at 115.5p  
(2009: 98.1p) benefiting in part from a 6% reduction 
in our effective tax rate following the agreement of 
certain issues with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) 
this year.
The trading result for the year was supported by 
strong cash generation. Overall there was an inflow 
of £82.7m resulting in record year-end net funds of 
£175.2m (2009: £92.5m), reflecting the sale of 
the uK Supreme Court asset which generated over 
£30m, together with a strong cash performance 
from the Construction division and a further 
unwinding of our cash investment in the Partnership  
Homes division.
Group structure and strategic developments
Our integrated business model is supported by 
four divisions: Construction, Support Services, 
Partnership Homes and Developments. The Group’s 
management structure and segmental analysis for 
reporting purposes are based on these four divisions.
Our strategy is to continue to focus on growth 
areas in each of our divisions, enhanced by the 
many opportunities that arise through our integrated 
model. By drawing on our strong relationships with 
both private and public sector clients, Kier is able 
to offer integrated property solutions through the 
provision of a range of services including investment, 
planning and design, construction, infrastructure 
provision, building maintenance, soft and hard 
facilities management and regeneration; combined 
services which few other single organisations are 
equipped to offer.
Our Developments team, which includes financial 
and planning expertise, is a key catalyst for gener-
ating integrated opportunities across the Group. 
its relationships with local authorities continue 
to provide the Group with the potential to consol-
idate and develop council-owned properties for the 
benefit of both clients and Kier. The division will 
require more cash investment in the short-term

as opportunities for further development arise. 
However, we will continue our strategy of pursuing 
largely non-speculative development by ensuring 
we secure pre-lets or pre-sales prior to the 
commencement of construction.
in Construction, conditions remain challenging, 
principally as a consequence of financial restrictions 
on our public sector clients. However our strong 
and diverse business model enables us to pursue 
a range of opportunities, particularly those in areas 
of non-discretionary investment, such as:
•   power, where we are market leader in the 
provision of civil engineering works;
•  utilities; and
•   waste, a strong and growing market including 
recycling and power generating opportunities.
Other growth areas include:
•  retail;
•   rail, including opportunities arising out of Crossrail; 
•   international projects, where we are rebuilding 
our business from a low base in Saudi Arabia, 
Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong; and
•   mixed-use developments, across all Kier divisions.
in Support Services, where we anticipate 
achieving annual revenues in excess of £500m 
by 2012, the economic environment in which we 
find ourselves is providing opportunities for our 
business, particularly in outsourcing contracts. 
Our bidding teams are busier then ever helping our 
local authority partners to address the budgetary 
pressures which they are facing by providing 
innovative funding and development solutions and 
assisting them in their desire to bundle several 
services into one contract.
The last few years have seen our housing 
business refocus more heavily on social and 
affordable housing provision. Kier Partnership 
Homes has the capability, through its relationships 
with public sector bodies and housing associations, 
to deliver social and mixed-tenure dwellings across 
the country. Whilst its origins were in private devel-
opment, as a result of which the land bank contains 
around 5,700 plots, the selling and marketing skills 
required for mixed-use development combine well 
with our ability to identify innovative planning as 
well as financing solutions to deliver these devel-
opments. The opportunities arising out of our 
position on the Homes and Communities Agency 
(HCA) delivery partner panel should also yield further 
substantial regeneration prospects. The restruc-
tured model is likely to provide annual revenues 
in the medium-term of around £300m at blended 
operating margins of around 7% and a lower working 
capital requirement than is necessary for a pure 
private housebuilding business. in the meantime 
our land bank is a valuable asset, becoming more 
so as planning restrictions bite further, which we 
will develop or sell over time in order to unlock our 
cash investment.

The Construction division encompasses our uK regional 
contracting, civil engineering and overseas businesses 
which are highly skilled in the construction of the full range 
of building projects, together with power, waste, nuclear 
and infrastructure facilities and rail and mining projects.
Overall revenue for the division was 5% below 
last year’s, as expected, at £1,417.0m  
(2009: £1,492.2m) with marginal growth in our 
uK revenues offset by a decline in revenue from 
overseas operations, particularly those in Dubai 
and Romania. Operating profit declined margin-
ally to £36.2m from £39.1m, at a strong margin, 
similar to last year’s, of 2.6% (2009: 2.6%). The good 
margin performance was underpinned by excellent 
cash generation with year-end cash balances at a 
record £417.8m (2009: £399.7m) after deducting 
tax and intra-group dividends. Contract awards 
were marginally higher than last year with 65% 
arising from our numerous private and public sector 
frameworks. These awards have provided us with a 
secured order book of signed contracts amounting to 
£1,320m (2009: £1,190m), together with £723m of 
probable awards, comprising contracts on which we 
are preferred bidder or are in one-to-one negotiations 
(2009: £1,055m).
Seventy-four per cent of our awards in the year 
were for public sector projects, many of them in 
the education sector which accounted for 41% of 
awards. The Contractors’ Framework for Academies 
has provided us with 19 schemes comprising 42 
schools with a value of over £800m including the 
first academy on this framework at Milton Keynes, 
which opened for the new term in September 2009. 
Twenty of the schools are currently on site, most 
of which are expected to complete during the next 
financial year. The remaining schools, valued at 
£330m, are at preferred bidder stage and have 
been given the go-ahead by the education secretary. 
We have also successfully secured our place on 
the second Academies Framework on which we are 
preferred bidder on one sample scheme and are 
shortlisted on three with a potential value in excess 
of £100m.

Framework has entered its seventh and final year, 
having provided us with 90 projects over that period 
valued at around £500m. Projects with a value of 
£55m have been awarded in the year, including 
major A&E schemes at Whipps Cross and l ewisham 
Hospitals. We were pleased to have recently been 
announced as one of six contractors on the new 
ProCure 21+ health projects framework which could 
be worth up to £4.5bn over the next six years. 
The Custodial Framework with the Ministry of 
Justice continues to provide good opportunities and 
represented around 23% of our awards in the year. 
Currently we are involved with 13 projects providing 
386 additional cells in addition to the 1,620 new 
cells at HMP Featherstone, a £180m project which 
commenced in October 2009. This framework has 
now been extended to 2012.
in the private sector, retail opportunities are 
beginning to pick up. We have been awarded five 
projects for Sainsbury’s, including a £25m project 
in Newport which is providing both building and civil 
engineering work for our teams. Our other key clients 
in this sector include Hermes, British l and and  
Wm Morrison.
in the water sector, as part of a joint venture, 
2010 has seen an extension to our framework with 
united utilities under AMP5, to which approximately 
£400m of work has been allocated in the five years 
to 2015. in addition, outside the framework, we were 
successful in winning Preston uiD which, at £72m, 
is the largest single contract let by united utilities 
this year. in rail, the five-year structures framework 
for Network Rail in East Anglia has successfully 
completed its fifth year.
in total we are active on over 50 frameworks 
across the uK through which clients are still 
procuring a significant element of their work with a 
focus on quality and whole life-cycle costs.
We have been successful in gaining entry onto 
the civil engineering, demolition and enabling frame-
works for Crossrail, having won our first project 
at Whitechapel and we are tendering, in joint 
venture, for the forthcoming major tunnelling and 
civil engineering work. Our activities in the nuclear 
market are ongoing at Sellafield, Aldermaston and 
Chapelcross and our 14th major Combined Cycle

began production in 2004 and have recently been 
awarded planning consent on an adjacent site which 
increases our reserves and takes coal production 
to beyond 2016.
Overseas we have seen our revenues fall to their 
lowest level for some considerable time, caused 
by the global economic crisis. As yet we have seen 
no recovery in the market in Dubai; our existing 
infrastructure contracts have been brought to a 
successful conclusion with cash receipts, whilst 
delayed, continuing to flow. Our attention has now 
turned to other areas in the Middle East where we 
are seeing growing opportunities such as Saudi 
Arabia, where we have completed the first year of 
an eight-year phosphate mining contract, and Abu 
Dhabi and Qatar. We are also re-establishing our 
presence in Hong Kong where we have recently 
been awarded a £125m tunnelling contract, in joint 
venture, for one of our long-established clients, the 
Mass Transit Railway Corporation.
Construction markets and outlook
There is no doubt that cuts to public sector expendi-
ture will have an impact on the construction market 
over the next few years. We have already witnessed 
the fall-out from the Building Schools for the Future 
programme, which has affected all contractors 
involved in the programme, although it has had little 
impact on Kier’s order books. We await the October 
Spending Review to assess the impact across our 
other markets. However, Kier is in good shape; we 
enter the new financial year with a strong order 
book and a healthy pipeline of probable awards 
which, together, secure around 98% of our targeted 
revenues for 2011 and 45% of our target for 2012.
Our focus over the short-term is to maximise our 
opportunities in areas where we believe expenditure 
will continue. Energy is a key sector for us and one 
which we believe will grow significantly over the next 
five to ten years. With our strong track record in this 
sector, having delivered the civil engineering works 
on over 33% of all CCGT power stations built in the 
uK over the last 19 years, we are in a strong position 
to maintain and even grow our market share. Our 
current relationship with EDF, for whom we are 
working at the West Burton CCGT power station, 
positions us well to help them deliver their planned 
nuclear programme. Having been awarded a small 
advanced works package we are currently bidding, 
in joint venture, for a range of contracts for EDF at 
Hinkley, totalling in excess of £1bn. These projects, 
together with other nuclear, gas, renewables, coal 
and waste to energy projects could provide us with 
over £6bn of opportunities over the next ten years.
Other key areas include Crossrail, mixed-use 
opportunities across the Group, utilities, waste and, 
importantly, overseas projects.
Significantly, we are beginning to see signs of 
recovery in the commercial property market, both 
through our own Developments business and 
through our long-standing client base.

by 4.5% in the year to £343.8m (2009: £329.1m). 
Our £600m partnership with North Tyneside Council 
to repair and maintain its social housing stock 
and other council-owned property commenced in 
September 2009 and is progressing well. The initial 
ten-year contract is extendable for a further five 
years and could take the value to £900m in total. in 
October 2009 we commenced a £21m, seven-year, 
Decent Homes contract with the l ondon Borough of 
Southwark, which is also progressing well.
A further major new contract, which commenced 
in April 2010, was for Barnsley Metropolitan 
Borough Council. This £11m per annum contract 
delivers housing repairs, planned maintenance and 
improvement and environmental work for 9,000 
dwellings over a five-year period, extendable for a 
further five years.
Some of our older contracts are now coming to 
an end and are set for renewal. it is vital to us that 
our track record of service delivery, our innovative 
partnership arrangements and the efficiency 
measures that we have put in place on these 
contracts are properly recognised in the renewal 
process. Therefore we were delighted to have been 
awarded two contracts at islington, where we have 
been repairing and maintaining the Borough’s 
housing stock since 2000 when we joined forces 
with islington Borough Council in one of the first 
public/private partnerships of its kind in the country. 
These contracts are for Homes for islington, the 
arm’s length management organisation for islington 
Council, valued at £20m per annum for four years, 
extendable for up to ten years.
We currently maintain over 240,000 homes, 
placing us, we believe, amongst the top five providers 
of building maintenance services in the uK.
Kier Facilities Services generated £119.6m of 
revenue in the year (2009: £92.9m) with growth 
resulting from new contracts including the £6m per 
annum cleaning contract for Sheffield City Council, 
secured last year through Kier Asset Partnership 
Services.
Our Street Services division successfully 
completed the acquisition of Pure Recycling during

waste collection and recycling contracts.
Kier Plant has had a challenging year, but never-
theless has remained profitable and has continued 
to invest, selectively, in plant and equipment during 
the year.
Support Services markets and outlook
inevitably all local authorities will come under 
budgetary pressures over the next few years. We 
are confident we will play a major part in helping 
them to improve efficiencies in their current services 
provision as well as identifying opportunities for 
them to maximise value from their existing assets, 
including development opportunities, a role which 
we are uniquely placed to perform. We are already 
approaching a number of our local authority partners 
to help them in this regard, including:
•   North Tyneside Council where, through our 
partnership, we are in discussions to broaden our 
range of activities to include both development 
and waste management opportunities; and
•   Sheffield City Council, where we are combining 
the skills of our existing contract teams to 
provide an integrated service comprising 
property management, funding, development, 
construction, housing maintenance, street 
cleansing and recycling.
There is a strong pipeline of new contracts for 
which we are, or will be, bidding totalling around 
£3bn. This includes contracts for the l ondon 
Borough of Hounslow, the l ondon Borough of Tower 
Hamlets and l ewisham Housing all with, at least, a 
five-year duration and options to extend. KiER GROuP Pl C ANNuAl R EPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2010 26

Market conditions continued to be challenging for 
our Partnership Homes business during the year. 
We have seen little improvement in the availability 
of mortgage finance, which has continued to impact 
on our private development sales whilst planning 
and public sector funding issues have adversely 
influenced our social housing unit sales. Overall 
we completed 1,060 units this year (2009: 1,141) 
albeit with a slight change of mix, with 499 arising 
from private development sales and 561 through 
affordable housing sales (2009: 467 private and 
674 affordable homes). These unit sales, together 
with land sales, generated revenues of £157.7m 
(2009: £150.8m). Operating profits grew from £1.1m 
in 2009 to £9.9m in 2010 and include healthy profits 
from land transactions in the period including the 
transfer of strategic land assets to the Kier Group 
Pension Scheme to settle a special contribution to 
the scheme by the Group.
Our cash investment in this division continues to 
reduce as our land and work-in-progress levels fall in 
line with our strategy and we generated £16.4m of 
cash during the year. Our land bank at 30 June 2010 
is carried at a value of £214m (June 2009: £230m), 
after previous years’ write-downs, represented by 
5,700 plots (2009: 6,150 plots), all with planning 
consent. This land bank provides us with opportu-
nities to create value either by developing units or 
selling them as appropriate. We have made some 
land disposals during the year to 30 June 2010 and 
are seeing signs of further activity in the market 
which may well result in further land disposals during 
the new financial year. The average plot cost remains 
at around £37,000 with wide variations in values 
depending upon location and the type of land (green-
field or brownfield) held in the land bank.
Kier Partnership Homes is a leading provider of  
mixed-tenure affordable housing, specialising in urban 
regeneration and rural development operating nationally 
throughout Scotland and England. it has the skills and 
experience to deliver innovative and environmentally 
sustainable construction and finance solutions.
We were delighted to have been selected as a 
member of the Delivery Partner Panel by the HCA that 
will be used to develop new affordable and private 
housing on public sector sites across England. We 
are also a designated partner on 29 frameworks 
for Registered Affordable Housing Providers across 
the country, which will provide a strong platform for 
establishing our position as a specialist provider of 
mixed-tenure affordable housing.
Kier Partnership Homes has recently completed 
a flagship scheme for Bournville Village Trust in 
l ower Shenley, Birmingham, which involved the 
construction of 167 houses for rent and shared 
ownership. We were also recently awarded a contract 
for a Municipal Housing Trust scheme for Birmingham 
City Council which will involve the construction of 58 
dwellings for Birmingham Municipal Housing Trust. 
Twenty homes will be retained as affordable housing 
and 38 will be sold on the open market.
Partnership Homes market and outlook
Our strategy is to continue to reduce our cash invest-
ment in this division by developing our existing land 
bank for homes for sale, or disposing of parts of it 
as the land market recovers. Our focus is increas-
ingly towards the development of mixed-tenure 
affordable housing where our skills in marketing and 
selling private homes combine effectively with our  
well-established relationships with local authorities 
and housing associations in order to deliver this type 
of development.
The market for new homes remains fragile, 
largely as a consequence of a scarcity of mortgage 
finance, particularly for first-time buyers, coupled 
with uncertainty over job security. However, visitor 
levels have been steady over the last six months.

We have been selling from a smaller number of 
sites over the past six months than in the previous 
six-month period and, indeed, a lower number than 
we would like. Detailed planning restrictions and 
negotiations over Section 106 agreements, together 
with a slow start on some of our sites means that 
the number of our outlets will not increase meaning-
fully until the second half of the new financial year. 
We therefore expect overall sales for the year to 30 
June 2011 to be second-half biased.
Whilst public sector grant funding continues to 
be an issue, we have seen increasing interest from 
private investment bodies and financial institutions 
who are interested in the long-term investment 
potential of new housing using an intermediate 
rental model. We are also working closely with a 
number of Registered Affordable Housing Providers 
to optimise our existing land portfolio, which has the 
benefit of planning permission. We remain flexible 
and adaptable to the rapidly changing housing 
environment and the opportunities that it presents.

Revenue for the year to 30 June 2010 of £53.3m 
(2009: £64.7m) was 17.6% below last year reflecting 
a low level of development sales mitigated, in part, 
by land disposals to the Kier Group Pension Scheme, 
together with revenue arising from our share of 
the Kent BSF project. Operating profit was £0.3m  
(2009: loss of £1.9m) and included profits arising 
on the land disposals to the Kier Group Pension 
Scheme but also reflected bidding costs within 
our PFi business, together with an element of cost 
associated with writing off our interest in the Kent 
BSF project following the cancellation of some of 
our schools.
During September 2009 we successfully 
completed the sale of the uK Supreme Court 
investment to Prupim, generating in excess of 
£30m of cash at an exit yield of around 5% on the 
post-tax disposal proceeds. At our former gasworks 
site at uxbridge, remediated by Kier Construction, 
we completed a new warehouse for AGS, an inter-
national storage and removals company. Also on 
that site Kier has now completed the construction 
of a Driving Test Centre on behalf of the Driving 
Standards Agency which was forward-sold at a yield 
of 5.5%.
Our record of securing significant pre-let devel-
opment opportunities continues. in December 2009 
we signed an agreement for lease with the university 
of Reading for a 55,000sq ft enterprise centre which 
was forward-sold in January 2010. Kier is carrying 
out the construction, with completion due in early 
2011. in Southampton we will shortly complete a 
175,000sq ft head office for Ordnance Survey. This 
will then see the release of the existing 25-acre site 
from Ordnance Survey to Kier Property for mixed-use 
development.
At Newcastle-under-l yme we secured HCA funding 
for a housing development on one of our brown-
field sites. Seventy-two units are for social housing 
which have been forward-sold to Aspire Housing, 
a Registered Social l andlord, with eight units for 
private sale. Construction, by Kier Partnership 
Homes, began in February 2010 with completion 
Our Developments division comprises Kier Property, which 
includes office, industrial, retail and mixed-use development 
both directly and through joint ventures; Kier Project investment 
(KPi) our PFi business; and Kier Asset Partnership Services 
(KAPS), which provides a comprehensive suite of asset 
management services from strategy through to operational 
property management for local authorities.
expected in the summer of 2011. We continue to 
make good progress with Solum Regeneration, 
our joint venture with Network Rail. in April 2010 
we secured planning permission at Epsom for a 
mixed scheme comprising a pre-let hotel, retail 
and housing on which Kier has now commenced 
construction. Seven other station sites are included 
in the joint venture, of which Walthamstow and 
Twickenham are expected to be the next develop-
ments to commence. The total development value 
of the current portfolio is expected to amount to 
around £400m with new sites being added to the 
joint venture; a testament to the strength of the 
partnership we have established with Network Rail.
in KPi, our PFi business, we have seen the 
completion, by Kier, of the construction of the three 
PFi secondary schools in the initial phase of the 
Kent BSF project, which now means that 11 of our 
current 13 investments are operational. in February 
2010 we achieved financial close on the Norfolk 
and Suffolk Police investigation Centres scheme 
with a capital value of £60m. Kier is the contractor 
on the scheme with work well advanced on the six 
sites. Completion of the final facility is expected in 
October 2011.
in April 2010, a Kier-led consortium was 
announced preferred bidder on the £22m Gloucester 
Fire project. Financial close is expected in December 
2010. in addition, we are shortlisted in a number of 
bids, including Woking Housing, l ondon Fire, West 
Yorkshire Police and Avon & Somerset Police.
During the year we continued with our strategy of 
selectively disposing of mature PFi investments from 
our portfolio. We disposed of two of our investments, 
Waltham and Tendring Schools, for a combined cash 
consideration of £7.3m representing a valuation 
discount rate of around 8%. This sale has resulted 
in an exceptional gain of £4.2m. Kier Facilities 
Services continues to act as facilities manager on 
both of these contracts.
Our portfolio of PFi projects following these 
disposals now totals 13 including the Gloucester 
Fire project now at preferred bidder stage. Our

full equity investment in these schemes stands 
at £27.9m (2009: £28.0m) of which £16.0m has 
been invested to date. The directors’ valuation of 
our investment of £27.9m at a discount rate of 7.5% 
is £49.1m.
The KAPS business is specifically focused on 
assisting local authorities and other public bodies to 
maximise the benefit from their assets and reduce 
the operational costs of large property portfolios. 
in our partnership with Sheffield City Council signif-
icant progress has been made by KAPS during the 
first 12 months of our contract resulting in over 
£1m of cost savings for the Council. in addition to 
the day-to-day delivery of services the team has 
developed a new Corporate Asset Management Plan 
which details an effective strategy and action plan 
for the management of the Council’s considerable 
land and building assets over the next decade.
Developments markets and outlook
We are encouraged by interest that is beginning to 
emerge from investors, particularly from the Far East, 
who are keen to take advantage of our product range 
and our approach to development through pre-let, low 
risk schemes. We will continue to establish long-term 
partnerships with local authorities and other bodies, 
such as those established with Network Rail and 
Sheffield City Council, in order to maximise the value 
of their property assets.
Given our in-house skills we are well placed to 
take a leading role in working closely with local 
government and other bodies to tailor innovative 
property solutions to meet their requirements. The 
well publicised spending cutbacks will require new 
approaches to the provision of services by local 
councils and we are providing significant support 
to proposals which will help them maximise their 
asset values and achieve significant cost savings. 
The announcement of preferred bidder status with 
Chesterfield Borough Council to deliver property 
and engineering services in a ten-year partnership 
serves to endorse this approach. By building upon 
our work with Sheffield and Chesterfield Councils 
we have expanded our property development activ-
ities in the north of England, working closely with 
Construction, Partnership Homes and Support 
Services to maximise opportunities for the Group.
More generally we are encouraged by the 
continued level of occupier demand for our sites 
across the country, which reflects well on our 
strategy of only acquiring well located sites.

Health & safety
During the year we have focused on health & safety 
leadership and our Behavioural Safety l eadership 
Programme is now firmly embedded within the 
Construction division. This programme focuses on 
encouraging active discussion within the workforce 
on safety specific issues and we have recorded in 
excess of 24,000 such conversations this year.
Our focus will now encompass both health and 
environmental issues to ensure that we support fully 
the Group’s sustainability aspirations. Our health 
programme is paying dividends with the current 
roadshow addressing noise and vibration issues. 
A long-term programme of health and well-being is 
being developed across the business to ensure that 
health is an integral part of the Safety, Health and 
Environment culture.
The commitment of our management and our 
supply chain partners has ensured that our Accident 
incidence Rate has improved by 23% from 404 in 
June 2009 to 312 in June 2010 against a Health and 
Safety Executive (HSE) benchmark of 782.
People
The year to 30 June 2010 has been a busy and 
challenging one for the Group and it is only with the 
commitment, skill and professionalism of all our 
employees that we have achieved another year of 
good profit and cash generation. i would like to thank 
all of our employees at every level throughout our 
many businesses for their contribution to the contin-
uing success of the Group. We are expecting 2011 
to be equally challenging and i am confident that 
our teams will rise to the occasion and will deliver 
another solid performance.
markets & prospects
The current economic climate will continue to pose 
challenges to our business over the next 12 months 
and the October Spending Review will, we hope, 
provide further clarity on public sector expenditure 
plans. Kier, with its established client relationships 
and financial strength, is well placed to attract 
construction work through its wide network of local 
offices and through the numerous frameworks in 
which we are involved in both the public and private 
sectors. We are encouraged by the prospects we 
see in markets such as power, utilities and waste. 
Our construction order books of secure and 
probable contracts are robust, providing 98% of our 
targeted revenue for 2011, much of it won through  
framework agreements, providing confidence that we 
can sustain healthy operating margins and strong 
cash flows.
Our Support Services business is benefiting from 
well-established client relationships which enable 
us to understand the needs of local authorities in

The performance and reporting of the Kier Group 
Corporate Responsibility (CR) programme is bench-
marked against both our competitors and customers 
through the annual Business in the Community 
(BiTC) CR index. This index assesses how we 
address the whole sustainability agenda, including 
issues concerning the environment and climate 
change (including waste and carbon reduction), the 
workplace (health and safety, employee relations 
and training), the marketplace (business ethics 
and corporate governance, customer relations and 
supply chain management) and community engage-
ment. The Group has worked closely with the BiTC CR 
index team to tailor our approach to the pragmatic 
delivery of our CR programme whilst endeavouring to 
maximise its impact. This has enabled us to monitor 
our progress against authenticated benchmarks and 
set targets to drive continuous improvement.
Governance
The Group CR Steering Committee, which oversees 
the CR programme and is chaired by chief executive 
Paul Sheffield, meets quarterly with its agenda based 
upon the four BiTC CR index headings. Reports and 
recommendations from this Committee, formed of 
senior representatives of the key Group functions 
that cover health, safety and environment, employee 
relations and training, community engagement, 
procurement and customer relations, are placed on 
the agenda for the Group’s full Board meetings in 
February, May, August and November.
The Group has put in place a sustainability strategy, 
supported by a wide range of procedures, policies 
and statements, which places corporate respon-
sibility at the highest level within its businesses 
(see pages 12 and 13). These include our Business  
Ethics Policy, Competition l aw Compliance  
Policy and recently revised Group Sustainable 
Procurement Policy.
The Group has also, during the last few years, 
established mechanisms and structures within 
which all businesses can actually deliver their 
corporate responsibilities in a measurable and 
full, third-party audited fashion. These range from 
health & safety procedures and environmental 
management systems to developing and adopting 
a bespoke SMARTWaste BRE waste management 
programme and becoming an Associate Member 
of the Considerate Constructors Scheme. it also 
includes a more manageable approach to corporate 
social responsibility and community activities, 
including formalised City Stewardship and local 
authority youth employment programmes.
During the year we have also consulted with 
several key shareholders for their feedback on our 
performance and their views on our approach to 
the CR agenda in the context of the wider investor 
environment.
BiTC CR index 2009/10
As included in the 2009 CR report, the Group made 
its first submission to the BiTC CR index in 2008 
and we achieved a creditable 58.5%. The Group 
then committed to achieve a benchmark of 70%, or 
Bronze status, within three years, based upon the 
improvement plan and initiatives taken in each sector 
within the index. The Group then made its second 
submission for the 2009 CR index. We were pleased 
that we recorded a remarkable improvement in the 
period, immediately exceeding our broad three-year 
target in only 12 months by achieving a score of 
78.2% (just short of the Silver status), representing a  
33% improvement. 
Following feedback from the BiTC administrators 
our weakest categories have been identified under 
the area of ‘impact’, reflecting that whilst we have 
been very active in setting up the mechanisms, 
processes and policies to deliver an efficient CR 
The Group’s vision is “to be the most highly respected company in the 
industry”. To achieve this vision we have to build, maintain, protect 
and enhance our reputation among our employees, customers, supply 
chain partners and investors, as well as among the community at 
large. A fundamental contribution to making this vision become reality 
is our robust approach to corporate responsibility, led by the Board 
and embedded in all the processes and services we undertake as a 
business. A full version of the following summary ‘2010 Corporate 
Responsibility Report’ will be placed on our website and will be regularly 
updated as appropriate at: www.kier.co.uk/responsibility

programme, we now need to measure the actual 
impact achieved. We will be completing the 2011 
survey submission in October this year. We have 
commissioned an index Peer Comparison Report 
from the BiTC which will give us greater knowledge 
of our CR performance and impact which in turn will 
reflect in higher scores in future surveys. Details of 
some of the mechanisms now being put into place in 
response to this feedback follow in the report below.
The Board has put in place a target to achieve 
90% (Gold status) under the BiTC CR index in the 
next three years.
Environment & climate change
in response to the uK Government’s Climate Change 
Act 2008, a commitment to significantly reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, the Group is actively 
measuring and recording its energy/fuel use for all 
uK operations. We have founded a Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Committee, which has now established 
the mechanisms and frameworks within which the 
business will capture and report this data. As part 
of this exercise, we participated in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) 2009, achieving a Carbon 
Disclosure l eadership index score of 59. This places 
Kier in the top 80 of the 236 FTSE350 respondents. 
This submission was based only on our Construction 
division’s carbon emissions.
Our report for CDP 2010 now includes both our 
Partnership Homes and Support Services divisions 
to give a complete Group-wide submission, with 
results expected to be published in October 2010.
The Group’s scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions for 
2009 (excluding mining operations) were 39,877 
tonnes or 20.2 tonnes of CO
2
 /£m revenue. This will 
be used as the benchmark for future measurement, 
with a targeted reduction of 10% over the next  
12 months. For the Construction division alone, 
we recorded 18,956 tonnes (2008: 26,727 
tonnes) or 14.6 tonnes of CO
2
/£m revenue 
(2008: 18.4 tonnes). 
As part of our commitment to the Waste & 
Resource Action Progamme’s (WRAP) ‘Halving 
Waste to l andfill’ initiative, our Construction division 
has achieved, in 2009, the following: 
•   27% reduction in the amount of construction, 
demolition and excavation (CDE) waste sent to 
landfill, based on our 2008 baseline;
•   8% reduction in the amount of CDE waste 
generated per £100,000 of turnover. 
The Group’s Construction division sent to landfill, 
in 2009, 16 tonnes of CDE waste per £100,000 of 
revenue (2008: 22 tonnes). The target is to reduce 
this figure to 11 tonnes by the end of 2012.
in 2010 we have worked closely with BRE to 
further upgrade the Group’s bespoke BRE online site 
waste management plan tool, ‘SMARTWaste’. This 
has significantly improved our capacity to analyse 
data streams across the Construction division. We 
are now looking to include our Building Maintenance 
businesses within this mechanism. 
Following our success in significantly reducing 
both the percentage of waste generated and the 
percentage sent to landfill on the pilot initiative 
at the Carmel College Project in St Helens during 
the year, we have now introduced WRAP’s Material 
l ogistics Planning concept across the business.
We have also established a Group agreement 
with the National Community Wood Recycling Project 
(NCWRP). Since the beginning of 2010 the NCWRP 
has recovered over 120 tonnes of waste wood from 
our sites, all of which has either been recycled or 
re-used, none going to landfill. 
workplace: Health & safety
Group businesses have maintained the aim of 
creating and maintaining safe sites through concen-
trating on ‘getting back to basics’, in conjunction 
with focusing on Health & Safety l eadership and our 
Behavioural Safety l eadership Programme.
Effective supervision remains a key factor in 
maintaining safe sites and the Group continues in its 
commitment for all supervisors on construction sites 
to hold the Construction Skills Site Supervisors’ 
Safety Training Scheme (SSSTS) certificate or a 
recognised equivalent supervisory qualification.
Our Behavioural Safety l eadership Programme, 
introduced to the Construction division in September 
2008, is now firmly embedded.  This programme 
focuses on encouraging active discussion within 
the workforce on safety specific issues.  Future 
development of this programme is to include 
environmental issues under the collective banner 
of sustainable behaviour.

As part of our focus to raise the profile of health 
within health & safety, a construction health manager 
has been appointed, the primary function of this role 
being the practical delivery of occupational health 
awareness at site level. This is currently being 
achieved through a series of roadshows focusing 
on hand-arm vibration and noise.
A series of objectives and targets have been 
set for 2010/11 encompassing safety, health and 
environment issues to ensure that the Group’s 
sustainability goals are fully supported and include 
a target of achieving an Accident incidence Rate 
(AiR) of zero.
workplace: Employees & training
The Group continues to offer a range of structured 
and innovative development programmes to attract 
new talent into our organisation. Almost 14% of our 
workforce is on new entrant trainee programmes. Our 
graduates and foundation degree students continue 
to be nominated by their businesses for their dedica-
tion and contribution to Kier. A third of employees 
enrolled on construction management NVQs have 
achieved their qualification in the last year. 
Commercial awareness toolbox talks are 
bite-sized interactive learning modules to help 
construction site staff get ‘back to basics’ in terms 
of site and commercial management. An initial set 
of ten 30-minute sessions were developed by the 
technical training steering Committee. These are 
delivered on site by contracts managers or senior 
quantity surveyors. Subjects range from ‘planning 
the works’, ‘setting out’, ‘material control and 
wastage’ to ‘record keeping’, ‘quality’ and ‘risk 
management’.
The commercial awareness toolbox talks will 
form part of the online ‘technical training academy’, 
currently under development, which will give access 
to course overviews, e-learning, course handouts 
and pre- and post-course tests.
Since investing in software to produce engaging 
and business focused e-learning programmes, over 
9,000 staff have enrolled in a number of on-line 
courses. The benefits to this type of learning is 
a reduction in our carbon footprint as employees 
have little or no travelling time, less time away from 
the workplace and that the programmes can be 
accessed anywhere there is an internet connection 
at a time convenient to the learner.
We are researching a number of technology-based 
learning methods to further support employees in 
obtaining the development they need in the most 
cost-effective and timely way.
We conducted an employee engagement survey 
in March to all divisions except Support Services, 
which plans to run the survey in October 2010. There 
were 2,650 respondents, representing just over a 
60% response rate. An analysis of the results shows 
that discretionary effort from employees is higher 
than typical in Kier compared with uK and worldwide 
and we are well set to retain staff over the next year.
The four main factors that will improve our 
employee engagement are:
•   strengthening the connection between our staff 
and Kier’s purpose and direction;
•   encouraging our management to give more 
feedback to their teams on a day-to-day basis;
•   ensuring our people are increasing their skills 
and providing the responsibility they need to 
develop; and
•   ensuring that people feel valued and have a 
career path ahead of them.
We will be focusing our efforts over the next year on:
•   strengthening the connection between the 
Company and employees;
•   improving people performance management 
through the roll out of a programme to increase 
our managers’ people management skills. it 
will give managers the skills to be able to give 
specific feedback to their teams, and coach  
their people; 
•   introducing regular pulse surveys to get further 
employee feedback on specific issues such as 
attitudes to health & safety, customer focus and 
corporate responsibility; and
•   ongoing re-measurement to monitor the improve-
ments in engagement levels.

Considerate Constructors Scheme
As an Associate Member of the Considerate 
Constructors Scheme (CCS) the Group takes its 
obligations for excellent performance under the 
eight categories audited within the scheme extremely 
seriously. The scheme is applicable to all businesses 
and divisions in the Group and the monthly reports 
on every visit to our sites from the CCS administra-
tors are posted on our website and intranet. We also 
produce quarterly reports that are circulated to every 
business unit summarising the Group’s performance 
and distributing examples of best practice for further 
improvement.
During the year we received 29 national CCS 
awards, comprising two gold, ten silver and 17 
bronze. This represents an improvement of 162% 
and 38% over our performance in 2008 and 2009 
respectively. Despite the introduction of much more 
stringent marking regimes at the end of 2009 by the 
CCS administrators, our CCS monthly average score 
for 10 out of the 12 months within the period was 
above 34 out of the 40 maximum score. Our overall 
monthly average has risen from 33.66 in 2009 to 
34.30 in 2010. 
l ast year we set the Group a target to exceed 
the national industry average during the year by 
2.10 points, but we actually exceeded that by 
achieving an annual average of 2.31 (7.2%) above 
the industry average (2009: 2.06). Our new target 
for 2011 is 2.40. Our highest monthly average score 
peaked at 34.85 in November 2009, just before the 
scoring criteria changed, bringing down the average 
scores across the board. Nevertheless, our monthly 
average scores since then have demonstrated how 
our site teams have quickly adapted to the more 
stringent marking by recovering with scores above 
34 since February 2010 to reach 34.60 in June.
Every quarterly report includes ideas to improve 
our scores and initiatives demonstrating areas of 
best practice. This has included the adoption of the 
National Community Wood Recycling Project to help 
our sites improve both their environmental impact 
and their community engagement. 
Kier Sheffield ll P is now to sign up all its 
responsive maintenance units in a new pilot CCS 
scheme as a business in its own right. This is being 
adopted now by some major local authorities, but 
Kier is the first contractor to pilot this initiative.
(SuSA) behavioural safety, Target Zero defects, 
the Considerate Constructors Scheme, the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment and Halving Waste to l andfill. 
We have conducted supplier awareness days 
throughout the uK with attendance of between 60 
and 250 companies at each. These events deliver 
our messages on health, safety, performance 
improvement and innovation as well as providing 
facilitated open forums to enable Kier to listen to 
our key suppliers.
in May 2010 a revised, more robust Group 
Sustainable Procurement Policy was launched in 
line with BiTC CR index data requirements and 
placed on our website. This is being embedded into 
our procurement processes across all the Group 
divisions and a focus is being given to relationship 
management within our supply chain.
Community engagement
in 2008 the Construction division introduced a 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and community 
engagement template and model that was adopted 
by every regional business to make our activities in 
this field both more consistent and more manage-
able, together with the ability to record more closely 
the value in man-hours dedicated to community work 
by our staff for charitable causes. The success of 
this (see table on pages 40-41) prompted us to 
look more widely to encompass the whole Group’s 
CSR activities. Thus, Kier iConnecting, a web-based 
data collection, analysis and reporting system for 
the Group’s community engagement activities, has 
been launched this year under a system managed by 
Measure2improve l imited. This will help immensely 
in the delivery of a fully coordinated and struc-
tured CSR programme for community engagement 
throughout the Group as well as the capture of data 
regarding the Group’s impact on communities so 
vital to our contract prequalification questionnaires 
(PQQs) requirements. This is being rolled out formally 
during November 2010. 
By its very nature, our Building Maintenance 
business is embedded in the communities where it 
undertakes its work with councils and local author-
ities across the country. This is manifested in the 
fact that it has supported approximately 400 young 
people to re-engage in learning or work through 
programmes targeting the NEET group (young people 
not in education, employment or training). it has 
also provided over 5,000 work experience days for 
14 to 16 year-olds through its various local authority 
building maintenance contracts. The business has 
delivered a groundbreaking programme targeting 
Children l eaving Care in four areas of the country 
in partnership with the national Care2Work initiative. 
For adults, it has supported the Future Jobs Fund 
by providing over 100 opportunities for unemployed 
adults and, furthermore, signed a l ocal Employment 
Partnership (l EP) with Jobcentre Plus, pledging 
to place every job vacancy with them to ensure 
maximum inclusion in our recruitment.

and which we have adopted as 
key performance indicators. 
Following our first submission to 
the BiTC CR index in 2008, when 
we achieved a creditable 58.5%, 
the Group aimed to achieve a 
target of 70% within the next 
three years based upon our 
improvement plan. The Group’s 
second submission for the  
BiTC CR index in 2009 recorded 
a score of 78.2% (Bronze status) 
representing a 33% improvement 
and exceeding our three-year 
target in only 12 months.  
Our target now is to achieve  
90% (Gold status) in the next 
three years. 41

Accounting policies
The Group’s annual consolidated financial state-
ments have been prepared in accordance with 
international Financial Reporting Standards. This 
year we have adopted iFRiC 12 and have restated 
the balance sheet for 2009 accordingly. iFRiC 12 
addresses how we account for our PFi concessions 
and has resulted in a reduction in net assets of 
£3.2m at 30 June 2009.
Other than stated above there have been no 
significant changes to the accounting policies 
adopted by the Group during the year to 30 June 
2010.
underlying profit before tax and earnings per share
u nderlying profit before tax and exceptional 
items grew by 9.7% to £55.5m (2009: £50.6m). 
This includes a joint venture tax credit of £0.1m  
(2009: deduction of £0.3m) and is stated before 
minority interests of £0.8m (2009: £0.8m). The 
share of minority interests relates to the share of 
profits from our building maintenance outsourcing 
contracts attributable to local authorities in the 
circumstances in which they partner with Kier.
Earnings per share after the amortisation of 
intangible assets and before exceptional items were 
17.7% ahead of last year at 115.5p (2009: 98.1p) 
benefiting from a reduction in the effective tax rate 
to 22% (2009: 28%) following the agreement of 
certain tax issues.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items amounted to a net credit of £2.2m, 
before tax, as follows:
 £m
Pension credit arising from changes to local  
authority schemes announced in the budget 16.0
Profit on the sale of two PFi investments 4.2
Provision in respect of the OFT fine  
against which we have appealed (18.0)
Total exceptional items 2.2
The £16.0m credit to the income statement and 
corresponding improvement in the funding position 
of the Sheffield pension scheme has arisen from 
changes announced in the recent budget which 
apply to local authority pension schemes and in 
our case to the South Yorkshire Pension Scheme in 
which employees of Kier Sheffield ll P, within Kier 
Building Maintenance, participate. These changes 
will result in future pensions increasing at the rate 
of the Consumer Price index (CPi) rather than at 
the Retail Price index (RPi) and, therefore, reduce 
pension scheme liabilities.
in December 2009 we sold our investment in two 
education PFi projects for a combined cash consid-
eration of £7.3m at a valuation discount of around 
8% resulting in an exceptional gain of £4.2m.
On 22 September 2009 Kier, along with 102 
other construction companies, was fined in respect 
of the Office of Fair Trading’s investigation into 
cover-pricing in the construction industry. Our fine 
of £17.9m was calculated by reference to Kier Group 
plc’s worldwide Group revenue for the year to 30 
June 2008 (£2.3bn) and, as such, was the highest 
level of revenue to which the calculation of any of 
the fines was applied. We have appealed against 
the quantum of the fine and anticipate that the 
Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) will conclude 
its findings and make a decision towards the end 
of this calendar year. We have made an exceptional 
provision of £18.0m in the results for the year to 30 
June 2010 to reflect the fine as it currently stands.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate, including joint venture 
tax on joint venture profits has reduced from 28% last 
year to 22% as a consequence of reaching agree-
ment on certain issues with HMRC.

The Group interest receivable includes that 
arising from average treasury balances of £67m 
for the year (2009: £36m). The charge of £1.9m 
relating to unwinding of discounts includes £1.1m 
relating to land creditor balances (2009: £2.1m).
Net funds at 30 June 2010 were a record 
£175.2m (2009: £92.5m) after deducting £30.3m 
relating to loan notes. £111.4m (2009: £7.5m) was 
generated from operations during the year including 
over £30m in respect of the sale of a property devel-
opment (the uK Supreme Court).
Cash at 30 June 2010 includes £51.7m (2009: 
£46.7m) of cash which is not generally available for 
Group purposes, including that held by joint arrange-
ments, overseas and other cash not readily available 
to the Group. The liquid cash position is affected 
by seasonal, monthly and contract-specific cycles.
Treasury policy and risk management
The Group has bank facilities amounting to £77.5m 
and long-term debt of £30m managed by the central-
ised treasury function.
•   £40m of the bank facilities were renewed in 
September 2010 and are in place for 42 months, 
expiring in February 2014. £10m of the facilities 
is an overdraft facility and £27.5m expires in 
February 2011. The facility expiring in 2011 is 
currently under review.
•   The long-term debt of £30m represents a ten-year 
uK and uS private placement and is due to be 
repaid in February 2013.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash 
and liquid investments. The Group, largely through 
its PFi and Property joint ventures, enters into deriva-
tives transactions (principally interest rate swaps) to 
manage interest rate risks arising from the Group’s 
operations and its sources of finance. We do not 
enter into speculative transactions.
There are minor foreign currency risks arising 
from operations. The Group has a small number 
of branches and subsidiaries operating overseas 
in different currencies. Currency exposure to 
overseas assets is hedged through inter-company 
balances and borrowings, such that assets denomi-
nated in foreign currencies are matched, as far as 
possible, by liabilities. Where there may be further 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, forward 
exchange contracts are entered into to buy and sell  
foreign currency.
Balance sheet and total equity
Total equity at 30 June 2010 is £104.2m (2009: 
£89.3m).
Acquisitions and intangible assets
The balance sheet at 30 June 2010 includes intan-
gible assets of £27.7m of which £13.7m relates to 
building maintenance contracts. During the year we 
made two acquisitions together with the acquisition 
of a building maintenance contract as follows:
•   in September 2009 we acquired an investment in 
a l ocal Education Partnership in Kent in respect 
of the development of a number of Building 
Schools for the Future projects. The programme 
was set out in several phases with the first 
phase already under way when we acquired our 
investment. The consideration for the investment 
was £4.2m which comprised intangible assets 
of £5.2m, goodwill of £0.7m offset by net 
liabilities of £1.7m. £2.0m of the consideration 
was contingent upon future phases of building 
projects being signed up. in June 2010 it was 
announced that future phases of the Kent BSF 
programme would be cancelled, therefore at 
30 June 2010 we have written £3.9m off the 
intangible asset, £1.9m through the income 
statement and £2.0m offsetting the provision 
held for the deferred consideration.
•   in September 2009 we commenced a building 
maintenance contract for North Tyneside. The 
consideration was £6.9m representing the 
value of net assets acquired including intangible 
assets of £6.5m. £3.4m has been paid in the 
year to 30 June 2010, the rest is deferred over 
the life of the contract.
•   in May 2010 we acquired Pure Recycling l imited 
for a total consideration of £7.1m. £2.0m was 
paid in cash on that date with the remainder 
contingent upon the completion of certain events 
together with the results of the business through 
to 2016. The net present value of the deferred 
consideration is £4.4m.

accordance with normal practice and accounting 
standards. No impairment in the carrying value of 
the land bank has been made this year. in the two 
years to 30 June 2009 we wrote the land bank down 
by a total of £69.1m representing 23% of the initial 
carrying value of the land bank.
The Group has also reviewed the land and work

How we manage risk
Core to our continued success 
is our ability to identify and 
effectively manage the risks to 
our business. Accordingly the 
Group has well-defined, rigorous 
policies and processes designed 
to identify, mitigate and control 
risk. Risks are specific to each 
of our businesses and are 
controlled through the Group’s 
risk management processes. 
The primary risks that have the 
potential to adversely impact on 
our business over the next 12 
months are considered to be as 
follows below.
Business risks
f inancial review
Continued
a defined benefit section, and a defined benefit 
scheme on behalf of its employees in Kier Sheffield 
ll P. The financial statements reflect the pension 
scheme deficits calculated in accordance with iAS 
19. At 30 June 2010 the net deficit under the Kier 
Group Pension Scheme (the Scheme) was £56.6m 
(2009: £69.2m). The market value of the Scheme’s 
assets was £611.2m (2009: £498.4m) and the 
net present value of the liabilities was £689.8m  
(2009: £594.5m). The increase in the liabilities is 
largely the result of a reduction in the discount rate 
to 5.3% (2009: 6.2%).
During the year we agreed to make an additional 
special cash contribution to the Scheme amounting 
to £13.2m which was settled through the transfer 
of residential land at market value, as confirmed 
by an independent valuation. This special contri-
bution is reflected in the Group’s balance sheet as 
a reduction in inventories together with a reduction 
in the gross pension deficit. As the land was 
transferred at greater than book value profits are 
included in operating profit for Partnership Homes 
and Developments for the year.
in addition to the land contribution during the 
year the Group has contributed £8.0m (2009: 
£8.0m) to the Scheme in respect of additional 
deficit funding based on an actuarial valuation as 
at 1 July 2007 which was 87% funded. The triennial 
valuation, as at 1 April 2010, is currently in progress 
and is likely to be finalised towards the end of the 
current financial year. We are still assessing the 
impact of the announced changes to inflation to be 
applied to future pension increases in respect of 
private pension schemes. The Group is committed 
to continuing to support the funding position of the 
Scheme.
under the scheme relating to Kier Sheffield ll P 
there was a net deficit of £6.2m at 30 June 2010 
(2009: £13.4m) after taking into account the benefit 
of £16.0m arising from the change in the inflation 
rate which is applied to future pensions for public 
sector pension schemes.
Pension charges of £11.9m (before the excep-
tional credit of £16.0m) (2009: £10.4m) have 
been made to the income statement in accordance  
with iAS 19.

KiER GROuP Pl C ANNuAl R EPORT AND ACCOuNTS 2010
The order books for our Construction and Support Services divisions 
are dependent upon the level of expenditure in the public sector and the 
availability of credit for private sector expenditure.
The Group is exposed to funding risks arising from changes in longevity, 
inflation and investment assumptions in relation to its defined benefit 
schemes. These changes could result in an additional funding requirement.
Our ability to tender for new business and our relationship with our range of 
customers, supply chain partners, our employees and other stakeholders 
depends a great deal upon the good reputation that we have established 
for the Group and how we are perceived by others.
The Group depends, for its success, on the stability of its customers, joint 
venture partners, suppliers, funders, bondsmen and insurers. Failure in 
these counterparties could result in non-collection of amounts owed or 
disruption and delays to contract progress.
The Group’s long-term business is dependent upon cash resources, 
facilities and the ability to provide performance and other bonds as 
necessary.
The Group carries out several hundred contracts annually and the risks to 
which the Group is exposed are dependent upon the nature of the work, the 
duration of the contract and the legal form of the contract.
The cost and quality of land is fundamental to the profitability of a housing 
and property development business.
The Group’s activities require the continuous monitoring and management 
of health, safety and environmental risks. Failure to manage these risks 
could cause injury to our employees and subcontractors and could expose 
the Group to significant potential liability and reputational damage.
The efficient operation of the Group is increasingly dependent upon the 
proper operation, performance and development of its iT systems. Failure 
to manage or integrate iT systems or to implement successfully changes 
in iT systems could result in a loss of control over critical business 
information and/or systems. This, in turn, could impact the Group’s ability 
to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The Group is subject to a number of complex, demanding and evolving tax, 
legal and regulatory requirements. A breach of laws and regulations could 
lead to legal proceedings, investigations or disputes resulting in a disruption 
of business ranging from additional costs incurred on a project to civil  
and/or criminal penalties as well as reputational damage to the Group.
The Group is dependent on members of its senior management team and 
on a flexible, highly skilled and well motivated workforce and believes its 
future success will depend, in part, on its ability to attract, develop and 
retain its personnel. if the Group does not succeed in attracting, developing 
and retaining skilled personnel it may not be able to grow as anticipated.
The Group recognises there are risks associated with PFi investment.
The Group has created a structure to manage and mitigate risk with the following 
key components:
–  A wide geographic regional network of offices across the uK providing strong 
integration in local communities, our client base and our supply chain
–  A strong level of framework agreements and partnerships with government, local 
authorities and the private sector
–  An ability to react to evolving opportunities in the marketplace and to maintain a 
focus on cost reduction and efficiency.
We also carry out monthly and quarterly reviews of our workload and forecast our 
overhead levels as a percentage of future work in order to maintain a steady ratio 
of overhead costs to revenue.
Steps have been taken over time to eradicate our calculated deficit including 
the closure of the Scheme to new entrants in 2002 and the imposition of a cap 
on pensionable salary increases, taken in 2009. Other measures to mitigate 
liabilities are under continuous review by the Group. 
The performance of the Group’s pension schemes are regularly monitored by the 
Group and the Trustees of the pension scheme who, as appropriate, take advice 
from external consultants.
Considerable efforts are made to assess the financial strength of counterparties 
before entering into contract and to structure payments so as to mitigate our 
financial exposure to them for the duration of our relationship. Where the Group 
is particularly dependent upon the continued financial strength of the providers of 
key financial services to the Group, we take steps to spread this exposure across 
a range of counterparties so as to diversify risk.
Cash forecasts and balances are prepared regularly (weekly and daily). Bank 
facilities are in place which have been recently renegotiated. The Group has 
strong, long-term relationships with its bondsmen and has an in-house team which 
monitors headroom and advises on bond terms and conditions.
The Group’s appetite for very long-term, large, competitively tendered construction 
contracts is limited, driven by the desire to manage risk. Tenders for contracts are 
subject to approval by the Board, chief executive and finance director or divisional 
directors depending upon the value and nature of the contract. Contracts in progress 
are controlled and managed through the Group’s operating structure and procedures, 
including rigorous and regular review of forecast revenue and costs to complete.
Site evaluation is a key process and site appraisals are carried out in detail, 
including using external advice where appropriate. l and and development 
acquisitions are subject to approval by the Board, chief executive and finance 
director or divisional directors depending upon the value of the land. Developments 
in progress are controlled and managed through the Group’s operating structure 
and procedures, including rigorous and regular review of forecast revenue and costs 
to complete. 
in the case of the Property division, development risk is controlled by commencing 
construction generally when it has either pre-sold or pre-let the development.
Detailed HSE policies and procedures exist to minimise such risks and are 
subject to review and monitoring by operating companies and Group. All operating 
companies have a director responsible for HSE although it is recognised that all 
directors and employees are responsible for health and safety. (See pages 34 & 36)
Group iT manages the majority of systems in the Group centrally. Other iT systems 
are managed locally by experienced iT personnel. Significant investments in iT 
systems are subject to Board review and approval.
The Group monitors and responds to legal and regulatory developments in 
the areas in which it operates. it is the Group’s policy to require that all of its 
subsidiaries, employees, suppliers and subcontractors comply with applicable 
laws, regulations and standards. Training courses are provided, including 
e-learning courses, to keep staff fully aware of their responsibilities.
The Group monitors staff turnover closely and pay and conditions are reviewed 
regularly against the prevailing market and benchmarked to ensure that we  
remain competitive.
Succession planning is also key at all levels in the organisation.
The Group is selective in the PFi projects for which it bids, primarily concentrating 
on the sectors where we have established construction expertise.
in order to protect and enhance our reputation we have put in place a robust series 
of business ethics, sustainability and compliance policies together with a range 
of mechanisms that help deliver the Group’s corporate responsibility programme, 
including health & safety, environmental impact, climate change, employees, 
customers & supply chain and community engagement. (See pages 35 to 41)

A statement on corporate governance is set out on pages 52 to 55.
Going concern
t he Group has considerable financial resources, together with long-term 
contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across its business 
activities. As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is 
well placed to manage its business risks effectively.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation

views of the Audit committee);
•  interim management statements;
•  the Group’s final salary pension scheme;

•  the implications of the election of a coalition government, including 
the potential impact on public sector expenditure;
•  health and safety issues and strategies;
•  corporate responsibility matters;
•  the response to an employee engagement survey conducted by the 
Group;
•  the process of appealing against the fine imposed by the office of 
Fair trading as a result of cover pricing by a Group company; and
•  presentations as to strategic issues from the senior management of 
a number of the divisions.
t he Group’s chairman is Mr p M White, who leads the Board. He is 
responsible for the Board’s effectiveness and sets its agenda, ensuring 
that the directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. He 
facilitates the effective contribution of the non-executive directors and 
ensures a positive and constructive relationship between the executive 
and non-executive directors. t he chairman is also responsible for 
effective communication with shareholders.
Mr J d odds retired from the Board on 31 March 2010 and was 
replaced as chief executive by Mr M p sheffield, who is responsible 
for the operational management of the Group and is accountable to 
the Board for the implementation of the Group’s strategy. in order to 
facilitate this, the chief executive meets monthly with a management 
c ommittee comprising the other executive directors and he also chairs 
monthly management meetings with each of the divisions. t he chief 
executive also meets regularly with the human resources managers 
and the director of safety, health and environment.
t he senior non-executive director is Mr c V Geoghegan. t he Board 
considers Mr c V Geoghegan and Mr n p Winser to be independent 
directors. t he chairman of the Board, Mr p M White, was also 
considered to be independent on his appointment.
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance
t he Board recognises the importance of high standards of corporate 
conduct and is committed to managing the Group’s operations in 
accordance with the best principles of corporate governance set out 
in section 1 of the combined code on corporate Governance issued in 
June 2008 (the combined code). t he company has complied with such 
principles throughout the year, except as explained below.
t hroughout the year, independent non-executive directors comprised 
less than half of the Board. t he Board remains of the view that to 
increase the number of independent non-executive directors to a level 
where parity was attained would lead to an unduly large and unwieldy 
Board, without delivering any tangible benefit to shareholders. For 
these reasons, the Board believes that, although the current Board 
structure does not comply with the c ombined c ode, it is satisfactorily 
balanced in practice, with the independent non-executive directors 
having a substantial presence in Board debate.
t he Board has noted the introduction of the uK c orporate 
Governance c ode, which is expressed to apply to accounting periods 
beginning on or after 29 June 2010. t he Board is currently considering 
the steps required to reflect the provisions of the new code in its 
policies and procedures.
Board of directors
t he Board is responsible to shareholders for the success of the 
c ompany. t he Board sets the strategic and financial policies of the 
Group, monitors and reviews business performance and controls risk. 
t he Board has put in place standing orders which are designed to 
ensure that it is provided with relevant information on a timely basis, 
which set authorisation limits and which reserve certain matters for 
the Board or its committees, including:
•  strategy and financial policy;
•  the approval of financial statements;
•  risk management;
•  major capital expenditure;
•  major project approval;
•  acquisitions and disposals; and
•  certain aspects of human resources policy, including senior 
appointments, general salary reviews, employee share plans and 
pension provision.

Audit Committee
t he Audit c ommittee comprises the non-executive directors. during 
the year ended 30 June 2010, the chairman of the Audit c ommittee 
was Mr s W l eathes, a chartered accountant with recent and relevant 
financial experience. t he committee met four times during the year in 
July, september, February and June. t hese committee meetings were 
also attended by the finance director and the head of internal audit. t he 
KpMG audit engagement director attended the meetings in september 
and February and then met with the c ommittee without management 
being present. t he chairman and executive directors have an open 
invitation to attend the meetings.
t he c ompany announced that Mr r c Bailey will replace  
Mr s W l eathes as the chairman of the Audit c ommittee for the year 
ending 30 June 2011. Mr r c Bailey is a chartered accountant with 
recent and relevant financial experience.
t he c ommittee has clearly defined terms of reference which outline 
its objectives and responsibilities relating to financial reporting, 
internal controls, risk management and the application of appropriate 
accounting policies and procedures. specific responsibilities include 
reviewing and recommending for approval the annual and interim 
financial statements, reviewing the Group’s accounting policies, 
reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management 
processes and reviewing the scope and results of the external audit.
t he c ommittee also has responsibility for overseeing the Group 
internal audit function, including approval of the annual risk-based audit 
plan and monitoring the work, recommendations and effectiveness of 
the function. t he head of internal audit reports directly to the chairman 
of the c ommittee.
At each of its meetings, the c ommittee received and reviewed a 
report from the head of internal audit which highlighted the internal 
audit activity against the approved plan, together with the key findings 
from internal audits. t he chairman of the c ommittee also has separate 
meetings with the head of internal audit and the c ommittee has also 
met with the head of internal audit without management being present. 
in June 2010, the c ommittee carried out a review of the effectiveness 
of the internal audit function.
t he c ommittee is responsible for monitoring the independence 
and objectivity of KpMG, the external auditors, and agreeing the level 
of remuneration and extent of non-audit services. t he c ommittee 
received a presentation from KpMG on its audit strategy and the scope 
of work at the February meeting, which the c ommittee agreed. it also 
discussed the firm’s professional ethical standards.
t he committee reviewed the performance of KpMG and the non-audit 
fees paid to them during the year, details of which are set out in note

services, other than tax compliance and routine taxation advice, must 
be referred to and agreed by the c ommittee over a predetermined 
cost threshold and any work costed below that threshold must be 
pre-approved by the Group finance director. t hese controls enable the 
c ommittee to be satisfied that KpMG’s objectivity and independence 
as auditors had not been impaired, notwithstanding the provision of 
non-audit services in the year.
t he c ommittee agreed and approved KpMG’s overall audit fee 
following discussions between relevant Group management and KpMG.

by the Board to be independent. t he Board was of the view that, as 
a result of Mr r c Bailey’s recent and relevant experience, it did not 
need to use either an external search consultancy or open advertising 
in making this appointment. At the forthcoming annual general meeting, 
a resolution will be proposed for the election of Mr r c Bailey as a 
director of the c ompany. Biographical details of Mr r c Bailey will be 
included in the notice of annual general meeting.
on 12 July 2010, the c ompany announced that Miss d e Mattar 
intended to leave the Group with effect from the conclusion of the 
forthcoming annual general meeting. t he c ompany also announced 
that Mr H J Mursell would join as Group finance director designate and 
that Mr H J Mursell was expected to take over from Miss d e Mattar 
upon her departure.
A table of attendance of directors at meetings of the Board and 
its various c ommittees is set out on page 54. in addition to these 
meetings, the full Board attends a number of away-days annually 
which focus on strategy, material issues facing the Group and 
succession planning. outside of the formal schedule of meetings, 
the non-executive directors met without the executive directors on a 
number of occasions during the year.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the c ompany 
secretary and the directors are able to seek independent professional 
advice if necessary at the c ompany’s expense. training is available 
for new directors and subsequently as necessary. All directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting 
following their appointment and to re-election thereafter at intervals 
of no more than three years. executive directors are required to seek 
approval from the Board before accepting any external non-executive 
positions, although no such positions are currently held.
t he r emuneration c ommittee and Board encourage directors and 
staff at all levels to acquire shares in the c ompany and to hold them 
for the longer term. t his sense of ownership is an important element of 
the Group’s culture and of its focus on long-term performance. so far 
as is considered appropriate, the Group prefers to promote individuals 
from within.
Board evaluation
t he chairman carried out an evaluation of the Board during the year. t his 
included all the committees of the Board. t he chairman held individual 
meetings with each director to discuss their views and to solicit their 
opinions. t he conclusions were discussed collectively by the Board 
and a number of actions agreed. t he performance of the chairman was 
reviewed separately in a process led by the senior independent director.
t he terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at the registered office and will 
be on display prior to and at the annual general meeting. 54 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010

Any non-attendance at meetings was due to other business commitments. 
When a director was unable to attend, he reviewed the papers circulated

the meeting.
Mr s Bowcott attended three Board meetings during the year, prior 
to being appointed to the Board with effect from 1 July 2010.
Internal control
t he combined code requires that the directors review the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control and that this review covers 
all material controls, including operational, compliance and financial 
controls and risk management systems. t he directors are satisfied that 
procedures are in place to ensure that the Group complies with the 
turnbull c ommittee guidance published by the institute of c hartered 
Accountants in england and Wales and that the procedures have been 
applied during the year.
t he Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of 
internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness. t he Board 
considers that the Group’s systems and controls, which have been 
developed and refined over many years, are appropriately designed 
to ensure that the Group’s exposure to significant risks is properly 
managed. However, such systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement. in reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls, the 
directors have considered the key risks and exposures within the Group.
t he key features of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
principal controls are:
•  an established management structure operating throughout the Group 
with clearly defined levels of responsibility and delegation of authority; 
•  clearly defined operating guidelines and procedures with authorisation 
limits set at appropriate levels. t hese are set out in the Group and 
divisional standing orders;
•  a comprehensive budgeting and forecasting system in place which 
is regularly reviewed and updated;
•  a formal quarterly review of each division’s year-end forecast, 
business performance, risk and internal control matters which is 
carried out by the directors of each division with the chief executive 
and finance director in attendance;
•  monthly management reporting, including regular comparison of 
actual results against latest forecasts;
•  established policies and procedures governing the Group’s investment 
in land, property and other significant assets, including acquisitions 
and disposals. t hese include detailed appraisals, appropriate 
authorisation levels and Board approval depending on value or 
perceived exposure;
•  investment decisions, including private Finance initiative (pFi) 
projects, and tenders for contracts being subject to approval by the 
Board, the chief executive and finance director or divisional directors 
depending on the value and nature of the investment or contract. 
individual tender and project review procedures are in place prior to 
bidding and before contract award;

Internal control continued
•  internal audits carried out to assess the adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal controls. t he scope of the internal audit work is planned 
to cover the key risks faced by the business and is supplemented by 
cyclical reviews of the core financial process. internal audit findings 
are reported to the Audit committee and the executive directors on 
a regular basis;
•  risk registers in place for each business unit highlighting key risks 
facing that business, together with an assessment of the 
effectiveness of controls to mitigate those risks. t he risk registers 
are updated regularly and at 31 March;
•  an annual process of risk and control self assessment whereby all 
operating companies are required to review and confirm that 
appropriate internal controls are in place and operating effectively 
across the key risk areas identified in individual company risk 
registers. t his assessment was carried out as at 31 March 2010 
and the findings reviewed by the Audit committee;
•  reviewing and reporting of safety, health and environmental matters; 
and
•  the provision of a confidential method of reporting any suspected 
fraud or other misfeasance to the head of internal audit.
t he Board receives regular reports from all operating units to monitor 
their performance and all business unit management teams are briefed 
on issues arising at Board meetings.
d uring the course of the year, members of the Board visit all 
significant Group companies and monitor the control framework of 
each business. t he Audit c ommittee reviews the appropriateness 
and effectiveness of internal controls.
Relations with shareholders
t he Board uses the annual general meeting to communicate with 
shareholders and encourages their attendance and participation. t he 
chairmen of the Audit and r emuneration committees are available to 
answer questions from shareholders. t he Group also maintains a regular 
dialogue with institutional investors to assist in the understanding of 
the Group’s objectives and the c ompany has a programme of regular 
communication with investors, analysts and brokers. presentations are 
made to investors, analysts and press at the time of the announcement 
of the final and half-year results and there are regular meetings with 
analysts and investors which are arranged through the c ompany’s 
brokers so that the investment community can be kept informed as 
to the Group’s performance. t he Board is provided with independent 
feedback from analysts and institutional shareholders.
t he c ompany’s website is also maintained to aid communication 
with investors, employees, customers, suppliers and the general public. 56 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010
Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
t his report has been prepared by the r emuneration c ommittee on 
behalf of the Board. in writing it, the c ommittee has adopted the 
governance principles relating to directors’ remuneration which are 
set out in the combined code.
t his report complies with the c ompanies Act 2006, schedule 8 of 
the l arge and Medium sized c ompanies and Groups (Accounts and 
r eports) r egulations 2008 and the l isting r ules.
The Remuneration Committee
t he r emuneration committee is a committee of the Board consisting 
of the non-executive directors and the chairman of the Board. t he 
following directors were members of the c ommittee during the year 
ended 30 June 2010:
c V Geoghegan (chairman)
s W l eathes
p M White
n p Winser
t he secretary of the committee is Mrs A sale, rewards director.
t he terms of reference of the c ommittee are available on the 
Group’s website and on request from the c ompany secretary. t he 
c ommittee meets when necessary, but not less than once a year. 
d etails of the number of times that the c ommittee met, and the 
number of meetings attended by each director, during the year ended 
30 June 2010 are set out on page 54. t he c ommittee consults the 
chief executive concerning its proposals (except in relation to his own 
remuneration) and takes external professional advice as appropriate. 
in respect of the year ended 30 June 2010, the c ommittee was advised 
by its independent remuneration advisers, Kepler Associates. Kepler 
Associates provides no other advice, or services, to the c ompany.
Where necessary, or appropriate, the c ommittee consults with 
major institutional shareholders on remuneration matters.
Remuneration policy
t he committee makes recommendations to the Board on its executive 
remuneration policy, for adoption by the Board, and determines specific 
remuneration packages for each of the executive directors on behalf of 
the Board. t he committee also monitors the remuneration packages of 
other senior members of management within the Group.
t he c ommittee’s policy is to maintain an appropriate balance 
between fixed elements of remuneration (basic salary, benefits in kind 
and pension) and performance related elements (annual bonus and 
long-term incentives) and to place an increasingly greater emphasis on 
rewarding executives by reference to the Group’s long-term performance 
by incentivising long-term sustainable profit growth and the creation 
of long-term value. Accordingly, for the year ending 30 June 2011,  
the c ommittee is seeking shareholder approval at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting for a new long-term incentive plan which will 
reward three-year total shareholder return (tsr ) outperformance 
and three-year cumulative earnings per share (eps ) performance. 
in addition, it is proposed that one-third of any annual bonus will be 
satisfied by Kier Group plc shares and that such shares will be subject 
to clawback over a three-year period.
t he c ommittee reviews the executive directors’ remuneration 
on an annual basis. At each review, the c ommittee considers an 
individual’s experience and performance in their role over the year 
(as well as over the period since being given the role) against a 
number of key performance indicators relating to both individual and 
corporate measures of performance. t he individual’s experience and 
performance are then considered against the market positioning of pay 
for the role, based on an analysis of external reference points provided 
by the Group’s independent remuneration advisers. t he c ommittee’s 
key objective is to ensure executive pay is aligned with shareholders’ 
long-term interests and optimises the balance between:
•  the need to attract and retain talent, but to provide value for money; 
and
•  increasing the long-term variable aspect of total remuneration and 
ensuring a mix that is appropriate to the Group.
t he c ommittee also takes into account employment terms and 
conditions across the Group in determining the executive directors’ 
remuneration so as to ensure a consistent approach.
t he executive directors’ remuneration consists of a basic salary, 
an annual bonus, benefits in kind, awards under a long-term incentive 
plan and membership of a pension scheme. Further information on 
each of the elements is set out below.
Basic salary
t he committee decided not to increase the executive directors’ salaries 
in 2009 in light of the adverse economic conditions in which the Group 
was operating. For 2010, the committee decided to increase salaries 
by approximately 3% (effective 1 July 2010) for all executive directors 
except Mr M p sheffield who received an increase on promotion to 
chief executive in April 2010. t he committee approved similar rates of 
salary increase across the Group. t his decision was influenced by the 
improved performance of the business during the year ended 30 June 
2010 and a desire for consistency at and below Board level.
t he basic salaries of the executive directors, with effect from  
1 July 2010, are:

Benefits in kind
t he remuneration received by each of the directors during the year, 
together with details of share interests and pension benefits, are set 
out on pages 59 to 61.
Benefits in kind comprise membership of a private health insurance 
scheme and the provision of a company car or a car allowance.
Annual bonus arrangements
during the year ended 30 June 2010, executive directors were eligible 
to receive a cash bonus of up to 75% of basic salary, based on the 
Group achieving pre-tax profit performance targets. Based on the 
c ommittee’s review of the Group’s performance against its targets, 
it determined that a bonus of 38% of basic salary would be payable 
to each of the executive directors during the year and was satisfied 
that this was commensurate with the Group’s overall performance for 
the year.
performance targets are agreed by the c ommittee at the start of 
the financial year; they are not published externally for reasons of 
commercial confidentiality.
Following a consultation with shareholders, the c ommittee 
proposes two changes to the executive directors’ annual bonus 
arrangements for the year ending 30 June 2011.
Firstly, one-third of any annual bonus will be satisfied by Kier Group 
plc shares which will be subject to clawback in certain circumstances. A 
similar approach is to be applied to the annual bonus arrangements for 
divisional directors. t he c ommittee believes that the part satisfaction 
of the annual bonus in Kier Group plc shares will further strengthen the 
alignment of interests of the executive directors, and of the divisional 
directors, with those of shareholders.
secondly, the c ommittee has decided to incorporate key measures 
of non-financial performance in relation to 20% of the annual bonus. 
For the year ending 30 June 2011, the c ommittee has determined 
targets based on health and safety and corporate responsibility. t he 
c ommittee also decided that 80% of the annual bonus will continue 
to be based on the Group’s pre-tax profit performance.
Retirement benefits
executive directors participate in the Kier Group pension scheme which 
has both a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan.
executive directors in the defined benefit section accrue pension 
up to the value of the lifetime allowance. Where the value of pension 
exceeds the lifetime allowance, future pension accrual ceases and a 
cash supplement of 20% of salary is paid.
o nly the basic salary of directors is pensionable. d etails of 
individual directors’ pension arrangements are shown on page 60.
in 2010, the c ommittee will review the existing retirement benefits 
of the executive directors in light of anticipated changes to approved 
pension provisions in the uK.
Long-term incentives
under the ltip , the executive directors are eligible to receive contingent 
awards of shares worth up to 100% of salary per annum. Awards 
granted in the year ended 30 June 2010 are subject to the Group 
achieving the following three-year adjusted eps growth targets:
 
•  100% of the award vests if eps increases by at least 15% per annum;
•  no awards will vest unless eps increases by at least 5% per annum, 
at which point 25% of the award will vest; and
•  for eps performance between these two levels, awards vest on a 
straight line basis.
t he above targets were selected by the committee to ensure that the 
Group would have to attain a substantial improvement in underlying 
financial performance before any awards could vest. eps is a key 
long-term performance measure used by the Group and the committee 
believes that it is easily understood. t he attainment of the performance 
targets is verified by the c ommittee and reviewed by the Group’s 
auditors.
t he lti p has now expired and, following consultation with 
shareholders, the c ommittee has decided to recommend the 
implementation of a new long-term incentive plan. shareholder 
approval for the new plan will be sought at the forthcoming annual 
general meeting and further details of the plan are set out in the 
circular to shareholders accompanying the notice of that meeting.
t he following principal changes are being proposed to the  
existing lti p:
•  the introduction of a tsr outperformance measure for 50% of the 
awards in order to provide an external assessment of long-term 
performance and increase alignment with shareholders’ interests; 
•  the remaining 50% of awards will continue to be based on eps 
performance, but measured on a cumulative basis to improve the 
robustness of performance target calibration. c umulative eps will 
be calculated by aggregating the eps in each of the three years of 
the performance period and then determining the equivalent constant 
annual growth rate (cAGr ); and
•  a requirement for executive directors to retain 50% of their net vested 
lti p awards until they have attained the individual shareholding 
requirement of one times salary (for further details, please see 
page 58).

Long-term incentives continued
in the year ending 30 June 2011, the c ommittee intends to make 
awards to executive directors under the new lti p of 100% of salary 
(subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions). participation 
will also be extended to include additional senior executives below the 
Board. previously, these executives were awarded cash-based long-term 
incentive awards and the committee believes this change will further 
strengthen alignment with shareholders’ interests.
t he rules of the new lti p will allow for individual awards sizes 
of up to 200% of salary. o ver time, this is intended to provide the 
c ommittee with sufficient flexibility to increase the emphasis of 
long-term performance on pay. However, the c ommittee does not 
intend granting lti p awards in excess of 100% of salary in 2010 and 
2011.
t he proposed performance vesting schedules for the new lti p 
are as follows:
each year the c ommittee will review both the eps and the tsr 
performance targets for new award cycles to ensure they continue 
to be appropriately stretching and achievable. At the end of each 
performance cycle, the c ommittee will undertake to ensure that any 
payout from the lti p reflects the long-term underlying performance 
of the Group.
Shareholding guidelines
t he committee’s policy encourages executive directors to build up a 
shareholding in the company equal to at least one year’s salary over 
a period of up to five years. in relation to the year ending 30 June 
2011 and following years, executive directors will be required to retain 
any annual bonus shares and 50% of vested lti p awards (net of tax) 
until this shareholding has been achieved.

tsr outperformance will be measured on a multiplicative basis relative 
to a revenue weighted index based on the Ftse AsX c onstruction 
index and the Ftse AsX support services index. For each award cycle, 
the revenue weightings will be fixed based on the Group’s prior year 
revenue mix and disclosed in the remuneration report after the award 
has been made. such a weighted index is intended to provide a better 
reflection of the Group’s overall business mix and therefore provide 
a more robust measure of management’s contribution to long-term 
value creation. For awards in respect of the year ending 30 June 2011, 
these weightings will be 75% on the c onstruction index and 25% on 
the support services index. For example, if c onstruction index tsr 
is 16% and support services index tsr is 12%, the Group’s tsr will 
need to be at least 15% ((75% x 16%) + (25% x 12%)) for this element 
of the lti p award to vest. 59 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010
Non-executive directors
t he remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board and reflects the anticipated time commitment to fulfil their 
duties. non-executive directors do not receive bonuses, long-term incentive awards, pension provision or compensation on termination of their 
appointment. As indicated above, the company has entered into letters of appointment with each of the non-executive directors. t he letters of 
appointment do not include any provisions for the payment of predetermined compensation in the case of wrongful termination by the company.

  t he ‘increase in accrued pension over the year’ is the difference between the total accrued benefit at the end of the year and the equivalent amount at the beginning of the year. 
t he figures presented are the same in absolute and inflation adjusted forms, since inflation was negative over the year to september 2009 (and therefore treated as zero for benefit 
revaluation purposes).

  t he figures in this column are the transfer values of the increases in the directors’ benefits during the year ended 30 June 2010.

  Mr J d odds reached his normal retirement date on 21 september 2005. Any increase in his accrued benefit after this date is due to the application of an actuarial late retirement factor 
to compensate him for late payment of his benefits. For the period after this date, he receives a pensionable allowance of 20% of salary.

  Mr M p sheffield received a cash supplement equal to 20% of the amount by which his salary exceeded the statutory earnings cap relating to his pension contributions.
t he above transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with uK legislation.
Members also have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions. n either these contributions nor resulting benefits are included 
in the above table.

Significant accounting policies
Kier Group plc (the c ompany) is a company domiciled in the united 
Kingdom (uK). t he consolidated financial statements of the company 
for the year ended 30 June 2010 comprise the c ompany and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the Group’s interest 
in jointly controlled entities.
t he consolidated financial statements were approved by the 
directors on 15 september 2010.
Statement of compliance
t he Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the directors in accordance with international Financial 
r eporting standards as adopted by the eu (iFrs ). t he c ompany 
has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in 
accordance with uK Generally Accepted Accounting practice (GAAp). 
t hese are presented on pages 99 to 101.
Basis of preparation
t he following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Group’s financial statements.
t he financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. t hey 
have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative 
financial instruments which are stated at their fair value, certain 
inventories that are valued at net realisable value and certain payables 
on extended terms which are stated at discounted cost.
t he following amendments to standards or interpretations are 
mandatory for the first time for the financial year ended 30 June 2010:
iFrs 2   ‘Amendments to share-based payments: vesting conditions 
and cancellations’
iFrs 3   ‘Business combinations (revised 2008)’
iFrs 7   ‘Amendments to financial instruments: disclosures – 
improving disclosures about financial instruments’
iFrs 8  ‘operating segments’
iAs 1   ‘presentation of financial statements (revised 2007)’
iAs 23   ‘Borrowing costs (revised 2007)’
iAs 27   ‘c onsolidated and separate financial statements (revised 
2008)’
iFric 12   ‘service concession arrangements’
iFric 14   ‘Amendments to the limit on defined benefit assets, 
minimum funding requirements and their interaction’
iFric 15   ‘Agreements for the construction of real estate’.
t he directors have considered the basis on which the Group’s operating 
segments are determined and disclosed following the adoption of iFrs 
8, and have concluded that the existing segments remain appropriate 
under the new standard.
t he adoption of the revised iAs 1 has resulted in the statement of 
changes in equity being contained in the primary statements rather 
than within the notes to the financial statements. in addition, the Group 
has elected to present a separate income statement and statement of 
comprehensive income. in accordance with the changes in terminology 
required by the standard the statement of recognised income and 
expense has been renamed the statement of comprehensive income.
t he adoption of iFric 12 on 1 July 2009 has resulted in a reduction 
in the investment in joint ventures and in retained earnings of £3.2m 
at this date. t he impact of the adoption of iFric 12 at 30 June 2008 
was also a reduction in the investment in joint ventures and in retained 
earnings of £3.2m, and as a consequence the income statement for 
the year ended 30 June 2009 has not been impacted. t he prior period 
balance sheet at 30 June 2009 has been restated accordingly.
iFric 12 addresses the accounting by private sector operators 
involved in the provision of public sector infrastructure assets and 
services where the infrastructure assets are not controlled by the 
operator. under this interpretation infrastructure assets are not 
recognised as property, plant and equipment of the operator but 
recognised as a financial asset as the operator has an unconditional 
right to receive a specified amount of cash or other financial asset 
over the life of the agreement. As a consequence of this treatment the 
operator now recognises investment income in respect of the financial 
asset on an effective interest basis. in addition, the timing of the profit 
recognition changes over the life of the contract with no change in the 
overall project cash flows arising therein.
o ther than detailed above, the adoption of the remaining 
amendments and interpretations has not resulted in any significant 
changes to the Group’s accounting policies and has not had a material 
impact on amounts reported for the current or prior years.
t he following new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial 
year ended 30 June 2010:
iFrs 2   ‘Amendments to share-based payments – group cash 
settled’
iFrs 9   ‘Financial instruments’
iAs 24   ‘r elated party disclosures (revised 2009)’
iAs 32   ‘Amendments to financial instruments – classification of 
rights issues’
iAs 39   ‘Amendments to financial instruments – recognition and 
measurement: eligible hedged items’
iAs 39   ‘Amendments to financial instruments – recognition and 
measurement: embedded derivatives’
iAs 39   ‘Amendments to reclassification of financial assets: effective 
date and transition’
iFric 9   ‘Amendments to reassessment of embedded derivatives’
iFric 18  ‘transfers of assets from customers’
iFric 19   ‘extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’.
t he directors have considered the impact of the other new standards 
and interpretations in future periods and no significant impact 
is expected. t he Group has chosen not to adopt any of the above 
standards and interpretations early.
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
t he consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements 
of the company and subsidiaries controlled by the company drawn up 
to 30 June 2010. control exists when the Group has direct or indirect 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so 
as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control transfers to the Group until the date that control ceases. t he 
purchase method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 69 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010

Significant accounting policies continued
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group 
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with 
third parties.
t he Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted 
for using the equity method. under this method the Group’s share of 
the profits less losses of jointly controlled entities is included in the 
consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is 
included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the 
share of losses exceeds the Group’s interest in the entity and there is 
no obligation to fund these losses the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued; future profits are 
not recognised until unrecognised losses are extinguished. interest in 
the entity is the carrying amount of the investment together with any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the net investment 
in the entity.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, 
that company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities and 
expenses it incurs and its share of the income. such joint arrangements 
are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
consideration over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly controlled 
entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment 
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed. negative goodwill 
is recognised in the income statement immediately. on disposal of a 
subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the attributable carrying amount 
of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 July 2004, being the 
date of transition to iFrs , has been retained at the previous uK 
GAAp amounts at 1 July 2004 subject to being tested for impairment. 
Goodwill written off to reserves under uK GAAp prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal.
o ther intangible assets which comprise contract rights are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to cost of sales in the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the relevant contract period.
Exceptional items
items which are significant by their size and nature to require separate 
disclosure are reported separately in the income statement in the 
column headed ‘exceptional items’.
Revenue and profit recognition
r evenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. it also includes the Group’s 
proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
r evenue and profit are recognised as follows:
(a) Construction contracts
r evenue arises from increases in valuations on contracts and is 
normally determined by external valuations. it is the gross value of 
work carried out for the period to the balance sheet date (including 
retentions) but excludes claims until they are actually certified.
t he general principles for profit recognition are as follows:
•  profits on short duration contracts (generally less than 12 months) 
are taken when the contract is complete;
•  profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of 
completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be estimated 
reliably;
•  provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing the 
contract to completion as soon as they become apparent; and
•  claims receivable are recognised as income when received or 
certified for payment except that, in preparing contract forecasts to 
completion, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims receivable 
may be included to mitigate foreseeable losses but only to the extent 
that there is reasonable certainty of recovery.
percentage completion is normally calculated by taking certified value 
to date as a percentage of estimated final value unless the internal 
value is materially different in which case the internal value is used.
(b) Support Services
r evenue and profit from services rendered is recognised when the 
service is provided.
(c) Private housing and land sales
r evenue from housing sales is recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable on legal completion, net of 
incentives. r evenue from land sales and land exchanges is recognised 
on the unconditional exchange of contracts. profit is recognised on a 
site-by-site basis by reference to the expected out-turn result from each 
site. t he principal estimation technique used by the Group in attributing 
profit on sites to a particular period is the preparation of forecasts on a 
site-by-site basis. t hese focus on revenues and costs to complete and 
enable an assessment to be made of the final out-turn on each site. 
consistent review procedures are in place in respect of site forecasting. 
provision is made for any losses foreseen in completing a site as soon 
as they become apparent. 70 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010

Significant accounting policies continued
(d) Property development
r evenue in respect of property developments is taken on unconditional 
exchange of contracts on disposal of finished developments. profit 
taken is subject to any amounts necessary to cover residual 
commitments relating to development performance. provision is made 
for any losses foreseen in completing a development as soon as they 
become apparent.
Where developments are sold in advance of construction being 
completed, revenue and profit are recognised from the point of 
sale and as the significant outstanding acts of construction and 
development are completed. if a development is sold in advance of 
the commencement of construction, no revenue or profit is recognised 
at the point of sale. r evenue and profit are recognised in line with 
the progress on construction based on the percentage of completion 
of the construction and development works. if a development is sold 
during construction but prior to completion, revenue and profit may be 
recognised at the time of sale in line with percentage completion of 
construction and development works at the time of sale and thereafter 
in line with the percentage of completion of the construction and 
development works.
if a development is sold after construction and development works 
are completed revenue and profit are recognised in full at the point 
of sale.
(e) PFI service concession agreements
r evenue relating to construction or upgrade services under a service 
concession arrangement is recognised based on the stage of completion 
of the work performed, consistent with the Group’s accounting policy 
on recognising revenue on construction contracts (see (a) above). 
operation or service revenue is recognised in the period in which the 
services were provided by the Group. When the Group provides more 
than one service in a service concession agreement, the consideration 
received is allocated by reference to the relative fair values of the 
services delivered.
Pre-contract costs
costs associated with bidding for contracts are written off as incurred 
(pre-contract costs). When it is probable that a contract will be awarded, 
usually when the Group has secured preferred bidder status, costs 
incurred from that date to the date of financial close are carried forward 
in the balance sheet as other receivables.
When financial close is achieved on private Finance initiative (pFi) 
or public private partnership (ppp) contracts, costs are recovered 
from the special purpose vehicle and pre-contract costs within this 
recovery that were not previously capitalised are credited to the income 
statement, except to the extent that the Group retains a share in the 
special purpose vehicle. t he amount not credited is deferred and 
recognised over the life of the construction contract to which the 
costs relate.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
depreciation is based on historical or deemed cost, less the estimated 
residual value, and the estimated economic lives of the assets 
concerned. Freehold land is not depreciated. other tangible assets 
are depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their 
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows:
Freehold buildings 25-50 years
l easehold buildings and improvements period of lease
plant, equipment and vehicles 3-12 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of 
the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.
Leases
operating lease rental charges are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Employee benefits
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group, 
amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. t he charge to the income statement reflects the 
current and past service costs of such obligations, and the interest 
cost on scheme liabilities less the expected return on plan assets.
t he retirement benefit obligation represents the difference between 
the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme 
liabilities. it is determined biannually by independent actuaries and 
recognised in full in the balance sheet. differences between the actual 
and expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses 
arising on scheme liabilities during the year, together with differences 
arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised in full directly 
in reserves via the statement of comprehensive income in the year.
t he recognised pension asset is limited to the present value of 
any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan expected at the balance sheet date.
t he Group’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance 
with the rules of the schemes and the recommendation of the actuary.
(b) Share-based payments
share-based payments granted but not vested, are valued at the fair 
value of the shares at the date of grant. t his affects the sharesave 
and lti p schemes. t he fair value of these schemes at date of award 
is calculated using the Black-scholes model.
t he cost to the Group of awards to employees under the lti p scheme 
is spread on a straight-line basis over the relevant performance criteria 
period. t he scheme awards to senior employees a number of shares 
which will vest after three years if particular criteria are met. t he 
Group has the option to make the awards either as shares or as a 
combination of shares and cash, based on the share price prevailing 
when the shares vest. t he cost of the share-based payment element 
of the scheme is based on the fair value of the shares at the date 
the options are granted, and the cost of the cash-based payment 
element is based on the market value of the share options at the 
balance sheet date.
shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the Group’s 
share schemes are deducted from retained earnings. n o gain or loss 
is recognised within the income statement on the market value of 
these shares compared to the original cost.

equivalent to the initial provision and depreciated on a coal extraction 
basis over the life of the asset. Where there is a subsequent change 
in the estimate of restoration costs or discount rate, the present value 
of the change is recognised in the cost of the tangible asset with a 
corresponding change to the restoration provision. t he resulting impact 
on the unwinding of the discount is recognised in the year of change.
Inventories
inventories and work in progress, including land held for and in 
the course of development, are valued at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. c ost comprises direct materials and, where 
appropriate, labour and production overheads which have been incurred 
in bringing the inventories and work in progress to their present location 
and condition. c ost in certain circumstances also includes notional 
interest as explained in the accounting policy for finance income and 
costs. net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution.
c onstruction work in progress is included within inventories in the 
balance sheet. it is measured at cost plus profit less losses recognised 
to date less progress billings. if payments received from customers 
exceed the income recognised, the difference is included within trade 
and other payables in the balance sheet.
l and inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised; 
generally after exchange of unconditional contracts.
property inventory, which represents all development land and work 
in progress, is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing 
and disposing of the development less any amounts received or 
receivable as progress payments or part disposals. Where a property 
is being developed, cost includes cost of acquisition and development 
to date, including directly attributable fees, expenses and finance 
charges net of rental or other income attributable to the development. 
Where development property is not being actively developed, net rental 
income and finance costs are taken to the income statement.
Finance lease receivables
l eases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. When 
assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the 
minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable. t he difference 
between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is 
recognised as unearned finance income. l ease income is recognised 
over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax 
which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.

Significant accounting policies continued
Finance income and costs
interest receivable and payable on bank deposits is credited or charged 
to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs qualifying 
assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to the income 
statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled entities 
relating to the construction of assets in pFi and ppp projects are 
capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
n otional interest payable, representing the unwinding of the 
discount on long-term liabilities, is charged to finance costs.
Taxation
income tax comprises current and deferred tax. income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also recognised 
in equity.
current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
d eferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. t he amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. d eferred tax assets are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Foreign currencies
t ransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
exchange rates in effect when they take place. r esulting foreign currency 
denominated assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. exchange differences arising from 
foreign currency transactions are reflected in the income statement.
t he assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are 
translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
trading profits or losses are translated at average rates prevailing 
during the accounting period. differences on exchange arising from the 
retranslation of net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings 
at the year-end rates are recognised in the translation reserve. All 
other translation differences are reflected in the income statement.
Mining assets
opencast expenditure incurred prior to the commencement of operating 
opencast sites is capitalised and the cost less the residual value is 
depreciated over the coaling life of the site on a coal extraction basis. 
t he total cost of restoration is recognised as a provision as soon as 
the mine becomes operational. t he amount provided represents the 
present value of the anticipated costs. costs are charged against the 
provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included 
within interest costs. A tangible asset is created for an amount  72 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010

Significant accounting policies continued
Share capital
t he ordinary share capital of the company is recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Provisions
provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and where it is 
probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation and 
the amount can be reliably estimated.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. t he principal financial assets and 
liabilities of the Group are as follows:
(a) Trade receivables and trade payables
Given the varied activities of the Group it is not practicable to identify a 
common operating cycle. t he Group has therefore allocated receivables 
and payables due within 12 months of the balance sheet date to current 
with the remainder included in non-current.
trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their initial 
value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts.
trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are 
stated at their nominal value. trade payables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and recorded 
at their fair value.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash at 
bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three 
months or less, net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included 
within financial liabilities in current liabilities in the balance sheet.
(c) Bank and other borrowings
interest-bearing bank and other loans are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of 
the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise.
(d) PFI assets
under the terms of a pFi or similar project, where the risks and rewards of 
ownership remain largely with the purchaser of the associated services, 
the Group’s interest in the asset is classified as a financial asset and 
included at its amortised cost within investment in joint ventures.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the 
contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured in future periods 
at their fair value. t he method of recognising the resulting change in 
fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument and whether the hedging relationship is effective.
t he effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives 
is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in 
equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the 
hedged items will affect profit or loss. t he fair value of interest rate 
derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or 
pay to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
if the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. t he cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs.
t he Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge 
against transactional foreign currency exposures. in cases where these 
derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is applied as 
described above. Where hedge accounting is not applied, changes in 
fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement. Fair 
values are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Accounting estimates and judgements
t he key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year, relate to revenue and profit 
recognition and the valuation of defined pension scheme assets and 
liabilities.
Revenue and profit recognition
details on the estimation techniques used for revenue and profit 
recognition in respect of private housing and land sales, property 
development and construction contracts are given on pages 69 and 70.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
in determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets 
and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. t he key 
assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors 
outside the control of the Group:
•  expected return on plan assets
•  inflation rate
•  Mortality
•  discount rate
•  salary and pension increases
details of the assumptions used are included in note 8.

Segmental reporting
t he Group comprises four divisions: c onstruction, support services, partnership Homes and developments and it is on this basis that the 
Group reports its segmental information.
segment information is based on the information provided to the chief executive who is the chief operating decision maker. t he segments 
are strategic business units with separate management and have different core customers and offer different services. t he segments are 
discussed in the chief executive’s review on pages 6 to 34.
t he accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies 
on pages 68 to 72. t he Group evaluates segment information on the basis of profit or loss from operations before interest and income tax 
expense. t he segment results that are reported to the chief executive include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that 
can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

t he pension credits arose:
in the current year a gain of £16.0m arose in the pension scheme in which the employees of Kier sheffield llp participate. t his arose as a 
consequence of changes announced in the budget in June 2010 requiring public sector pension schemes to use the c onsumer prices index 
(cpi ) in place of the r etail prices index (rpi ) to determine future pension increases.
during the prior year a credit of £24.3m arose in the Kier Group pension scheme as a consequence of the Board’s decision to restrict pensionable 
salary increases to the lower of actual pay increases and the annual rate of increase in rpi . 76 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010

Exceptional items continued
on 22 september 2009 the Group was fined £17.9m in respect of t he office of Fair trading’s investigation into cover pricing in the construction 
industry. t he Group has lodged an appeal with the competition Appeals tribunal (cAt ) and this was heard in June 2010. it is not expected that 
the cAt will conclude its findings and make a decision until the end of the calendar year. An exceptional provision has been made to reflect the 
fine as it currently stands.
during the prior year the carrying value of land and work in progress in partnership Homes and developments was written down to net realisable 
value as a result of a deterioration in market conditions.
t he charges in the prior year in respect of restructuring consist principally of the costs arising from the announcement of closures of four of the 
six offices within the partnership Homes division and the costs associated with staff redundancies.

Retirement benefit obligations
t he Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme
t his is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan. t he assets of the scheme are held under 
trust separately from those of the Group; the trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent 
professional investment managers.
t he defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002; existing members continue to accrue benefits for 
future service.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the trustees’ independent actuaries as at 1 July 2007 using the projected unit method. 
t he market value of the scheme’s assets at that date were £508.9m which represented approximately 87% of the benefits that had accrued 
to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries. t he contributions paid during the year were £32.5m (2009: £20.2m) 
which include special contributions of £21.2m (2009: £8.0m) to fund the past service deficit.
An actuarial valuation is currently being undertaken by the trustees’ independent actuaries as at 1 April 2010 using the projected unit method. 
it is not expected that the results of the valuation will be finalised until towards the end of the new financial year.
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2007 valuation date until the 2010 
valuation is finalised when a revised allowance will be included. t he Group expects to pay contributions for future service of £11.8m being 
20.3% of pensionable pay plus £8.0m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2011.
t he pension protection Fund (ppF) levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined 
contribution section of the Kier Group pension scheme. t he Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance 
with the rates specified in their contracts of employment. t he contributions paid during the year and the pension charge, amounted to £6.0m 
(2009: £5.8m).
Kier Sheffield LLP
t he Group participates in this defined benefit scheme through its subsidiary Kier sheffield llp which has participated as an admitted body in 
the south Yorkshire pension Fund since 1 April 2003. As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with 
assets and ongoing past service liabilities of £65.0m.
t he scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from sheffield council’s employment to Kier sheffield llp upon the start of the contract. 
new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group pension scheme. Kier sheffield llp is required to 
pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier sheffield llp ’s pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary 
using the projected unit method. t he contributions paid during the year were £1.1m (2009: £1.1m). Going forward Kier sheffield llp expects 
to pay contributions for future service at the rate of 11.5% of pensionable pay which the fund’s actuary has determined is sufficient to meet 
ongoing benefits.
Other schemes
contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme, and in respect of employees 
who are members of a local government pension scheme. t he pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid during 
the year. 78 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010

t he assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted. if the discount rate were to increase by 0.1% the Kier Group

in december 2009 the Group agreed to make a special cash contribution to the Kier Group pension scheme amounting to £13.2m which was 
settled through a transfer of residential land at market value as determined by dt Z an independent firm of chartered surveyors. t his amount 
has been included as a contribution received by the scheme.
t he past service credit in the current year arose in the Kier sheffield llp pension scheme due to changes announced in the budget in June 
2010 to use the cpi in place of the rpi to determine pension increases. t his has been accounted for as a change in benefits and recognised 
in the income statement as an exceptional item. t he potential effect of the change in the rp i to cp i on the Kier Group pension scheme is yet 
to be determined.
t he credit on the benefit curtailment in the prior year arose in the Kier Group pension scheme as a consequence of the Board’s decision to 
restrict pensionable salary increases to the lower of actual pay increases and the annual rate of increase in rpi . t he previous valuations were 
based on salaries increasing at 1.5% above the rate of increase in rpi .

2011.t he first reduction from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010 and will be effective from 1 April 2011.t his will reduce 
the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. if the rate change from 28% to 27% had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2010 it would 
have had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset of £21.5m (Group £21.2m, joint ventures £0.3m) held at this date by £1.4m, with 
£1.0m being credited to the income statement and £2.4m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
it has not been possible to quantify the full-anticipated effect of the announced further 3% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the 
Group’s future current tax charge and reduce the deferred tax assets accordingly.
d) Tax losses
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused income tax losses of £2.5m (2009: £12.9m) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £nil (2009: £10.0m) of income losses. no deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset. under present 
tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Financial instruments
Capital risk management
t he Group and company manage their capital to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure 
to reduce the cost of capital. t he capital structure of the Group and company comprises: equity attributable to equity holders of Kier Group plc, 
consisting of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, and cash, 
cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 19.
t he Group and company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issue of new shares and 
issuing or repaying borrowings. t he Group’s policy is to carry no significant debt, other than the non-recourse debt of joint ventures engaged in 
commercial property and pFi projects.
t he Group’s overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. in the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily 
to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. t he overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse 
effects on financial performance and net assets.
t he Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board. 
treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions. derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to 
fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk
credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued 
by the major ratings agencies. c ounterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are 
within predetermined limits. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
t rade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management 
following a review of individual receivable accounts. t here is no Group-wide rate of provision, and provision made for debts that are overdue is 
based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. r eceivables are written off against the bad debt provision when 
management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.

which £40.2m (2009: £32.2m) had been received by the end of August 2010. t here are no indications as at 30 June 2010 that the debtors 
will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and 
unprovided. t he proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2010 that were overdue for payment was 21% (2009: 20%). credit terms vary across 
the Group; the average age of trade receivables was as follows:
construction 50 days (2009: 41 days)
support services 29 days (2009: 26 days)
overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
t he Group has hedged part of its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of £30.3m of loan notes for ten years from 
February 2003, which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p.a. t he balance of the Group’s borrowings are to finance short-term working 
capital requirements. such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to li Bor .
in addition, a number of the Group’s pFi and developments joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk
t he Group operates primarily within the uK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk
t he Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to 
carry significant net debt over the medium term. t he Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in 
the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities. t he quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly 
and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.

Fuel price forward contracts       0.2 0.1 0.3
Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as an ineffective cash flow hedge. t he fair value of these contracts have been determined 
based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on observable market data.
in addition to the above, a number of the Group’s pFi joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest 
rate risk. interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 
years and are without recourse to the Group. At 30 June 2010 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which 
interest rate derivatives are held is £178.5m. t he Group’s share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 
2010 based on quoted prices in active markets, amounted to £15.0m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of £4.2m, have met 
the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity. 94 Kier Group plc Annu Al r epo rt And Accounts 2010

t he long-term borrowings represent a £17.0m uK sterling loan and a £13.4m us dollar loan, net of £0.1m of capitalised finance costs, from 
the private placement of loan notes made in February 2003. t he loans are repayable in one payment in February 2013. t he uK sterling loan 
is at a fixed interest rate of 6.4% for the term of the loan. t he Group has entered into interest payment and repayment swaps for the us dollar 
loan, which give an effective 6.4% fixed interest rate for the term of the loan.

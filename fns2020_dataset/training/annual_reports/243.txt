Chairman’s Statement
 
It is my pleasure to announce our first set of results as  
a publicly traded company. For Action Hotels 2013 was 
a transformational year with the opening of our sixth 
hotel, our first hotel partnering with Intercontinental 
Hotels Group, and the successful admission of our 
shares to trading on the London Stock Exchange AIM 
market in December 2013. During the IPO process we 
were very pleased to raise $50m before costs and secure 
a number of new institutional shareholders. 03 Annual Report & Accounts 2013  Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements

OPERATOR ACTION HOTELS
Post construction, we work alongside our hotel operators  
to manage the hotels on our behalf and to maximise 
performance under long term management agreements. 
We pay our operators a fee based on the revenue and 
profitability of the hotel. 06 Action Hotels plc

long-term strategic relationships with  
selected partners to deliver enhanced 
stakeholder returns by continuing to expand

We have strong relationships with leading 
global hotel brands in the economy  
and midscale sector and, due to our 
independence, we are able to objectively 
determine the most appropriate brand  
for each development opportunity.

Hotel pipeline Finance Director’s Review
Our five operational hotels performed well during 
the financial year. We saw improvement in our 
key performance metrics: occupancy, revenue, 
RevPAR and ADR. Our sixth hotel opened in

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1. General information
Action Hotels plc (“the Company”) is a public company limited by 
shares and incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. The address of the registered office is 1st Floor, 
17 Bond Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3NP, Channel Islands.  
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries  
(“the Group”) are owning, developing and operating hotels in  
the Middle East. The Group’s principal administrative subsidiary, 
Action Hotels Limited, is domiciled in Dubai International Financial 
Centre which is its principal place of business.
2. Significant accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and IFRIC 
interpretations. The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the 
revaluation of certain classes of property, plant and equipment. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process  
of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving  
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
A presentational currency of US Dollars has been used on the 
basis that the functional currency in the majority of jurisdictions  
in which the Group operates and which represent its primary 
economic environment are either pegged to the US Dollar, or 
pegged to a basket of currencies, which include the US Dollar.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis. The Directors have made this assessment after 
consideration of the Group’s budgeted cash flows and related 
assumptions, including appropriate stress testing thereof,  
key risks and uncertainties and debt maturity review and in 
accordance with the Going Concern and Liquidity Guidance  
for Directors of UK Companies 2009 published by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Further information on the Group’s business 
activities, cash flows, liquidity and performance are set out in the 
Directors’ report and Strategic report and its objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital and financial risks are 
detailed in note 29.
In accordance with Article 105(11) of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991, the parent company is not required to present separate 
financial statements as consolidated statements have 
been presented.
2.2 Basis of Consolidation
Acquisition of businesses under common control
Action Hotels plc was incorporated in Jersey on 7 May 2013 and 
took control of the Action Hotels business on 9 December 2013 
through the following common control transactions with its 
shareholder (“the Transaction”). The Company issued 100 million 
shares to its shareholder in return for 100% of the beneficial 
interest in and voting control over the issued share capital of 
Action Hotels Limited, a company incorporated in Dubai 
International Financial Centre. Action Hotels Limited in turn 
acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Action Hotels 
Company LLC, a company incorporated in Kuwait, through  
a share for share exchange. 
Action Hotels plc was subsequently admitted to trading on the 
AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and issued a further 
47.6 million shares on 23 December 2013. 
Pursuant to the Transaction, Action Hotels Company LLC, which 
had previously been the parent company of the Group became  
a subsidiary of Action Hotels plc and the existing shareholder  
of Action Hotels Company LLC became the shareholder in  
Action Hotels plc. Accordingly, the financial statements have been 
prepared using merger accounting principles. The comparative 
information prior to the date of Transaction presented in these 
financial statements therefore represents the consolidated results 
of the group under its previous parent company. The following 
accounting treatment has been applied to account for 
the Transaction:
• the consolidated assets and liabilities of Action Hotels 
Company LLC and its subsidiaries (“the Subsidiary group”) 
were recognised and measured at the pre-Transaction carrying 
amounts, without restatement to fair value;
• the retained earnings and other equity balances recognised  
in the consolidated statement of financial position reflect the 
consolidated retained earnings and other equity balances of 
the Subsidiary group adjusted to reflect the share capital and 
share premium of the Company at the time of the Transaction. 
• the comparative balances as at 31 December 2012 and the 
results for 2012 and the period from 1 January 2013 to the 
date of the Transaction, are those of the Subsidiary group. 
The contribution of the business and assets of the ibis Salmiya 
hotel to Action Hotels Company LLC on 1 April 2013 has also 
been accounted for under merger accounting principles as it  
was previously under common control.
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Group 
(its subsidiaries). The Group controls an entity when the group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its power 
over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group under a business 
combination. They are deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases. Uniform accounting policies have been adopted across 
the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation. The full list of 
subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements  
is included in note 34.
Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business 
combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of 
a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred by the 
Group, the liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners  
of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values  
at the acquisition date. 
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
on an acquisition by acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised 
amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition 
date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest 
in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; 
any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are 
recognised in profit or loss. 32 Action Hotels plc
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013
2. Significant accounting policies continued
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date  
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the  
fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as 
goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling 
interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less 
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in 
the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised 
directly in the consolidated income statement.
Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that 
qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted 
retrospectively with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. 
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from 
additional information obtained during the measurement period 
(which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about 
facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss  
or as a charge in other comprehensive income. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured,  
and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
2.3 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities carried on the consolidated 
statement of financial position include: cash on hand and at banks; 
accounts receivable; due from/to related parties; due to banks; notes 
payable; accounts payable; loans and loans due to related parties.
Financial instruments are classified as liabilities or equity in 
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Loans, receivables and amounts due from related parties
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, 
do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as 
either fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale. Such 
assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses 
are recognised in the income statement when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through  
the amortisation process. 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount less any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful 
debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer 
probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Accounts payable
Accounts payable include trade and other payables. Trade 
payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have 
been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Accounts payable are classified as current 
liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal 
operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented 
as non-current liabilities.
Cash and bank balances
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash 
at bank and in hand and short–term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the 
consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts.
Borrowings
Borrowings include bank loans, notes payable and amounts due to 
related parties. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net 
of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated 
at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of 
transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of income over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs directly attributed to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until 
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific 
borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is 
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which they are incurred.
2.4 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value 
after providing allowances for any obsolete or slow-moving items. 
Cost is determined on a weighted average basis. 
2.5 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised as the cost of acquiring,  
or the fair value at the time of contribution by shareholders of, 
interests in trading properties held under operating leases. 
Intangible assets are subsequently recognised at cost less 
accumulated amortisation, with amortisation charged on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease period  
or the economic useful life of the trading property.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its 
purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the 
asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. 
Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred, except where these 
relate to purchase of other items of property, plant and equipment, 
which are capitalised when put into operation.
Expenditures incurred after the property, plant and equipment 
have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance 
and overhaul costs, are normally charged to income in the period 
in which the costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly 
demonstrated that the expenditures have resulted in an increase in 
the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use 
of an item of property, plant and equipment beyond its originally 
assessed standard of performance, the expenditures are 
capitalised as an additional cost of property, plant and equipment.
Hotels in operation or under construction are revalued to fair value 
at the end of each reporting period. Gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of each property are recognised in the 
statement of total comprehensive income and the revaluation 
reserve. Any deficit on revaluation, if temporary, is recognised in 
the statement of total comprehensive income and the revaluation 
reserve. If a deficit below original cost arises and is deemed to be 
permanent it is recognised in the statement of income.
Undeveloped land sites are stated at cost less impairment losses. 33 Annual Report & Accounts 2013  Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Financial statements
When assets are sold or retired, their cost and accumulated 
depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or 
loss resulting from their disposal is included in the consolidated 
statement of income.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of operational assets.
Depreciation percentage
Land Nil
Buildings 2%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10-15%
Motor vehicles 33%
The useful life and depreciation method are reviewed periodically 
to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are 
consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from 
items of property, plant and equipment.
2.7 Impairment of assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. Each property and undeveloped land site is 
treated as a separate cash-generating unit.
Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the  
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit)  
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated statement of income, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated statement of income, unless the relevant asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase in other 
comprehensive income.
2.8 Provision for end of service indemnity
Provision is made for amounts payable to employees under the 
relevant legislation and employee contracts. This liability, which is 
unfunded, represents the amount payable to each employee as  
a result of involuntary termination on the date of the respective 
statement of financial position and approximates the present value 
of the final obligation.
2.9 Partners’ current account
The Partners’ current account principally represents the net 
amount invested in the Group in the form of loans by the principal 
shareholder in excess of capital contributions prior to 30 June 
2013. It was also used as a current account for expenses incurred 
by the Partners on behalf of the Group and vice versa. It was 
converted into equity on 30 June 2013.
2.10 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course 
of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of returns, rebates 
and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can 
be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each 
of the Group’s activities as described below. The amount of 
revenue is not considered to be reliably measurable until all 
contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. The Group 
bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration 
the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of 
each arrangement.
Owned and leased hotels
Revenue is primarily derived from hotel operations, including the 
rental of rooms, food and beverage sales and other services from 
owned and leased hotels operated under the Group’s brand 
names. Revenue is recognised when rooms are occupied, food 
and beverages are sold and services are performed.
Customer loyalty programmes
The Group’s hotels participate in the Le Club Accor hotels and 
IHG Rewards customer loyalty programmes to provide customers 
with incentives to buy room nights. These customer loyalty 
programmes are owned and operated by Accor/IHG respectively 
and, therefore, the entity retains no obligations in respect of the 
award credits other than to pay the programme operator for the 
granted award credits. The customers are entitled to utilise the 
awards as soon as they are granted.
The Group purchases these award credits and issues these to its 
customers in order to enhance its customer relationships rather 
than to earn a margin from the sale of these award credits. The 
Group concluded that it is acting as principal in this transaction 
and, in substance, is earning revenue from supplying these 
awards to its customer. The Group measures these revenues at 
fair value and recognises these gross from the costs of 
participating in the programme.
Rent
Rental income is recognised, when earned, on a time 
apportionment basis.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-apportionment basis 
using the effective interest method.
Other revenue and expenses
Other revenue and expenses are recognised on the accrual basis.
2.11 Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA has been defined as operating profit before 
depreciation, amortisation and restructuring and listing costs. It 
does not include impairment charges, gains and losses arising 
from the disposal of property, plant and equipment or foreign 
exchange gains or losses.
2.12 Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before restructuring and listing costs, 
finance income and finance costs. 34 Action Hotels plc
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013
2. Significant accounting policies continued
2.13 Taxation
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
income because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of asset and liabilities in 
the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
difference can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interest in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable and sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the statement of income, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive 
income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other 
comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
2.14 Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others 
providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the 
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value is determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments and is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity 
instruments that will eventually vest. At each statement of position 
date the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market 
based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. 
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties 
other than employees are measured at the fair value of goods  
or services received, except where that fair value cannot be 
estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair 
value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the 
entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.
2.15 Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current 
best estimate. Where the effect of the time value of money is 
material, the amount of a provision is the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
2.16 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for 
their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets 
during the period of construction, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific 
borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is 
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in consolidated statement 
of income in the period in which they are incurred.
2.17 Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income  
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, except 
where another more systematic basis is more representative of  
the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset 
are consumed. 
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into 
operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.  
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction  
of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in 
which economic benefit from the leased asset are consumed.
Where a lease includes terms such that the Group has the option 
to extend the lease, the lease term is determined as the shortest 
period up to where management are reasonably certain the 
options will be exercised.
2.18 Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, 
foreign currency transactions are translated into the entities 
functional currency at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of 
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currency at the end of reporting periods are retranslated  
at rates of exchange prevailing on that date. Non-monetary items 
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value 
was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
35 Annual Report & Accounts 2013  Financial statements
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or 
loss for the period. Translation differences on non-monetary items such as equity investments which are classified as investments at fair 
value through the statement of income are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the foreign controlled entities are 
translated into US Dollars at rates of exchange prevailing at the end of reporting period. The results of the controlled entities are 
translated into US Dollars at rates approximating the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income. Such translation 
differences are recognised in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.
2.19 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed in the consolidated financial statements except when the possibility of an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits 
is probable.
2.20 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) for the year by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) for the year by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the 
conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
2.21 Dividends
Dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are declared.
2.22 Standards and interpretations issued but not effective
The following relevant new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the 
financial year beginning on 1 January 2013, as adopted by the European Union, and have not been early adopted:
Standard Key requirements
Effective date as 
adopted by the EU
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial 
statements’ and corresponding 
amendment to IAS 27, 
‘Consolidated and separate 
financial statements’
IFRS 10 replaces guidance in IAS 27 regarding the principles for the 
presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an 
entity controls one or more other entities. It builds on existing principles by 
identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an 
entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the 
parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the 
determination of control where this is difficult to assess.
1 January 2014
IFRS 11, ‘Joint Arrangements’ IFRS 11 is a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the 
rights and obligations of the arrangement rather than its legal form. There are 
two types of joint arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Proportional 
consolidation of joint ventures is no longer allowed.
1 January 2014
Amendment to IAS 28, 
‘Associates and joint ventures’
IAS 28 includes the requirements for joint ventures, as well as associates, to be 
equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11.
1 January 2014
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests 
in other entities’
Provides disclosure requirements for IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 28 (Associates) 
and introduces disclosure requirements for unconsolidated structured entities.
1 January 2014
Amendment to IAS 32, 
Offsetting Financial Assets and

2.23 New and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group
The following relevant new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 January 2013, but had no significant impact on the Group:
Standard Key requirements
Effective date as 
adopted by the EU
Amendment to IAS 1, 
‘Presentation of financial 
statements’ – presentation of 
other items regarding other 
comprehensive income
The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities 
to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis 
of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently 
(reclassification adjustments). The amendments do not address which items are 
presented in OCI.
1 July 2012
Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial 
statement presentation 
regarding comparatives’
The amendment clarifies the difference between voluntary additional 
comparative information and the minimum required comparative information. 
1 January 2013
Amendment to IAS 16, 
‘Property, plant and equipment’
The amendment clarifies that spare parts and servicing equipment are classified 
as property, plant and equipment rather than inventory when they meet the 
definition of property, plant and equipment.
1 January 2013
Amendment to IAS 32, 
‘Financial instruments: 
Presentation
The amendment clarifies the treatment of corporation tax relating to 
distributions and transaction costs such that corporation tax related to 
distributions is recognised in the income statement and the corporation tax 
related to the costs of equity transactions is recognised in equity.
1 January 2013
Amendment to IAS 34, ‘Interim 
financial reporting’
The amendment clarifies the disclosure requirements for segment assets and 
liabilities in interim financial statements to bring it in line with the requirements of 
IFRS 8.
1 January 2013
Amendment to IFRS 7, 
‘Financial Instruments: 
Offsetting Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities’
The amendments require entities to disclose information about the rights of 
offset and related arrangements for financial instruments under an enforceable 
master netting agreement or similar agreement.
1 January 2013
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement
The Group has applied IFRS 13 for the first time in the current period. IFRS 13 provides single source guidance for fair value 
measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements. It applies to financial instruments items and non-financial instrument 
items for which other IFRSs permit or require fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements, except for 
share-based payments within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based payments, leasing transactions within the scope of IAS 17 Leases and 
measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value (e.g. net realisable value for the purpose of measuring 
inventories or value in use for impairment assessment purposes).
IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the 
principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement price under current market conditions. Fair value under IFRS 13 is an exit 
price regardless of whether that price is observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
IFRS 13 requires prospective application from 1 January 2013. Comparatives information provided for periods before the initial application 
of the Standard is not required. The Group has not made any new disclosures required by IFRS 13 for the 2012 comparative period. 
Other than the additional disclosures, the application of IFRS 13 has not had any material impact on the amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The Group makes judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The preparation of consolidated Historical Financial 
Information in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
consolidated financial information and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from 
the estimates.
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies which are described in note 2, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
(i) Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. The determination of whether the revenue recognition criteria as specified under IAS 18 are met requires judgement.
(ii) Control over voting shares not owned and assets held under trust
The determination of ability to exercise control over Action Hotels Limited, whose voting shares are not owned by the Company, and the 
Australian operations which are held under trust structures requires judgement as the Group’s control is reliant on options to purchase 
the relevant shares and powers of attorney in relation to the shares and voting rights. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
37 Annual Report & Accounts 2013  Financial statements
(iii) Recognition of appropriate lease accounting treatments
The determination of whether any of the Group’s leases constitute a finance lease under IAS 17 requires judgement. The directors’ 
have concluded that none of the Group’s leases should be recognised as a finance lease. Accordingly, all leases are presented as 
operating leases.
Estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below:
(i) Valuation of hotels in operation or under construction:
The Group carries its hotels in operation or under construction at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income. The Group engaged independent valuation specialists to assist the Directors to determine the fair value as at 
each reporting date.
There is a lack of comparable transaction data because of the nature and location of the properties. The valuers used a valuation 
technique based on a discounted cash flow model. The determined fair value of the completed properties is most sensitive to the 
estimated discount rate as well as the long-term projected future hotel occupancy and room rates. These in turn are dependent on key 
operating assumptions such as obtaining appropriate licences for new hotels.
For hotels under construction the fair value is also sensitive to the estimated costs to complete and an adjustment for a hypothetical 
‘developer’s profit’ based on the level of development risk remaining in the project.
(ii) Impairment of undeveloped land sites
Undeveloped land sites are held at cost less impairment provisions. Impairment reviews have been performed based on an assessment 
of the present values of future cash flows from developing and operating hotels. The Group engaged independent valuation specialists 
to assist in these reviews. The estimated future cash flows and discount rates are subject to inherent uncertainty and are in some cases 
reliant on the envisaged planning permission being granted.
(iii) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
Hotel properties are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives. Land is assumed to have an infinite life and buildings are 
estimated to have useful economic lives of 50 years, with no residual values. The allocation of revaluation changes to land or buildings 
affects the depreciation charge and the Group generally attributes valuation changes to the land element of the property.
(iv) Provision for deferred tax
Deferred tax arises on the timing differences between the carrying value of the Group’s hotel properties and their tax bases. In some 
jurisdictions the timing differences related to land are not taxable. The Group generally attributes increases in property valuations to the 
land element of the property.

The loss/(2012:gain) on foreign exchange in the year relates primarily to a loan between the Company and one of its subsidiaries which is 
denominated in Australian Dollars. The loss/(2012:gain) arose as a result of significant movements in the exchange rate with the US dollar.
7. Business and geographical segments
The Board of Directors of the Group is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments 
based on the information reviewed by the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance of the Group.
The Group’s reportable segments are the operational hotels in the Middle East and in Australia, hotels under construction and 
undeveloped land sites which are managed and reported to the Board as separate distinct business units.
The Group’s operating segments are its individual hotels. These have been aggregated into two reportable segments, as each operating 
segment within these regions has similar economic characteristics.
Central management costs represent the head office and management costs incurred at the Group level, which have not been 
subsequently allocated to any particular operating segment.
Each of the geographical segments derives its revenue from the ownership and management of hotel operations.

Tax expense for the year, excluding restructuring 89 (15)
Deferred tax arising in Kuwait on restructuring 1,980 –
2,069 (15)
A deferred tax charge of $1,980k arose in Kuwait in respect of the contribution of the Salmiya lease intangible asset into the Group on 
1 April 2013. The Kuwaiti entities became liable to taxation after the restructuring which resulted in ownership of the entities passing to 
entities registered outside of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, also known as the Gulf Cooperation Council 
(‘GCC’).
The tax charge arising in Australia of $89k consists of a current income tax charge of $98k (2012: $nil) being offset by a deferred tax 
credit of $9k (2012: $15k). This deferred tax credit arose in respect of timing differences arising from long term employee benefits 
including retirement benefits have been recognised in the income statement. There are no other significant differences between 
accounting profits and taxable profits.
No current income tax charge has been suffered in Jordan (2012: $nil). In 2013 and 2012 the Group benefitted from a 25% exemption 
from corporate income tax in respect of taxable profits arising in Jordan. No tax charge was suffered in respect of the remaining 75%  
of profits as a result of the utilisation of historical losses. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of carried forward tax 
losses of $0.2 million in Jordan at 31 December 2013.
No current income tax has been suffered in Oman (2012: $nil). In 2013 and 2012 the Group benefitted from a tax exemption such that the 
Group is not required to pay any corporate income tax on the taxable profits arising in Oman. At 31 December 2013, the Group had tax 
losses carried forward in Oman of $1.5m for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
No current income tax has been suffered in Bahrain (2012: $nil), as Bahrain does not levy income tax on the profits of companies apart 
from companies operating in the oil & gas sector.
No current income tax has been suffered in Jersey as the Group has not generated any taxable gains or profits in that jurisdiction.
At 31 December 2013, the total temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries was $nil (2012: $nil), such that there  
is no unrecognised deferred tax liability in this respect.

The intangible asset was initially recognised as the fair value of the short leasehold interest in the ibis Salmiya hotel at the date of transfer, 
when it was transferred to the Group from the principal shareholder on 1 April 2013 as a capital contribution. The fair value was 
determined by an independent valuer as at the date of the contribution and an amortisation charge has been recorded each period to 
derive the carrying value at 1 January 2012. This asset and the results of the hotel operations have been included in each period using 
the principles of merger accounting, as the business was under common control.
The intangible asset is subsequently recognised at amortised cost, being amortised over 25 years, representing the term of the lease  
as the Group plans to exercise its option to extend the initial lease of 5 years by a further 20 years. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report

At 31 December 2013, had the land and buildings of the Group been carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, their carrying amount would have been $167.4 million (2012: $157.4m). The revaluation surplus is disclosed in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The revaluation surplus cannot be distributed due to legal restrictions.
During the year the construction of the Holiday Inn in Seeb has been completed and the carrying value of the assets of $56.8m has 
been transferred from assets under construction into property, plant and equipment of operational hotels.
Hotels under development consist of ibis Seef with the carrying value of $25.4m and the Premier Inn Sharjah development site, which 
was contributed to the Group by the principal shareholder at fair value of $7.1m.
The land, buildings and fixtures and fittings of operational hotels and hotels under construction with a carrying amount of $205.8m 
(2012: $185.6m) have been pledged to secure borrowings of the Group (note 20). The Group is not allowed to pledge these assets  
as security for other borrowings or to sell them to another entity.
During the year the Group formally transferred its interest in certain undeveloped land to Action Real Estate Company at its carrying 
value of $9.6m resulting in no gains or losses for the Group.
The value in use of the land site in Brisbane, Australia, which had a carrying value of $18.5 million at 31 December 2013, is determined 
using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% and assumes that the existing planning consent for a 289 room hotel will be revised to a 368 
room hotel. This valuation indicates no impairment has occurred however an increase in the discount rate of 1% or an increase in the 
estimated construction costs of 15% would give rise to an impairment charge. 44 Action Hotels plc

impairment if they are past due; beyond 90 days for individual customers or 180 days for commercial contracts.
There has been no movement in the provision for impairment of trade receivables (2012: none) and no trade debtors have been impaired 
during the year (2012: none)
The other classes within accounts receivable and other debit balances do not contain impaired assets. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of debit balances mentioned above. The Group does not hold any collateral as 
security for account receivable and other debit balances.

Bronzia contract
Prior to 30 June 2013 a construction contract was entered in with Bronzia Company (Oman), a related party in relation to the Holiday Inn 
Muscat. The contract price was OMR 4.6 million ($12.1 million); however Bronzia sub contracted the work to a third party contractor for 
OMR 2.9 million ($7.7 million). After 30 June 2013, Bronzia agreed to reduce the contract price and return the OMR 1.7 million 
($4.4 million) surplus to the Group. The construction has now been completed.
The total capitalised expenditure incurred by the Group for the year-ended 31 December 2013 was $834,104.
Bronzia also agreed to indemnify the Group against increases in the cost to complete the project. The Group has estimated overruns of 
$1.1m and is taking professional advice to indentify any costs recoverable under the indemnity. No benefit from the indemnity has been 
recorded in the financial statements.

Transactions and agreements with related parties
The Group does not have ownership of the A shares of Action Hotels Limited, its principal subsidiary, which carry the voting rights and 
are held by Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C, the principal shareholder. The Group therefore entered into the following 
agreements with Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. to safeguard its control over the subsidiary:
a. a relationship agreement dated 17 December 2013 between the Company and Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. (the 
“Relationship Agreement”) pursuant to which Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. has agreed that: 
i. the Group will be able to operate independently of Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. and its Associates (as defined in the 
Relationship Agreement). This will include a majority of the board being independent of Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. 
at all times. For clarity, for these purposes, the concept of independence can include the executive directors. The agreement 
further provides that any transactions or arrangements to be entered into between Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. (or 
its Associates) and the Group will require the approval of the Directors who are independent of Action Group Holding Company 
K.S.C.C.
ii. it will not (and will procure so far as it is able that its Associates will not) compete with the  business of the Group (being budget/
mid-market hotels worldwide);
iii. the Group will have a ‘right of first refusal’ on any real estate assets held by it and which may be made available for hotels;
iv. it will transfer any property, rights, assets or services held by it (or its Associates) and intended for use or required to be used  
by the Group to the Group;
v. it will cooperate with the Company in the event that a restructuring is required to comply with local laws; and
vi. the agreement will terminate if Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C.’s (and its Associates) holding in the Company drops  
to below 30%.
b. a call option agreement between the Company and Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. dated 9 December 2013 pursuant  
to the terms of which Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. has granted the Company an option to acquire the A ordinary shares 
in the capital of Action Hotels Limited for a nominal amount;
c. a management agreement dated 16 December 2013 between the Company, Action Hotels Limited and Action Group Holding 
Company K.S.C.C. pursuant to the terms of which the Company exercises management control of Action Hotels Limited. The 
management agreement provides that:
i. the Company has the sole right to manage Action Hotels Limited, and all operational decision-making power is vested exclusively 
with the Company;
ii. the Company has the sole right to appoint and replace the directors of Action Hotels Limited;
iii. the Company has the right to receive 100% of all distributions that are declared by Action Hotels Limited including on  
a liquidation; and
iv. Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. shall not encumber (which includes creating any mortgage, charge, right to acquire  
or right of pre-emption) the A ordinary shares in Action Hotels Limited.
d. the Power of Attorney granted by Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. to the Company to exercise the voting rights attached  
to the A ordinary shares in Action Hotels Limited;
A detailed list of related party agreements which the Group entered into as part of the restructuring in preparation for the IPO can

The loans are granted to the Group by local and foreign banks. As at 31 December 2012, all of the bank loans were classified as due in 
less than one year because the loan agreements in place for each of the loans included provisions which gave the lender the right to call 
in the loan on demand, in line with local standard terms and conditions. During the year-ended 31 December 2013, the Group has 
negotiated an amendment to the terms of the loan agreements to remove these provisions.
The table below analyses the bank loans into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the statement of financial 
position date to the contractual maturity date. The comparative information as at 31 December 2012 has been restated to reflect the 
contractual maturity groups which would have existed as at that date if the amendments to remove the on-demand repayment provisions 
had already been removed, in order to provide a meaningful comparative.

The Partners’ current account principally represents the net amount invested in the Group in the form of loans by the principal 
shareholder in excess of capital contributions. It was also used as a current account for expenses incurred by the principal shareholder 
on behalf of the Group and vice versa. A proportion of this balance attracted interest during the period at a fixed rate. On 30 June 2013 
the Partners agreed that the balance outstanding of $74,022,000 was to be fully contributed as capital to the Group, removing any right 
to repayments and interest on this balance. Accordingly the balance was credited to the merger reserve.

No interest is levied on any of the above loans. The loans are all secured against the partners’ guarantees.
As at 30 June 2013 it was agreed by the Board and with each of the counter parties that the responsibility for the settlement of these 
loans would be taken on by Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C., the controlling partner of the Group, and the Group’s liability was 
transferred to the Partner current account. This transfer of responsibilities resulted in no gain or loss for the Group.

In accordance with IAS12, the Group is required to recognise a deferred tax liability in respect of the difference between the carrying 
value of its assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Where hotel properties have been revalued upwards, there is typically no additional 
tax base attributable to the increase in value, such that a deferred liability arises.

Statutory reserve
As required by applicable law and article of association of certain subsidiaries, 10% of the net profit for each period in those subsidiaries 
is transferred to statutory reserve until the value of the reserve equals 50% of capital. No transfers to the statutory reserve have been 
made since 1 January 2011. The reserve is not available for distribution except in cases stipulated by applicable law and articles 
of association.
Voluntary reserve
Voluntary reserve represents additional contributions made to the Statutory reserve. No contributions have been made since 
31 December 2010.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve includes the following:
i. the conversion on 30 June 2013 of the entire Partners’ current account balance of $74,022 into capital, thus removing any right to 
repayments and interest on this balance;
ii. the contribution made by the principal shareholder of the business and short leasehold interest in the ibis Salmiya hotel to the Group 
on 1 April 2013, which has been reflected in the financial statements as of 1 January 2012 using merger accounting principles. The 
transfers made from retained earnings during the period 1 January 2012 and 31 March 2013 represent the results of the Salmiya 
operations included in the consolidated statement of income;
iii. The contribution by the principal shareholder of the Premier Inn Sharjah development site on the date of the IPO;
iv. The adjustment to the Group’s reserves to reflect the share capital and share premium issued by the Company on the share for 
share exchange on 9 December 2013.
27. Share-based payments
Share options
On admission onto the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Company has introduced a share option scheme for the 
Directors of the Group. The Company granted a total of 7,381,860 options with an exercise price of £0.64, being the placing price of the 
Group’s shares on AIM. The options vest in tranches over a period of 3 years from the grant date and are exercisable for a period of 30 
months starting six months after the vesting date. The options are forfeited if the directors leave the Group before the options vest or 
within 6 months after the vesting date. The group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding during the year are as follows:

The fair value of the options granted in the year is USD$1,589,409. The fair value was determined using the Binomial model using the 
following assumptions:
Exercise price
(in £)
Share price at grant date £0.64
Option exercise price £0.64
Assumed exercise price £1.28
Expected volatility 30%
Risk free rate 0.33%-0.96%
Dividend yield 3.5%
Volatility 30%
As there is no historical data on the share price movements of the Company, the expected volatility was determined by calculating the 
historical volatility of share price movements of two comparable companies over the previous 3 years.
The Group recognised total expense of USD$19k related to the share options in 2013.
Share warrants
On 17 December 2013 the Group issued warrants to subscribe for 3,690,930 ordinary shares of the company exercisable at £0.64 to 
Omada Investments Limited to which Stefan Allesch-Taylor (non-executive deputy chairman) is a consultant and former director. The 
warrants are exercisable immediately and expire in December 2016. The fair value of the options was determined to be USD$577,000 
using the Binomial model with the same assumptions as used to value employee share options.

Proposed final dividend declared in the year ended 31 December 2013 of 0.96 pence sterling per share 829 –
The proposed final dividend is expected to be paid on 30 May 2014, subject to approval of the dividend at the Company’s annual general 
meeting which is expected to occur on 29 May 2014. It is expected that the Company’s ordinary shares will be marked ex-entitlement to 
such dividend on 7 May 2014 and the dividend will be payable to all shareholders on the Company’s share register at the close of 
business on 9 May 2014. Save that, as announced at the time of the Company’s admission to trading on AIM, the principal shareholder, 
Action Group Holding Company (K.S.C.C), has waived its entitlement to this dividend.
29. Financial risk management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, bank borrowings and items such as trade payables and trade 
receivables which arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the 
Group’s operations.
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk and 
foreign currency exchange rate risk. Given the size of the Group, the directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial 
risk management to a sub-committee of the board. The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the Group’s 
finance department.
The Group currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these risks. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
53 Annual Report & Accounts 2013  Financial statements
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation causing the other party to incur a financial 
loss. Financial assets which potentially subject the Group to credit risk consist principally of cash at banks, trade and other receivables 
and receivables from related parties.
The Group’s cash at banks is placed with financial institutions which hold medium grade credit ratings or higher (BBB+ or higher).  
The Group also banks with a number of institutions to diversify the risk of any potential credit issues.
Receivables are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the large 
number of customers and their dispersion across different industries. Past due receivables are not material.
The largest exposure to credit risk in receivables from related parties arises from a $7,976,000 balance with Action Real Estate Co 
K.S.C.C which is a real estate company under the control of Action Group Holding Company K.S.C.C. The Directors believe the balance 
to be recoverable and $5,836,000 of this amount has been received after the balance sheet date. Other balances due from entities 
controlled by the principal shareholder totalled $2.6m at 31 December 2013. The principal shareholder has committed that these 
balances will be repaid on or before 1 May 2015.
The Group’s maximum exposure arising from default of the counter-party is limited to the carrying amount of cash at banks, trade and 
other receivables and receivables from related parties.
Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term debt finance that is designed to ensure it has sufficient available 
funds for operations and planned expansions. The Group monitors its levels of working capital and debt to ensure that it can meet its 
debt repayments as they fall due and does not breach bank loan covenants.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. 
To manage this risk, the Group periodically assesses the financial viability of customers and invests in bank deposits or other investments 
that are readily realisable. The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk.
Of the Group’s financial liabilities, only bank loans and the partners’ current account suffer any interest, all at fixed rates, with the 
exception of some bank loans which suffer a mix of fixed and variable rates.
The following table shows the contractual maturities of the Group’s financial liabilities (none of which are derivative financial liabilities):

Market risk and sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk
Financial instruments are subject to the risk of changes in value due to changes in the level of interest rates. The effective interest rates 
and the periods in which interest bearing financial assets and liabilities are repriced or mature is indicated in notes.
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest bearing assets comprise only some cash and cash 
equivalents which earn interest at a variable rate. The interest arising on these assets is not considered material to the Group.
Interest bearing liabilities comprise bank loans (note 20) and an element of the Partners’ current account (note 21). The interest levied  
on the notes payable and the interest bearing elements of the Partners’ current account are both at a fixed rate.
The Group’s policy for managing interest rate risk includes consideration at Board meetings of the balance between fixed and variable 
rate interest bearing liabilities and considers changes in market rates, the long term strategy of the Group and the availability of 
necessary financing. 54 Action Hotels plc

29. Financial risk management continued
The Group has bank borrowings at both fixed and variable rates, as shown below. The variable rate borrowings of the Group are based 
on LIBOR, BIBOR, CBK base rate and BBSY. The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions during the period under review. 
The table below shows the level of bank borrowings suffering fixed and variable rates:

Bank borrowing at fixed rate 41,574 42,398
Bank borrowing at variable rate 66,742 57,950
108,316 100,348
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, an increase/decrease of 0.5% to all 
variable rate bank loans, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit, capitalised interest and total interest due:

2012
USD’000
Effect on consolidated income statement 432 255
Effect on capitalised interest 150 61
Effect on total interest due 582 316
An increase in the interest rate results in a decrease in the net loss for each respective period and vice versa for a decrease in the rate.
Details of the terms of the Group’s borrowings are disclosed in note 20.
The Group has fixed rate bank borrowings, notes payable and an element of the Partners’ current account which are carried at amortised 
cost. Changes in the market interest rates in respect of these liabilities do not affect profit or equity and therefore are not sensitised.
The Directors have reviewed the fair value of the fixed rate bank borrowings and have concluded that there is no material variance 
between the carrying value of loans and their fair value. The fair values of Group’s bank borrowings are within Level 2 of the fair value 
hierarchy (note 30).
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar, 
the presentational currency for the Group.
The Group‘s operations and headquarters are in the Dubai International Financial Centre and records transactions in US Dollar, its 
functional currency, a currency which is pegged to a basket of international currencies weighted towards the US Dollar. The Group 
operates in a number of other countries in the Middle East, which similarly have functional currencies which are pegged either to a basket 
of currencies, weighted towards the US Dollar, or to the US Dollar itself. The Directors do not believe that the foreign currency exchange 
rate risk exposure of the Group in these jurisdictions is material.
The Group’s operations in Australia give rise to transactions denominated in Australian Dollars, which results in exposure to a material 
foreign currency exchange rate risk.
During the period the Group did not enter into any arrangements to hedge this risk, as the directors did not consider the exposure to be 
significant given the short term nature of the balances. The Group will review this policy as appropriate in the future.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the exchange rate between the Australian Dollar and 
the US Dollar, showing the impact of a decrease in the value of the Australian Dollar of 15%, with all other variables held constant, of the 
Group’s loss and other comprehensive income:

30. Fair value measurements of non-current assets
The Group holds Property, Plant and Equipment for Operational Hotels and Hotels under construction at fair value on a recurring basis 
in the statement of financial position. No other assets or liabilities are held at fair value.
Hotels in operation or under construction are revalued to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of each property are recognised as a separate line in the statement of total comprehensive income and the 
revaluation reserve. Any deficit on revaluation, if temporary, is recognised in the statement of total comprehensive income and the 
revaluation reserve. If a deficit below original cost arises and is deemed to be permanent it is recognised in the statement of income  
as an impairment.
The fair value measurements at the end of each reporting period, along with a reconciliation of the movements in respect to these 
balances, are shown in note 15.
The Group re-values Operational Hotels and Hotels under construction on the basis of forecast future operating profits discounted to 
give a net present value. The forecasts are based on the Directors’ best estimate of future trading drawn from their historic experience 
of the Group and the hotel industry as a whole. The discount rates used and the valuations themselves have been prepared by 
independent valuers at CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle in each reporting period.
The Directors’ believe that these valuations, on the basis of current use, represent the highest and best use of the respective assets.
This technique has remained unchanged and the Directors of the Group review the valuation process undertaken each year and 
consider whether it remain appropriate.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of assets and liabilities held at fair value by valuation technique:
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly  
or indirectly; and
• Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
The fair value measurements of property, plant and equipment are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy in their entirety,  
due to the fact that significant unobservable inputs are used in arriving at an appropriate fair value.
The fair value measurement is sensitive to changes in unobservable inputs. The discount and yield rates used by the independent 
valuers to establish a net present value for each separately valued property are as follows and if changed, could result in a materially 
different fair value.
At
31 December 
2013
Discount rate: leased asset 17.5%
Discount rate: owned asset 12-14%
Exit yield 9-9.5%
The independent valuers utilise available market data and their experience in each respective market and jurisdiction to arrive at an 
appropriate discount rate. An increase in the discount rate of 1% would result in an estimated decrease in gross and net assets of 
$17.5m at 31 December 2013.
The future forecast results represent an unobservable input for each property. Each separate property valuation is directly dependent 
on the forecast results and hence a decrease in expected future results would result in a similar proportional reduction in the fair value 
measurement related to the property.
31. Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Board of Directors monitors the level of capital as compared to the Group’s long term debt commitments and adjusts the ratio of debt 
to capital as is determined to be necessary, by issuing new shares, reducing or increasing debt, paying dividends and returning capital 
to shareholders.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements (2012: none).
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt 
divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the 
consolidated statement of financial position) less cash and bank balances. Total capital is calculated as total equity, as shown in the 
consolidated statement of financial position plus net debt. 56 Action Hotels plc

32. Commitments and contingent liabilities
Stamp duty and capital gains tax
As part of the proposed placement, the beneficial ownership and control of the Australian entities was transferred to the AHC Kuwait 
Group after 30 June 2013. Management have sought tax advice which has concluded that the establishment of the new trust structure 
and associated change in classes of beneficiaries for this transfer should not of itself trigger any stamp duty on the properties held 
in Australia.
Stamp duty
If any of the restructuring steps did result in stamp duty, such duty would generally be calculated by reference to the unencumbered 
market value of the underlying dutiable property of the Discretionary Trusts at rates of up to 5.5% in Victoria and 5.75% in Queensland. 
Hence the Victorian duty liability on the Glen Waverley asset would be up to $1.9m. The Queensland duty liability on the Brisbane asset 
would be up to $0.9m, based on the current unencumbered market value for the Brisbane asset.
The listing of the AHC Kuwait Group should also not result in landholder duty in Victoria provided the Group has not and is not declared  
a listed company by the Victorian Commissioner of State Taxation. If duty were to become payable, it would be approximately $0.2m. 
Management consider that there are likely to be reasonable arguments that a relevant duty benefit would not arise as a result of the 
proposed transactions.
Capital gains tax
If any of the restructuring steps did result in a capital gains tax liability, such tax would be calculated by reference to the unencumbered 
market value of the properties less their tax basis at rates of up to 30%. The resulting tax based on the valuation of the properties at 
31 December 2013 would be $5.7m and is already effectively included within the deferred tax liability recorded on the statement of 
financial position.
Commitments on properties under construction
At 31 December 2013, the Group had entered into contractual commitments on construction costs of hotels under construction 
amounting to $2m.

Chairman’ s 	 Statement
Since	my	last	statement	to	shar eholders	
the	Company	has	made	significant	
pr ogr ess	in	r ealising	its	objective	of	
building	a	successful	exploration	and	
pr oduction	business.	Having	defined	
a	very	attractive	lead	inventory	based	
on	a	coarse	2D	seismic	grid	we	made	
the	decision	to	acquir e	new	3D	seismic	
over	part	of	our	acr eage	in	the	Falkland	
Islands,	with	a	particular	focus	on	large,	
high	impact	structural	targets.
The	planning	for	the	3D	commenced	in	January	
2007	with	the	tendering	pr ocess	starting	in	June.	
One	of	the	issues	we	faced	was	the	scale	of	
our	lead	inventory .	Our	objective	was	to	cover	
as	many	high	impact	leads	and	dif fer ent	play	
types	as	we	could.	W ith	the	incr eased	seismic	
acquisition	costs	due	to	high	global	demand	
we	needed	to	raise	additional	funds	in	or der	to	
maximise	the	survey	ar ea.	In	September	the	
Company	completed	the	successful	placing	of	
50,000,000	or dinary	shar es	of	1p	per	shar e,	
raising	£15	million.
Following	a	competitive	tender ,	PGS	wer e	
awar ded	both	the	seismic	acquisition	and	
pr ocessing	contracts.	During	our	discussions	
with	PGS	they	expr essed	an	inter est	in	
investing	dir ectly	in	the	Company	which	
r esulted	in	their	subscription	for	16,656,670	
new	or dinary	shar es	of	1p	per	shar e,	raising	
$10	million.	The	placement	and	subscription	
agr eements	gave	us	a	str ong	cash	position	
which	is	r eflected	in	our	year	end	cash	balance.
These	funds	allowed	us	to	acquir e	nearly	1500	
sq	km	of	3D	seismic,	far	exceeding	our	work	
pr ogramme	obligation	of	750	sq	km.	This	is	a	
large	survey	for	a	Company	of	our	size	but	we	
believe	it	gives	us	the	best	chance	to	deliver	
success. 3
	 Chairman’ s 	 Statement
The	seismic	operations	commenced	in	October	
2007	and	wer e	completed	in	February	2008.	
The	acquisition	was	finished	ahead	of	schedule	
and	within	budget.	Importantly	the	operations	
wer e	conducted	without	any	HSE	incidents.	
W e	contracted	marine	mammal	observers	on	
the	seismic	vessel	and	their	observations	have	
pr ovided	an	excellent	insight	into	the	wildlife	
in	the	ar ea.	This	new	data	will	be	incorporated	
into	the	Envir onmental	Impact	Assessment	(EIA)	
ahead	of	drilling.
As	we	look	forwar d,	our	aim,	fr om	a	technical	
perspective,	is	to	work	up	drillable	pr ospects	
by	the	end	of	the	year .	In	parallel	we	hope	to	
pr ogr ess	access	to	a	suitable	rig.	In	this	r egar d	
In	September	the	Company	completed	
the	successful	placing	of	50,000,000	
or dinary	shar es	of	1p	per	shar e,	raising	
£15	million.
we	ar e	working	with	other	Falkland	Islands	
operating	companies	to	identify	a	suitable	rig,	but	
equally	as	we	get	near er	to	finalising	the	technical	
evaluation	we	will	be	looking	at	all	possible	
options	for	rig	access.	
The	pr ocessing	of	the	3D	seismic	is	well	under	
way	and	we	ar e	just	starting	to	r eceive	some	
of	the	early	pr ocessing	r esults.	The	pr ospect	
generation	will	be	undertaken	using	the	final	
pr oduct	but	alr eady	the	fast	track	data	is	giving	
us	mor e	confidence	of	the	quality	of	our	acr eage	
and	the	pr ospect	of	delivering	r eal	value	to	our	
shar eholders.	As	an	untested	fr ontier	basin	the	
South	Falkland	basin	and	particularly	the	fold	belt	
tr end	looks	a	very	exciting	pr oposition. 4
Chief 	 Executive’ s 	 Review
It	was	one	hundr ed	years	this	May	since	
the	first	commer cial	oil	was	discover ed	
in	the	Middle	East.	The	discovery	was	
located	at	Masjid-i-Suleiman	in	the	
Zagr os	foothills	in	Iran	and	occurr ed	
some	30	years	prior	to	discoveries	in	
Saudi	Arabia	and	Kuwait.	The	Zagr os	
fold	belt	has	pr oven	to	be	one	of	the	
world’ s	most	pr olific	hydr ocarbon	
pr ovinces	and	continues	to	be	an	
important	ar ea	for	both	exploration	and	
pr oduction.	In	fact,	it	is	so	pr olific	that	it	
is	pr obably	atypical	of	fold	belts	ar ound	
the	world.	That	said,	commer cial	
hydr ocarbons	have	been	discover ed	
in	nearly	50	fold	belts,	accounting	
for	appr oximately	14%	of	the	world’ s	
discover ed	r eserves.	
It	is	the	chance	to	discover	multi-billion	barr el	
hydr ocarbon	pr ovinces	and	the	abundance	of	
large	simple	structural	traps	that	has	attracted	
petr oleum	explor ers	to	fold	belts.	Globally ,	37	
fold	belts	contain	giant	fields	(>250	million	barr els	
of	oil	equivalent),	and	16	have	total	r eserves	
of	mor e	than	3	billion	barr els	of	oil	equivalent.	
In	2000	the	US	Geological	Survey’ s	global	
assessment	of	r esour ces	concluded	that	fold	
belts	contained	some	15%	of	the	global	yet-to-
find	r esour ces.	
It	is	for	these	r easons	that	Bor ders	&	Souther n	
was	first	drawn	to	unlocking	the	potential	of	a	
pr eviously	undefined	fold	belt	play	in	the	South	
Falkland	Basin,	appr oximately	150	km	south	
of	the	Falkland	Islands.	Prior	to	our	2D	seismic	
acquisition	pr ogramme	only	limited	data	had	
existed,	and	it	was	far	fr om	certain	whether	
a	cr edible	exploration	play	would	materialise.	
However ,	on	r eceipt	of	the	pr ocessed	data	it	
became	clear	that	we	wer e	fortunate	to	have	
defined	a	new	fold	belt	play ,	the	majority	of	which	
falls	within	our	licensed	acr eage.
Whilst	fold	belts	have	always	attracted	explor ers	
they	have	also	frustrated	explor ers	due	to	the	
structural	complexity	in	the	face	of	often	poor	
quality	seismic	data.	The	r eason	for	this	is	that	
the	majority	of	fold	belts	occur	on	land	within	
major	mountain	ranges.	Seismic	acquisition	
is	dif ficult,	expensive	and	commonly	delivers	
r esults	which	can	support	dif fering	structural	
interpr etations.	In	contrast	to	many	of	these	
ar eas,	the	fold	belt	located	of fshor e	in	the	South	
Falkland	Basin	is	very	well	imaged	and,	as	
pr eviously	r eported,	has	allowed	us	to	define	
numer ous	large	(>50	sq	km)	anticlinal	traps	
capable	of	containing	giant	accumulations.		 5
Chief 	 Executive’ s 	 Review
W ith	the	completion	of	the	2D	seismic	
interpr etation	technical	risks	wer e	still	per ceived	
as	too	high	to	pr oceed	dir ectly	with	drilling	in	
this	untested	fr ontier	basin.	This	was	primarily	
due	to	the	coarse	seismic	grid	which	had	a	
line	spacing	of	appr oximately	5	km.	The	Boar d	
r eviewed	all	possible	options	for	risk	r eduction	
and	concluded	the	best	way	forwar d	was	to	
acquir e	a	3D	seismic	survey	over	part	of	the	play	
fairway .	Following	a	competitive	public	tender	
the	seismic	acquisition	and	pr ocessing	contracts	
wer e	awar ded	to	PGS.	
Prior	to	tendering	the	seismic	contracts	we	
enter ed	discussions	with	the	Falkland	Island	
Gover nment	about	a	possible	extension	to	
the	initial	exploration	term.	These	discussions	
r eached	a	successful	conclusion	with	the	awar d	
of	a	2	year	extension,	r epr esenting	a	total	of	5	
years	for	the	first	exploration	phase.	The	new	
expiry	date	is	1
st
	November	2009.	At	that	time	
Bor ders	&	Souther n	will	have	the	option	to	
further	extend	the	initial	exploration	term	in	lieu	of	
a	one	well	obligation	or	enter	the	second	5	year	
exploration	term	which	also	has	a	one	well	work	
pr ogramme	obligation.	This	means	the	Company	
has	suf ficient	time	to	fully	evaluate	and	test	its	
exploration	licences.
The 	 extension 	 was 	 granted 	 on 	 the 	 basis 	 that	
Bor ders 	 & 	 Southern 	 completed 	 a 	 minimum 	 work	
pr ogramme 	 obligation 	 of 	 750 	 sq 	 km 	 of 	 new 	 3D

The	full	pr ocessing	will	take	5	months	but	we	
have	r ecently	r eceived	a	fast	track	pr oduct.	
Whilst	we	do	not	intend	to	interpr et	this	data	as	
it	is	primarily	a	data	QC	pr oduct,	it	has	allowed	
us	to	make	some	initial	observations.	The	data	
quality	is	very	good,	and	particularly	good	for	
a	fold	belt.	The	seismic	is	giving	us	an	or der	of	
magnitude	mor e	information	than	we	pr eviously	
held	and	we	ar e	confident	that	we	now	have	the	
data	to	fully	assess	the	pr ospectivity	and	the	
associated	risks	in	our	acr eage.
The	3D	fast	track	pr oduct	has	confirmed	the	
structural	r obustness	of	the	pr ospects	that	
had	pr eviously	been	mapped.	Clear	four	way	
dip	closur es	can	be	seen	on	the	seismic	time	
slices.	Additionally ,	new	structur es,	albeit	smaller ,	
have	been	r ecognised.	These	structur es	had	
pr eviously	fallen	between	the	coarse	grid	of	
2D	lines.
The	data	has	also	pr ovided	us	with	gr eater	
r esolution	deeper	in	the	section.	This	will	allow	
us	to	map	pr eviously	undefined	sub-thrust	plays,	
older	ramp	anticlines	and	tilted	fault	blocks	along	
with	stratigraphic	plays.	As	a	consequence,	we	
would	anticipate	a	much	expanded	pr ospect	
inventory	after	the	mapping.		
The	new	data	demonstrates	to	us	that	the	
gas	hydrates	ar e	mor e	widely	distributed	than	
pr eviously	thought.	W e	ar e	starting	to	see	a	
systematic	r elationship	between	the	pr esence	
of	hydrates	and	the	anticline	cr ests	and	thrust	
faults.	This	will	be	investigated	further	on	the	final	
pr ocessed	pr oduct.

Other	possible	indir ect	evidence	of	hydr ocarbons	
is	seen.	Amplitude	anomalies,	occurring	in	
geologically	sensible	trapping	configurations,	
have	been	noted.	Certain	stratigraphic	intervals	
appear	mor e	pr one	to	display	amplitude	
anomalies	over	dif fer ent	structur es	and	may	
ther efor e	be	pr oviding	us	with	information	on	
r eservoir	distribution.	It’ s	encouraging	news,	but	
it	is	too	early	to	say	whether	these	ar e	dir ect	
hydr ocarbon	indicators.	A VO	analysis	on	the	final	
pr oduct	should	pr ovide	mor e	answers.
W e	ar e	delighted	with	the	pr ogr ess	of	the	pr oject	
to	date	and	with	these	initial	observations	and	
look	forwar d	to	r eceiving	the	final	data	so	that	
the	har d	work	can	begin.
One	 additional	 benefit	 fr om	 acquiring	 a	 3D	 survey	
is	that	we	will	not	have	to	undertake	site	surveys	
prior	to	drilling.	The	vertical	r esolution	and	aerial	
coverage	of	3D	seismic	data	in	deep	water	can	
be	used	to	identify	shallow	geohazar ds	and	
gauge	seabed	stability .	Furthermor e,	the	detailed	
imaging	of	the	sea	floor	will	assist	the	benthic	
sampling	pr ogramme	that	will	be	undertaken	as	
part	of	the	EIA.	
Strategically ,	we	hope	to	have	matur e	pr ospects	
with	drilling	locations	in	the	fourth	quarter	of	
this	year .	Our	aim	is	to	align	our	technical	work	
pr ogramme	with	the	other	Falkland	operating	
companies	so	that	we	can	take	advantage	of	a	
shar ed	drilling	campaign.	In	that	r egar d	we	ar e	
working	together	trying	to	sour ce	rigs.	Rig	supply	
shows	no	signs	of	easing	at	the	moment,	but	our	
aim	is	to	advance	our	technical	work	so	that	we	
can	take	advantage	of	any	opportunity	should	it	
arise.	In	the	meantime	we	intend	to	pr ogr ess	our	
EIA,	a	r equir ement	ahead	of	drilling.
Prior	to	committing	to	a	rig	we	will	need	to	
r eview	our	funding	options.	W e	curr ently	have	a	
very	healthy	cash	balance,	but	unfortunately	this	
is	not	enough	to	cover	our	drilling	aspirations.	
At	the	appr opriate	time	the	Boar d	will	decide	
whether	to	initiate	a	farmout	of	the	acr eage	or	to	
seek	additional	funding	(or	a	combination).	W e	
ar e	very	fortunate	to	have	an	extr emely	attractive	
fr ontier	exploration	pr oject	on	our	hands	and	
we	need	to	make	sur e	we	optimise	value	for	the	
shar eholders.

Financial 	 Review
During	the	year ,	the	Company	raised	a	total	
of	£19.2	million	post	expenses	fr om	private	
placements	to	UK	Institutions	and	to	PGS,	the	
seismic	contractor .	
At	balance	date,	the	Company	had	£19.6	
million	in	cash	or	cash	equivalent	deposits.	
However ,	part	of	those	funds	wer e	r equir ed	
to	fund	the	balance	of	the	3D	seismic	survey	
with	the	r emaining	invoices	paid	by	end	May	in	
accor dance	with	the	terms	of	the	contract.	W ith	
all	these	commitments	paid	for ,	the	Company	
had	a	cash	balance	of	appr oximately	£12.7	
million	at	end	May	2008	which	places	it	on	a	
sound	financial	basis.
The	cash	deposits	ar e	held	with	a	UK	based	
Aaa	rated	bank	in	either	US	Dollars	or	Pounds	
Sterling	tr easury	deposits	and	curr ent	accounts.	
As	you	will	have	r ead	in	other	parts	of	this	r eport,	
the	Company’ s	objective	is	to	drill	exploration	
wells	within	the	Falkland	Island	licenses	at	some	
point.	The	Company	has	a	wide	range	of	options	
for	funding	this	expenditur e	including	a	farm-out	
and/or	a	capital	raising.	When	the	Company	is	
in	a	position	to	assess	a	firm	rig	contract	and	
the	r esults	of	the	r ecent	3D	seismic	survey ,	it	will	
consider	the	best	option	for	the	shar eholders	to	
fund	this	capital	expenditur e.	W e	believe	that	we	
ar e	well	placed	financially	to	take	advantage	of	
either	or	a	combination	of	these	options.
As	you	can	see	fr om	the	graphs,	the	Company’ s	
shar es	have	performed	very	well	over	the	last	
year	both	in	absolute	terms	and	also	r elative	to	
other	AIM	listed	oil	and	gas	companies.

Risks and uncertainties and financial risk 
management
Business risks and uncertainties
The	Company	is	subject	to	risks	inher ent	in	oil	
and	gas	exploration.	In	addition,	ther e	ar e	risks	
associated	with	the	jurisdictions	wher e	the	Gr oup	
operates.	
The	Company	has	an	experienced	team	of	
pr ofessionals	who	have	considerable	experience	
in	the	industry ,	which	mitigates	some	of	these	
risks.	However ,	a	number	of	risks	ar e	out	of	
the	contr ol	of	the	Company	such	as	the	cost	of	
goods	and	services	pr ocur ed	by	the	Company	in	
the	course	of	its	business.
Financial risk management
The	company’ s	operations	ar e	such	that	it	has	
a	limited	exposur e	to	a	variety	of	financial	risks.	
These	may ,	fr om	time	to	time,	include	the	ef fects	
of	changes	in	price	risk,	liquidity	risk	and	a	
for eign	exchange	risk.	The	company	does	not	
use	derivative	financial	instruments	to	manage	
inter est	rate	or	curr ency	risks	and	as	such,	no	
hedge	accounting	is	applied.
Given	the	size	of	the	company ,	the	dir ectors	have	
not	delegated	the	r esponsibility	of	monitoring	
financial	risk	management	to	a	sub-committee	
of	the	boar d.	The	company’ s	management	
implements	the	policies	set	by	the	boar d	of	
dir ectors.
Price risk  
The	company	is	exposed	to	price	risk	due	to	
normal	inflationary	incr eases	in	the	pur chase	
price	of	goods	and	services.	The	company	has	
no	exposur e	to	equity	securities	price	risk,	as	it	
holds	no	listed	or	other	equity	investments.
Liquidity risk 
The	company	has	no	long	term	commitments	
and	is	able	to	satisfy	any	curr ent	liability	fr om	
cash	r eserves.	The	company’ s	solvency	is	
monitor ed	and	assur ed	within	the	framework	
and	r egulations	set	out	by	the	Financial	Services	
Authority .
Foreign exchange risk
The	company	has	potential	exposur e	due	to	
some	of	its	pur chases	being	invoiced	in	for eign	
curr encies,	mainly	US	dollars.	T o	mitigate	the	
risk,	the	company	when	it	becomes	awar e	of	a	
liability	in	the	for eign	curr ency ,	seeks	to	minimise	
the	risk	by	either	immediately	converting	the	
r equir ed	funds	to	the	r elevant	curr ency	or	taking	
out	a	forwar d	contract.	Other	than	forwar d	
contracts,	the	company	does	not	use	any	other	
type	of	curr ency	hedging.
Key Performance Indicators
The	Company’ s	key	financial	performance	
indicators	(discussed	in	the	Chief	Executive’ s	
Review	and	Finance	Review	on	pages	4-9)	ar e	
the	management	of	its	cash	position	and	the	
fulfilment	of	the	exploration	pr ogram.

which	r equir e	r eporting	or	disclosing	in	the

Transitional arrangements
Pr eviously	the	Gr oup	had	r eported	under	United	Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Principles	(UK	GAAP).	The	transition	fr om	UK	
GAAP	to	IFRS	has	not	impacted	upon	the	gr oup’ s	pr eviously	r eported	equity	or	loss,	and	has	only	r esulted	in	pr esentational	changes	
to	the	financial	statements.	For	this	r eason	an	opening	balance	sheet	r estated	using	IFRS	accounting	principles	and	a	r econciliation	for	
comparative	periods	between	UK	GAAP	and	IFRS	has	not	been	consider ed	necessary .	No	transitional	exemptions	have	been	adopted.
Basis of consolidation
Wher e	the	company	has	the	power ,	either	dir ectly	or	indir ectly ,	to	gover n	the	financial	and	operating	policies	of	another	entity	or	business	
so	as	to	obtain	benefits	fr om	its	activities,	it	is	classified	as	a	subsidiary .	The	consolidated	financial	statements	pr esent	the	r esults	of	the	
company	and	its	subsidiaries	(“the	gr oup”)	as	if	they	formed	a	single	entity .	Inter company	transactions	and	balances	between	gr oup	
companies	ar e	ther efor e	eliminated	in	full.
Business combinations
The	consolidated	financial	statements	incorporate	the	r esults	of	business	combinations	using	the	pur chase	method.	In	the	consolidated	
balance	sheet,	the	acquir ee’ s	identifiable	assets,	liabilities	and	contingent	liabilities	ar e	initially	r ecognised	at	their	fair	values	at	the	
acquisition	date.	The	r esults	of	acquir ed	operations	ar e	included	in	the	consolidated	income	statement	fr om	the	date	on	which	contr ol	is	
obtained.
Loss for the financial year
The	company	has	taken	advantage	of	the	exemption	allowed	under	section	230	of	the	Companies	Act	1985	and	has	not	pr esented	its	
own	income	statement	in	these	financial	statements.	The	gr oup	loss	for	the	year	includes	a	loss	after	tax	of	£147,718	(2006	-	£500,996)	
which	is	dealt	with	in	the	financial	statements	of	the	par ent	company . 30

Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The	pr eparation	of	the	financial	statements	r equir es	management	to	make	estimates	and	assumptions	that	af fect	the	r eported	amounts	
of	r evenues,	expenses,	assets	and	liabilities,	and	the	disclosur e	of	contingent	liabilities	at	the	date	of	the	financial	statements.	If	in	the	
futur e	such	estimates	and	assumptions,	which	ar e	based	on	management’ s	best	judgement	at	the	date	of	the	financial	statements,	
deviate	fr om	the	actual	cir cumstances,	the	original	estimates	and	assumptions	with	be	modified	as	appr opriate	in	the	year	in	which	the	
cir cumstances	change.	Wher e	necessary ,	the	comparatives	have	been	r eclassified	or	extended	fr om	the	pr eviously	r eported	r esults	to	
take	into	accounts	pr esentational	changes.
Management	has	made	the	following	judgements	which	have	the	most	significant	ef fects	on	the	amounts	r ecognised	in	the	financial	
statements:
	 Recoverability	of	exploration	and	evaluation	costs
	 	 The	gr oup	uses	the	full	cost	method	of	accounting,	wher eby	exploration	and	evaluation	costs	ar e	capitalised	as	intangible	assets	if	
the	associated	pr oject	is	commer cially	viable,	and	r eviewed	for	impairment.	This	r equir es	judgement	assessments	as	to	(a)	the	likely	
futur e	commer ciality	of	the	asset,	and	(b)	futur e	r evenues	and	costs	r elating	to	the	pr oject	in	or der	to	determine	the	r ecoverable	value	
of	the	asset.
The	key	sour ces	of	estimation	uncertainty	at	the	balance	sheet	date,	which	have	significant	risk	of	causing	a	material	adjustment	to	the	
carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	within	the	next	financial	year ,	ar e	as	follows:
	 Shar e	options
	 	 The	gr oup’ s	shar e	based	payments	wer e	r ecognised	at	fair	value,	as	in	the	prior	period,	using	a	50%	volatility	rate.	This	is	set	out	in	
gr eater	detail	in	note	7.
Income
At	the	end	of	the	year	the	gr oup	had	not	commenced	commer cial	pr oduction	fr om	its	exploration	sites	and	ther efor e	has	no	r evenue	in	
the	year .
Finance income
Finance	income	is	measur ed	and	r ecognised	using	the	ef fective	rate	of	inter est.	The	income	consists	of	inter est	on	cash	deposits.
Segment reporting
A	business	segment	is	a	distinguishable	component	of	an	enterprise	that	is	engaged	in	pr oviding	an	individual	pr oduct	or	service	or	a	
gr oup	of	r elated	pr oducts	or	services	and	that	is	subject	to	risks	and	r etur ns	that	ar e	dif fer ent	fr om	those	of	other	business	segments.	
The	gr oup	has	only	one	business	segment,	which	is	the	exploration	for	oil	and	gas,	and	is	its	primary	r eporting	segment.
A	geographical	segment	is	a	distinguishable	component	of	an	enterprise	that	is	engaged	in	pr oviding	pr oducts	or	services	within	a	
particular	economic	envir onment	and	that	is	subject	to	risks	and	r etur ns	that	ar e	dif fer ent	fr om	those	of	components	operating	in	other	
economic	envir onments.	The	gr oup’ s	geographical	segments	ar e	the	United	Kingdom,	the	Falkland	Islands	and	other	ar eas	W orldwide,	
and	make	up	the	gr oup’ s	secondary	r eporting	segment.
Impairment
Exploration	and	evaluation	assets	ar e	assessed	for	impairment	when	facts	and	cir cumstances	suggest	that	the	carrying	amount	may	
exceed	its	r ecoverable	amount.	Such	indicators	include	the	point	at	which	a	determination	is	made	as	to	whether	or	not	commer cial	
r eserves	exist.		Wher e	the	E&E	assets	concer ned	fall	within	the	scope	of	an	established	full	cost	pool,	the	E&E	assets	ar e	tested	for	
impairment	together	with	all	development	and	pr oduction	assets	associated	with	that	cost	pool,	as	a	single	cash	generating	unit.	The	
aggr egate	carrying	value	is	compar ed	against	the	expected	r ecoverable	amount	of	the	pool,	generally	by	r efer ence	to	the	pr esent	
value	of	the	futur e	net	cash	flows	expected	to	be	derived	fr om	pr oduction	of	commer cial	r eserves.	Wher e	the	E&E	assets	to	be	tested

generally	be	written	of f	in	full.	Any	impairment	loss	is	r ecognized	in	the	income	statement	as	additional	depr eciation	and	separately	
disclosed.	 31
In	assessing	the	value	in	use,	the	estimated	futur e	cash	flows	ar e	discounted	to	their	pr esent	value	using	a	pr e-tax	discount	rate	that	
r eflects	curr ent	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and	the	rises	specific	to	the	asset	for	which	the	estimates	of	futur e	
cash	flows	have	not	been	adjusted.	Exploration	and	evaluation	assets	have	been	assessed	using	a	discount	rate	of	10%	and	futur e	
r evaluations	based	on	expected	r ecovery	of	oil	over	life	of	the	fields	using	oil	prices	per	barr el	based	on	prices	of	flat	$25.
No	impairment	was	consider ed	necessary .

Assets	ar e	depr eciated	fr om	the	date	of	acquisition,	and	on	a	straight	line	basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
As	permitted	under	IFRS	6,	the	gr oup	has	accounted	for	exploration	and	evaluation	expenditur e	using	the	full	cost	method,	wher eby	
all	costs	associated	with	oil	exploration	ar e	capitalised	as	intangible	assets	on	a	pr oject-by-pr oject	basis,	pending	determination	of	
feasibility	of	the	pr oject.	Costs	incurr ed	include	appr opriate	technical	and	administrative	expenses	but	not	general	overheads.	If	an	
exploration	pr oject	is	successful,	the	r elated	expenditur es	will	be	transferr ed	to	tangible	assets	and	amortised	over	the	estimated	life	of	
the	commer cial	r eserves.	Wher e	a	licence	is	r elinquished,	a	pr oject	is	abandoned,	or	is	consider ed	to	be	of	no	further	value	to	the	gr oup	
the	r elated	costs	ar e	written	of f.	All	capitalised	costs	ar e	r eviewed	annually	against	the	underlying	value	of	oil	and	gas	r eserves,	unless	
the	expenditur e	r elates	to	an	ar ea	wher e	it	is	too	early	to	make	a	decision	about	the	value	of	the	assets.
Impairment tests and provisions
The	carrying	amounts	of	the	company’ s	asset	ar e	r eviewed	at	each	balance	sheet	date	and,	if	ther e	is	any	indication	that	an	asset	may	
be	impair ed,	its	r ecoverable	amount	is	estimated.	The	r ecoverable	amount	is	the	higher	of	its	net	selling	price	and	its	value	in	use.
Estimates	on	impairment	ar e	limited	to	an	assessment	by	the	Dir ectors	of	any	events	or	changes	in	cir cumstance	that	would	indicate	
that	the	carrying	value	of	the	asset	may	not	be	r ecoverable.
Any	impairment	loss	arising	fr om	the	r eview	is	charged	to	the	income	statement	whenever	the	carrying	amount	of	the	asset	exceeds	its	
r ecoverable	amount.
Provisions
A	pr ovision	is	r ecognised	in	the	balance	sheet	when	the	gr oup	has	a	pr esent	legal	or	constructive	obligation	as	a	r esult	of	a	past	event,	
and	it	is	pr obable	that	an	outflow	of	economic	benefits	will	be	r equir ed	to	settle	the	obligation.

Share based payments
The	fair	value	of	employee	shar e	option	plans	is	calculated	using	the	Black-Scholes-Merton	pricing	model.	In	accor dance	with	IFRS	2	
‘Shar e-based	Payments’	the	r esulting	cost	is	charged	to	the	income	statement	over	the	vesting	period	of	the	options.	The	value	of	the

Wher e	equity	settled	shar e	options	ar e	awar ded	to	employees,	the	fair	value	of	the	options	at	the	date	of	grant	is	charged	to	the	income	
statement	over	the	vesting	period.	Non-market	vesting	conditions	ar e	taken	into	account	by	adjusting	the	number	of	equity	instruments	
expected	to	vest	at	each	balance	sheet	date	so	that,	ultimately ,	the	cumulative	amount	r ecognised	over	the	vesting	period	is	based	
on	the	number	of	options	that	eventually	vest.	Market	vesting	conditions	ar e	factor ed	into	the	fair	value	of	the	options	granted.	As	long

Taxes
The	major	components	of	income	tax	on	the	pr ofit	or	loss	include	curr ent	and	deferr ed	tax.
Curr ent	tax	is	based	upon	the	pr ofit	or	loss	for	the	year	adjusted	for	items	that	ar e	non-assessable	or	disallowed	and	is	calculated	using	
tax	rates	that	have	been	enacted,	or	substantively	enacted,	by	the	balance	sheet	date.
Income	tax	is	charged	or	cr edited	to	the	income	statement,	except	wher e	the	tax	r elates	to	items	cr edited	or	charged	dir ectly	to	equity ,	
in	which	case	the	tax	is	also	dealt	within	equity .
Deferr ed	tax	assets	and	liabilities	ar e	r ecognised	wher e	the	carrying	amount	of	an	asset	or	liability	in	the	balance	sheet	dif fers	to	its	tax	
base.
Recognition	of	deferr ed	tax	assets	is	r estricted	to	those	instances	wher e	it	is	pr obable	that	taxable	pr ofit	will	be	available	against	which	
the	dif fer ence	can	be	utilised.
The	amount	of	the	asset	or	liability	is	determined	using	tax	rates	that	have	been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	by	the	balance	sheet	
date	and	ar e	expected	to	apply	when	deferr ed	tax	liabilities	and	assets	ar e	settled	or	r ecover ed.

3. LOSS PER SHARE
The	calculation	of	the	basic	ear nings	per	shar e	is	based	on	the	loss	attributable	to	or dinary	shar eholders	divided	by	the	weighted	
average	number	of	shar es	in	issue	during	the	year .	The	loss	for	the	financial	year	for	the	gr oup	was	£167,723	(2006	-	£527,024)	and	the	
weighted	average	number	of	shar es	in	issue	for	the	year	was	147,182,725	(2006	-	127,687,500).	
Potentially Dilutive Share Options
Because	the	gr oup	is	loss	making,	no	diluted	loss	per	shar e	has	been	calculated.		However ,	at	31	December	2007	ther e	wer e	options

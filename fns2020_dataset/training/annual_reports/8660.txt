Chairman’s statement
Group revenue up by 14%  
to £413.7m and underlying  
profit before tax up 18%  
to £41.4m
Group results and dividend
James Fisher and Sons plc made significant progress 
in 2013 with Group revenue up by 14% to £413.7m 
and underlying profit before tax up 18% to £41.4m. 
Underlying diluted earnings per share was 65.6 pence, 
an increase of 19% over 2012.
All four of the Group’s operating divisions contributed to 
the strong pattern of growth underpinning these results. 
Marine Support achieved further expansion of its ship to 
ship transfer and mooring operations while making good 
progress with the development of its support contracts 
and diving businesses. Offshore Oil did particularly well, 
benefitting from favourable market conditions in the North 
Sea as well as making significant progress in the new deep 
sea markets off Brazil and Africa. Specialist Technical’s 
excellent result reflected the first-time contribution from 
Divex Limited (Divex), a leading equipment supplier to the 
saturation diving market which was acquired in March and 
performed ahead of expectations. Our Nuclear business 
within Specialist Technical also did well, broadening its 
customer base significantly while producing another good 
result. Tankships improved its earnings further by careful 
attention to costs and by managing capacity to reflect the 
level of contract demand.
The strength of the Group’s trading performance in 2013 and 
the continued positive outlook has led the Board to propose 
a 15% increase in the final dividend to 13.54 pence per share 
which together with the 6.46 pence interim will bring the total 
dividend for the year to 20.0 pence per share (2012: 17 .7p).  
Strategic developments
The Group continues to benefit from its consistent 
strategy of investing in niche businesses which operate in 
demanding environments where their strong marine service 
and specialist engineering skills are valued and rewarded. 
The majority of the Group’s activities are therefore 
focused on the offshore oil, gas and renewables sectors 
together with an increasing presence in the nuclear 
decommissioning and condition monitoring businesses. 
Working with their strong multi-national client base, these 
businesses have expanded their international footprint 
significantly in recent years and have benefited from 
the strong growth seen in the new markets offshore of 
Africa, Brazil and the Far East. 
In March, the Group acquired Divex for an initial 
consideration of £20.8m. This Aberdeen based 
company is a leader in the saturation diving equipment 
market, servicing both the commercial and defence 
sectors in a strongly international setting. Its expertise, 
customers and operational bases fit well with our JF 
Defence submarine rescue business. Together, they will 
form a strong specialist subsea business with combined 
operations in the UK, Far East and Australia and a 
broader spread of customers which will help even out 
the peaks and troughs that have affected our Defence 
business in recent years.
In July, we announced the disposal of our 25% interest in 
Foreland Shipping for an initial consideration of £1 1.4m in 
cash with potential additional consideration in the event 
of the sale of certain assets. This Private Finance Roll-on 
Roll-off support ship contract to the Ministry of Defence 
had reduced in scale following the Defence Review. The 
Board therefore decided that it was better to release the 
capital tied up in this business for reinvestment into faster 
growing areas of the Group. An example of this was the 
acquisition in August of Osiris Marine for £3.3m, a diving 
services company which enhanced the Group’s offering 
to the offshore renewables sector.
The combination of strong cash conversion from the 
Group’s trading activities together with the sale of our 
Foreland interest led to a further reduction in year-end  3

gearing to 30%. The strength of our balance sheet 
means that the Group is well placed to take advantage 
of further organic growth and acquisition opportunities in 
the year ahead.
The Board
At our last AGM we announced that Maurice 
Storey would retire from his role as Senior Non-
Executive Director during 2013. In his ten years on 
the Board, Maurice made a significant contribution 
to the development of the Group and brought deep 
technical and maritime expertise. Malcolm Paul was 
appointed Senior Non-Executive Director on 31 
December 2013. In August, I was delighted to be able 
to announce the appointment of David Moorhouse 
(formerly Executive Chairman of Lloyds Register) 
and of Michael Salter (formerly Chief Operating 
Officer of Abbot Group plc) as new Non-Executive 
Directors. Between them they strengthen the Board’s 
insight into the oil and gas sectors and provide a 
full replacement of Maurice Storey’s technical and 
maritime knowledge. 
Having ensured a period of hand-over, Michael 
Everard has also decided to retire from the Board at 
the end of April.  Michael has served on the Board for 
over seven years and helped shape the integration 
of FT Everard into the Group following its acquisition 
in 2006. I would like to thank Maurice and Michael 
for the great contribution that they have made to the 
Group’s development over the last years.
Staff
The success of James Fisher remains linked to our 
ability to retain and develop the entrepreneurial drive 
and professionalism of the staff and management 
teams in our operating companies. As the Group 
expands overseas these businesses become 
increasingly complex. A number of sectors are marked 
by shortages of skilled engineering staff. As a Group 
wide initiative we are therefore paying increased 
attention to our in-house training and to our graduate 
and management development programmes. This 
investment comes at a cost but will enable us both to 
continue growing and to manage increased complexity 
as we go forward.
Our success depends more than ever on the dedication 
and professionalism of our staff. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank all our staff for the tremendous 
commitment shown throughout all our businesses over 
the last year.
Outlook
The increased scale of the Group and its enhanced 
international presence has reinforced the Group’s 
market position in the demanding environments of the 
offshore, marine and nuclear sectors. This gives us 
confidence that our operating companies will continue 
their recent pattern of growth across a broad front. In 
particular, demand for our services remains strong in 
our Offshore Oil division while our Specialist Technical 
subsea and nuclear businesses have a healthy order 
book in a growing market. All divisions will benefit from 
the strength of our balance sheet which will enable us 
to invest further in organic growth opportunities and to 
continue with our programme of targeted acquisitions. 
Trading to date in 2014 has been to management 
expectations and we continue to be well placed to 
provide further growth and value for our shareholders.

Saturation Diving System
In October 2013 Divex completed the design, 
manufacture and supply of a 450 metre rated  
saturation diving system. The system, worth in 
excess of £10m, is to be installed onto a Navy 
rescue ship in 2014.
The system is a unique design that 
accommodates 12 divers in saturation, allowing 
three-man bell excursions to depths of 450 
metres to gain access to stricken submarines.
The chamber complex can also accommodate up 
to 60 submariners in the event that they require 
decompression following rescue. 4

Business model and strategy
Business model
Our business model comprises a number of high quality niche 
businesses offering a range of marine services predominantly to large 
multinational customers and governments on an international basis.
Strategy
A consistent strategy has been applied to leverage UK marine 
skills in areas of niche expertise to a global market.
Marine services
Businesses linked together by common marine 
service skills.
Entrepreneurial culture
The Group has a decentralised management structure 
which encourages managers to be responsible for 
running their own businesses with the back-up and 
resources of a larger group.
Our businesses have strong, experienced management 
teams that are rewarded according to the success of 
their businesses. An entrepreneurial culture means 
we are responsive to changes in the market and the 
competitive environment.
High quality services provided to 
demanding environments
The Group provides solutions to customers through the 
provision of specialist equipment which is coupled with 
the detailed knowledge of our people, who are industry 
experts in their specifi c operations. The equipment is 
often designed and assembled by our people, who then 
operate the equipment and provide through-life support 
to our customers.
Whilst our expertise originates in the UK, the Group 
provides these solutions and support on an international 
basis and focuses on servicing less mature markets.
Addressing customer demands for quality and 
improvement entails the continuous development of 
innovative products to maintain market leadership in our 
areas of service.
Buy and build
The Group has acquired a series of privately owned 
companies with specifi c niche expertise which has 
enabled the Group to widen the range of services 
provided to our large multinational customers. 
The global reach of the Group has facilitated the 
internationalisation of operations of these companies.
Strong organic growth has been achieved through 
investment in people, working capital and equipment.
The Group has a range of entrepreneurially led 
businesses which are at the forefront of the market 
in their specifi c operational niches. Our businesses 
operate in demanding environments where strong 
marine service and specialist engineering skills are 
valued and rewarded. The focus is on providing 
solutions to our customers who are moving into the 
less mature and fast growing markets where they value 
trusted and quality suppliers. 
Such high value services are expected to be cash 
generative and to produce net margins in excess of 
10% and returns on capital employed of 15% or more.
Bolt-on acquisitions have broadened the range of 
services provided. As a result the Group provides 
an integrated range of services to our international 
customers and leverages these relationships. 6
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Chief Executive’s review
Principal corporate objectives
• deliver progressive long-term growth in underlying earnings per share
• deliver progressive dividend growth
Underlying diluted earnings per share has grown 
over the last fi ve years by a compound rate of 
13% per annum largely through organic growth 
supplemented by a number of niche acquisitions.
The Group’s dividend policy is progressive by 
reference to underlying growth and dividend cover. 
Dividends have grown by a compound rate of 9% 
over the last fi ve years and this continues the trend 
of increasing dividends in each of the last 19 years.
The Group had a further year of strong growth with 
underlying diluted earnings per share increasing by 
19% on the previous year. Sustained organic growth 
represented 85% of the 13% increase in underlying 
operating profi t to £46.6m. All four divisions produced 
signifi cant contributions with underlying profi t growth in 
Marine Support (13% adjusted for prior year disposal), 
Specialist Technical (55%), Offshore Oil (15%) and 
Tankships (33%). Operating margins increased in 
Specialist Technical and Tankships and were in line with 
prior year in Offshore Oil and Marine Support (adjusted 
for The Railway Engineering Company (TRE) which was 
sold in 2012).
Since 2002, the Group has established and grown 
its Marine Services businesses (Marine Support, 
Specialist Technical and Offshore Oil) and revenues 
have increased by a compound rate of 19% over the 
last fi ve years to £352.4m in 2013. In continuation of 
this strategy, the Group divested the non-core TRE 
in December 2012 for £25.5m and reinvested the 
proceeds with the acquisition of Divex in March for an 
initial consideration of £20.8m.
Divex is a global leader in the design and supply 
of saturation diving systems and related diving 
equipment to the defence and oil and gas markets. It

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
is complementary to our submarine rescue business, 
JF Defence, and joins the Group at an interesting time 
with high activity levels in the subsea market and good 
prospects for new orders of saturation diving systems.
In August 2013, Osiris Marine Services Limited and 
Osiris Underwater Engineering Limited (together Osiris 
Marine) were acquired for an initial consideration of 
£3.3m. Osiris Marine provides diving and subsea 
services, principally to the renewables sector in the UK.
At the same time, we announced the sale of our 25% 
shareholding in Foreland Holdings Limited (Foreland). 
James Fisher and Sons plc was one of the four original 
investors in Foreland, a Private Finance Initiative to own 
and operate six roll-on, roll-off vessels for the Ministry 
of Defence. The disposal realised £11.4m of proceeds 
and resulted in a profit of £6.8m in the year. Further 
proceeds conditional on the sale of two vessels may be 
received in 2014. Whilst a successful investment for the 
Group, the Board decided that Foreland’s contract did 
not have significant growth prospects. The proceeds 
will be used to finance further bolt-on acquisitions and 
to drive further organic growth.
During the year, the Group opened several new bases 
and early in 2014 will commence operations from 
Labuan, Malaysia. Our Scantech Offshore business 
became established in Brazil and won two significant 
well testing orders from major multinational customers, 
one of which has contributed strongly to the 2013 result. 
The Group invested £24.7m (2012: £26.1m) in capital 
expenditure of which the majority was spent within 
our Offshore Oil division in new high specification 
equipment. Our JF Nuclear business created a new 
digital radiography facility at Deeside, UK and we 
recently invested in a new facility in Inchinnin, near 
Glasgow, UK where operations for JF Defence and 
Divex will be based. Our Nuclear business successfully 
implemented a new business information system across 
its six sites.
A recent strategic development has been to seek 
marine service contracts in the operations and 
maintenance sector of the European renewables 
market. In support of strategic bases and diving 
services within Fendercare and Strainstall Marine’s 
structural stress monitoring services, we acquired Osiris 
Marine which broadens our offering to this sector.
In providing solutions to our customers, an important 
part of our strategy is to develop new innovative 
products. Our safety product, the Weak Link Bail is 
being delivered to customers outside of the Norwegian 
market for the first time in 2014 and the award winning 
PyroSentry product proved successful in 2013. Our JF 
Nuclear business has largely completed development 
and testing of the robotic manipulator, Moduman, and 
within Offshore Oil, we launched the Switch which 
facilitates the operation of multiple down-hole devices 
from a single power source. 
CALM Buoy refurbishment 
In 2013, Fendercare completed a 
significant contract for Chevron Nigeria to 
refurbish and re-commission a catenary 
anchor leg mooring (CALM) buoy as part 
of the Escravos Gas to Liquids Project. 
A CALM consists of a floating buoy 
anchored to the seabed by catenary 
chain legs which are secured to anchors 
or piles. Fluid product is transferred via 
the CALM to or from a tanker by floating 
and subsea hose systems. 
Fendercare’s scope of work included 
inspection of all hydraulic and electrical 
systems, determining the buoy’s water 
tight integrity and the refurbishment of 
all lifting points and lifting equipment.  
Fendercare successfully re-commissioned 
the CALM Buoy following refurbishment. 8

Performance against KPI’s
Underlying operating profit (£m)
Cash conversion (%)
Operating margin (%)
Return on operating capital employed (%)
Gearing (%)
Underlying profit before tax (£m)
Underlying operating profit is after adjusting for 
separately disclosed items and is the profit from 
operations before interest. The Group has increased 
underlying profit by a compound rate of 9% over the 
last five years.
Cash conversion is defined as the ratio of operating 
cash flow to underlying operating profit. Operating cash 
flow is defined as underlying operating profit, adding 
back depreciation and amortisation and adjusting for 
net movements in working capital, pension payments 
and for the cash profits of associates. The Group’s 
cash conversion was 131% in 2013 (2012: 132%).
Operating margin is the ratio of underlying operating 
profit to revenue. The Group’s operating margin in 
2013 was 11.3% (2012: 11.3%). The Group’s margin 
has ranged between 11.3% and 12.1% over the last 
five years and is partly dependent on the amount of 
third party content or pass through revenue.
Return on operating capital employed is defined 
as underlying operating profit divided by average 
operating capital employed. Operating capital employed 
comprises tangible fixed assets, intangible fixed assets, 
operating debtors net of creditors, less provisions. The 
Group’s post tax return on operating capital employed 
was 16.9% (2012: 15.3%) at 31 December 2013.
Gearing is defined as the ratio of net borrowings 
to net assets. The gearing of the Group at 31 
December 2013 was 30% (2012: 39%) and 
compares to 93% at the end of 2009.
Underlying profit before taxation is after interest and 
before separately disclosed items and taxes. The 
compound annual growth rate in underlying profit 
before taxation over the last five years is 12%.

• Underlying revenue growth of 14%
•  Ship to ship transfer produced further organic 
growth
• First LNG ship to ship operations completed
•  West African contract for mooring buoy 
refurbishment completed
•  Acquisition of Subsea Vision and Osiris Marine for 
£5.8m
• Further contract wins in UK renewables
Marine Support produced a good financial performance 
with underlying revenue growth of 14% and operating profit 
increasing by 13% after adjusting for TRE, the business sold 
in 2012. Overall margins adjusted for TRE, were maintained 
in 2013 after reducing by around three percentage points 
in 2012, when we commenced a large contract in Angola 
which had a high proportion of third party content.
Ship to ship transfer services achieved further organic 
growth with South-East Asia performing well and we 
completed our first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) transfer 
in 2013. Operations in the West African market increased 
profits through contracts to install and refurbish mooring 
equipment and Fendercare continued to expand its 
network of bases around the world, recently opening a 
new facility in Sharjah, Dubai.
The acquisition of Subsea Vision Limited for £2.5m was 
completed in January 2014. Subsea Vision is an operator 
of niche remotely operated vehicles (ROV) used in the 
support of floating production, storage and offloading 
(FPSO) in the oil and gas market. 
Osiris Marine was acquired in August 2013 for a 
consideration of £3.3m. Osiris Marine provides diving and 
subsea services both to the renewables and oil and gas 
sectors in the UK. This broadens the range of support 
services to the renewables market which is developing.
Structural monitoring services also produced organic 
growth both in the UK, South-East Asia and the Middle 
East, where the market is showing signs of recovery.

•  Divex completed a major saturation diving project and 
made strong contribution since acquisition in March
• Orders for two further saturation diving systems
•  Joint project assembly base established in 
Glasgow, UK
• Australia – integrating contracts with the navy 
• Exceptional profit of £6.8m on sale of Foreland 
• Healthy order book at JF Nuclear
The Specialist Technical division produced a strong 
set of results with revenue increasing by a third and 
after adjusting for Foreland, underlying operating profit 
nearly doubled. This reflects the contribution from Divex, 
the global market leader in the design and delivery of 
saturation diving systems. During 2013 it completed a 
system that will ultimately be used by the Russian Navy. 
It also received orders for two further systems which will 
be completed over the next two years. The introduction 
of Divex into the Group has gone smoothly and the 
integration of the operations in Australia, Singapore and 
Scotland is underway.
JF Defence, which had a shortage of project work in 
the first half after completing the refurbishment of the 
Swedish submarine rescue vehicle in 2012, produced an 
improved order book in the second half of 2013, including 
securing funding for the next stage of development of the 
Swimmer Delivery Vehicle. In December it also completed 
a large exercise off Sydney in Australia (Black Carillon) 
which boosted second half financial performance.  
Our Nuclear business produced another solid 
performance. Whilst there was no significant increase in 
profit, the prior year included the benefit of the one-off 
Olympics contract in 2012 and the financial performance 
in 2013 illustrates the underlying organic growth from 
the nuclear power sector. The customer base has been 
further extended during the year with contract wins from 
Dounreay and the Atomic Weapons Authority (AWE).

Chief Executive’s review
•  Steersman and Asperity vessels sold, reducing 
fl eet size
•  Milford Fisher chartered out to Mediterranean 
market
• King Fisher and Kestrel Fisher introduced
• MoD charters for 2 vessels
Tankships produced an improved result with underlying 
profi ts increasing by 33% to £3.2m whilst revenue declined 
marginally. This was in line with the policy to reduce 
capacity and improve the yield. During the year the fl eet 
was reduced by a further 2 vessels with m.v. Steersman 
sold on behalf of its owners in January, and m.v. Asperity 
sold in December. In addition a further vessel, m.v. Milford 
Fisher, was chartered out to the Mediterranean market. 
The results benefi ted from the charter of two vessels to the 
Ministry of Defence, which entailed replacement vessels 
being chartered in to cover our contract commitments.
The demand for clean petroleum products, whilst 
not recovering to 2007 levels, remains stable. The 
fl eet has now been reduced to refl ect the level of 
contract demand with the exposure to the spot market 
signifi cantly reduced.  
•  Strong organic growth – revenue up 19%, profi ts 
up 15%
•  Contract wins for Zone 2 equipment in Africa 
and South America
• One-off profi t on well testing order in Brazil
• New product developments coming to market
The Offshore Oil division had an excellent year with revenue 
increasing by 19% and underlying operating profi t by 15%. 
The market, both in the North Sea and in the developing 
markets off West Africa and South America, continued 
to be very active, particularly in the subsea sector. The 
strong performance was in part driven by the demand for 
our designs of Zone 2 and Norsok (Norwegian standard) 
equipment. This led to signifi cant contracts being won 
for major international oil and gas suppliers for well testing, 
both in Brazil and Africa, which were partially completed in 
2013.
Capital expenditure of £14.8m was invested into new 
equipment during the year and will drive further organic 
growth. The majority of this is targeted at long term rental 
contracts in Asia, Africa and South America.
We continued to invest in new product development 
which provides solutions to our customers or improved 
health and safety. The Switch was exhibited at a major 
industry workshop in Houston, US in May 2013. This 
facilitates operating a number of down-hole devices 
from a single power source from the surface. In addition, 
new products were developed at Scantech AS, our 
Norwegian business and at Scantech Offshore which 
provides well testing related services.

 The Railway Engineering Company (TRE) was sold on 31 December 2012  
2
 Foreland was sold on 19 August 2013
The Group’s balance sheet has been strengthened over the 
last eighteen months with proceeds from businesses sold of 
around £38m and marine service acquisitions costing around 
£18m. As a result the Group’s fi nancial gearing has reduced 
to 30% (2012: 39%) from 93% fi ve years ago and the ratio 
of net debt to earnings before interest, tax and depreciation 
(EBITDA) at 31 December 2013 was 1.0 times (2012: 1.2 
times). In 2013 revenue increased by 14% to £413.7m and 
underlying profi t before taxation was 18% higher at £41.4m 
(2012: £35.0m). Second half turnover was 21% higher 
than prior year and operating profi t was up by 15%.
Good performance in ship to ship services, marine services 
and strain monitoring led to a 14% increase in ongoing 
marine support revenues and a 13% increase in underlying 
operating profi t. Offshore Oil services remained strong in 
the Norwegian North Sea and in developing markets. Our 
Scantech Offshore business delivered part of a sale and 
service order for a customer in Brazil that added around 
£1.0m to the result in 2013 which under its normal rental 
arrangements would have arisen over a four year period.
Specialist Technical’s 35% increase in revenue and 55% 
increase in underlying operating profi t refl ects a good 
contribution from Divex since March net of the impact 
of divesting of the Group’s 25% interest in Foreland, in 
August 2013. Tankships revenue was fl at but profi tability 
was 33% higher as a consequence of reduced 
operating costs and the benefi t of two larger vessels 
being chartered out for the majority of 2013.

Financial review
Restatement of prior year
A change to the accounting standards in relation to defined 
benefit pension schemes (IAS19) has decreased reported 
underlying operating profit in 2012 by £0. 1m and increased 
interest payable by £0.3m and as a result, underlying 
pre-tax profit has been restated from £35.4m to £35.0m. 
There is no impact on cash flows of this amendment 
to accounting standards. Following the acquisition 
of Divex Limited in March, the segmental format has 
been revised. Our submarine rescue Defence business 
is now reported together with Divex and our Nuclear 
business within Specialist Technical. Our fendering, strain 
monitoring and maritime services businesses are now 
reported within a new Marine Support segment.
Interest
Net interest reduced by £0.9m to £5.2m (2012: 
£6.1m) due to lower borrowings and lower total cost of 
borrowing as the Group’s gearing was reduced. Pension 
interest was £0.3m lower due to a lower discount rate 
applied and a reduction in the liability.
Separately disclosed items
To provide a better understanding of the underlying 
trading performance, the Group separately discloses 
certain items each year. This is done on a consistent 
basis and comprises gains on sale of businesses, any 
impairments which are significant by virtue of their 
size, costs incurred in making business acquisitions 
and the amortisation of acquired intangible assets. In 
2013, there was a gain on sale of the Group’s interest 
in Foreland of £6.8m, costs of acquiring businesses of 
£0.9m and amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £0.6m. In 2012 the Group reported a profit on sale of 
TRE of £20.9m, recorded a vessel impairment charge 
of £9.1m and amortisation of £0.1m.
Taxation
The effective tax rate on underlying profit before tax 
was 18.6% (2012: 19.0%). The rate is slightly lower than 
previous year as the Group has reflected future UK rate 
reductions into its deferred tax calculations.  The overall 
rate is dependent on the mix of profits in overseas 
operations which have different tax rates to the UK and 
dependent on the proportion of Tankships profit, which 
is taxed based on tonnage rather than on profitability.
  
The Group’s tax policy has been approved by the 
Board and shared with the UK tax authorities. Whilst 
the Group has a duty to shareholders to seek to 
minimise its tax burden, its tax policy is to do so in 
a manner which is consistent with its commercial 
objectives, meets its legal obligations and its code 
of ethics. We aim to manage our tax affairs in a 
responsible and transparent manner and with regard 
for the intention of the legislation rather than just the 
wording itself.

Operating margins at Marine Support were 
consistent with prior year having reduced in 2012 
due to the high third party content on the Angola 
contract but this led to a compensatory increase 
in ROCE over the period. Offshore Oil margins 
remain around the 20% level and ROCE of 16% 
whilst Specialist Technical improved significantly 
reflecting improved profitability at Divex and 
continued progress in our JF Nuclear operations. 
ROCE in our Tankships has benefited from a 
reduction in vessel book values following an 
impairment provision taken in 2012.  13
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
James Fisher and Sons plc
Earnings per share and dividends
Underlying diluted earnings per share increased by 19% 
in the year to 65.6p per share (2012: 55.1p) due to the 
increase in underlying operating profit, lower interest 
costs and a lower effective tax rate on profits. Diluted 
earnings per share after separately disclosed items 
decreased by 4% to 75.7p per share (2012: 78.5p) mainly 
due to a lower gain on the sale of businesses in 2013.
The Board are recommending a 15% increase to the 
final dividend for the year to 13.54p per share (2012: 
11.83p), which makes a total for the year of 20.0p per 
share (2012: 17.7p).  The final dividend will be paid on 
9 May 2014 to shareholders on the register on 11 April 
2014.  Dividend cover based on underlying earnings 
was 3.3 times (2012: 3.1 times).  
Cash flow and borrowings
Net borrowings decreased by £8.8m in the year 
due to a cash inflow from operating activities of 
£53.3m, which was used to finance £24.9m of capital 
expenditure, net outflows on businesses acquired and 
disposed of £6.4m and outflows for dividends and 
interest of £13.2m. The Group’s cash conversion, the 
ratio of operating cash to operating profit was 131% 
(2012: 132%).  At 31 December 2013, the ratio of net 
borrowings (including guarantees) to earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 
was 1.0 times (2012: 1.2 times). Net gearing, the ratio of 
net debt to equity, was reduced to 30% (2012: 39%). 
An additional contribution of £5.2m on 31 December 
2013 to reduce MNOPF pension liabilities added three 
percentage points to year-end gearing and reduced 
cash conversion by eleven percentage points.  However, 
by removing the associated interest cost of spreading 
payments over ten years, the payment will result in a 
£1.7m cash flow benefit over the remaining seven years 
of the obligation.
A small group of relationship banks provide bilateral 
facilities to the Group on an unsecured basis over a 
3-5 year term. At 31 December 2013, the Group had 
£73.6m (2012: £78.0m) of undrawn facilities of which 
£68.8m (2012: £65.6m) were committed.
Pensions
The majority of the Group’s pension arrangements 
are defined contribution arrangements where the 
Company’s liability is limited to the contributions it 
agrees on behalf of each employee. The Group has 
a small defined benefit scheme in Norway and a UK 
Shore Staff Scheme which closed to further accrual on 
31 December 2010. As a consequence of its history in 
shipping the Group is required to contribute to industry-
wide Merchant Navy Pension Funds. The MNOPF’s 
triennial 2012 valuation was finalised in June 2013 and 
increased the deficit by £4.4m. 
As reported last year, the trustees of the Ratings 
fund (MNRPF) were given permission to extend the 
requirement for deficit contributions beyond current 
employers to both current and past employers. The 
trustees are seeking ratification from the Court of its 
proposed methodology for future deficit contributions 
and the extent of any additional contributions will not be 
known with certainty until the process is concluded.
During the year, the Group made contributions to 
defined benefit schemes of £10.1m including the 
additional contribution of £5.2m made in December. 
Total defined benefit pension deficits at 31 December 
2013 were £23.1m (2012: £27.1m). The annual 
instalment on pension schemes in 2014 is estimated at 
£4.7m (2012: £4.6m).
SWITCH
RMSpumptools develops mechanical and electrical 
products for artificial lift completions. The Switch is an 
industry first, patented, in-well device that can direct 
power between two electric submersible pumps from 
a single power cable. Through use of its innovative 
technology, RMSpumptools has developed a means 
to reliably switch between two power cables using 
hydraulic control from surface, all while compensating 
for the high pressures and temperatures associated 
with an in-well environment.   
The Switch targets high cost applications typically 
associated with offshore and subsea well completions 
where significant savings can be achieved. 14

Market drivers 
Fendercare are the leading provider of pneumatic floating 
fenders and other mooring equipment to the global marine 
industry. The sectors serviced are commercial shipbuilding, 
ship refurbishment, defence, port developments and the oil 
and gas market for project applications.  Fendercare is also 
the leading provider of ship-to-ship services for the transfer 
of crude or refined oil, liquefied petroleum gas or bulk 
cargoes.  The demand for these services is driven by the 
volume of oil trading between oil majors and independent 
traders, and also the production from countries who do not 
have the port infrastructure to accommodate large tankers.  
Strainstall are the leading provider of strain gauges to the 
marine industry, which are used in a range of applications 
such as mooring systems on ships and in ports as well as 
being used to monitor structural integrity of infrastructure 
in the construction and transport sectors.  The sectors 
serviced encompass new shipbuilding, ship refurbishment 
and life extension, port developments and projects for the oil 
and gas market.
These services are provided from a global spread of regional 
bases.  In addition the division provides support services to 
the renewables industry in the UK and European North Sea.

Sector
Our Specialist Technical businesses supply the subsea 
market with diving equipment, submarine rescue services 
and the nuclear decommissioning market. The submarine 
rescue market is a small niche with a national navy either 
having its own capability or relying on other countries. 
Other subsea services provided to the Defence sector 
include diving equipment and special operations vessels. 
The Group also supplies saturation diving systems to the 
oil and gas sector. Saturation diving systems are installed 
onto Dive Support Vessels and support deep subsea 
diving activities. Our Nuclear businesses primarily serve 
the UK decommissioning market.
Our principal businesses
Market drivers 
Divex is the world’s leading supplier of saturation diving 
systems and related diving equipment. Its end markets 
are oil and gas and defence. Saturation diving systems 
are both fixed and portable. Fixed systems are usually 
built into dive support vessels (DSV). Divex provides the 
equipment and the follow-on consumables, support 
and maintenance to the DSV operator. The construction 
and replacement of DSVs drives new build saturation 
diving systems which in turn drives ancilliary service 
and product spend. Divex’s defence market is based 
on service, repair and calibration requirements and on 
projects requiring specialist diving equipment. 
JF Defence is the world leader in submarine rescue 
services. It encompasses the ability to design, deliver 
and operate submarine rescue vehicles. It has long term 
service contracts with navies in a very niche area of 
capability. The driver is the tendering of defence projects 
for provision of the equipment, which can then lead to 
longer term service contracts to operate the service. 
We currently provide submarine rescue services to the 
UK, Singaporean and Australian navies. The business 
also provides swimmer delivery vessels to the Special 
Operations markets.
JF Nuclear provides products and services to the nuclear 
industry both in the operation of nuclear power plants 
and decommissioning. Its products and services operate 
in hazardous environments. The business provides 
instrumentation, non-destructive testing, calibration, 
and digital radiography to the nuclear, aerospace and 
process industries. The market drivers for JF Nuclear 
are the demand for its products, services and lifetime 
support from the UK decommissioning industry, 
radiological calibration requirements and projects within 
the aerospace, process and defence industries.

ScanTech AS, based in Stavanger, Norway, rents a 
range of equipment to the Norwegian oil and gas market 
which are used on the rigs for platform maintenance, 
well testing or specific projects. The equipment is 
designed and certificated to the Norsok standard. The 
drivers for the business are the number of offshore rigs 
in operation in the Norwegian sector and the level of 
operating expenditure within that sector.
ScanTech Offshore provides support services to the 
well testing market on a global basis, other than Norway. 
It rents equipment to the large multinational oil service 
companies along with qualified personnel to operate the 
equipment. The driver on the business is the number of 
offshore rigs in operation around the world.

oil and gas market which improve the productivity of wells 
utilising electrical submersible pumps.
The Offshore Oil division operates in niche areas of the 
oil and gas services market. These are predominantly 
focused on the operation and maintenance phases 
of the market. There is limited exposure to exploration 
expenditure.

tankers with capacity ranging from 3,000 to 11,000 
tonnes. The driver is the level of consumption of clean 
products (petrol, diesel, kerosene and biofuels) in the 
UK, Ireland and Northern Europe.
Shipping dramatically reduces our customers’ carbon 
footprint compared to other modes of transportation.

 emissions are halved for shipping compared to 
road freight and just one full ship keeps more than 100 
trucks from the roads.
Cattedown Wharves is a port in Plymouth which 
provides stevedoring services to the oil majors who 
own tank farms in Plymouth. It also handles dry 
cargoes such as animal feed which is imported and 
clay which is exported from the South West. The driver 
for the business is the level of consumption of clean oil 
products within the South West of the UK.

Two new double hulled oil tankers with a deadweight displacement of 7kT joined the fleet to be managed 
by our ship management team. The vessels are powered by MAK type 8M25C engines and delivered a trial 
speed at summer draft of 12.3 Knots. 
This supplements the Tankships fleet of 3kT, 4kT and 10kT vessels transporting clean petroleum products 
around the European coastline.

Principal risks and uncertainties
James Fisher and Sons plc
Risk and description Potential impact Mitigation
Risk management framework
The Board is ultimately responsible for the management 
of risk in the Group. The Board determines the Group’s 
policies on risk, appetite for risk and levels of risk tolerance 
and specifically approves: risk management policies 
and plans; significant insurance and/or legal claims and/
or settlements; major acquisitions, disposals and capital 
expenditures; and the Group Budget, Forecast and Three 
Year Plan. The Board has put in place a documented 
organisational structure with strictly defined limits of 
authority from the Board to operating units that have been 
communicated throughout the businesses and are well 
understood by the Executive Directors, the management 
team and business leaders who have delegated authority 
and specific responsibility for ensuring compliance with and 
implementing policies at corporate, divisional and business 
unit level. Each operating unit is required to operate 
within this control environment and in accordance with 
established policies and procedures which include ethical, 
anti-bribery and corruption, treasury, employment, health 
and safety and environmental issues. The Board retains an 
oversight role and has a schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to it for decision thus ensuring that it maintains full 
and effective control over appropriate strategic, investment, 
financial, organisational and compliance issues. This schedule 
is subject to review by the Board on an annual basis.
A list of the principal risks to the business that were 
discussed by the Board during the year is shown below. 
Contractual
Failure to manage large and complex 
contracts. In addition, as the Group 
continues to grow there is a risk 
that contracts are accepted on 
unsatisfactory terms.
Failure to deliver a major contract 
in accordance with customer 
requirements would have potentially 
significant commercial and financial 
risk and the impact of potential 
litigation.
The Group utilises professional expertise to 
minimise risk in contract negotiation. Limits of 
authority are designed to ensure that contracts 
are reviewed and approved at appropriate levels 
prior to commitment. Major contracts are subject 
to ongoing review at levels and frequencies 
appropriate to performance and potential risks. 
Recruitment and retention of key staff
The success of the Group is built 
upon strong management teams in 
the operating businesses who are 
committed to the success of their 
respective businesses. Our success 
also depends on recruiting and 
retaining the right people in all areas 
of our business.
The failure to attract or retain personnel 
of the requisite calibre could have an 
adverse impact on the business.
Succession planning, regular appraisals 
and appropriate remuneration incentives 
including the extension of share schemes to 
key individuals and the implementation of skills 
development initiatives are designed to retain 
and motivate individuals.
Reputational risk from operational incidents
The Group’s businesses are reliant 
on ensuring that a good reputation is 
maintained with their customers.  
An adverse operational incident 
would potentially damage the Group 
commercially.
The Group places a particular emphasis on the 
health, safety and security of its operations which 
are regularly monitored and reported to the Board.
Financial
The Group is exposed to interest 
rate, foreign exchange and credit 
risk. The majority of its transactions 
are in USD or GBP but the Group 
has an increasing exposure to less 
liquid currencies.
An increase in interest rates or change 
in exchange rates or credit restriction 
would have a financial impact.
The Group manages interest rate and 
foreign exchange rate risks through hedging 
arrangements where appropriate. The Group 
maintains relationships with a small key group 
of banks and reviews its funding mix and 
requirements at each Board meeting.
Energy prices
The Group has significant operations 
in the oil and gas sector.
A marked fall in the price of oil or gas 
leading to reduced investment in these 
markets could indirectly affect demand 
for the Group’s products and services.
The Group has limited exposure to the 
exploration phase and seeks longer term 
contracts in the production and maintenance 
cycles in the oil and gas sector.
Operations in emerging markets
The Group has increasing activities 
in overseas emerging markets which 
may be in association with local 
shareholders.
This has the potential for increasing the 
Group’s financial and governance risk 
exposure.
The Group allocates additional resource to areas 
of higher risk and enhanced internal audit reviews 
are supported by external audit companies.
Pensions
Defined benefit pension schemes 
place the financial risk with the 
employer. Future contributions are 
assessed on a number of actuarial 
assumptions which can change over 
time and may result in increases or 
decreases in pension deficits.
Increased pension deficits would be 
detrimental to the Group’s balance 
sheet and lead to increased future 
contributions. The Group is also 
required to contribute to industry wide 
schemes which carry the risk that if 
others default the liability increases for 
the remaining participants.
The Group liaises with the trustees of its own 
schemes and works proactively to de-risk 
liabilities and actively participates in employer 
group initiatives in industry wide schemes. 19

Corporate responsibility
Introduction
Corporate responsibility is central to the Group’s 
business strategy and the Company is committed to 
conducting its business with honesty, integrity and 
fairness. The Board believes that aligning corporate 
responsibility linked to business strategy and objectives 
is key to the Group’s sustainability and success. The 
Group has implemented a number of policies covering 
anti-bribery and corruption, business ethics and whistle-
blowing which support our approach to corporate 
responsibility. We require all our people to conduct 
themselves to the highest level of ethical conduct in their 
business activities. We do not permit bribery, illegal or 
corrupt business practices and we provide a procedure 
for employees to raise any malpractice concerns in an 
appropriate forum without fear of recourse. The continual 
monitoring of the application of these policies across our 
Group demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our 
business operates in an ethical and responsible manner.
Employees
The Board recognises that as a service business, 
our talented and diverse workforce is our most 
valuable asset. The long term success of the 
Group is dependent on the quality, skill, dedication 
and commitment of our people. Accordingly we 
are focussed on creating an environment where 
performance is rewarded, people are respected for 
their contribution, diversity is encouraged and where 
integrity is upheld in all aspects of our work. The Group 
remains committed to seeking out, retaining and 
developing the highest calibre employees to maximise 
business growth and performance and is committed to 
equal opportunity for all employees and job applicants 
free of discrimination.  
We support our employees through training and on-
going investment and seek to ensure that employees 
are informed on matters affecting their employment 
and business developments in the Group through 
management briefings and newsletters, the Group’s 
website and by the distribution of Preliminary 
and Interim Announcements and press releases. 
Copies of the Annual Report and Accounts are also 
made available to the operating business and this 
communication process enables employees to gain an 
understanding of the Group’s objectives and their roles 
in achieving them. 
To enable personal development, employees are 
encouraged to participate in training and development 
programmes and to obtain professional qualifications 
relevant to their roles through the Group’s training 
programmes. In addition, in 2013 the Group broadened 
its management development and graduate 
recruitment programme which focuses on recruiting 
talented graduates, developing skills and experience 
and producing potential future managers.
We operate in a competitive marketplace and the 
Board recognises the importance of rewarding 
employees appropriately for the value they bring to 
the business and aims to offer rewards that attract 
and retain key talent. In addition, the Company 
encourages employees to share in its success through 
share ownership and annually invites employees to 
participate in its share schemes. At 31 December 2013, 
251 employees were participants of the James Fisher 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (2012: 188).
The Company is committed to equal opportunity and it 
is our policy to ensure that all employees and potential 
employees are treated fairly regardless of their race, 
religious or political beliefs, gender, age, marital status 
sexual orientation or disability. We aim to ensure that 
people from any background or gender have equal 
access to employment, training and career progression 
opportunities. We strive to select individuals on 
merit and do not consider that targets or quotas are 
appropriate. However, the Board has agreed that the 
issue of gender diversity should be addressed as part 
of the Board’s succession and development. 
Set out below is a breakdown of the average number of 
persons by gender and category:
All of our employees are treated with respect and 
dignity and harassment or any kind is not tolerated. 
It is our policy and practice to give full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment by 
disabled people. If an employee became disabled 
during the course of their employment, wherever 
practicable, the Company would make every effort to 
ensure that arrangements and adjustments are made 
to continue their employment and arrange appropriate 
training for that employee.  
Health and safety 
The Group is fully committed to providing very high 
standards of safety to its employees and to contractors 
and visitors to the Group’s premises. The Group promotes 
a safety culture of continuous improvement. The Chief 
Executive Officer, Nick Henry has overall responsibility 
for health and safety and the review of health and safety 
performance is usually the first agenda item at each 
Board and business board meeting. In accordance with 
our decentralised management approach, accountability 
is with local management to comply with local laws and 
regulations and specific needs.

Corporate responsibility
Nick Henry chairs the Group health and safety 
committee (GHSC), which meets on a quarterly basis to 
discuss all health and safety issues including incidents, 
mitigating actions and training requirements. The GHSC 
ensures that recordable safety incidents are reported 
to the Board and each Group operating company is 
maintaining high standards of health and safety in its 
business. Through the GHSC, the Group shares best 
practice and following any health and safety incidents, 
including near misses, appropriate corrective action is 
taken to mitigate the risk of their recurrence.     
The Group’s principal operating companies maintain 
internationally recognised Occupational Health and 
Safety Management Systems accredited to OHSAS 
18001 and management systems which are accredited 
to the international quality standard ISO 19001. The 
Group has adopted the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases 
and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 
(RIDDOR) in the reporting of recordable incidents.   
A reportable incident under RIDDOR are work-related 
injuries to workers which result in their incapacitation 
for more than seven days. The number of reportable 
incidents across the Group in 2013 was 6 (2012: 1).  
The most common incidents relate to trips, falls 
and crush injuries. The Group also records lost time 
accidents (LTA’s) to monitor performance and trends.  
An LTA is where a worker is incapacitated for three 
or more consecutive days, not including the day of 
incident. In 2013 the Group incurred 2 LTA’s (2012: 6).
In addition the Group monitors the overall RIDDOR 
reportable frequency rate. The RIDDOR reportable 
frequency rate was 0.9 in 2013 (2012: 0.2).
Environmental
The Group is committed to operating its businesses in 
an environmentally responsible manner, recognises that 
its operations have an impact on the environment and is 
committed to working within the appropriate regulatory 
framework to minimise the environmental impacts of its 
operations, so far as reasonably practicable.
Our principal operating companies are ISO14001 
compliant or are in the process of achieving 
accreditation. This internationally recognised 
environmental management system enables a 
systematic approach to handling environmental issues 
within an organisation. 
Energy consumption was measured across the Group 
by recording data on the combustion of fuel and the 
use of electricity at its facilities. The Group’s total 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in 2013 was 82,600 
tonnes of CO
2
. This is largely made up of emissions 
from the combustion of oil and gas in vessels, which 
amount for 96% of our total emissions, although one 
4,000 tonne vessel can carry over one hundred times 
the volume of fuel transported by a single petrol tanker, 
significantly reducing congestion and emissions to air. 
Our GHG emissions have been calculated using 
UK Government guidelines for conversion of fuels 
and electricity. The Group’s Carbon intensity ratio 
calculated against Group revenue is 0.02%. Following 
2013, our goal is to reduce our GHG emissions in 
2014, where possible. To help do so we have identified 
a series of actions to help reduce carbon intensive 
activities, including monitoring and reducing energy 
consumption, actively improving energy efficiency and 
avoiding unnecessary travel. In 2013 our Tankships 
Division implemented a new Ship Energy Efficiency 
Management Plan to regulate shipping energy 
efficiency and to control our marine GHG emissions.  
Waste management and recycling of materials, where 
practicable, is encouraged across the Group.
Human rights
James Fisher is committed to supporting and 
respecting human rights. Our everyday work practices 
and policies throughout the Group are designed to 
ensure that respect for human rights is integrated into 
the systems and culture of our business.
Business Ethics and Anti-
Bribery and Corruption Policies
Our business ethics policy aims to instil the highest 
standards of business behaviour across the Group 
and focuses on embedding a culture of ethical 
compliance, so that all of our employees understand 
the standards of ethical business practices that 
are expected from them.  As well as protecting 
the reputation of the Group and safeguarding the 
investment of our shareholders, the  business ethics 
policy aims to protect the interests of every employee 
by ensuring legal and regulatory compliance as well as 
promoting responsible behaviour across the Group.
The Group has an established anti-bribery and 
corruption policy reflecting the requirements of 
the UK Bribery Act 2010 and has introduced an 
extensive compliance programme which has top 
level commitment from the Board and from senior 
management. The programme includes communication 
of the statement and policy, training, risk assessment, 
monitoring and review processes. Employees assessed 
to be at risk are required to complete the training and to 
self-certify that they understand and agree to be bound 
by its provisions.

Corporate governance report
Introduction by Charles Rice, Chairman of the Board
I am pleased to present the Corporate governance report on behalf of the Board. We aim to give a clear and meaningful explanation of how 
the Board and its committees discharge their duties and apply the principles of good governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010 and September 2012 (Code). The Board is committed to ensuring the highest 
standards of corporate governance and that values and behaviours are consistent across the Group. The appointment of David Moorhouse 
and Michael Salter as independent Non-Executive Directors during the year provides a firm foundation for continued oversight and scrutiny of 
the Company’ s activities.
I am pleased to report that at the date of this report, the Company complies fully with all of the principles and provisions enshrined in the Code.
I would encourage all shareholders to attend our AGM on 1 May 2014 as it provides an excellent opportunity to meet the Executive Directors 
and the independent Non-Executive Directors.
Our approach to corporate governance 
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. This report is intended to give shareholders a clear 
understanding of the Group’ s corporate governance procedures, how they operated during the year and how the Group complied with the 
principles set out in the Code. 
Statement of compliance
The Board confirms that throughout the year ended 31 December 2013 through to the date of this report, the Company complied with the 
principles of the Code without exception.  
Leadership 
Chairman and Chief Executive roles
The Directors are collectively responsible for the long term success of the Company. The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are 
separate and clearly distinct and are set out in writing and approved by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board 
and ensuring the Board is effective in all aspects of its role. The Chief Executive Officer has direct responsibility for the Group on a day to day 
basis which includes leadership of the operational management of the Group’ s businesses. Strategy, acquisition and disposal of businesses 
and major capital investments are agreed between the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and Group Finance Director prior to review and 
approval by the Board. The Board has considered and was satisfied that these roles operated effectively. 
During the year, pursuant to the Code, the Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present on more 
than one occasion and the Senior Independent Director met with the other Non-Executive Directors, without the Chairman present, on more 
than one occasion.
Role of the Board 
The Board is the principal decision making forum for the Company. The Board has responsibility for the overall management of the Group and 
is accountable to shareholders for financial and operational performance. The Board approves Group strategy and monitors performance. It 
has adopted a formal schedule of matters detailing key aspects of the Company’ s affairs reserved for it to approve, including: 
• strategy and management; 
• long term objectives; 
• oversight of operations; 
• performance; 
• any changes to the Group’ s capital structure; 
• financial reporting; 
• material contracts; 
• internal control and risk management systems; 
• material capital commitments; 
• corporate governance; and
• key policies and reporting to shareholders.  
The schedule is reviewed annually.
All Directors participate in discussing strategy, performance, financial and risk management of the Company. Meetings of the Board are 
structured to allow open discussion and as scheduled, the Board met six times in 2013. T o enable the Board to discharge its duties, the 
Chairman ensures that all Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information on all relevant matters in advance of the Board meetings, 
including comprehensive financial and business reports covering the Group’ s principal activities. The Non-Executive Directors regularly 
visit major business centres of the Group in order to enhance their knowledge of the services and products offered, which in turn acts to 
strengthen their contribution to Board debate. 24
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Corporate governance report
The Board has adopted established procedures to address the management of potential and actual conflicts of interest. The Company 
Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters and to ensure that Board procedures are 
followed and applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The Company Secretary also advises the Directors on any important changes 
in legislation, regulation and best practice. In addition, all Directors have access to independent professional advice if necessary.
Effectiveness
Size and composition of the Board
The Board currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer, a Group Finance Director and four other Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board functions effectively and efficiently and is considered to be of an appropriate size in view of the scale of the Company and 
the diversity of its businesses. The Board considers that each Director demonstrates a range of experience and is of the calibre necessary to 
support and develop the long term success of the Group, that each Director allocates sufficient time to perform his responsibilities effectively 
and that no individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board’ s decision making. 
David Moorhouse and Michael Salter joined the Board as Non-Executive Directors on 1 August 2013.  Maurice Storey retired from the Board 
on 30 December 2013 after 10 years’ service and on that date Malcolm Paul succeeded him as the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Role of the Non–Executive Directors
The Board considers the Non-Executive Directors combine broad business and commercial experience to bring independent and objective 
judgement to bear and to challenge constructively the Executive on issues of strategy, performance, resource and standards of conduct. The 
balance between Non-Executive and Executive Directors enables the Board to provide clear and effective leadership and maintain the highest 
standards of integrity across the Group’ s business activities.  
The Code requires the Board to determine whether its Non-Executive members are independent. The Board considers that all the Non-
Executive Directors including Charles Rice, up to the date of his appointment as Chairman, are independent for the purposes of the Code. 
Each Non-Executive Director is expected to commit sufficient time to allow for attendance at Board and Committee meetings and for keeping 
in touch with the senior management team, shareholders and other stakeholders. The Senior Independent Director also acts as a sounding 
board for the Chairman and an intermediary for Non-Executives where necessary.  
Board committees
The Board has Nomination, Remuneration and Audit Committees. Each Committee has formal written terms of reference. In addition to 
the formal Committees, the Board has appointed an Executive Committee consisting of the Chairman and the Executive Directors. This 
has written terms of reference and reports to the Board and, subject to the Company’ s Articles, is empowered to take such actions as are 
necessary relating to affairs of the Company in the normal course of business and of a routine nature, subject to such limits as the Board in its 
discretion determines from time to time. The Executive Committee reports into the Board via the Chairman. The Board also appoints from time 
to time sub-committees consisting of at least two Directors in order to finalise and approve those matters that have been approved in principle 
by the Board.  The Executive Directors meet with the managing directors of the principal businesses on at least a quarterly basis to deal with 
operational issues and develop and implement strategy.
Effective development
Training and induction
On appointment, new Directors are given a comprehensive induction to the Group’ s business, together with an ongoing programme of 
visits to the Group’ s major activities and meetings with senior management. Ongoing training and development for Directors is available as 
appropriate and is reviewed annually. 
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of the Audit Committee, Remuneration 
Committee and Nominations Committee and each individual Director. The formal evaluations are undertaken internally and for the year ending 
31 December 2013 were conducted in January 2014. 
The formal evaluation requires each Director to complete in confidence a detailed questionnaire relating to all aspects of Board performance 
and performance of the Board’ s principal Committees. The results of the evaluation are collated by the Company Secretary and reported to 
the Board via the Chairman with recommendations for further consideration and action as appropriate. The review is unlimited in scope and 
includes an analysis of the Board’ s and Committees’ performance in key areas including corporate governance, structure and procedures, 
strategy and its effectiveness, risk control and communications with stakeholders.  
The performance of each Director is also reviewed following the end of each year. The Chairman’ s performance is reviewed by the other Non-
Executive Directors led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. The 
performance of the Executive Directors is also reviewed by the Non-Executive Directors with the Chairman in attendance. The Chairman and 
the Executive Directors review the performance of each of the other Non-Executive Directors. The performance evaluations are designed to 
assist the Board in identifying strengths and weaknesses and areas for further improving performance.  
Re-election of Directors
All Directors are subject to election by the shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment to the Board and in accordance with the 
Code, all of the other Directors will also stand for re-election at the 2014 AGM. 25
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Risk management and internal controls framework  
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its objectives and for 
ensuring that the Company maintains sound risk management and internal control procedures. Accordingly, the Board has established 
an on-going process in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control, for the identification, evaluation and 
management of the significant risks facing the Group, which operated throughout the year.  The internal control systems are designed to 
provide the Board with reasonable assurance as to the effective and efficient operation of the Group and to ensure the quality of internal 
and external reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  However, there are inherent limitations in any system of internal 
control and accordingly even the most effective system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance. 
In 2013, the effectiveness and consistency of risk management at all levels of the organisation has been measured. The Board has reviewed 
the risk management process and confirms that on-going processes and systems ensure that the Group continues to be compliant with the 
Turnbull guidance.
Further information on the Group’ s risk management and internal control processes are set out in the Audit Committee report and details of 
the principal risks and the Group’ s approach to mitigating them are set out in the Strategic report. 
Whistle-blowing policy
As part of its internal control, the Group has a whistle-blowing policy which encourages employees to report in good faith any genuine 
suspicions of fraud, bribery or malpractice in order to identify any problems within the Group at an early stage. The policy is designed to 
ensure that any employee who raises a genuine concern is protected. Any concerns may be raised in the first instance with the Company 
Secretary in confidence.
Anti-bribery and corruption
In accordance with the UK Bribery Act 2010, the Board is committed to ensuring the highest standards in all of the Group’ s business dealings 
and condemns corruption in all its forms. The Group has a formal anti-bribery and corruption statement and policy and does not tolerate 
or condone corruption or bribery in any of the Group’ s business dealings. This policy has been implemented throughout the Group and is 
supported by a Group wide training and awareness programme and regular Group wide compliance reviews. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company communicates with shareholders through the annual report, interim report, preliminary announcements, interim management 
statements, investor days and the Company web site.  The Board takes the opportunity at the AGM to meet and communicate with private 
and institutional shareholders and welcomes their involvement.  Furthermore, communication with the Company’ s largest institutional 
shareholders is undertaken as part of the Company’ s investor relations programme. 
In order that all Directors are aware of the views of shareholders non attributable feedback on the institutional presentations which is given to 
the Company’ s advisers, is circulated to the Board. The Chairman periodically consults with major shareholders in order to develop a balanced 
understanding of any issues and concerns. In addition if at any meetings of the Executive Directors with investors a governance or strategy 
matter is raised, it is relayed back to the Board.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee reports to the Board and its members are appointed by the Board. The Committee members are Malcolm 
Paul, Michael Everard, David Moorhouse and Michael Salter. The Committee is chaired by Malcolm Paul. The Committee is formally 
constituted with written terms of reference. In summary, the Committee’ s terms of reference include:
• T o determine and agree with the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives;
• T o review the appropriateness and relevance of the Group’ s remuneration policy; and
• T o ensure that the provisions of the Code are fulfilled.
The Chairman attends the Committees’ meetings on invitation by the chairman of the Committee and is not present when his own terms and 
conditions are discussed.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee reports to the Board and its members are appointed by the Board. The Committee members are Charles Rice, 
Michael Everard, Malcolm Paul, David Moorhouse and Michael Salter. The Committee is chaired by Charles Rice.  The Committee is formally 
constituted with written terms of reference which include:
• T o regularly review the structure, size and composition of the Board (including skills, knowledge and experience) and recommend changes;
• Succession planning for Directors and senior executives; and
• Identifying and nominating for approval to the Board, candidates to fill vacancies when they arise.
The Committee’ s work in 2013 included making recommendation to the Board on the appointment of two new independent Non-Executive 
Directors, Michael Salter and David Moorhouse, and nominating Maurice Storey’ s successor as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
and chairman of the Remuneration Committee.  The Committee on behalf of the Company engaged Cardinal Resourcing, external search 
consultants, to assist with the identification, screening and appointment of Non-Executive Directors. 26

Audit Committee report
Introduction by Malcolm Paul, Chairman of the Audit Committee
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
Role and responsibilities
The Audit Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference, which include all matters referred to in the Code. The Committee 
assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in respect of the Company and the Group and its key responsibilities are:
•  to review the reporting of financial and other information to the shareholders of the Company and monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements including the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices;
•  to advise the Board whether it believes that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company’ s performance, business model and strategy; 
•  to review the effectiveness and objectivity of the external audit process, assess the independence of the auditor and ensure appropriate 
policies and procedures are in place to protect such independence;
•  to review and assess the adequacy of the Group’ s systems of internal control and risk management (which includes monitoring the  internal 
audit function) and monitor the risk profile of the business; and 
• to report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
Composition
The Audit Committee consists exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors. The chairman of the Committee is Malcolm Paul, a 
Chartered Accountant, who was formerly finance director of a FTSE 250 company and has significant recent and relevant financial experience. 
The other members were Maurice Storey, Michael Everard, David Moorhouse and Michael Salter. Committee attendance is shown on 
page 26. David Moorhouse and Michael Salter were appointed to the Committee on 1 August 2013 and Maurice Storey resigned from the 
Committee on 30 December 2013.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance Director, representatives from external audit and internal audit and the Company 
Secretary normally attend the meetings by invitation. 
Main activities of the Committee during the year 
The Committee met three times during the year in February, August and November and conducted the following business:
February 2013
•  reviewed papers on key accounting judgements. These included a review of the carrying value of intangible and tangible assets for any 
permanent impairment, the adequacy of provisions for slow moving inventory and overdue debts, claims and contingent liabilities, and the 
appropriateness of assumptions underlying the assessment of defined benefit pension schemes;  
•  considered reports from the external auditor on its audit and review of the Company’ s accounts including accounting policies, areas of 
judgement, risk management and internal controls;
•  reviewed the principal financial and non-financial risks relevant to the Group, and the Group’ s internal control and risk management 
systems; 
•  reviewed the proposed final dividend and approved the going concern statement and management representation letter; 
•  reviewed and approved the Company’ s  preliminary announcement, and draft Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year ending  
31 December 2012;
•  considered the level of non-audit services fees for services provided by the external auditor and satisfied itself that the objectivity and 
independence of the auditor was safeguarded;
• reviewed internal audit reports and approved the 2013 internal audit plan;
•  assessed the performance of the external auditor, summarising the result of the annual performance evaluation of the external auditor 
during the 2012 audit;      
•  met with the external and internal auditor without executive management being present to review the audit process, identify areas of 
improvement and concern and provide feedback on their respective performance; and

James Fisher and Sons plc 
Audit Committee report
•  considered the 2012/2013 Audit Quality Inspections Annual Report and the 2012/2013 Public Report on KPMG issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council; and
• met with both the external and internal auditor without executive management being present.
November 2013
• reviewed and approved the external auditor’ s proposed audit plan and fees for 2013 and approved the key areas of audit focus;  
• reviewed the internal auditor’ s progress report on the 2013 internal audit and approved the proposed 2014 internal audit programme; 
• reviewed and approved the Group’ s internal control and risk management review process; and
• reviewed and approved the process for evaluating the performance of the external auditor, internal audit and the Audit Committee.
Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of their monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements, the Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies have been 
adopted, whether management have made appropriate estimates and judgements and seeks guidance from the external auditors to make a 
full and proper assessment. The main issues reviewed in the year ended 31 December 2013 were:
•  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
  The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill and the assumptions related to the impairment review. The judgements in relation 
to the impairment review relate to the underlying assumptions in calculating the value of a cash generating unit. The key assumptions are 
the achievability of long term forecasts and the discount rates applied to the forecast cash flows. As an area of audit focus, the Group 
Finance Director provided detailed reporting to the Committee including an assessment of the sensitivity analysis carried out.
• revenue recognition
  The Group increasingly works on long term contracts which often span the period end and as a result judgements have to be made at that 
time on the stage of completion of these projects in order to fairly represent their progress in terms of both revenue and profit recognition. 
The Company uses an established accounting policy in respect of accounting for long term contracts. The Committee received reports on 
a number contracts where the estimation of the stage of completion had an impact on the performance of the business and were able to 
challenge the methodology by which revenue and profits had been recognised. Where appropriate, matters arising were discussed with the 
Group Finance Director and the Committee concluded that the financial statements recognised revenue in accordance with the Group’ s 
accounting policy.
• defined benefit pension obligations
  The Committee considered the Group’ s defined benefit obligations and the underlying assumptions used to value those obligations. The 
key assumptions being the discount rate, the inflation rate and life expectancy were compared to those of actuarial specialists and any 
significant changes from previous years were explained by the Group Finance Director.  Small changes to the assumptions applied to the 
valuation of defined benefit pension obligations can materially affect the results and reported pension liability.
• operating in overseas jurisdictions with uncertain legislation
  In line with its overall strategy the Group has seen an increase in overseas activities particularly in emerging markets and sometimes in 
association with local shareholders. This has the potential for increasing both the financial and governance risk exposure of the Group. 
The Committee receives regular updates on the operational and financial performance of these businesses together with the assessment 
of areas where specific judgements have been necessary. Where appropriate the Group seeks local professional advice on matters of 
legislation and tax and responds accordingly. During the year Deloitte were appointed to advise specifically on control issues and to provide 
an internal audit function in several overseas territories. On review the Committee was satisfied that the reports and explanations received 
supported the treatment of the performance of these overseas businesses in the financial statements.
The Committee was satisfied that each of the matters set out above was adequately addressed by the Executive Directors, appropriately 
tested and reviewed by the external auditor and that disclosures made in the Annual Report and Accounts were appropriate.
External audit 
The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment of the external auditor, the auditor’ s fees and their performance.  
The Committee discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with the external auditor and management. Following the conclusion 
of the annual audit the Committee reviews the effectiveness of the audit and the performance of the auditor through an evaluation process; 
this review takes into account and assesses the views of the Committee members, the Board and senior managers involved in the audit 
process.  The results of the review are considered by the Committee and discussed with the auditor and management. The review includes 
an assessment of the calibre of the audit firm, its quality controls, the composition of the audit team, the audit fee, the effectiveness of the 
auditor’ s communication and the auditor’ s governance and independence. 
For the 2013 audit, the Committee considered that the performance of the auditor was good and the auditor’ s interaction with the Company, 
management and with the Audit Committee satisfactory.   
KPMG Audit Plc has been the Company’s auditor since 2008. In accordance with UK regulations, KPMG adhere to a rotation policy 
based on best practice and a new lead engagement partner was appointed in 2013 in place of his predecessor who had completed 
five years in that role. The Committee is mindful that the audit should be put out to tender at least every ten years. The latest date the 
Committee would need to consider putting the audit out to tender is 2018, however the Committee will consider the need to tender the 
audit annually, dependent on the auditor’s performance.   29
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
To safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor, the Company has an established policy in respect of non-audit fee 
work that may be undertaken by the auditor. Whilst the Committee accepts that certain work of a non-audit nature is best undertaken 
by the auditor, it is a requirement that where fees exceed an agreed threshold, approval to use the auditor for such work must be given 
in advance by the Committee. In 2013, KPMG carried out various non-audit tasks, particularly in relation to taxation where a detailed 
understanding of the Group’s activities is advantageous. Due diligence work in connection with the Group’s acquisition of Divex was placed 
with another firm.  Non-audit fees paid to KPMG represented 32% of the audit fee in 2013. The Committee has recommended to the 
Board that KPMG should be re-appointed as auditor and a resolution to this effect will be put forward at the forthcoming AGM.
Internal audit
Internal audit programmes and internal control and risk management questionnaires are used to monitor the effectiveness of the Group’ s 
risk management and internal control systems and processes. The internal audit is managed by an experienced professional and primarily 
consists of a peer group review process, whereby a senior manager from within the Group conducts an audit of a non-related area of the 
Group in accordance with an annual programme approved by the Committee. The scope of each internal audit is agreed in advance to try to 
ensure that key areas for each business are addressed. Internal audit identify, report and address key commercial and financial risk and control 
issues and their reports are presented to the Committee for review. The internal audit reports are shared with local and Group managers for 
review and action as appropriate, and provided to the external auditor. 
In 2013 to supplement the peer review process, the Group appointed Deloitte’ s risk assurance practice to carry out internal audits of our non-
UK businesses and to improve our internal audit planning process. The Committee considers that this appointment has improved the Group 
internal audit procedures.
The effectiveness of the Group’ s internal audit function is reviewed annually by the Board and the Committee. Following the 2013 review, the 
Committee recommended and the Board concluded that the internal audit process was appropriate and effective.
Risk management and internal controls   
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and the system of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness. Certain of 
these responsibilities have been delegated to the Audit Committee, in particular the monitoring and review of internal control procedures. The 
Audit Committee received reports throughout the year and has reviewed the systems of internal control and risk management and is satisfied 
that the systems are effective. 
During the year there was one incidence of whistle-blowing in relation to alleged wrong-doing by the manager of a small overseas subsidiary. 
Immediate action was taken by senior management which resulted in Deloitte being commissioned to carry out an independent review. This 
process is on-going and appropriate action will be taken once the full facts have been established.
Key features of internal control systems 
The Company has an organisation structure which has clear lines of communication and accountability and delegation of authority rules. Business 
strategies are reviewed and approved by the business board and reported to each Board meeting by the Chief Executive Officer. All major items 
of capital expenditure, significant treasury transactions and significant contracts are subject to approval. The Group has established policies for 
ethics, employment, health and safety, environmental, whistle-blowing and anti-bribery and corruption which are reviewed annually. A 
schedule of matters reserved for the Board is in place for approving major transactions and strategic or organisational changes.
Key features of risk management systems
Key risks, both financial and non-financial, are reviewed by the Board as well as by divisional management on an ongoing basis. The Chairman 
and the Executive Directors meet at least quarterly with the trading company managing directors and functional heads to review their business 
performance, strategy and risk management. All companies are required to have processes to identify and measure risks and, so far as 
possible, take action to reduce those risks. This includes maintaining and regularly updating risk registers and formally submitting an annual 
risk management review for review by the Executive Directors, who report any material issues to the Board and are responsible for ensuring 
that necessary actions are identified and undertaken. 
Executive management of the various business units submit reports to the Board, including details of the significant risks facing their business 
and how they are being controlled. The annual review of risk management systems undertaken by the business units managing directors, 
includes an updated risk register. Completed returns are submitted to the Company Secretary for analysis and reporting to the Board. 
Furthermore the Board also undertakes a risk assessment before any decision on major projects is made and commercial, legal and financial 
due diligence is carried out on any potential acquisition.
The Group’ s Risk Committee which is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and includes the Group Finance Director, the Company Secretary 
and Group functional heads meet quarterly. The Risk Committee’ s terms of reference include the identification and monitoring of risks and 
ensuring the risks are actively managed. The Committee’ s findings are reported to the Board.

Directors’ Remuneration report
Annual Statement
Introduction by Malcolm Paul, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration report for 2013 for which we will be seeking your approval at our 2014 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM).
The Directors’ Remuneration report is presented to comply with the new reporting requirements on directors’ remuneration and is in two 
principal sections. The first section on the Remuneration Policy Report, summarises the policy of the Board for the remuneration of the 
Directors and is a restatement of the existing policy updated in light of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (Regulation). The main changes relate to the policies for recruitment and termination.  The second 
section, the Annual Report on Remuneration, describes how that policy has been implemented in 2013 and how it will operate in 2014 and 
provides details on the Remuneration Committee.
We are seeking shareholder approval at the AGM of the Remuneration Policy Report by way of a binding resolution and plan to put this 
section of the report to a binding vote every three years, unless there are changes to our policy requiring shareholder approval. The Annual 
Report on Remuneration will be put to the AGM each year on an advisory vote basis. The Remuneration Policy will commence on 1 January 
2014 but not become formally effective until the 2014 AGM, assuming shareholder approval is obtained. 
During the year the Committee held three meetings. Matters discussed included the annual salary review, bonus targets, long term incentive 
awards and prior year performance against targets. The Committee also reviewed the remuneration arrangements of senior management 
across the Group. The Committee has always endeavoured to be clear and transparent in matters of remuneration and consider that the new 
report format continues this approach by being easy to understand and informative.  
Transition of Board structure and remuneration
Tim Harris retired as Executive Chairman on 31 July 2012. The Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee decided that his 
successor, Charles Rice, would be appointed on a non-executive basis but be expected to allocate the majority of his time to this role given 
the transition from the previous structure. The number of Executive Directors then reduced from three to two - Nick Henry, Chief Executive 
Officer, and Stuart Kilpatrick, Group Finance Director - with a corresponding increase in their responsibilities. During 2013 James Fisher and 
Sons plc also joined the FTSE 250 Index.
During this transition, the Remuneration Committee has implemented phased increases in the salaries of Nick Henry and Stuart Kilpatrick on  
1 August 2012, 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2014 to bring them to a level more appropriate to their new level of responsibilities and the size 
of the Company. The Committee consider that this adjustment phase has now been substantially completed with the 1 January 2014 review.
2013 performance and remuneration
During the year ended 31 December 2013, James Fisher and Sons plc delivered another strong trading performance with revenue increased 
by 14% and underlying profit before tax up by 18% on previous year. The decisions made by the Committee in relation to executive 
remuneration outcomes were taken in the context of this performance.
In the context of the transition process noted above, Charles Rice’ s fee as Non-Executive Chairman was increased by 10% to £220,000 on  
1 January 2013. Fifty per cent of this fee, net of tax, is used to purchase shares to be held throughout his period in office. Nick Henry’ s salary 
increased by 15% to £375,000 and Stuart Kilpatrick’ s by 16% to £255,000. Fees for Non-Executive Directors were increased by 3%. Annual 
bonuses for the Executive Directors, which are based on a combination of the achievement of individual and Company objectives paid out at 
the maximum level of 70% of base salary. 
Awards under the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) made in 2011 will vest in full on 6 April 2014 having achieved the maximum target of 
earnings per share (EPS) growth over the Retail Prices Index (RPI) over the three year period to 31 December 2013. Awards under the 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) made in 2011 are expected to vest in full in 2014 having exceeded the upper quartile target for total 
shareholder return (TSR).
Remuneration policy for 2014
Other than as described above, the Remuneration Committee has decided not to make changes to the remuneration framework and policy 
this year. The decisions we have taken within the terms of our existing policies have been designed to both reward performance that benefits 
shareholders and focus management on delivering the agreed business strategy.
As part of the transition phase, on 1 January 2014 Nick Henry’ s salary was increased by 9% to £410,000 and Stuart Kilpatrick’ s by 8% to 
£275,000. The annual fees of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ increased by 2.5%.
As appropriate, the Company will continue to engage and communicate to shareholders regarding the Company’ s remuneration policy and to 
take suitable action when required. I hope you will join me in supporting the two resolutions in respect of this year’ s Directors’ Remuneration 
report at the AGM on 1 May 2014.

Remuneration Policy Report
Overview of Directors’ Remuneration Policy
James Fisher and Sons plc operates in a competitive international environment. For the Company to continue to compete successfully, it 
is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objective of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the 
necessary high calibre of individuals at all levels across the Company. The Company therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to 
all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
The remuneration strategy is designed not only to align with the Company’ s fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity, 
but also to support the Company’ s corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to competitive advantage. A cohesive reward structure 
with a timely pay review process, consistently applied to all employees, with links to corporate performance is seen as critical in ensuring 
all employees can associate with, and are focused on, the attainment of the Company’ s strategic goals. In line with this the remuneration 
package for the Executive Directors is normally reviewed annually. Where an Executive Director’ s responsibilities change during the course of a 
year, the Committee will consider whether a remuneration review is appropriate outside of the annual review process. 
Executive remuneration reviews are based upon the following principles: 
•  T otal rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reflect the competitive market in which the Company operates, and to provide a fair 
and attractive remuneration package.
•  Reward elements should be designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward. The majority of the total remuneration 
package should be linked to the achievement of appropriate performance targets. 
•  Executive Directors’ incentives should be aligned with the interests of shareholders.  This is achieved through setting performance targets 
to reward increase in shareholder value and through the Committee’ s policy to encourage shareholding by Executive Directors.
How the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy relates to the wider Group
The Remuneration Policy set out within this report provides an overview of the structure that operates for the senior executives in the 
Group. Employees below executive level have a lower proportion of their total remuneration made up of incentive-based remuneration, with 
remuneration driven by market comparators and the impact of the role of the employee in question. Long-term incentives are reserved for 
those judged as having the greatest potential to influence the Group’ s earnings growth and share price performance. While the Remuneration 
Committee considers pay and conditions across the workforce when reviewing and setting the Executive Director remuneration policy, the 
Committee does not consult with employees on this matter at the current time.
How shareholders’ views are taken into account 
The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on our Remuneration Policy and is mindful of the concerns of shareholders and 
other stakeholders. 32

developments in the relevant 
employment market and 
having regard to the Group’ s

range around the market median 
for similar positions in appropriate 
comparator companies. The

Notes:
(1)  The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus reflect the Committee’ s belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit 
growth and personal objectives. 
(2)  The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP and ESOS were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and 
the Group’ s financial growth and are consistent with the Company’ s objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders. The TSR performance condition is assessed on the Committee’ s 
behalf by New Bridge Street whilst EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
(3)  The Committee operates its share plans in accordance with the plan rules and the Listing Rules and the Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the 
operation and administration of the plans (e.g. treatment of awards for leavers, change of control, adjustments to performance targets).
(4)  Consistent with HMRC legislation, the all-employee SRSOS does not have performance conditions. 
(5) In approving the Directors’ Remuneration Policy , authority is given to the Company to honour any past commitments entered into with current or former Directors (such as the vesting of share awards granted in the past).
Directors’ Remuneration Policy 33
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
In illustrating potential reward opportunities the following assumptions have been made: 
(1) Minimum performance is based on fixed pay only (comprising basic salary and pension and the estimated value of benefits from 1 January 2014). 
(2) T arget performance is based on fixed pay plus 50% of the maximum values used for the Company’ s incentive arrangements.
(3)  Maximum performance is based on: (a) a maximum annual bonus of 70% of base salary; (b) an LTIP award of 75% basic salary at face value; and (c) an ESOS award of 100% of base salary at an expected value 
approximated to one third of the face value of the shares under option.
(4) No share price appreciation has been assumed.
Executive Director’s potential value of 2014 remuneration package 
Approach to recruitment  
New Executive Directors will be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and elements set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration policy table. On-going incentive pay will be limited to:
• Maximum annual bonus of 70% of salary;
• Up to 100% of salary LTIP award;
• Up to 100% of salary ESOS award; and
• Participation in the SRSOS.
For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional cash or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by 
an executive when leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards 
forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.  Shareholders will be informed of any such payments as 
soon as practicable following the appointment. 
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its original 
terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to 
shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
Loss of office 
The Committee has considered remuneration for Executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to applying consistent and 
equitable approach to ensure the Company pays no more than necessary.  The loss of office policy is in line with market practice and will be 
dependent on whether deemed a ‘good leaver’ or ‘bad leaver’.  The ‘good leaver’ policy includes:
•  payment in lieu of notice equal to one year’ s basic salary or, if termination is part way through the notice period, the amount of salary 
relating to any unexpired notice to the date of termination.  There is an obligation on Directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if 
the Company terminates their service contract; 
•  bonus payments for the period worked may be made, subject to the original performance targets, at the discretion of the Committee. Any 
such payments would be made on the normal payment date;
•  vesting of share scheme awards is not automatic and the Committee retains the discretion to prevent awards from lapsing depending 
on the circumstances of the departure and the best interests of the Company.  Awards which do not lapse on cessation of employment 
may either vest at that time or on the normal vesting date.  These awards will usually be subject to time pro-rating to reflect the unexpired 
portion of the performance period concerned.  Awards that are subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the extent that 
these conditions are satisfied; and  
• Executive Directors will also be entitled to a payment in respect of accrued but untaken annual holiday entitlements on termination.
‘Good leaver’ reasons are death, injury, illness or disability, redundancy, retirement, transfer of business resulting in cessation of the individual’ s 
employment within the Group or change of control. No compensation is paid for summary dismissal, save for any statutory entitlements.

It is the Board’ s policy that Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to no more than twelve months’ notice from either side. The 
Board recognises however that it may be necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer an initial longer notice period, which 
would subsequently reduce to 12 months after the expiry of the initial period. The service agreements do not have a fixed term. If it becomes 
necessary to consider termination of a service contract, the Committee will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including 
mitigation, when determining any compensation to be paid. Details of the current service contracts are as follows: 35

Annual Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee was chaired by Maurice Storey during 2013. The Committee also comprised four other independent Non-Executive Directors: 
Malcolm Paul, Michael Everard, David Moorhouse and Michael Salter. Malcolm Paul became chairman of the Committee on 31 December 
2013 following Maurice Storey’ s retirement.    
The Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. They have no conflicts 
of interest arising from cross-directorships with the Executive Directors, nor from being involved in the day-to-day business of the Company. 
The Committee operates under clear written terms of reference and confirms that its constitution and operation comply with the provisions of 
section D of the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to Directors’ Remuneration Policy and practice and that it has applied the Code 
throughout the year. The Committee’ s terms of reference include:
• T o determine and agree with the Board the framework and policy for Executive Directors and senior managers;
• T o review the appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy;
• T o agree the measures and targets for any performance related bonus and share schemes of the Executive Directors; and
• T o determine within the terms of the policy the total individual remuneration package of the Executive Directors. 
The Committee met three times during the year. Details of attendance at Committee meetings during 2013 are set out on page 26. During 
the year the Committee has considered the appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy, the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages, including base salaries, the grant of share-based incentive awards, the vesting of share-based incentive awards subject to 
performance conditions being met and the amount and basis of performance related bonuses. Charles Rice also attended Committee meetings, 
when invited by the chairman of the Committee, and was consulted on matters relating to the Executive Directors who reported to him.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
New Bridge Street is the principal independent adviser to the Committee. During the year the Committee reviewed market information on 
Directors’ remuneration published by New Bridge Street and a number of other sources and received advice from New Bridge Street on all 
matters under consideration by the Committee including on Directors’ remuneration, updates on best practice, legislative requirements and 
market practice. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided on remuneration is objective and independent. New Bridge Street’ s fees 
for this work amounted to £7,825. 
Implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for 2014
Nick Henry’ s salary was increased by 9% to £410,000 on 1 January 2014 and Stuart Kilpatrick’ s salary was increased by 8% to £275,000. For 
2014, Company pension contributions or cash supplement in lieu of pension will remain unchanged at 13% and LTIP awards will be granted 
to the Executive Directors over shares worth 75% of base salary. The comparator group for the 2014 ESOS will be the FTSE 250 Index, 
excluding investment trusts. Otherwise, Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2014 is as set out in the policy section. 36

Vesting of the 2013 share awards is subject to achievement of performance targets over a three year period. The LTIP is subject to EPS 
performance over the three year period ending on 31 December 2015. No awards vest if EPS growth does not at least equal the RPI increase 
over the period plus 9%. Full vesting is achieved at 18% growth in excess of the RPI increase over the vesting period. The ESOS is subject to 
Company’ s TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts, over the three year period from the date of grant.  If 
at the end of the period the Company ranks in the upper quartile all of the options will vest. If the ranking is at median level, 25% of options will 
vest.  No options will vest for performance below the median. For intermediate rankings, a proportionate number of options will vest reducing on a 
straight-line basis.  Options which do not vest at the end of a performance period lapse.  39

The scheme is unapproved for HM Revenue and Customs purposes. At the date of publication of this report, there are no changes to the 
Executive Directors’ interest in LTIP share movements.
Sourcing of shares and dilution
The Remuneration Committee has regard to the limits on dilution advised by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and reviews the number 
of shares committed under share incentive schemes in any rolling 10 year period and the headroom available for granting share based 
incentives in accordance with ABI guidelines on dilution limits.
On vesting, the awards of shares under the LTIP are satisfied by the shares held by the James Fisher and Sons plc Employee Benefit Trust 
(the Trust). During the year the Trust purchased 174,572 ordinary shares on the open market (2012: 154,591) and at 31 December 2013 the 
Trust held 154,170 (2012: 186,329) ordinary shares. During the year 31,193 shares were issued by the Company to satisfy obligations under 
the ESOS scheme. 
Share price during the financial year
The middle market price of one ordinary share in the Company during the financial year ranged from 815p to 1,277p and at 31 December 
2013 was 1,250p.

Shareholder voting 
The Company is committed to on-going shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. Where there are substantial 
votes against resolutions in relation to Directors’ remuneration, the Company seeks to understand the reasons for any such vote and will 
report any actions in response to it. The following table sets out actual voting in respect of our 2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report at the 
2013 AGM: 
Following comments by corporate governance and proxy voting agencies on the treatment of Tim Harris’ 2012 bonus and his remaining LTIP 
and ESOS share awards on his retirement on 31 July 2012, a number of shareholders voted against the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
It was highlighted that the standard approach in respect of such matters is that they should be pro-rated for time, except in exceptional 
circumstances. The Board took the view that exceptional circumstances did exist because:
• he had led the transformation of the Company’ s fortunes over ten years;
• during that time profits had risen 370% and the share price had increased sevenfold;
• underlying profit before tax in 2012 was over 20% up in the first half and 18% up over the year as a whole; and
• he had provided for an orderly succession enabling the Company to continue its rapid development.
The Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee therefore decided that while his 2012 LTIP and ESOS schemes would be 
cancelled in full, his 2012 bonus and his 2010 and 2011 share schemes, which were all more than half way through their qualifying periods, 
would be allowed to stand. This was on the basis that any eventual awards under these schemes would anyway be dependent on the 
Company meeting its profit and performance targets. In the case of poor performance these awards would not be payable.

nominal amount. On a winding up of the Company the preference shareholders have a right to receive, in preference to payments to ordinary 
shareholders, repayment of the capital paid up on such shares plus any accrued dividend.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
The powers of the Directors are determined by the Articles, the Companies Act 2006 and any directions given by the Company in general 
meeting. The Directors are authorised by the Articles to issue and allot ordinary shares and to make market purchases of shares.  These 
powers are referred to shareholders at the AGM for renewal.  Any shares purchased may be cancelled or held as treasury shares.
During the year the Company did not purchase any of its own shares, however, during the year 31,193 ordinary shares were issued in respect 
of options exercised under the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS). 
The James Fisher Employee Share Ownership Trust, holds 154,170 ordinary shares (2012: 186,329) of the Company in trust for the purposes 
of the various share incentive plans referred to in this Report. The rights attaching to these shares are controlled by independent trustees, who 
may take into account any recommendation by the Company. 
The Company also operates a Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP), details of which are set out on pages 32 and 38. 
Additional information for shareholders
The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. Directors are reappointed by ordinary 
resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. The Board can appoint a director but anyone so appointed must be elected by an 
ordinary resolution at the next general meeting.  
Authority to allot shares and disapply statutory pre-emption rights
The Directors will be seeking to renew their authorities to allot unissued shares and to dis-apply statutory pre-emption rights at the AGM.
Purchase of own shares
At the AGM held on 2 May 2013, the Company was given authority to purchase up to 2,503,391 of its ordinary shares until the date of its next 
AGM. No purchases were made during the year by the Company. The Directors will be seeking a new authority for the Company to purchase 
its ordinary shares at the forthcoming AGM.

 Each Director in office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirms that: 
• so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’ s auditors are unaware; and

suppliers’ standard terms.  At 31 December 2013 the Group and Company had an average number of 54 days and 75 days purchases 
outstanding in trade creditors respectively (2012: Group 59 days, Company 57 days).

to ensure that disabled employees are treated fairly and that their training and career development needs are met.  For those employees who become 
disabled during the course of their employment, the Group will provide support, whether through re-training or re-deployment, so that they will continue to 
be employed, wherever practicable, in the same job, or if this is not practicable, every effort will be made to find suitable alternative employment.
Significant agreements – change of control 
The Company is a guarantor of all of the Group’ s bilateral bank facilities which upon a change of control could be withdrawn. The following 
contracts may terminate upon a change of control of the Company or its relevant subsidiary or associated undertaking:
•  the Singapore Submarine Rescue Service Agreement dated 17 October 2008, between James Fisher Marine Services Limited and First 
Response Marine PTE Ltd; and
•  The Export T anker Support Services Contract dated 3 February 2012 made between BP Exploration (Angola) Ltd, and James Fisher 
Angola Limitada. 
The rules of the LTIP , SRSOS and ESOS schemes set out the consequences of a change of control on the rights of participants under those 
schemes. Participants are generally able to exercise their options on a change of control, provided that the relevant performance conditions 
have been satisfied.
Except as provided above, the Company is not party to any agreements which take effect, alter or terminate in the event of a change of control of the 
Company . Furthermore there are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office 
or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that arise in the event of a change of control of the Company.  
Going concern
The Group’ s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future performance, the financial position of the Group and a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties are set out in the Strategic report. The Group’ s primary sources of funding are a number of bilateral facilities 
with a core group of banks. These bilateral facilities, totalling £147.9m at 31 December 2013 (2012: £147.9m) fall due for renewal over the next 
5 years with none falling due for renewal by 31 December 2014. Compliance with banking covenants is reported half yearly and involves tests for 
the ratio of net debt: EBITDA, interest cover and fixed charge cover. There were no breaches of covenants during the year.
The Group uses cash flow forecasts derived from budgets, forecasts and medium term planning to identify headroom under the covenant 
tests and having evaluated the ongoing trading of the businesses, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue to operate for the foreseeable future as a going concern. As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
UK Corporate Governance Code
In accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Board has carried out a thorough review of the Annual Report and Accounts and the 
processes involved in compiling the accounts and is satisfied that the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’ s performance, business model and strategy.
Annual General Meeting 
The AGM of the Company will be held on 1 May 2014. The Notice of AGM is set out on page 107.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’ s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report and a Directors’ report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration report and Corporate governance statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’ s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibilities statement in respect of the Annual Report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
•  the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, provides the information necessary to assess the Company’ s performance, 
business model and strategy and is fair, balanced and understandable; and
•  the management report which comprises the Directors’ report and the Strategic report include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Independent auditor’s report
To the members of James Fisher and Sons plc only
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified  
We have audited the financial statements of James Fisher and Sons 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 48 to 
105.  In our opinion:  
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’ s and of the Parent Company’ s affairs as at 31 December 
2013 and of the Group’ s profit for the year then ended;  
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the 
risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit were as follows:
Goodwill (£104.2m)
Refer to page 28 (Audit Committee report), page 60 (accounting 
policy) and page 76 (financial disclosures)
•  The risk: The Group remains acquisitive and an impairment 
assessment of goodwill is carried out annually. The Group 
performs the review at an individual cash generating unit (CGU) 
level using value in use models.  Due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, which 
are the basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the 
key judgmental areas that our audit is concentrated on.  
•  Our r esponse: Our audit procedures included, among others, 
testing the principles and integrity of the models used, 
comparison of the key assumptions to external data as well as 
our own assessments in relation to key inputs such as revenue 
growth, gross margin assumptions, cost inflation and long term 
growth rates. We considered the historical accuracy of the 
Group’ s growth assumptions and used external data and our own 
valuation specialists when assessing the discount rate applied. 
We considered the Group’ s market capitalisation and compared 
that with a market valuation derived from the forecasts used 
in the impairment calculations, assessed the potential risk of 
management bias in the calculations and critically assessed the 
sensitivities applied by the Group. We also assessed whether the 
Group’ s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflects 
the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Revenue (£413.7m)
Refer to page 28 (Audit Committee report), page 61 (accounting 
policy) and page 69 (financial disclosures)
•  The risk: Revenue is recognised from the provision of goods and 
services by the Group and its subsidiaries when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer. Where 
services rendered are provided through long term contracts 
and are not completed at the balance sheet date, revenue 
is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the 
transaction measured by reference to the proportion of total 
expected costs incurred. Revenue recognition is considered 
a significant audit risk due to the element of estimation in the 
calculation of contract revenues. 
•  Our r esponse: Our audit procedures included, among others, 
testing the Group’ s internal controls over revenue. Analytical and 
substantive audit procedures were undertaken at subsidiary 
level and included the analysis of monthly revenue trends, the 
assessment of sales around the year end for inclusion of the 
relevant transaction in the appropriate period and the testing 
of cash received after the year end. We reviewed the terms 
of significant sales contracts when assessing the revenue 
recognition basis applied by the Group. When assessing the 
stage of completion on contracts we agreed amounts recognised 
to confirmatory evidence on a sample basis. This included the 
agreement of actual costs incurred to invoice and the assessment 
of any judgements applied in the projection of total contract costs 
including any contingency provisions. 
Retirement benefit obligations (£23.1m)  
Refer to page 28 (Audit Committee report), page 63 (accounting 
policy) and pages 85 and 91 (financial disclosures)
•  The risk: Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’ s 
post-retirement defined benefit schemes and small changes in 
assumptions and estimates used to value the Group’ s net pension 
deficit would have a significant effect on the results and financial 
position of the Group. For this reason it is one of the judgemental 
areas our audit is focused on.
•  Our response: In this area our audit procedures included, among 
others, testing the reasonableness of the Group’ s net defined 
benefit liability calculations and, with the support of our own 
actuarial specialists, we challenged the key actuarial assumptions 
applied, being the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality/life 
expectancy and compared key assumptions to independently 
derived data. We agreed asset values to direct confirmations from 
investment managers. We also considered the adequacy of the 
Group’ s disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the deficits to 
these assumptions.
Operating in overseas jurisdictions with uncertain 
legislation
Refer to page 28 (Audit Committee report) 
•  The risk: The Group is multinational and is developing its 
operations in a number of emerging markets. Operating in 
these territories presents increased contractual, operational and 
financial risks due to the need to comply with potentially uncertain 
regulatory and legislative environments, including legislation 
relating to foreign exchange and tax. Breaches of compliance 
or inappropriate assumptions over provisioning for the uncertain 
legislation could have a significant effect on the results and 
financial position of the Group and is one of the judgemental areas 
our audit is focused on.
•  Our response: In response to this, our audits included the 
involvement of local specialists where appropriate to analyse 
and challenge the assumptions used to determine provisions for 
legal and tax matters based on their knowledge and experience 
of local regulations and practices. We considered the exposure 
to breaches of legislation by making appropriate enquiry of the 
Group in relation to compliance with laws and regulations and 
the existence and status of any significant legal matters. We also 
reviewed the compliance logs and reports returned by overseas 
locations to identify actual and potential non-compliance with laws 
and regulations, both those specific to the Group’ s business and  47
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
those relating to the conduct of the business generally. Where 
significant matters were identified we obtained confirmations from 
the Group’ s legal counsel. We reviewed correspondence where 
available with the local tax authorities and using our experience 
of local practices and court interpretations we assessed the 
assumptions made by management in arriving at the tax provision 
or, where there are material local indirect taxes, contract results.  
3  Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £2.0m. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark 
of group profit before taxation, which we consider to be one of the 
principal considerations for members of the Company in assessing 
the financial performance of the Group. Materiality represents 4.8% 
of PBT and 4.3% of PBT adjusted for items disclosed separately on 
the face of the income statement. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report all corrected and 
uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a 
value in excess of £0.1m, in addition to other audit misstatements 
below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
In determining the key reporting components at which to conduct 
full scope audits or specified procedures we considered not only the 
financial size of individual components’ operations but also the level 
of risk presented by, for example, the nature, complexity, maturity or 
location of those operations. Audits for Group reporting purposes were 
performed by the Group audit team at the key reporting components 
in the UK and by component auditors in the following countries: 
UK, Norway, Angola and the United Arab Emirates. Audit work in 
these countries was a combination of controls and substantive work 
determined by our assessment of the strength of internal controls 
within each business. In addition, specified audit procedures for Group 
reporting purposes, including the attendance at inventory counts and 
desktop review work, were performed by Group and component 
auditors in the UK, Brazil, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and China. 
These audit procedures covered 96% of total Group revenue; 90% of 
Group profit before taxation; and 90% of total Group assets.    
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the key 
reporting components of the Group were all performed to materiality 
levels set by, or agreed with, the Group audit team. These materiality 
levels were set individually for each component and ranged from 
£0.2m to £1.0m.
Detailed audit instructions were sent to all the auditors in these 
locations. These instructions covered the significant audit areas that 
should be covered by these audits (which included the relevant risks 
of material misstatement detailed above) and set out the information 
required to be reported back to the Group audit team. T elephone 
meetings were also held with the auditors at the majority of locations 
that were not physically visited.
4  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:  
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
5  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we 
are required to report by exception  
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based 
on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•  we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the group’ s performance, business model and strategy; or
•  the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or  
•  the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or  
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or  
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
•  the Directors’ statement, set out on page 44, in relation to going 
concern;   
•  the part of the Corporate governance report on pages 23 to 26 
relating to the Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 45, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view.  A description of the scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’ s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’ s members as a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published 
on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2013a, which 
are incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be read 
to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work 
we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Notes to the financial statements
General information
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of James Fisher and Sons plc (the Company), all of its subsidiary 
undertakings and the Group’ s interest in associates and jointly controlled entities (together referred to as the Group), for the year ended 31 
December 2013.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and on an historical cost basis, modified to include revaluation 
to fair value of certain financial instruments as described below.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and 
financial statements.
Further information regarding the Company’ s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position is set out in the Chairman’ s statement and Strategic report on pages 1 to 21. Further information regarding the financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out in the primary statements and in note 24. In addition, 
note 26 of the financial statements includes the Company’ s objectives; policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risks.
The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through operating cash flows, with borrowings in place to fund acquisitions and 
capital expenditure. The Group also has £68,800,000 of undrawn committed facilities none of which expire within twelve months. The Group’ s 
forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate 
within the level of its current banking facilities.
The Group and Company present their financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), adopted by the 
European Union (adopted IFRS). The Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The 
Company’ s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company and consolidated financial statements were approved for issue 
by the Board of Directors on 3 March 2014.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and related notes for the holding company have not 
been presented in these financial statements. The profit after taxation in the holding company was £47,461,000 (2012: £28,037,000).
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) 
except when otherwise indicated.
Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements and those of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU as at 31 
December 2013 and are applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
1 Significant accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, is set out 
below.
During the year the Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations:
Amendments to existing standards:
Amendments to IAS 1    Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
IFRS 13      Fair Value Measurement
Amendment to IFRS 7   Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Amendments to IAS 19   Employee Benefits
Improvements to IFRS 2012
Other than amendments to IAS 19 the adoption of these standards and interpretations had no impact on the Group.
Restatement of pension costs
The Group and Company has adopted the requirements of the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits from 1 January 2013. The standard 
requires that the discount rate previously applied only to the scheme liabilities is also applied to the scheme assets. Previously separate growth 
assumptions were applied to scheme assets. Scheme administration costs which were previously incorporated into the return on plan assets 
are now included in administration expenses. 57

The impact of the changes set out above was to reduce basic and diluted earnings per share by 0.8p (2012: 0.6p). 
Basis of preparation of Group accounts
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.  Acquisitions are 
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period 
as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and 
losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets and liabilities, are eliminated in full.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers 
under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The investment in joint ventures is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus the Group’ s post acquisition share in the change in net assets of 
the joint ventures, less any impairment provision.  The income statement reflects the Group’ s share of the post tax result of the joint ventures.  
The Group’ s share of any changes recognised by the joint venture in other comprehensive income are also recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in the 
income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders’ equity. On the acquisition of 
non-controlling interests, the difference between the consideration paid and the fair value of the share of net assets acquired is recognised in 
equity. 
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Financial and business risks
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial and business risks. Where possible the Group seeks to minimise these risks through its 
risk management policies.
Pensions
The Group primarily provides pensions to its employees through defined contribution schemes but also has defined benefit obligations. The 
valuation of these defined benefit schemes is subject to a high degree of volatility arising from their exposure to changes in bond yields and 
equity values, and sensitivity to changes in actuarial assumptions, such as to life expectancy. This makes it difficult to predict future potential 
liabilities with any certainty. Details of the Group pension schemes, the assumptions underlying their current valuations and sensitivities in 
respect of these assumptions are set out in note 22. Certain defined benefit obligations relate to industry-wide schemes which are funded by 
current and former employers to the shipping industry. The risk of corporate failure of any of the participants could lead to an increase in the 
Group's share of liability.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any permanent impairment in accordance with the accounting policy on page 60. 
An analysis of the Group's goodwill and the assumptions used to test for impairment together with the sensitivity of the impairment review to 
changes in the key assumptions is set out in note 12. 58
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Notes to the financial statements continued
Impairment of other assets 
The Group reviews the carrying value of all assets for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date. If indicators of impairment exist the 
carrying value of the asset is subject to further testing to determine whether its carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount represents the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, which is determined by measuring the discounted 
cash flows arising from the asset (including ultimate realisation on disposal). Details of asset impairments are included in note 14.
Intangible assets
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on business combinations requires the performance of a review of the acquired 
business to assess whether such assets exist and can be identified separately and reliably measured. Details of the assets identified in the 
acquisitions made during the year are set out in note 17. Details of intangible assets included in the statement of financial position are included 
in note 13.
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration arises on acquisitions and is usually related to the achievement of financial performance targets relating to operating 
profits over an agreed period. The outcome of these arrangements depends on a number of factors outside the control of the business 
including, but not limited to, competition, general economic conditions and the availability of resources within the business to meet its 
obligations to its customers. The Group regularly assesses the likelihood of the targets being achieved during the performance period and 
makes appropriate adjustments to the expected contingent consideration through the income statement.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of the transfer of risks and rewards will vary depending 
on the terms of the sales agreement, the evaluation of the specific risks associated with the performance of the contract (for example design, 
construction and testing) or generally accepted practice where there are no specific arrangements in the contract.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax risk issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such difference will impact the income tax and deferred tax 
provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group has entered the UK tonnage tax regime under which tax on its ship owning and operating activities is based on the net tonnage of 
vessels operated. Income and profits outside this regime are taxed under normal tax rules. This means that it is necessary to make estimates 
of the allocation of some income and expenses between tonnage and non tonnage tax activities. These estimates are subject to agreement 
with the relevant tax authorities and may be revised in future periods.  Further details are provided in notes 8 and 9.
Residual values and estimated remaining lives
Assets other than vessels are depreciated to a zero residual value over their useful economic lives. Residual values for vessels are set initially 
at 20% of purchase cost or fair value at acquisition, which is regarded as an approximation of current residual values. Changes in the residual 
values and estimated lives of assets would result in adjustments to the current and future rate of depreciation and amortisation through the 
income statement or the creation of impairment provisions.  Residual values and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually by the 
Directors taking into account the condition of vessels, future trading expectations and observable market transactions. See note 14 for details 
of movements on tangible fixed assets in the year.
Investments
The Group holds a number of investments in unquoted entities. These interests are accounted for as investments as the Group does not 
consider that it exercises significant influence over the policies and control of these entities. As the fair value of these shareholdings cannot be 
readily ascertained or reliably measured, these investments are held at initial cost subject to annual impairment review.
The Group holds investments in subsidiaries operating in certain jurisdictions where foreign investors are prohibited from owning a majority 
of the equity share capital of locally domicilied entities. Where possible these investments have been structured so that, in the opinion of the 
Directors, the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity to the extent that it is able to consolidate 100% 
of the operations and is not required to recognise a minority interest in these entities. Where this is not possible the Group recognises as a 
minority interest the share of the right to receive future income distributions attributable to the local investor.

Accounting policies
Foreign currency
(i) Group
  The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Company's functional and presentational currency. The net investments 
in overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated from their functional currency into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. The exchange differences arising on the retranslation of opening net assets are taken directly to the translation reserve.
  Exchange differences arising on monetary items forming part of the Group's net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings which are 
denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary undertaking are taken directly to the translation reserve. Exchange differences on 
other foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to provide an effective hedge against Group equity investments in foreign 
currency are taken directly to the translation reserve.
  Exchange differences on the net investment in overseas subsidiary undertakings are recognised in the translation reserve until such time as 
the subsidiary is disposed of at which time they are included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
  The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquistion are translated into Sterling 
at the period end exchange rate. The income and expenses arising in foreign operations are translated at the average exchange rate for the 
reporting period. 
  All other exchange differences on transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.  Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Exchange 
differences arising on settlement of monetary items or on the retranslation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they 
were initially recognised are taken to the income statement.
  T ax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences included in the translation reserve are also dealt with in the translation reserve.
(ii) Company
  T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on settlement of monetary items 
or on the retranslation of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recognised are taken to the income statement.
  All exchange differences on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the income statement.
The Company's investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures 
In its separate financial statements the Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at cost. Income is recognised 
from these investments when its right to receive the dividend is established.
Financial assets
The Group recognises three classes of financial assets:
• Loans and receivables
• Available for sale financial assets
• Derivatives 
(a) Loans and receivables
  These comprise non-derivative financial assets such as trade receivables, with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in 
an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money may have 
a significant impact on their value less any impairment losses. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans or 
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
  If there is evidence of an impairment loss on assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the carrying amount of the asset and the estimated future cash flows (after excluding amounts already provided against), 
discounted at the original effective interest rate. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
  If in a subsequent period the factors which indicated the original decision to impair the asset cease to exist, or are mitigated then the 
previously recognised impairment loss can be reversed subject to the revised carrying value of the asset not exceeding its amortised cost 
at the date the impairment is reversed. Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
  A provision is made against a trade receivable only when there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to recover all of the 
amount due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through the use of a provision for 
doubtful debts account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectable.
(b) Available for sale financial assets
  These are non-derivatives that are either designated or not classed as another category.  These are included as non current assets unless 
intended to be disposed of within twelve months of the balance sheet date. After initial recognition, available for sale financial assets 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses being recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income until the 
investment is derecognised or deemed to be impaired, at which point the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in 
the income statement in the period in which it arises.
1 Significant accounting policies continued 60
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Notes to the financial statements continued
  Where investments are held in unlisted equity shares where there is no active market the investment is held at cost within non-current 
assets and is subject to annual impairment.
  If an available for sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and 
amortisation) and its current fair value, less any previously recognised impairment loss, is transferred from other comprehensive income to 
profit or loss. Reversal of impairment provisions are not recognised in profit or loss.
(c) Derivatives 
  Derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Assets are carried in 
the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement unless designated as a hedging instrument.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination 
are recorded at cost which represents the fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets having finite lives are amortised over their useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that they are impaired. The amortisation period is reviewed at the end of each accounting period. The amortisation of intangible 
assets is recognised in the income statement.
The principal rates used are:
Development costs  20% or over the expected period of product sales     
Intellectual property  5% to 33%    
Patents and Licences 20% or over the period of the licence    
Other Intangibles  20%
Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits arising from that specific asset.
Goodwill
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (2008) - business combinations, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and business 
units from 1 January 2010 represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable to the vendor plus the recognised amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. The 
consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally 
recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill on acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010 represents the excess of the cost of the 
acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the Group incurrs in connection 
with a business combination, are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill is stated at cost less provision for impairment. The carrying value of goodwill arising on each acquisition is reviewed annually for 
impairment but more regularly if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. When an impairment loss is recognised 
it cannot be reversed in a subsequent accounting period, even if the circumstances which led to the impairment cease to exist.
For the purposes of determining impairment of purchased goodwill carried in the balance sheet, all goodwill is allocated against the 
appropriate combination of business units deemed to obtain advantage from the benefits acquired with the goodwill. These are designated as 
cash generating units (CGU).  Impairment is then assessed by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant CGU with the carrying value 
of the CGU's assets and liabilities and related goodwill. Recoverable amount is measured as the higher of the CGU's fair value less cost to sell 
and the value in use. Where relevant in order to assess the value of goodwill the Group combines a number of CGU's. Where the recoverable 
amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
For goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 amortisation ceased at transition to IFRS and it is carried at its previous carrying 
amount subject to provision for impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year to 31 December 1997 and earlier periods which was written off to reserves in accordance with the 
accounting standard then in force, has not been reinstated in the balance sheet and will continue to be accounted for in reserves even if the 
business to which it relates is subsequently disposed of.
Separately disclosed items
Separately disclosed items are those which management believe would provide a clearer indication of the underlying trading performance of 
the Group if they are removed from the underlying results and shown separately. These are usually items which are significant in size or  
non-recurring in nature.
Warranty costs
Provision is made for warranties offered with products where it is probable that an obligation to transfer economic benefits to the customer 
in future will arise. This provision is based on management's assessment of the previous history of claims and probability of future obligations 
arising on a product by product basis. Provisions for warranty costs included in the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 were £911,000  
(31 December 2012: £nil).

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.  Refit costs relating to vessels are 
capitalised when incurred and amortised over 30 months, which is deemed to be the useful economic life of the asset. Other subsequent 
expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits associated with the asset to which it relates.
Depreciation is provided to write-down the cost of property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation to their residual value in equal 
annual instalments over their remaining estimated useful lives.
The principal rates used are:
Freehold property 2.5% 
Leasehold improvements 2.5% or over the period of the lease 
Plant and equipment 5% to 20% 
Ships 4% to 10%
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.
Residual values for vessels are set initially at 20% of purchase cost or fair value at acquisition, which the Directors believe to be an 
approximation of current residual values. Residual values and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually by the Directors and adjusted if 
appropriate to reflect the relevant market conditions and expectations, obsolescence and normal wear and tear.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes expenditure incurred during construction, delivery and modification. Where a substantial 
period of time is required to bring the asset into use attributable finance costs are capitalised and included in the cost of the relevant asset.  
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date the Group asseses whether there are any indications that an asset has been impaired. If any indication exists, the 
Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset concerned. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of its fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use. These calculations are determined for an individual asset unless that asset does not generate 
cash inflows independently from other assets, in which case its value is determined as part of that group of assets. Where the carrying 
amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
T o assess the value in use the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing and 
discontinued operations are recognised in the income statement.
If an event occurs after the recognition of an impairment that leads to a decrease in the amount of the impairment loss previously recognised 
the impairment loss is reversed. The reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not 
exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Research and development costs
Expenditure undertaken by the Group on research is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development costs which represents the application of research to the development of new products or processes 
is capitalised provided that specific projects are identifiable, technically feasible, and the Group has sufficient resources to complete 
development. The useful life of projects meeting the criteria for capitalisation is determined on a project by project basis.
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over its expected useful life on a straight line basis. Capitalised development costs are 
measured at costs less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Other development costs are recognised in the income statement 
as incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition, as follows:
Raw materials, consumables stores and finished goods for sale - purchase cost on a first in first out basis;
Work in progress and finished goods - cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads allocated on a systematic basis based 
on a normal level of activity;
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale or disposal.
Long-term service contracts
(i) General
  Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs relating to the construction contract are 
recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract, in the period in which the work is performed. The stage of 
completion is assessed by reference to physical progress, attributable man hours and costs incurred measured against the expected 
outcome based on the most appropriate method for the specific type of contract. Revenue from the contract is recognised under the 
percentage of completion method whereby recognition is determined by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
 Contract costs incurred that relate to future activity are deferred and recognised as inventory. 62
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Notes to the financial statements continued
 When a loss is expected to be incurred on a long-term contract it is recognised as an expense immediately in the income statement.
  When the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably no profit is recognised. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that costs incurred will be recovered.
(ii) Bid costs
  All bid costs incurred relating to contracts for the design, manufacture or operation of assets or the provision of services to third parties 
are expensed to the income statement as incurred, except for those costs incurred after the point at which the contract award is virtually 
certain. Directly attributable costs incurred subsequent to this point are included within contract costs and amortised over the life of the 
initial period of the contract to which they relate.
Taxation
T onnage tax payable by those Group entities who have entered the tonnage tax regime is provided by reference to net tonnage of qualifying 
vessels at the current rate.
Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits from activities not qualifying for the tonnage tax regime and is recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity, or in other comprehensive 
income.
Current tax is the expected corporation tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, less any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in the financial 
statements and the amounts used for tax purposes, that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, 
with the following exceptions:
•  No provision is made where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction 
which is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
•  No provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and interests in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits 
from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is expected to 
be realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax arising on actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit pension funds is recorded in other comprehensive income. Where 
the cash contributions made to the schemes exceed the service costs recognised in the income statement the current tax arising is recorded 
in other comprehensive income.
No deferred tax is recognised on vessels which are subject to the tonnage tax regime.
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group operates in international markets and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily relating 
to the US Dollar, Euro and Norwegian Kroner.  The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk arising from long-term borrowings.  The Group 
uses derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge risk, in the form of foreign currency contracts, to manage foreign exchange risk and 
interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date that the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. Fair value is 
calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined 
by reference to market values for similar instruments. The recognition of the gains or losses arising on these movements in fair value depends 
on whether a derivative is designated as a hedge and if so the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group recognises two classes of hedges for derivative financial instruments:
•  Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or an unrecognised firm commitment (fair value hedge);
•  Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or recognised assets or liabilities (cash flow hedge).
Cash flow hedges
These can include forward foreign currency contracts which the Group will enter into only if they meet the following criteria:
•  The instrument must be related to a foreign currency risk of a firm commitment;
•  It must involve the same currency as the hedged item;  and
•  It must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Group's operations.
1 Significant accounting policies continued 63
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
These may also include interest rate swaps which must have the following characteristics:
•  The instrument must be related to a recognised asset or a liability; and
•  It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Gains or losses arising on any portion deemed to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where the hedge relates to a firm commitment or forecast transaction which subsequently results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the 
cumulative gain or loss relating to that item is removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.  Otherwise 
the cumulative amount is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the related movements on the 
hedged transaction.
When the term of the hedging instrument expires or it is sold, or where the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any 
cumulative gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until either the related forecast transaction occurs, 
in which case it is recognised in accordance with the policy stated above, or if the hedged transaction is not expected to take place, it is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability in the fair value of an asset or liability of the Group, it is designated as a fair value 
hedge.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement at the same 
time as the related movements in the hedged asset or liability.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Changes in the fair value of any derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting under any of the criteria outlined above are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Calculation of fair values
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using assumptions based on market conditions at 
the balance sheet date or discounted cash flow techniques.
Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings
All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, which represents the fair value of the consideration received 
net of any issue costs associated with other borrowings.  Finance charges, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption 
of debt instruments including preference shares and the direct costs of issue, are accounted for on an amortised cost basis in the income 
statement. Charges are calculated using the effective interest method, and are recognised in the income statement over the term of such 
instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount. 
Accounting for leases
(i) Operating leases
  Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.  Lease payments 
under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(ii) Finance leases
  A lease arrangement under which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item rest with the lessee are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the related item or the present value of the minimum lease payments.
  Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are expensed to the income statement.
 Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset.
Pension plans
(i) Defined contribution scheme
  Under this type of pension plan the Group pays a pre-determined contribution to a separate privately administered pension plan.  Other 
than this contribution the Group has no further legal or constructive obligation to make further contributions to the scheme.
  Obligations for contributions to the scheme are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
(ii) Defined benefit scheme
  A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan under which the amount of pension benefit that an employee receives on retirement is defined 
by reference to factors including age, years of service and compensation.
  The schemes are funded by payments determined by periodic actuarial calculations agreed between the Group and the trustees of 
trustee-administered funds. 64
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Notes to the financial statements continued
  The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current 
period (current service cost) and to current and prior periods (to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation). Current 
service costs are recognised in the income statement in the current year. Past service costs are recognised in the income statement 
immediately. When a settlement (which eliminates all obligations for benefits already accrued) or a curtailment (which reduces future 
obligations as a result of a reduction in future entitlement)  occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current 
actuarial assumptions and the gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment 
occurs.
  The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in the present value of scheme obligations resulting from the 
passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account 
material changes in the obligation during the year. The return on scheme assets is determined by multiplying the fair value of plan assets by 
the discount rate, as determined at the start of the annual reporting period, taking account of any changes in the plan assets held during 
the period as a result of contributions or benefits payments. The  return on scheme assets and the interest cost are recognised in the 
income statement in finance costs.
  A liability is recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Group's net obligations to the schemes which is calculated separately for each 
scheme.
  The liability represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the scheme 
assets.
  The defined benefit obligations represent the estimated amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their services 
in current and prior periods, discounted at a rate representing the yield on a high quality corporate bond at the balance sheet date, 
denominated in the same currency as the obligations, and having the same terms to maturity as the related pension liability, applied to 
the estimated future cash outflows arising from these obligations.  The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected 
unit credit method.  When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised 
past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in 
future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits,consideration is given to any minimum funding 
requirements that apply to the plan.
  An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. When the 
benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit related to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. T o the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
  Actuarial gains and losses on experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions that arise subsequent to 1 January 2004 are 
recognised in the period in which they arise directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
Share based payments
The Company operates executive share option schemes and a savings related share option scheme under which options have been granted 
to employees of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
For options granted since 7 November 2002 the fair value of employee services rendered in exchange for the grant of options is  determined 
by the fair value of the option at the date of grant. The total amount, which is expensed over the specified period until the options can be 
exercised (the vesting period), is recognised cumulatively as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the option is determined by the use of mathematical modelling techniques, including the Black-Scholes option pricing model 
and the Binomial model.
Non-market vesting conditions (such as profitability and growth targets) are excluded from the fair value calculation but included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The Company re-assesses its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance sheet date.  Any 
adjustments to the original estimates are recognised in the income statement (and equity) over the remaining vesting period with any element 
of any adjustments relating to prior periods recognised in the current period.  No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, (such as the performance of the Group relative to a group or index 
composed of third party entities). These are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance conditions are satisfied.
In addition to failure by the employee to exercise an option in accordance with the exercise period allowed by the scheme, an award made to 
an employee under a share option scheme is deemed to lapse when either the scheme is cancelled by the Company, or when an employee, 
who continues to qualify for membership of a scheme, ceases to pay contributions to that scheme. In these circumstances the full remaining 
unexpired cost of the award will be expensed in the period in which the option lapses.
When awards are made to employees of a subsidiary, the award is treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary with a corresponding 
increase in the cost of investment being reflected in the Company balance sheet. No reversal of previously recognised expense is made when 
options lapse.
1 Significant accounting policies continued 65
James Fisher and Sons plc 
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Where the exercise of options is satisfied by the issue of shares by the Company the nominal value of any shares issued from the exercise of 
options is credited to share capital with the balance of the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, credited to share premium.
Short-term employee benefits
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for short-term employee benefits, including bonuses, only when contractually or 
constructively obliged.
Treasury shares
Shares issued by the Company which are held by the Company or its subsidiary entities (including the Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(ESOT)), are designated as treasury shares. The cost of these shares is deducted from equity. No gains or losses are recognised on the 
purchase, sale, cancellation or issue of treasury shares.  Consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity.
ESOP Trust
Company shares are held in an employee share ownership plan (ESOP). The finance costs and administration costs relating to the ESOP are 
charged to the income statement.  Dividend income arising on own shares is excluded in arriving at profit before taxation and deducted from 
aggregate dividends paid.  The shares are ignored for the purposes of calculating the Group's earnings per share.
Revenue
Revenue, after excluding trade discounts and value added tax, represents the provision of goods and services by the Group and its 
subsidiaries in the normal course of business and is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer.  
The transfer of risks and rewards is assumed to pass to the customer on delivery of the goods or completion of the provision of the relevant 
services.
Where services rendered relate to long-term contracts and are not completed at the balance sheet date, revenue is recognised in proportion 
to the stage of completion of the transaction measured by reference to the proportion of total expected costs incurred. Revenue is not 
recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due.
Details of the revenue recognised on long-term contracts are included on page 69.
Rentals receivable under operating leases are credited to revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term. There are no rental 
commitments in respect of long-term leasing arrangements.
Non-current assets held for sale
On classification as held for sale, non-current assets are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, as are any gains and losses on subsequent re-
measurement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits included in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less from the original acquisition date. Cash and cash equivalents included in the cash flow statement comprise 
cash and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts. Further analysis of movements on cash equivalents is given in note 25.
Other reserves 
Other reserves comprise the following:
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of operations whose financial statements are 
denominated in foreign currencies as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company's net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to 
hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Intra Group financial instruments
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtness of other companies within the Group, the 
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect the Company treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the 
guarantee. 66
James Fisher and Sons plc

New standards and interpretations not applied
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) have also 
issued the following standards and interpretations which have been endorsed by the EU at 31 December 2013 with an effective date of 
implementation after the date of these financial statements:
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRSs)      Effective Date (for Group)
IFRS 10 (revised)  Consolidated Financial Statements    1 January 2014
IFRS 11 (revised)  Joint Arrangements     1 January 2014
IFRS 12 (revised)  Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities    1 January 2014
IAS 27 (revised)  Separate Financial Statements (2011)    1 January 2014
IAS 28 (revised)  Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011)  1 January 2014

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group's financial 
statements in the period of initial application. 
2 Segmental information
Operating segments
During 2013, management has determined that the definition of operating segments should be revised to better reflect the nature of the 
Group's businesses. The revised segments, which continue to be based on the products and services provided by the business, are defined 
as follows:
Marine Support - includes the hire and sale of large scale pneumatic fenders and ship to ship transfer services, and the design and supply of 
systems for monitoring strains and stress in structures.
Offshore Oil - manufacture and rental of equipment for the offshore oil and gas industry and the design and manufacture of specialist 
downhole tools and equipment for extracting oil.
Specialist T echnical - provision of subsea services including submarine rescue and saturation diving including maintenance, asset 
management and consultancy services and non-destructive testing, decommissioning and remote operations and monitoring services 
predominantly to the nuclear industry.
Tankships - engaged in the sea transportation of clean petroleum products in North West Europe.
The main changes to the previous structure are that the fendering mooring and strain businesses are transferred out of the Specialist T echnical 
segment into a new segment, Marine Support. The former Defence segment together with Divex and the nuclear activities is included within 
Specialist T echnical. The Offshore Oil segment is unchanged and the Marine Oil division is renamed ‘T ankships’.
Inter segmental sales are made using prices determined on an arms length basis.
The Group's largest customer accounted for 8% of Group external revenue (2012: 12%).
Business segments
The following tables present revenue and profit and certain asset and liability information regarding the Group's business segments for the 
years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012 (restated for the changes described above).
Further information on the activities of these segments is included in the Chairman's statement and Strategic report on pages 1 to 21.

Geographic information
The following table represents revenue, expenditure and certain asset information regarding the Group's geographic presence for the years 
ended 2013 and 2012. Further analysis of the geographic spread of the business outside the European area has been provided in order to 
enable a better understanding of the scope of the Group's overseas activities.
Geographical revenue is determined by the location in which the product or service is provided. Where customers receive the product or 
service in one geographical location for use or shipment to another it is not practicable for the Group to identify this and the revenue is 
attributed to the location of the initial shipment. The geographical allocation of segmental assets and liabilities is determined by the location of 
the attributable business unit.

5 Operating profit
This is stated after charging/(crediting)
On 19 August 2013 the Group disposed of its 25% interest in Foreland Holdings Limited for a gross consideration of £11,425,000. The 
gain of £6,795,000 is included in the Specialist T echnical division. In August 2013 the Group disposed of the marine leisure business of 
Fendercare Australia for a consideration of £1,395,000. An operating loss on disposal of £182,000 has been recognised on this transaction 
and is included in the Marine Support division. On 31 December 2012 the Group disposed of the entire issued share capital of The Railway 
Engineering Company Limited (TRE) for a gross consideration of £25,500,000. The gain of £20,896,000 is included in the Marine Support 
division. Details of disposals are set out in note 17.
In 2012 the Directors performed an impairment review of its fleet of vessels. The Group's strategy is to make further adjustments to its 
fleet both in total and between tonnage types, to meet contracted demand. As a result of the review an impairment was recognised in the 
T ankships division of £7,573,000 and £1,659,000 in Marine Support in the income statement. Following the disposal of m.v. Asperity in 
December 2013, £1,355,000 of the T ankships provision was utilised. The Directors have reviewed the impairment provision at 31 December 
2013 and having considered the global vessel market believe that the remaining provision is appropriate. Further details are given in note 14.

9 Deferred tax
Group
Deferred tax at 31 December relates to the following:
Deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet have been analysed according to the net exposures in each tax 
jurisdiction.
The gross movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows:
At 31 December 2013 the Group has no recognised deferred income tax liability (2012: £nil) in respect of taxes that would be payable on the 
unremitted earnings of certain of the Company's subsidiaries. At 31 December 2013 the unrecognised gross temporary differences in respect 
of reserves of overseas subsidiaries is £37,444,000 (2012: £45,327,000). No deferred income tax liability has been recognised in respect 
of this temporary timing difference due to the foreign profits exemption, the availability of double taxation relief and the ability to control the 
remittance of earnings.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.
The effective income tax rate on the underlying profit before tax is 18.6% (2012: 19.0%). The effective rate on profit before income and 
tonnage tax from continuing operations is 16.2% (2012: 13.6%).
Unrecognised tax losses
At 31 December 2013 the Group has unrecognised tax losses of £77,000 (2012: £77,000). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in 
respect of these losses due to the uncertainty relating to their future recovery.
The Group has elected to enter tonnage tax with effect from 2000. This election was renewed in 2009. The shipping activities of FT Everard 
and Sons Limited entered the regime on acquisition in 2006. The election had the effect of eliminating future potential tax liabilities on shipping 
profits of qualifying ships in the United Kingdom. The regime includes provisions whereby a proportion of capital allowances previously 
claimed by the Group can be subject to tax in the event of a significant number of assets being sold and not replaced. This contingent liability 
diminishes to nil over the seven year period following entry into tonnage tax. The contingent liability relating to the ships operated by the Group 
on entry into tonnage tax has expired in accordance with this seven year provision. 
There is no provision for deferred tax on accelerated capital allowances for activities which fall within tonnage tax.
UK corporation tax rates are reducing from 28% to 20% over a period of four years from 2011. The rate reduced to 23% on 1 April 2013 
and further reductions to 21% and 20% effective from 1 April 2014 and 1 April 2015 respectively have also been enacted. This will reduce 
the Group's future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax balance at 31 December 2013 has been calculated based on application 
of the reduced 20% UK corporation tax rate from the relevant date and the impact of the remeasurement has been included in the income 
statement and other comprehensive income as appropriate.

10 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, after excluding ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust and held as treasury 
shares.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
At 31 December 2013 172,227 options (2012: 10,315) were excluded from the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 
calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
The average market value of the Company's shares for purposes of calculating the dilutive effect of share options was based on quoted 
market prices for the period during which the options were outstanding.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following number of shares:

12 Goodwill
Group
Impairment of goodwill 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units (CGUs) 
described in note 2.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU by segment is:
The recoverable amount of these units has been assessed based on value in use calculations using cash projections based on financial 
budgets approved by the Board for the next financial year together with projections derived from those budgets for the following four years. A 
terminal value of cash flows beyond that date has been calculated at a growth rate in line with management's long-term expectations for the 
relevant market.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations include gross margin, discount rate, inflation of overheads and payroll and growth 
rates.
Growth estimates are based on the levels achieved in the current and historic periods adjusted for management expectations of the impact 
of management actions and the future development of the relevant market. Short-term growth rates for turnover vary between 2% and 58% 
which allows for significant growth in project based activities. These growth rates are considered to be conservative and vary dependant on 
the market conditions in which the CGU operates. Direct costs are expected to increase in line with turnover in initial periods before stabilising 
at a long-term inflationary level of 2%. Administrative costs are anticipated to increase at 1%.
Payroll inflation reflects the fact that the Group provides specialist services in a competitive market. Payroll costs are therefore influenced 
by the need to retain skilled staff. As a result the initial growth rates for payroll costs range between 2% in mature business to up to 6% for 
specific posts in businesses located in areas where skilled staff are in short supply.
Discount rates reflect management's estimate of the return required from the business to reflect the cost of funds plus an appropriate risk 
premium. This has been determined with reference to the CGU's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and adjusting it for risks specific 
to each CGU's cash flows. The range of pre-tax discount rates used is 9.5% to 10.6% (2012: range of 10.2% to 11.2%). An effective tax rate 
of 18.4% has been assumed.
Based on the value in use calculations performed no impairment of any of the cash generating units is required.
The key assumptions applied to each CGU are as follows:
Marine Support; maximum short-term gross profit growth of businesses of between 4% and 40% with long-term growth of between 2% and 
7%, maximum growth in direct costs of 42% with between 2% and 5% increase in the long-term.
Offshore Oil; maximum short-term gross profit growth of between 10% and 20% with long-term growth of 2%, maximum growth in direct 
costs of 20% with 2% increase in the long-term.
Specialist T echnical; maximum short-term gross profit growth of 20% with long-term growth of 2%, maximum growth in direct costs of 17% 
with 2% increase in the long-term.
T ankships; maximum short-term gross profit growth of 17% with long-term growth of between 1% and 2%, maximum growth in direct costs 
of 13% with between 1% and 2% increase in the long-term.
Long-term growth has been assumed at a steady market rate of 2% in line with the requirements of IAS 36.
Sensitivity to impairment
Sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the impact of a reasonable change in a key assumption (e.g. increase in discount rate by 
2%, removal of long-term growth) and no impairment issues were identified. 77

Reclassifications

Impairment provisions
In 2012 the Group  recognised an impairment provision of £9,232,000 in respect of its fleet of vessels. The impairment relates to the class of 
assets referred to as ships in the table above. The segmental allocation of the provision between the T ankships and Marine Support segments 
is shown in note 2. 
The impairment was calculated based on the estimated value in use of the assets compared to their current carrying value. Income has been 
estimated over a period of 5 years being the estimated time required to dispose of the vessels with allowance made for the estimated disposal 
value of the vessels, less the costs directly attributable to the disposal or scrapping of the asset. Income has been determined by calculating 
the most likely performance achievable by the vessels given current expectations of the value of contracts available and the expected market 
conditions over the period. The related expenses of operating the vessels reflect the expected changes in costs including labour, insurance 
and fuel over the period. These values have then been discounted at a post tax rate of  8.8%. The rate has been determined based on the 
after tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group, adjusted for the relative risk profile of the business segment. 79

consideration of £11,425,000. Further details of the disposal are included in note 17.
On 1 September 2012 the Group acquired an additional 10% interest in Fender Care Malaysia SDN BHD for a consideration of £957,000 
which increased the Group's equity interest in the business to 40%. Goodwill of £720,000 arose on the acquisition of this interest and is

Available for sale 
Available for sale financial assets represents a 17.2% (2012: 17.2%) equity interest in ordinary shares in SEML De Co-operation Transmanche, 
an unlisted company incorporated in France, whose main activity is a port and ferry operator. 
The Group has a 50% interest in DivexDomeyer GmbH, a company incorporated in Germany which provides in-service support and 
aftermarket services to the German Navy. The Group does not actively participate in the operation and control of that business. Related party 
transactions with DivexDomeyer GmbH are set out in note 28.
The investments listed above are in unquoted entities whereby the fair value of the shareholding cannot be readily ascertained or measured 
reliably. The investments are therefore held at initial cost and are subject to an annual impairment review. No impairment was required at 31 
December 2013 (2012: £Nil).

Year ended 31 December 2013 
On 5 March 2013 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Divex Limited and its subsidiaries (Divex), for an initial cash 
consideration of £20,800,000. The principal activities of Divex are the design, supply and assembly of diving and subsea equipment. Further 
contingent consideration is payable of up to £13,000,000 based on the future profitability of both the core commercial diving business and 
earnings from the sale of saturated diving systems during the five year period ending in December 2017. Whilst the achievement of these 
targets is contingent on both the expected size of the market for saturated diving systems and Divex's ability to win a significant proportion of 
it, management believe that the requirements will be met and have provided in full for the consideration due, having allowed for the impact of 
the time value of money on the expected dates on which the consideration will be paid.
On 19 August 2013 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Osiris Marine Services Limited and Osiris Underwater Engineering 
Services Limited (Osiris) for an initial consideration of £3,250,000. The principal activities of Osiris are the supply of diving and subsea 
services to the renewable energy sector. Further contingent consideration of up to a maximum of £1,250,000 is payable, linked to future 
annual profitability targets for the  two years ended 30 June 2015. Management has reviewed its forecasts at the end of December 2013 
and concluded that it is unlikely that the minimum target for the year to 30 June 2014 will be achieved. The contingent consideration 
payable for that period has therefore not been provided . Provision has been made for the remaining contingent consideration on the basis 
of management's current forecasts and this has been adjusted for the time value of money based on the expected date of payment. The 
outcome of these forecasts remains uncertain as to the volume, timing and profitablity of available contracts.
The provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are set out below. The businesses are expected to benefit from synergies 
derived from common marketing and distribution bases. Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets including the anticipated impact on 
these businesses of distributing their products to existing Group customers, that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due 
to their nature.

Trade receivables in the acquired entities comprise gross contracted amounts of £5,349,000. There is doubt over the collectability of 
£297,000 of this amount.
On 26 July 2013 the Group acquired the trade and assets of The Underwater Centre Fremantle Pty Limited, a commercial diving training 
centre. The consideration of £712,000 related to the acquisition of £241,000 in relation to tangible fixed assets and £497,000 has been 
treated as an intangible asset representing the value of customer relationships. Deferred tax of £149,000 has been recognised on the 
acquisition. During the year the Group also acquired the trade and assets of a maritime engineering consultancy for a consideration of 
£119,000, which resulted in goodwill of £116,000.
The Group has identified intangible assets in respect of customer relationships in the various businesses. These relate to the major customers 
of acquired businesses in their main markets. Cash flow forecasts have been calculated over five years being the expected period over which 
the Group will benefit from the relationships which have been inherited with the acquisitions. The calculations are based on local management 
forecasts and have been discounted at rates of between 9% and 15% reflecting the risk factors associated with these cash flows. 
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition expenses
The Group incurred acquisition expenses of £939,000 in relation to these business combinations which have been charged to the income 
statement and included within administration expenses.

22 Retirement benefit assets and obligations
The retirement benefit obligations included in the Group and Company balance sheets relate to The James Fisher and Sons plc pension fund 
for Shore Staff, (Shore staff);  together with the Group’ s obligations to the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF), an industry wide 
scheme which is also accounted for as a defined benefit scheme. The Company has obligations under the Shore Staff and under the MNOPF 
scheme, the balance of which relates to its subsidiary, FT Everard and Sons Limited.
The Group has two defined benefit schemes located in Norway. These are included in the table below at their fair value based on an actuarial 
valuation as at 31 December 2013.
The valuations of the schemes have been updated to 31 December 2013 by qualified actuaries using agreed assumptions as detailed in the 
table of assumptions included below.
The Group’ s obligations in respect of its pension schemes at 31 December 2013 were as follows:
Details of the schemes operated by the Group are as follows:
James Fisher and Sons plc pension fund for shore staff
The assets of this scheme are held in a separate trustee administered account. The scheme was closed to new members in October 2001 
when the Company changed to a defined contribution scheme for all new members. The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the 
advice of professionally qualified actuaries. These financial statements incorporate the latest full actuarial valuation of the Shore Staff Scheme 
carried out as at 1 August 2010, rolled forward to 31 December 2013. 
The scheme closed to future accrual on 31 December 2010. During 2012 a Group subsidiary, James Fisher Nuclear Limited secured a 
contract which required the provision of defined benefits to three transferring employees. These benefits are provided through the Shore Staff 
Scheme. There has been no transfer of past service rights into the scheme. 
Contributions to the scheme from the Company amounted to £1,615,000 (2012: £1,615,000). 
Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund
In 2005 the High Court established that former as well as existing employers are liable to make payments in respect of the funding deficit of 
the MNOPF . The Company was informed by the trustees as to the level of annual payments it will be required to make into the fund over a 
period of ten years commencing October 2005 representing its share of the deficit disclosed in the initial actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 
March 2003. 
The trustees have also indicated that they may make calls for further contributions in the future, if new deficits arise or if other employers liable 
for contributions are not able to pay their share. The MNOPF is valued every three years and further deficits have typically been funded over a 
ten year period. In May 2013 the trustees of the scheme concluded the triennial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2012. The Group’ s 
share of the revised deficit was £4,163,000 and this has been accounted for in the calculation of its 2013 liability.
Since the Company has no control over the calls for contributions made from the MNOPF , it has determined that the fund should be 
accounted for as a defined benefit scheme and its liability recognised accordingly. The share of the Group and Company in the MNOPF as 
advised by the trustees is Group 3.0% (2012: 3.3%) and Company 1.4% (2012: 1.7%). Disclosures relating to this scheme are based on 
these allocations. The liability recognised represents the discounted value of committed cash flows. 
Information supplied by the Trustees of the MNOPF has been reviewed by the Company’ s actuaries. The principal assumption in the review is 
the discount rate on the scheme’ s liabilities which is 4.65% (2012: 4.45%). The disclosures below relate to the Group’ s share of the assets and 
liabilities within the MNOPF .
Actuarial assumptions
The last actuarial valuations performed have been updated to 31 December 2013 by the Company’ s actuary. The scheme’ s assets are stated 
at their market values on the respective balance sheet dates. The overall expected rates of return on assets reflect the risk free rate of return 
plus an appropriate risk premium based on the nature of the relevant asset category. The principal assumptions used in updating the latest 
valuations for each of the schemes were:

The post retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increase in longevity. The “current” disclosures above relate to assumptions 
based on longevity (in years) following retirement at the balance sheet date, with “future” being that relating to a member who is currently 45 
years old.
Investments
The schemes’ assets do not include any of the Group’ s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or used by the Group.
Restatement of pension costs
As referred to in note 1, the Group has adopted the requirements of the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits from 1 January 2013.  
The long-term employee benefit costs are now measured by applying the discount rate previously applied only to the gross liability to the net 
pension deficit. The tables below have been adjusted to reflect the restatement of prior period data.
Sensitivities
The key sensitivities on the major schemes may be summarised as follows
Shore staff scheme
Key measure Change in assumption Change in Deficit
Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 3.1%
Rate of inflation Increase by 0.25% Increase by 2.8%

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses relating to all schemes recognised since 1 January 2004 in the Group and Company 
statement of comprehensive income is a loss of £40.6m (2012: £35.1m). The Directors do not consider it to be possible to determine how 
much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS  and taken directly to equity of £12.8m in the Group and Company is 
attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes. Consequently the directors are unable to determine the 
amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group and Company statements of comprehensive income 
before January 2004.
Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. The pension charge for the year for these arrangements is equal to the 
contributions paid and was £4,486,000 (2012: £3,162,000). During the year the Company contributed £306,000 (2012: £327,000) into 
defined contribution schemes.
23 Share based payments
The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and a Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) in respect of directors and certain 
employees. Further details on these schemes are included in the Director’ s Remuneration report on pages 30 to 41. The Company also 
operates a Savings Related Save as You Earn (SRSOS) scheme for eligible employees which is HM Revenue and Customs approved.
Executive share option scheme 1995 (1995 ESOS)
Share options up to a maximium limit of four times base salary may be awarded to board directors and senior executives. The exercise price 
is determined at the date of grant and may be no lower than the market price on the date of grant. The options vest if the increase in the 
Company’ s diluted earnings per ordinary share over a continuous period of three years exceeds inflation and is at least 9%. A failure to meet 
this target increase during the performance period causes the options to lapse. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There 
are no cash settlement alternatives. The last award made under this scheme was on 10 March 2003.
Executive share option scheme 2005  (2005 ESOS)
Share options up to a maximum limit 100% of base salary may be awarded to board directors and senior executives. The exercise price 
is equal to the market value at the date of grant. The options vest depending on the Company’ s total shareholder return relative to the 
constituents of the FTSE Small Cap index (excluding Investment Trusts). If performance over a three year period is in the upper quartile, 100% 
of the options will vest. For options granted before 31st December 2012 if performance is at the bottom of the median, (second) quartile 
40% will vest. For options granted thereafter 25% will vest at median level. The amount vesting will decrease on a straight line basis between 
the median and upper quartile. If performance is below the median quartile no shares will vest. A failure to meet these conditions during 
the performance period causes the options to lapse. The contractual life of each option granted is ten years. There are no cash settlement 
alternatives. Awards were made under this scheme on 9 April 2013.
Savings related share option scheme (SRSOS) 
All employees, subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee, may apply for share options under an employee save as you earn plan 
which may from time to time be offered by the Company. In order to comply with HM Revenue and Customs’ requirements an individual’ s 
participation is limited so that the aggregate price payable for shares under option at any time does not exceed the statutory limit. Options 
granted under the plans will normally be exercisable if the employee remains in employment and any other conditions set by the remuneration 
committee have been satisfied. Options are normally exercisable at the end of the related savings contract but early exercise is permitted in 
certain limited circumstances. The performance period will not normally be less than three and a half years or greater than seven and a half 
years. Awards were made under this scheme on 7 May 2013.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
Share options up to a maximium of 100% of base salary may be awarded to main board directors and senior executives. The exercise price 
of the option is £nil. In respect of awards granted up to 31 December 2008, the options vest if the increase in the Company’ s diluted earnings 
per ordinary share over the performance period is at least equal to the rate of inflation plus 9%. A failure to meet this target increase during 
the performance period causes the options to lapse. The contractual life of each option granted is three years. There are no cash settlement 
alternatives. 92
James Fisher and Sons plc 
For options granted since 31 December 2008 the options vest in full if the increase in diluted earnings per ordinary share over the performance 
period is at least equal to the rate of inflation plus 18%. If the increase is between 9% and 18% above the rate of inflation the amount of shares 
vesting reduces on a pro rata basis until at growth of 9% one third of the options granted will vest. Failure to reach the 9% plus the rate of inflation 
threshold results in all options lapsing. There are no cash settlement alternatives. Awards were made under this scheme on 8 April 2013.
The expense recognised for share based payments relating to equity settled share based payments transactions is £1,205,000 (2012: 
£1,192,000).
The Company has granted conditional awards in the form of options over shares or conditional rights to have shares transferred to certain 
employees under the LTIP scheme (approved at the Annual General Meeting) over 476,317 (2012: 583,426) ordinary shares of 25p each.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of and movements in share options during the year. In

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was £10.25 (2012: £6.46).
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2013, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 3 years and 10 months (2012: 4 
years and 2 months).
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was £5.40 (2012: £3.44). The range of exercise prices for options 
outstanding at the end of the year was £3.27 - £10.50 (2012: £3.27 - £6.73).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was £10.14 (2012: £6.59).
For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2013, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 4 years and 10 months (2012: 5 
years and 2 months).
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was £5.74 (2012: £3.04). The range of exercise prices for options 
outstanding at the end of the year was £3.27 - £10.50 (2012: £3.27 - £6.73).
The fair value of equity settled share based payments has been estimated as at date of grant using statistical models which will most 
appropriately determine the fair value of each type of scheme. The Black Scholes model has been used for the SRSOS and the LTIP 
schemes, the binomial model for the 1995 ESOS and the Monte Carlo model for the 2005 ESOS.

Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’ s capital management policy is to maintain a strong credit rating and covenant ratios in order to be able to 
support the continued growth of its trading businesses and so maximise shareholder value.
The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through operating cash flows, with borrowings in place to fund acquisitions and 
capital expenditure. At 31 December 2013 the Group had £68,800,000 (2012: £65,600,000) of undrawn committed facilities none of which 
expire within twelve months. 
The Group is required to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to earnings before interest and depreciation and amortisation 
(EBITDA), net interest costs to earnings before interest (EBIT) and EBIT and operating lease costs to net interest and operating lease costs. 
The Group has met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 December 2013. The Directors have prepared forecasts of the cash flows for 
the subsequent eighteen month period which indicate that taking into account the factors noted above the Group will meet its covenant 
requirements for this period. The Group has a borrowing covenant which restricts the total amount that it is able to borrow under revolving 
credit facilities to a maximum of £150,000,000 (2012: £150,000,000). 
The Group manages its capital structure through maintaining close relationships with its bankers who provide the majority of funds used 
for acquisitions. Capital is monitored by measuring the gearing ratio which is a measure derived from net debt divided by capital. Net 
debt comprises interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Capital  represents net equity attributable to the 
equity holders of the parent. Return on capital employed is also monitored. The Group’ s dividend policy is based on the expected growth 
in sustainable income streams after making provision for the retention of capital to invest in growth and acquisitions. In evaluating growth 
investment opportunities the Group has a target of 15% pre tax return on the capital invested.

The reasons for the change in gearing over the previous year are discussed in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 21. 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Interest rate risk
• Foreign exchange risk
Details of the Group’ s financial instrument risk management objectives, strategies and policies are set out on pages 1 to 21 of the Strategic report.
Further information on these risks is presented below and is included in other disclosures throughout these consolidated financial statements. 96

Notes to the financial statements continued
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. These arise principally from the Group’ s receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the 
maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group’ s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual 
characteristics of each customer and the industry and country in which each customer operates. The Group has a number of large customers 
including Government agencies in the UK and overseas, major oil companies and other multinational corporations. The ten largest customers 
of the Group accounted for approximately 30% of Group revenue (2012: 35%). No customer accounted for more than 8% of Group revenue. 
In 2012 one customer, a multinational company in the Oil and Gas sector, accounted for 12% of revenue.
New customers are subject to creditworthiness checks and credit limits are subject to approval by senior management. Goods are sold 
subject to retention of title clauses so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are generally on 30 to 60 days terms. At 31 December the value of trade debtors outstanding was:
The Group establishes an allowance for unrecoverable amounts movements on which are as follows:

The Group considers that the trade receivables that have not been provided against and are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible 
based on historic payment behaviour and extensive analysis of underlying customers’ credit ratings. Based on historic default rates, the Group 
believes that apart from the amounts included in the table above, no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables. 
No other receivables are considered to be past due.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages its cash resources 
to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due but in a manner designed to maximise the benefit of those 
resources whilst ensuring the security of investment resources. The Group forecasts the profile of its cash requirements on a monthly basis 
and ensures that sufficient facilities are available to meet peak requirements which occur at predictable times in the year. The Group manages 
the maturity profile of its borrowings by maintaining a regular dialogue with its lenders and ensuring that it commences the renegotiation of 
facilities sufficiently early to allow a comprehensive review of its requirements before completion.

that the Group negotiations with individual lenders follow an orderly process which does not expose the group to the possibility of a significant 
reduction in available facilites in a single period. At 31 December 2013, the Group has available £68,800,000 of undrawn committed bank 
facilities (2012: £65,600,000).

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
At 31 December 2013 the Group’ s cash balances included £3,784,000 denominated in Angolan Kwanza and held in James Fisher Angola 
Limitada. A change in Angolan legislation effective from 1 July 2013 required in-country monetary transfers to be transacted in local currency. 
Exchange control regulations can potentially impact the transferability of cash balances in certain countries of operation.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its transactional exposures.  Most forward exchange contracts have maturities of less 
than one year after the balance sheet date.  Forward exchange contracts which qualify as effective cash flow hedges are included at their fair 
value in the hedging reserve and in current assets or short-term liabilities until the earlier of their maturity or the date the transaction to which 
they relate is recognised at which point they are transferred to the income statement. 
Changes in the level of exchange rates will have an impact on consolidated earnings. The following table shows the impact on earnings 
of a 5% strengthening in the exchange rate in the Group’ s key currencies against Sterling. The obverse movements would be of the same 
magnitude. These amounts have been calculated by applying changes in exchange rates to the Group’ s estimated foreign currency revenues 
and costs and its net investment in entities which do not use Sterling as their base currency and include the impact of forward exchange 
contracts.
Interest rate risk
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The interest rate profile of the Group’ s 
financial assets and liabilities are set out in the table below. The Group has used interest rate swaps to convert interest rates on certain 
borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.

financial assets and liabilities are set out in the table below. The Group uses interest rate swaps to convert interest rates on certain borrowings 
from floating rates to fixed rates, details of the interest rate swaps are shown in the table below. Where hedging criteria are met the Group 
classifies interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.  Over the longer term permanent changes in interest rates 
would have an impact on consolidated earnings. At 31 December 2013 a general increase of one percentage point would have had the

Fair value hierarchy
The Group classifies fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making measurements 
of fair value. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
(a) Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
(b)  Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
(c) Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The following table shows an analysis of financial instruments carried at fair value by the level of fair value hierarchy:

Contingent liabilities
(a)  In the ordinary course of the Company’ s business, counter indemnities have been given to bankers in respect of custom bonds, foreign 
exchange commitments and bank guarantees.
(b)  A Group VAT registration is operated by the Company and 27 group undertakings in respect of which the Company is jointly and severally 
liable for all amounts due to HM Revenue and Customs under the arrangement.
(c)  A guarantee has been issued by the Group and Company to charter parties in respect of obligations of a subsidiary, James Fisher Everard 
Limited, in respect of charters relating to seven vessels.  The charters expire between 2014 and 2016.
(d)  Subsidiaries of the Group have issued performance and payment guarantees to third parties with a total value of £6,850,000 (2012: 
£3,017,000).
(e)  The Trustees of the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) have indicated that under the terms of the High Court ruling in 2005 
which established the liability of past employers to fund the deficit on the Post 1978 section of the MNOPF , they may make calls for further 
contributions in the future if additional actuarial deficits arise or if other employers liable for contributions are not able to pay their share. The 
Group and Company remains jointly and severally liable for any future shortfall in recovery of the deficit.
(f)  The Group has give an unlimited guarantee to the Singapore Navy in respect of the performance of First Response Marine Pte Ltd, its 
Singapore joint venture, in relation to the provision of submarine rescue and related activities. Further details of this joint venture are given in 
note 15.
(g)  In the normal course of business, the Company and certain subsidiaries have given parental and subsidiary guarantees in support of loan 
and banking arrangements.
(h)  In 2011 the High Court established that past employers as well as current employers of the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF) 
would be required to fund any deficit on the MNRPF . The trustees of the scheme are currently consulting with past and present employers 
regarding the method to be used to calculate the liability and based on this the extent of any liability individual employers may have. Further 
legal adjudication will be required before the nature and extent of the liabilities in respect of individual employers can be established. The 
Trustees have confirmed that they believe that the Group has a liability in respect of this scheme. Due to the uncertainty associated with the 
timing and calculation of this liability the directors have concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision at this time.

Notes
1.  Any member who has not elected to receive the Annual Report and Accounts for 2013 may obtain copies by writing to the Company 
Secretary, Fisher House, PO Box 4, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, LA14 1HR.  Members who wish to receive the printed Annual Report 
and Accounts, free of charge, in future years should write to the Company’ s Registrars, Freepost RL YX-GZTU-KRRG, SAS, The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 9ZA.
2.  Any member entitled to vote at the above meeting may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and, on a poll, vote instead of 
him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in order to represent a member. A proxy could be the 
Chairman, another director of the Company or (if you wish the proxy to speak on your behalf) another person who has agreed to attend 
and represent a member. Details of how to appoint the Chairman or another person as a proxy using the proxy form are set out in the 
notes to the proxy form. A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by him. Completion of the proxy form will not preclude a member from attending and 
voting in person, in which case that member’ s proxy appointment will automatically be terminated. Proxy forms, duly executed (including 
any authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified notarially), should be returned to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU.  Alternatively you may submit your proxy form online by accessing the Shareholder 
portal at www.capitashareportal.com, logging in and selecting the “proxy voting” link.  If you have not previously registered for electronic 
communications, you will first be asked to register as a new user, for which you will require your investor code (which can be found on your 
proxy card, share certificate or dividend tax voucher), family name and post code (if resident in the UK). In each case your proxy instruction 
must be received no later than 12 noon on 29 April 2014.  If you are a CREST member, see note 4 below. The deadline for receipt of proxy 
appointments also applies in relation to amended instructions, and any attempt to amend a proxy appointment after the relevant deadline 
will be disregarded. Where two or more valid proxy appointments are received in respect of the same share in respect of the same 
meeting, the one which is last sent shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others.
3.  The right to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by persons who have been nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under 
section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (a “Nominated Person”): they can only be exercised by the member. However, a Nominated 
Person may have a right under an agreement between him and the member by whom he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for 
the meeting or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it, 
he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights. Nominated persons 
should contact the registered member by whom they were nominated in respect of these arrangements.
4.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by 
utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). CREST personal members or other 
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment 
made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’ s (EUI) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, 
as described in the CREST Manual. The message regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to 
the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’ s agent 
(ID number – RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of 
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which 
the issuer’ s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . The Company may treat as 
invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
5.  Voting by corporate representatives. A member of the Company which is a corporation may authorise a person or persons to act as its 
representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, each such representative may exercise (on 
behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company, provided 
that they do not do so in relation to the same shares. It is no longer necessary to nominate a designated corporate representative. 
Representatives of shareholders that are corporations will have to produce evidence of their proper appointment when attending the 
general meeting. Please contact our Registrar if you need any further guidance on this.
6.  Copies of the Director’ s service contracts, the terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors, together with a copy 
of the Company’ s Articles of Association are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours 
and will also be available at the place of the AGM from 11.30 a.m. on the date of the meeting until the close of the meeting.
7.  Audit statements. Members satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a 
statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’ s accounts (including the auditors’ report and the 
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting, that the members propose to raise at the meeting. The Company cannot 
require the members requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the 
Company’ s auditors no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the 
meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.
8.  Members’ questions. The Company must cause to be answered at the meeting any question relating to the business being dealt with 
at the meeting which is put by a member attending the meeting, except where: (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation 
for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of 
an answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be 
answered. 110

Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
9.  A copy of this notice, and other information required by section 311A of the Act, can be found at www.james-fisher.co.uk.  A member 
may not use any electronic address provided by the Company in this document or with any proxy appointment form or in any website for 
communication with the Company for any purpose in relation to the meeting other than as expressly stated in it.
10.  Only persons entered on the register of members of the Company at 6.00pm on 29 April 2014 (or, if the meeting is adjourned, at 6.00pm 
on the date which is two days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting or adjourned meeting.  
Changes to entries on the register after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the 
number of votes they may cast) at the meeting or adjourned meeting.
11.  As at 3 March 2014 (being the latest practical date before the publication of this Notice), the Company’ s issued share capital consists of 
50,099,015 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each, and 100,000 preference shares carrying one vote each. Therefore the total voting 
rights in the Company are 50,199,015.  There are no shares in treasury.
12.  As soon as practicable following the AGM, the results of the voting at the meeting and the number of votes cast for and against and the 
number of votes withheld in respect of each resolution will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the 
Company’ s website at www.james-fisher.co.uk.
Ordinary Business Explanatory Notes
Resolution 1 – Annual Report
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors of a public company to lay its Annual Report before the Company in general meeting, 
giving shareholders the opportunity to ask questions on the contents.  The Annual Report comprises the accounts, the auditor’ s report, the 
Directors’ report, the Directors’ Remuneration report and, for the first time, the Strategic report. The Company proposes, as an ordinary 
resolution, a resolution on its Annual Report in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
Resolution 2 – Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy  
For the first time and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company proposes an ordinary resolution to approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy contained in the Directors’ Remuneration report. The proposed policy is set out on pages 31 to 34 of the Annual Report.  
The vote on Resolution 2 is a binding vote and, if passed, will mean that the Directors’ can only make remuneration payments in accordance 
with the approved policy. The Company is required to ensure that a vote on its Remuneration Policy takes place annually unless the approved 
policy remains unchanged, in which case the Company will propose a similar resolution at least every three years. 
Resolution 3 – Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company proposes an ordinary resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration report 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2013. The Directors’ Remuneration report is set out on pages 30 to 41 of the Annual Report and, 
for the purposes of this resolution, does not include the parts of the Directors’ Remuneration report containing the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy which is set out on pages 31 to 34. The vote on this resolution is advisory only and the Directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not 
conditional on its being passed.   
Resolution 4 – Declaration of final dividend
A final dividend can only be paid after it has been approved by the shareholders in general meeting and may not exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Directors recommend a final dividend of 13.54p per ordinary share in respect of the financial year ended 31 
December 2013. If the meeting approves Resolution 4, the final dividend will be paid on 9 May 2014 to ordinary shareholders who are on the 
register at the close of business on 11 April 2014.  It is proposed to pay the dividend.
Resolutions 5 to 10 – Re-election and election of Directors
The Company’ s Articles of Association require that one third of the Directors will retire each year and that each Director must stand for re-
election at least every three years. However the UK Corporate Governance Code provides that all Directors of FTSE 350 companies should 
be subject to re-election by their shareholders every year.
In accordance with this provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has decided that all Directors shall retire at the AGM and 
offer themselves for re-election. David Moorhouse and Michael Salter who each joined the Company on 1 August 2013 as Non-Executive 
Directors will be proposed for election for the first time at this year’ s AGM. Following performance reviews the Chairman and the Board believe 
that each of the Directors standing for re-election or election continue to perform effectively and with commitment to their role including 
commitment of time for Board and Committee meetings and other duties. The Board also considers that each of the Non-Executive Directors 
is independent in character and judgement. Each of Resolutions 5 to 10 shall be proposed as ordinary resolutions. Biographical details of 
each of our Directors appear on page 22 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 11 and 12 – Appointment of auditor/auditor’s remuneration  
These resolutions propose the appointment of the Company’ s auditor and authorise the Directors to agree the auditor’ s remuneration.
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company, to hold office until 
the conclusion of the next such meeting. KPMG Audit Plc has notified the Company that it is instigating a wind down of its business. It is 
proposed that KPMG LLP be appointed as auditor of the Company to hold office from the conclusion of the AGM until the conclusion of the 
next general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company, and that the auditor’ s remuneration be fixed by the Directors.
In connection with the resignation of KPMG Audit Plc, the Company is required as a matter of law to send you a copy of the statement of 
circumstances connected with the resignation of the Company’ s auditor. This statement is delivered to shareholders with the Annual Report. 111

Resolution 13 – Authority to allot shares
Authority is given to the Directors to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for, and convert any security into shares in 
the Company up to a total nominal amount of £4,174,918 (16,699,672 ordinary shares) representing approximately 33% of the nominal value 
of the Company’ s total issued ordinary share capital as at 3 March 2014 being the latest practical date before publication of this Notice. The 
authority will expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2015, or, if earlier, on 30 June 2015 and replaces an authority granted on 2 May 
2013 which expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise this authority.
At 3 March 2014 the Company does not hold any treasury shares.
Resolution 14 - Permission to allot a limited number of shares other than to existing shareholders
This resolution which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks to renew the authority conferred on the Directors at last year’ s AGM to 
issue equity securities of the Company for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.  
Other than in connection with a rights or other similar issue or scrip dividend (where difficulties arise in offering shares to certain overseas 
shareholders and in relation to fractional entitlements) the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value of 
£626,838 (representing 2,504,951 ordinary shares) which represents approximately 5% of the Company’ s issued equity share capital as at 3 
March 2014, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice. The renewed authority will remain in force until the date of 
the next AGM or on 30 June 2015, whichever is the earlier and replaces the authority granted on 2 May 2013 which expires at the conclusion 
of the forthcoming AGM.  It is a standard resolution for most UK listed companies each year.
In line with best practice, the Company has not issued more than 7.5% of its issued share capital on a non-pro rata basis over the last three 
years and the Directors confirm their intention to follow the best practice set out in the Pre-Emption Group’ s Statement of Principles which 
provides that companies should not issues shares for cash representing more than 7.5% of the Company’ s issued share capital in any rolling 
three-year period, other than to existing shareholders, without prior consultation with shareholders.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise this authority.
Resolution 15 – Authority to purchase own shares
This special resolution, gives the Company authority to purchase in the market up to 2,504,951 of its ordinary shares of 25p each 
(representing approximately 5% of the Company’ s total issued ordinary share capital). The minimum and maximum prices at which such 
shares can be purchased is as stated in the resolution. The authority will expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2015, or on 30 
June 2015, whichever is earlier, and replaces a similar authority granted on 2 May 2013 which expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming 
AGM.
If any ordinary shares purchased pursuant to this authority are not held by the Company as treasury shares then such shares would be 
immediately cancelled in which event the number of ordinary shares in issue would be reduced. As at 3 March 2014, being the latest practical 
date before publication of this Notice, there were options over ordinary shares in the capital of the Company representing 2.75% of the 
Company’ s total issued share capital.  If the authority to purchase the Company’ s ordinary shares was exercised in full and those shares were 
subsequently cancelled, these options would represent 2.89% of the Company’ s total issued share capital. The Directors have no present 
intention to exercise this authority and in reaching their decision to purchase ordinary shares will take into account, amongst other things the 
Company’ s cash resources and capital requirements, the effect of any purchase on earnings per share and whether it is in the best interests of 
shareholders generally. 
Resolution 16 – Authority to hold general meetings (other than annual AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice  
This special resolution renews an authority given at last year’ s AGM and is required as a result of section 307A of the 2006 Act coming into 
force. The Company is currently able to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear day’ s notice. In order to be able to preserve 
this ability, shareholders must have approved the calling of meetings on 14 day’ s notice. Resolution 16, which is proposed as a special 
resolution, seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’ s next AGM, when it is intended that a similar resolution will 
be proposed.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for general meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited by the 
business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation
The Directors consider that the proposed resolutions set out in the Notice of AGM are in the best interests of the Company and to its 
shareholders as a whole and they unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of them, as the Directors intend to do in respect of their 
own holdings of shares in the Company. 112

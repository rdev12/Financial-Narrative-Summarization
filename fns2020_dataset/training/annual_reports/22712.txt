ENERGY
...ENSURING ENERGY 
SECURITY...
Ensuring that the UK has a secure and reliable energy 
mix is another area of national need in which Costain 
is playing a key role.
Following completion of a successful Front End Engineering Design (FEED) project, via 
competitive tender, Costain was awarded a contract by National Grid to upgrade its 
Peterborough and Huntingdon compressor stations. The primary driver for the programme 
is to reduce emissions associated with moving gas around the UK to support EU legislation; 
added benefits include increased system resilience and reduced overall risk on the National 
Transmission System by replacing ageing assets with modern, efficient equipment.
STRATEGIC REPORT
04 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 THE CHALLENGE
As both compressors are 
adjacent on the National 
Transmission Service, they 
cannot be taken out of service 
at the same time. The Costain 
team has devised a complex 
delivery programme to 
minimise any impact on 
the NTS and avoid outages 
during the winter months. 
This will ensure National Grid’s 
customers are provided with 
a seamless service during the 
project and will benefit from 
a much enhanced supply when 
it is completed.

The M1 is one of the UK’s 
major road arteries but road 
users suffer from excessive 
traffic levels, congestion and 
ultimately delays. Costain has 
been working to transform 
junctions 28-35 into a Smart 
Motorway, increasing its 
capacity, reducing congestion 
and improving safety. This 
is achieved by converting 
the hard shoulder into a 
running lane, using innovative 
technology automatically 
to identify congestion and 
maintain traffic flows using 
variable speed limits, ensuring 
roads are run as efficiently as 
possible. The new motorway 
will be complete in 2017 and 
remain maintenance free for 
5 years.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  07 I am pleased to report that Costain has 
delivered another strong result, with 
continued growth in both revenue and 
profit, and has maintained a record 
forward order book.”
Dr Paul Golby CBE | Chairman
This is my first statement since joining the 
Board and becoming Chairman on 5 May 
2016. I am pleased to report that Costain 
has delivered another strong result, with 
continued growth in both revenue and 
profit, and has maintained a record forward 
order book. 
I was delighted to have been asked to join 
Costain. It is a great British engineering 
success story with an outstanding brand 
and leading market positions. 
I look forward to playing a part in 
delivering further success as the Group 
accelerates its growth.
Costain’s opportunity
These are exciting times for Costain. 
The cross-party political support for 
investment in infrastructure as a facilitator 
of sustainable economic growth, coupled 
with our customers’ committed multi-billion 
pound investment programmes, creates 
a positive environment for the Group 
to continue to grow. This is evidenced 
through recent decisions to progress 
investment programmes at Hinkley, 
Heathrow and High Speed 2.
Meanwhile, the increasingly complex 
demands of the Group’s blue chip 
customers present engineering challenges 
which require an even greater emphasis 
on technology-based solutions. Costain’s 
unique and focused ‘Engineering 
Tomorrow’ strategy has successfully 
positioned the business as one of 
only a few companies able to provide 
those solutions.
Costain is continuing to grow its skills and 
capabilities and this is enabling the Group 
to win substantial new contracts and 
contract extensions thereby maintaining 
a high quality order book.
Dividend
The Group has a progressive dividend 
policy, targeting an ongoing dividend 
cover of around two times underlying 
earnings, translating strong performance 
directly in to shareholder value.
Our performance this year, and our 
confidence in the opportunities for 
future growth, has resulted in the 
Board recommending a final dividend 
of 8.4 pence per share (2015: 7.25 pence) 
which, if approved, will be paid on 
19 May 2017 to shareholders on the 
register as at 7 April 2017. This represents 
an increase of 15% in the total dividend 
for the year to 12.7 pence per share 
(2015: 11.0 pence).

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
STRATEGIC REPORT
08 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Pension
A triennial actuarial review of the Costain 
defined benefit scheme, reflecting 
updated market and liability assumptions, 
has been carried out as at 31 March 2016 
and a plan agreed with the scheme Trustee 
regarding the associated deficit recovery. 
The amount of annual total contributions 
has been agreed at the same overall level 
as previously established, based on the 
Group’s dividend matching policy.
Governance
I have joined a company with a Board 
committed to the highest standards 
of governance and a first-rate executive 
team implementing a robust strategy. 
Our Annual Report will set out and 
explain the processes we have put 
in place to deliver long-term success 
whilst also ensuring that the Company 
complies with all applicable laws and 
regulations and meets the requirements 
of our shareholders and their 
representative bodies. 
We measure the Board’s effectiveness 
by holding an externally facilitated 
evaluation of Board performance every 
three years and take appropriate action 
where required. The most recent external 
evaluation was in 2014 and, in the interim, 
we undertake annual internal follow-up 
reviews to ensure that we are delivering 
agreed actions.
Board and people
I joined the Board and succeeded David 
Allvey as Chairman at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2016. 
David had been Chairman for seven years, 
and on behalf of everyone at Costain, 
I would like to thank him for the substantial 
role he played, and we wish him and his 
family all the very best for the future.
The success of any company is down to 
the quality of its leadership and the depth 
of talented and skilled people throughout 
the organisation.
On behalf of the Board, I would also like 
to thank all of Costain’s people for their 
commitment, dedication and hard work. 
The strong result we have achieved this 
year would not be possible without them.
Corporate citizenship
Costain takes seriously its wider corporate 
responsibility and the role the business 
plays in society. That corporate perspective 
is also integral to the development of 
long-term relationships with our blue-
chip customers who increasingly place a 
demonstrable commitment to corporate 
responsibility high on their selection 
criteria for preferred suppliers. 
Outlook
Our major customers are committed to 
spending billions of pounds to improve 
people’s lives by enhancing the UK’s 
energy, water and transportation 
infrastructures. In order to deliver solutions 
to their increasingly complex requirements, 
Costain will continue to provide the 
broadest range of innovative integrated 
services and technology-based solutions. 
The Group’s continuing success is, 
therefore, the direct result of its 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy and the 
deliberate acceleration of growth, both 
organically and by targeted acquisition. 
Costain is well-positioned to take 
advantage of the opportunities that lie 
immediately ahead and this, combined 
with the good visibility we have over the 
medium term, reinforces our confidence 
for the future.
That confidence is reflected in the 
recommendation to increase the total 
dividend for the year by 15% and I look 
forward to reporting on future progress.

Andrew Wylie CBE | Chief Executive
Our purpose at Costain is to 
improve people’s lives by deploying 
technology-based engineering 
solutions to meet urgent national 
needs across the UK’s energy, water 
and transportation infrastructures. 
I am pleased to report on another good 
year, during which we delivered a strong 
overall result, continued to accelerate 
the growth of the business through 
investing in our skills and capabilities, 
maintained our market leading position 
and secured a record amount of work 
for the following year. 
Strong trading performance
Revenue, including the Group’s share 
of joint ventures and associates, for the 
year increased 26% to £1,658.0 million 
(2015: £1,316.5 million).
Group underlying operating profit 
increased 24% to £41.1 million 
(2015: £33.2 million).
Underlying profit before tax was 
£37.5 million (2015: £29.9 million), and 
underlying basic earnings per share 
increased to 31.5 pence (2015: 25.1 
pence). Reported profit before tax was 
£30.9 million (2015: £26.0 million) and 
reported earnings per share were 
25.7 pence (2015: 21.8 pence).
Although we have two core operating and 
reporting divisions within our business 
(Infrastructure and Natural Resources) 
we have continued to implement our 
‘One Costain’ philosophy which enables 
us to constantly focus our resources 
on identifying and securing the most 
attractive business opportunities across 
the markets in which we operate.
The Infrastructure division delivered 
increases in revenue and operating profit 
and maintained a record order book. 
The Natural Resources division saw an 
increase in revenue with the overall result 
impacted by further costs in relation to 
the legacy Greater Manchester Waste 
contract awarded in 2007, as detailed 
in the Divisional review.
Costain finished the year with a strong 
net cash position of £140.2 million 
(2015: 108.2 million) reflecting positive 
timing of receipts at the period end. This is 
after significant further investment in the 
Group’s strategic development including 
the £17 million acquisition in July 2016 of 
Simulation Systems Limited (SSL), which 
has been fully integrated and which will 
be earnings enhancing in 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT
10 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Accelerating growth: investing in 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’
Our performance is the result of our 
unique, focused and continually evolving 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy which 
has successfully positioned the business 
to provide the range of innovative 
integrated services demanded by our 
major customers who are spending billions 
of pounds on projects, underpinned 
by legislation, regulation or essential 
capital spend in the UK, upgrading and 
renewing the country’s energy, water and 
transportation infrastructures. 
Through increasing the capacity of road 
and rail infrastructure networks, improving 
the security of water and power supplies 
and enhancing the service provided to 
consumers, Costain is playing a key role 
in enhancing the lives of millions of people 
across the country.
Additionally, the Group’s blue-chip 
customers’ increasingly complex 
requirements to ensure future-proofed 
capacity, high quality service, security of 
supply and efficiency in delivery present 
numerous opportunities which demand 
an ever greater emphasis on innovative 
engineering and technology-based 
solutions. We have previously referred 
to the revolution taking place in the 
deployment of technology and this is 
gathering momentum as our customers 
increasingly recognise it as a major 
facilitator in the delivery of infrastructure. 
Costain is, and intends to remain, at the 
forefront of that revolution. 
Following the referendum vote in June, 
there has been no adverse impact on 
Costain. We have noted the increased 
emphasis from the Government on 
the vital role infrastructure plays in 
promoting economic growth and an allied 
commitment to investment in key sectors, 
including technology, to ensure that the 
country continues to compete on the 
global stage. This presents Costain with 
additional opportunity.
Consequently, we are reinforcing our 
strategic focus on our major customers 
who are already committed to spending 
billions of pounds addressing critical 
UK infrastructure needs and we will 
continue to accelerate the growth of the 
business, investing both organically and 
by acquisition, in people and skills and 
in innovation and capabilities. 
In July, we successfully acquired SSL to 
enhance further the range of technology-
led solutions we can provide to our 
customers. SSL, established in 1979 and 
with 165 people, provides integrated 
hardware and software-based solutions 
across a broad spectrum of traffic 
monitoring and management solutions 
with the potential for wider application 
across our customer groups. The business 
has now been fully integrated into the 
Group and is performing well.

STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION Combining an award winning team 
and leading-edge innovation
The success of Costain is built on the 
strength and experience of our team 
and it is essential that we continue to 
attract, retain and develop the best talent. 
Costain today has over 4,100 people and, 
reflecting the development and changing 
nature of the business, over 1,200 of those 
are now in technology, advisory or design 
service roles. 
At Costain there are over 750 chartered 
professionals across a wide range of 
disciplines. Additionally, there are over 
200 graduates on our award-winning 
graduate development programme 
and 120 apprentices on a structured 
development programme undergoing 
training across the business.
Across the Group, there has been over 
50,000 hours of training and development 
in the year. A number of the members 
of the senior leadership team have 
participated in executive education 
programmes during the year at leading 
business schools including Harvard 
and INSEAD. 
In order to ensure we continue to generate 
thought leadership on key issues, we are 
currently sponsoring 13 PhD students 
undertaking leading-edge research 
at renowned universities including 
Cambridge, Imperial College, Edinburgh 
and Manchester. 
Along with our engineering centre in 
Manchester, where over 300 of our people 
are based, we currently have research and 
development relationships with 15 leading 
universities and with whom we continue to 
progress a number of patent applications.
This investment in people and R&D 
continued to deliver a number of exciting 
innovations including:
• Advanced Vehicle Technology: 
Automatic vehicle recognition 
technology for the management 
of vehicles, removing the need for 
traditional toll booths and automatic 
crossing charging and therefore reducing 
traffic congestion; 
•  Analytics and predictive services: our 
technology is being used to manage 
critical infrastructure when experiencing 
extreme events; 
• The deployment of workforce and 
workflow technology to the delivery of 
complicated maintenance contracts. 
Through the use of this technology 
we are improving the local customer 
experience, improving event 
management and improving efficiency 
of operations through automatic 
workforce management; 
• Capturing asset operational data and 
maintenance records, through the use 
of algorithms, to optimise maintenance 
and operations achieving significant 
reductions in both capex and opex costs.
Record order book providing visibility 
of earnings
As a consequence of its strong customer 
relationships, and its engineering and 
technology-led solutions, Costain secured 
a significant number of new orders and 
contract extensions including: 
• Development of the M4 corridor around 
Newport for the Welsh Government;
• Peterborough and Huntingdon 
compressor station upgrade for 
National Grid; 
• Contract for the East works package of 
the Thames Tideway Tunnel in London;
• High Speed 2 South Enabling 
Works contract;
• Appointment to the Decommissioning 
Delivery Partnership framework by 
Sellafield Ltd;
• Three asset maintenance support 
contracts for Highways England; 
• Transport for London’s Surface Transport 
Major Projects Framework.
As a result, the Group’s order book at 
the year-end was maintained at the 
record level of £3.9 billion (31 December 
2015: £3.9 billion). 
The Group has increased its revenues 
secured for 2017 to over £1.2 billion (as 
at 31 December 2015: over £1.1 billion 
secured for 2016). The order book also 
provides good medium-term visibility with

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT

STRATEGIC REPORT
12 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 We started 2017 with 
a maintained record 
order book giving 
good visibility over the 
medium term and we 
look forward to the 
future with confidence.
The strategic nature of Costain’s 
long-term customer relationships has 
once again ensured that over 90% of the 
order book comprises repeat business. 
We deliberately work with major customers 
who utilise target cost, cost reimbursable 
contracts as the most appropriate contract 
form to deliver their complex and changing 
requirements. As a consequence, over 90% 
of the order book is in this lower-risk form 
of contract. 
Given the changing nature of the business 
and the evolving profile of the order book, 
we will also increasingly use consultancy-
related indicators, such as utilisation.
Costain Cares
The management of Safety, Health and 
Environment is a core value at Costain. 
The Group’s Accident Frequency Rate 
(AFR) in the year was 0.09, which although 
slightly behind the best-ever performance 
of 0.08 achieved in 2015, still compares 
well with our industry peer group. 
We received a total of 21 RoSPA 
awards in 2016 including two Orders 
of Distinction, two President’s 
Awards and the International Dilmum 
Environmental Trophy. 
Notwithstanding this industry leading 
safety performance, the Group still had 
a number of serious safety incidents in 
the year, including a fatality on the M1 
J16-19 Managed Motorway contract, 
which reinforced the need for continuous 
learnings, vigilance and improvement in 
our safety performance.
We remain committed to further 
improvement in our safety performance 
and are implementing a strategy to reduce 
by a further 50% the number of incidents 
in the business by the end of 2018. 
Our customers place great emphasis 
on the good citizen credentials of their 
strategic supply chain partners. Given the 
profile of their businesses and the nature of 
the activities we undertake, how we deliver 
our services is as important to them as 
what we do. Increasingly, customers insist 
that their tier-one providers share their 
corporate and social responsibility values 
and failure to do this would mean a failure 
to pre-qualify for future work. 
The Costain Charitable Foundation 
is the focus of the range of charitable 
and community work we undertake, 
both individually and as a Group. 
Following the success in 2015 of the 
‘Costain 150 Challenge’, which raised 
over £1.1 million for good causes, we set 
a challenge for 2016 of 10,000 hours of 
volunteering by Costain people and I am 
delighted to report that we achieved a 
total of over 12,000 hours. 
Outlook
These are exciting times with billions 
of pounds being spent upgrading and 
renewing the country’s energy, water and 
transportation infrastructures. 
There is a revolution in the deployment 
of technology-led innovative solutions 
to meet the increasingly complex 
requirements of our national infrastructure 
needs and we are continuing rapidly to 
transform our business to be at the heart 
of the opportunity this presents.
We started 2017 with a maintained record 
order book giving good visibility over the 
medium term and we look forward to the 
future with confidence.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  15
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION The markets in which the Costain Group is active have, in total, an anticipated 
spend of just under £92 billion per annum, of which over £20 billion is 
addressable. Customers in these markets continue to spend at consistent levels. 
Below is a summary of the activity in those markets.
w
POWER
The UK recognises the need to continue 
to invest in a reliable and sustainable 
power supply.
Total* £17.1bn
Addressable** £2.7bn
The UK Power market continues to be driven 
by the four energy policy imperatives of 
affordability, security of supply, reliability and 
reduced carbon. Asset optimisation remains the 
predominant investment balanced with capital 
infrastructure spend.
OFGEM Regulator reforms will play a key role 
in determining remaining RIIO Phase1 capital 
investment and outlook for RIIO Phase 2. 
The Government is supporting the market to deliver 
a diverse range of technologies. 
The National Infrastructure Plan 2016–2021 highlights 
a period of planned energy spend of £58.3bn, which 
is focused around maintaining a reliable, secure, 
affordable and low carbon energy system.
OIL & GAS
The oil & gas market continues to 
recover with rising oil prices creating 
new engineering opportunities.
Total* £16.5bn
Addressable** £1.1bn
Whilst remaining a competitive environment, 
opportunities exist in emerging markets and 
traditional differentiation areas for Costain.
Midstream business outlook is good in 2017 with 
the UK continuing to increase its reliance on gas. 
Costain is a market leader in engineering for 
Gas Processing, Storage and Distribution.
The upstream market is starting to recover from 
the effects of low oil price and we will focus on the 
growing number of decommissioning opportunities, 
in addition to our offshore topside and sub-sea 
engineering and advisory services.
WATER
As the water companies near the 
mid-point of the sixth asset management 
plan (AMP6) they are planning for the 
next price review in 2019.
Total* £12.2bn
Addressable** £3.1bn
The water sector is in the middle of the regulatory 
spend cycle, AMP6. Costain is working with our 
customers to deliver outcomes and support 
preparations for the 2019 price review.
The water industry is evolving with great emphasis 
on efficiency and resilience, incorporating technology 
to assist with this transformation. Customers seek 
to reduce their operating costs and produce 
greater value and service for their customers. 
Support opportunities lie in advisory services 
and technology-based solutions.

STRATEGIC REPORT
16 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 RAIL
Investment in the UK rail infrastructure 
remains a high priority for the nation.
Total* £26.0bn
Addressable** £7.0bn
Rail remains an enabler for national economic 
growth and the Government have announced 
further investment focused on future technology 
and digitisation. This is essential to support the 
increase in passenger journeys.
Network Rail continues to evolve and the 
introduction of contestability will open up new 
opportunities. Control Period 6 bidding will start 
later this year and is expected to be of the same 
magnitude as Control Period 5.
As Crossrail heads towards a successful 
commissioning and opening, further 
infrastructure investment in the South East 
continues to gain support. 
The first HS2 enabling contracts have been 
awarded and the transition to major programme 
delivery will follow on from these activities.
NUCLEAR
Nuclear power is integral to meeting the 
UK’s energy needs; decommissioning 
programmes continue.
Total* £11.1bn
Addressable** £1.6bn
The industry has significant opportunities within 
nuclear new build, decommissioning, generation 
and the defence markets.
Hinkley Point C has been given the go ahead with 
the final investment decision reached by EDF and 
the UK Government. This paves the way for new 
nuclear in the UK. Consultations continue on the 
Moorside, Wylfa Newydd and Sizewell C projects. 
The NDA has set significant decommissioning 
milestones to be achieved by 2020, in particular 
defuelling all 11 Magnox reactors, drawing fuel 
reprocessing at Sellafield to a close and fulfilling 
their accelerated decommissioning for Bradwell. 
Defence spending is set to increase with the 
proposed Dreadnought Class submarine programme.
HIGHWAYS
There is renewed commitment to 
improve the UK's road network.
Total* £8.8bn
Addressable** £4.1bn
The Autumn 2016 statement committed an 
additional investment of £1.1bn to reduce 
congestion and upgrade local roads and 
transport and is also providing £390 million in 
support for the transport technology of the future.
Highways England continue to progress their 
2015–2020 Road Investment Strategy (RIS) which 
outlines £15 billion of spend. The development of 
RIS2 (2020–2025) will outline further requirements 
across the UK network. 
Other organisations, such as TfL, continue to 
recognise the need to modernise the road network 
to make them more reliable, safer and greener.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  23
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION Our customer-aligned Infrastructure and Natural Resources divisions have 
continued to deliver technology-based solutions to meet urgent natural 
needs across the UK’s energy, water and transportation infrastructures.
Operational review
Under our ‘One Costain’ operating model 
the Group has two core operating and 
reporting divisions within the business: 
Infrastructure and Natural Resources. 
Infrastructure
The Costain Infrastructure division, 
which operates in the highways, rail 
and nuclear markets, has had a strong 
year with an increase in revenue and 
operating profit. Revenue (including 
share of joint ventures and associations) 
increased to £1,276.1 million 
(2015: £996.1 million) and operating profit 
(before other items) rose to £56.6 million 
(2015: £50.9 million). Reported (after other 
items) operating profit was £54.6 million 
(2015: £49.9 million). The underlying 
operating profit margin delivered in the 
division is within the targeted blended 
range of 4% to 5%. 
The forward order book for the division has 
increased to £2.9 billion (2015: £2.8 billion) 
and the level of tendering activity is high 
as we continue to prioritise the Group’s 
bidding activity in the areas that currently 
provide the greatest opportunity.
Highways
In Highways, major milestones have 
been achieved on the M1 Junction 28 
to 35 Managed Motorways contract for 
Highways England, the M6 to Heysham 
Link Road for Lancashire County Council 
and the A465 Heads of the Valleys Dualling 
for the Welsh Government. 
We continue to provide 24/7 operational 
capability to key customers who require 
immediate response to incidents and 
severe weather events, keeping our 
strategic road network open and available 
for safe use by all. Following successful 
awards by Highways England, the Areas 
4 and 12 Asset Support Contracts (ASCs) 
have been successfully mobilised and, in 
December, we were awarded the Area 
14 Maintenance and Response contract.
Our Highways operational capability was 
recognised further with the award of 
our first local authority operations and 
maintenance contract for East Sussex 
County Council and which has also been 
successfully mobilised.
The acquisition of SSL in July has already 
enabled us to secure important contract 
wins as a consequence of the additional 
capabilities the business brought to 
Costain, particularly across technology 
services. These new capabilities are 
now being deployed on the recently 
awarded TMT2 framework for Highways 
England and the refurbishment of the 
critical M4 Brynglas Tunnels for the 
Welsh Government.
Rail
This year has seen a significant growth in 
activity as we work with Network Rail and 
others to modernise ageing infrastructure. 
During the year we successfully, and on 
time, opened the first phase of the major 
London Bridge station redevelopment. 
This was a major landmark, achieved whilst 
having to keep one of London’s busiest 
transport hubs open for business. 
We also responded swiftly to the closure 
of the Folkestone to Dover line as a 
consequence of the damage to the 
sea wall in the December 2015 storms. 
This contract has been completed well 
ahead of schedule and budget and the 
railway line was back into full operation 
in September 2016.
Capacity constraints on the national 
rail network are being alleviated by our 
rail electrification joint venture, ABC 
Electrification Limited which continues to 
deliver significant sections of the National 
Electrification Programme in the Midlands, 
Scotland and on the Great Western Line.
Crossrail will improve journey times 
across London and will ease congestion 
while offering significantly enhanced 
connectivity. On this iconic programme of 
work we continue to deliver the landmark 
Paddington and Bond Street stations 
and have made significant progress on 
the System Wide contract to provide

STRATEGIC REPORT
24 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 the operational railway on the central 
section of Europe’s largest infrastructure 
programme. On associated works for 
London Underground, both the Bond 
Street station upgrade and the Bakerloo 
Line link at Paddington have made 
excellent progress in the year.
In order to increase rail capacity and 
reduce travel times into London from the 
Midlands and the North, the Government 
is developing a high-speed rail network 
known as HS2. This programme has made 
good progress in the year with Costain 
being awarded, in joint venture, the 
southern section enabling works contract.
Nuclear
As part of the programme to manage 
the decommissioning of the UK’s legacy 
nuclear power stations, Costain made 
significant progress towards completion 
of the Evaporator D contract for Sellafield 
Limited and we have mobilised a team 
for Sellafield’s design and delivery 
partner framework.
With regard to the upgrade programme 
of the country’s existing nuclear power 
station fleet, Costain successfully secured 
in December the project controls 
programme management advisory project 
for EDF which, importantly, demonstrates 
the broadening of the Group’s capabilities 
across integrated services and consultancy. 
We are also undertaking advance works for 
EDF at Hinkley Point.
Natural Resources
The Natural Resources division, which 
operates in the water, power and oil & gas 
markets, has seen some good progress in 
underlying performance. Revenue in the 
division has increased as a consequence 
of the expected cyclical growth in spend 
in the AMP6 programmes in the water 
sector, the full benefit from the integration 
of the acquisition of the Rhead Group 
in August 2015 and despite the impact 
of the continued difficult oil and gas 
market conditions. 
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  25
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION DIVISIONAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
Revenue (including share of joint 
ventures and associations) increased to 
£377.3 million (2015: £317.6 million) with 
an operating loss (before other items), 
including the impact of the increased costs 
and provisions on the legacy waste PFI 
contract detailed below, of £8.6 million 
(2015: £11.1 million loss). Reported (after 
other items) loss from operations was 
£12.6 million (2015: £13.4 million loss). 
Excluding the impact of the legacy 
waste contract the division generated an 
underlying operating profit of £6.5 million 
in 2016.
The loss in the period includes further 
costs and provisions arising in the year 
totalling £15.1 million in relation to 
the completion of the legacy Greater 
Manchester Waste Disposal Authority PFI 
contract awarded in 2007. As reported 
previously, all 46 facilities on the 
scheme are operating and processing 
waste. These facilities are all either fully 
completed or in the warranty period 
under the terms of the contract during 
which further work and plant modifications 
are to be completed. In the period, the 
Group has incurred further costs and has 
taken additional provisions to reach Final 
Acceptance on the contract, which is now 
targeted this year; and to complete the 
remaining works when access is available 
in accordance with the operational running 
of the plants under an agreed schedule 
to 2019. Costain has received significant 
payments from, and remains in discussions 
on further payments with relevant contract 
counterparties and the Group’s insurers 
regarding the issues that have arisen on 
this contract. It has been the Group’s 
policy since 2009 not to pursue fixed 
price contracts of this nature.
The division has a forward order book 
of £1.0 billion (2015: £1.1 billion).
Water
The Group is now in year two of the AMP6 
five year programmes for Thames Water, 
Severn Trent and Southern Water with a 
focus on improving and maintaining water 
quality standards, supply resilience and 
meeting anticipated demographic shifts. 
These programmes are utilising the full range 
of integrated capabilities available in the 
Group to deliver improved customer service, 
innovative solutions and achieve significant 
total expenditure efficiency savings.
In Glasgow, Costain is improving water 
quality and resilience of supply through the 
delivery of the Shieldhall Tunnel for Scottish 
Water, reducing flooding issues in the city’s 
wastewater network. This is one of the 
largest infrastructure investments in Scotland 
and the main tunnel drive and associated 
works are progressing well.
Costain’s joint venture for the east section 
of the Thames Tideway project has now 
successfully mobilised and is progressing 
well. This major project will form an integral 
part of the modernisation of London’s 
Victorian sewerage system and significantly 
improve water quality in the River Thames, 
providing capacity to cope with the demands 
of the city well in to the 22nd century. 
Power
Ensuring that the UK has a secure and 
reliable energy mix is another area of national 
need in which Costain is playing a key role. 
The River Humber pipeline is a strategically 
important asset, connecting the gas import 
facility at Easington on the Yorkshire coast 
and which provides 70 – 100 million cubic 
metres of natural gas per day, to the national 
network. Costain is delivering the project 
services contract to deliver the replacement 
of the Humber Estuary Crossing for 
National Grid. 
Following completion of a successful Front 
End Engineering Design (FEED) project, 
Costain was awarded the contract by 
National Grid to upgrade its Peterborough 
and Huntingdon compressor stations. 
The programme of work is part of National 
Grid’s Emissions Reduction Project to ensure 
that both compressor stations comply 
with the Industrial Emissions Directive 
and Pollution Prevention and Control 
regulations. The project will also increase 
system resilience and reduce overall risk 
on the National Transmission System 
by replacing ageing assets with modern, 
efficient equipment.

Oil & Gas
The Group continues to secure new repeat 
order work for its front end design studies, 
programme management, complex project 
delivery and asset supports including 
the new Hydrochloric Acid Dosing Plant 
Construction Contract with Total, building 
on the Condensate Mercury Removal 
System for its Edradour-Glenlivet facility. 
Costain’s programme management 
services to Ithaca on the Stella field 
development continue to programme, 
as well as the ongoing support 
services to Total and Phillips 66 at their 
Immingham refineries.
There was a noticeable increase in new 
business opportunities towards the end 
of 2016 as customers restructure their 
operations and investment projects 
to accommodate prevailing market 
conditions, providing us with some 
improvement in visibility of potential 
workload in 2017. 
Alcaidesa
In July 2015, we announced, by mutual 
agreement with our partner Santander Bank, 
that we had completed a reorganisation 
of the Spanish non-core joint venture that 
resulted in the assets being split equally 
between the parties. Costain now owns the 
Alcaidesa group, which incorporates the 
operating assets of the golf courses, the 
associated parcel of land and the 624-berth 
marina concession, adjacent to Gibraltar, 
and has retained its portion of the debt, 
amounting to €11.5 million. 
Revenue in the year was £4.6 million 
(2015: £2.8 million) and the loss from 
operations was £0.7 million (2015: £0.9 million 
loss). The result reflects some early 
improvement in market conditions in Spain 
for this non-core activity.
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  27
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION This section highlights the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
together with the key mitigating activities that have been put in place to 
manage those risks.
Risk management processes are incorporated within the Group’s normal 
management and governance systems at all levels.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management framework
The Board formally reviews the 
material risks and ensures that these 
are appropriately managed by the 
management team. The Board 
retains the ultimate responsibility 
for the Group’s risk management 
framework, however, it has delegated 
responsibility for annually reviewing 
the overall effectiveness of the risk 
management programme to the 
Audit Committee. The Group Risk 
Management function provides 
assurances to the Audit Committee 
of the effectiveness of the internal 
control procedures through 
completion of the annual audit plan 
which takes into account current 
business risks.
Risk management processes are 
incorporated within the Group’s 
normal management and governance 
systems at all levels and form an 
integral part of the day-to-day activity 
of the Company. The Group Risk 
Management function leads the 
process for the review and assessment 
of risk, focused principally at the 
strategic operations of the Group. 
This supplements and integrates with 
the processes already established at 
contract level, is in line with ISO 31000 
and provides a consistent approach 
to risk management activities 
Group-wide. Risks, which form the 
basis for the principal risks and 
uncertainties detailed in this section, 
are challenged and validated by the 
Group Executive Board and the Board 
on a regular basis.
Risk appetite
The Board keeps under constant 
review the relationship between 
our strategic ambitions and the 
management of risk. The Company 
continues to operate a formal risk 
appetite document which includes, 
amongst other things, the Investments 
Committee tender review procedures 
and formal guidelines for joint 
ventures. The Company continues 
to expand its business activities and 
is now entering into knowledge and 
innovation based contracts. As a 
result of this, procedures for this type 
of work have been strengthened, 
levels of authority have been reviewed 
and guidelines implemented. 
Further details of the Company’s 
appetite to risk is provided overleaf.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out 
in the Strategic report on pages 01 
to 37. Principal risks and uncertainties 
are described on pages 30 to 33. 
In addition, Note 17 to the financial 
statements on pages 117 to 122 
includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing 
its exposures to interest rate risk, 
foreign currency risk, counterparty 
risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
Details of the Group’s financial 
instruments and hedging activities 
are also provided in Note 17.
The Directors believe, after due 
and careful enquiry, that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue 
operations for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, 
the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group over a three-year period. 
This assessment has been made taking into 
account the current position of the Group, 
the annual corporate planning process and the 
potential impact of the principal risks stated 
on pages 30 to 33. The plans and projections 
prepared as part of the corporate planning 
process consider the Group’s cash flows, 
profits, contracted work, dividends and other 
key financial indicators over the period.
The principal risks have been taken into 
consideration in preparing the projections,  
with particular emphasis on:
–  A major health, safety or environmental 
incident;
– Reduction in new work won;
– Operational delivery issues;
– Deterioration in pension liabilities;
–  Making an acquisition that does not achieve 
the planned profit;
– A major IT systems failure.
The projections have then been incorporated 
into a sensitivity analysis which reflects plausible, 
but severe, combinations of the above variables, 
and the impact of these on the Group’s liquidity 
and banking arrangements. Given the long-term 
nature of a significant element of the Company’s 
activities, a number of the principal risks 
potentially impact the Group’s ability to win new 
work. This has therefore formed a key element 
of the assessment.
The period of three years has been chosen 
because this is a time period in which the 
Company has a reasonable visibility of secured 
work and pipeline of opportunities. It is also  
the period reviewed by the Board in the 
business planning process.
Based on this assessment, the Directors  
confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the three-year period to  
31 December 2019. 
In making this statement, the Directors 
carried out a robust assessment of the  
principal risks facing the Group, including  
those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity.

risks and information about how we manage 
them. See pages 30 to 33.

at the date of this report and the mitigations that we have in place to manage

RISK AND IMPACT RISK APPETITE MITIGATION
CHANGE  
IN 2016
1.  Safety, Health and Environment
 • Failure to prevent a major safety incident/
accident or environmental event which 
could adversely affect the Group’s 
reputation and its operational and 
financial performance.
 • Failure to deliver ongoing improvements 
to performance result in failure to secure 
new work.
Costain recognises that 
we operate in a high-risk 
field but we have a zero 
tolerance approach to 
the safety and health of 
our workforce and other 
stakeholders, and in 
relation to the protection 
of the environment.
 • The health and safety of our people and 
everyone who is impacted by Costain remains 
our highest priority. 
 • A comprehensive strategy for the improvement 
of our Safety, Health and Environment performance 
enhanced in 2016 to deliver further progress to 
our goals.
 • Detailed Safety, Health and Environment 
management processes.
 • The Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS) programme, 
accredited by The Cambridge Centre for Behavioural 
Studies, is used to create an environment where, 
through exhibiting leadership, everyone understands 
the importance of taking responsibility for their 
own safety and those around them.
 • Regular monitoring visits by experienced 
professionals and senior leaders from across the 
business, and on-site training take place to reduce 
the risk of human error.
 • Performance metrics in the Group’s Annual Incentive 
Plan also include a key non-financial indicator 
for health and safety.
2.  Political, economic and 
market conditions
Whilst the long-term nature of Costain’s 
contracts limits sudden fluctuations in 
revenue, changes in the cost of Costain 
doing business or reductions in the 
addressable market could arise as a 
result of:
 • Changes in Government policy on 
spending including an increased 
burden on corporate entities.
 • The implications of the EU 
referendum result.
 • The changing nature of international 
politics and their influence on the 
UK market.
Costain’s business is 
based on taking informed 
decisions on the future 
market conditions but 
this can only happen 
where there is a high 
level of insight.
 • Our focus is on major customers in the UK energy, 
water and transportation markets defined by 
significant and long-term expenditure programmes 
underpinned by committed regulated spend and 
essential capital investment, e.g. the UK Government’s 
National Infrastructure Plan has identified investment 
of over £320 billion to 2020–21. 
 • The period of contracts providing significant 
protection from immediate change to 
Government policy.
 • Monitoring of policy development via industry 
groups and close contact with customers in our 
target markets.
 • High levels of engagement with our customers 
and other key stakeholders in Government and 
third parties.

CHANGE  
IN 2016
3. Financial strength
Costain must establish sufficient financial 
strength to operate its business. Without 
this the Group will:
 • Be unable to demonstrate to customers 
the required level of financial resource 
resulting in failure to win long-term 
contracts. 
 • Be unable to maintain a competitive 
scale in a consolidating market within 
the engineering sector.
 • Fail to maintain adequate working capital 
to operate the business.
Costain prioritises its 
financial strength to ensure 
it can continue to win work:
 • F o r e i g n c u r r e n c y 
exposure risk 
to be hedged.
 • P a r en t Com pa n y 
guarantee is the 
preferred option, and 
any performance bonds 
to be a maximum of 
10% and surety bonds 
are preferred.
 • There is zero tolerance 
to fraud and bribery.
 •  A strong balance sheet including positive net 
cash position.
 •  Extensive unutilised banking and bonding facilities.
 • The strategic use of joint venture partners to help 
achieve the required financial and operational 
strength only in markets where this is not 
demonstrated by the Group in isolation.
4. Winning new work
Costain maintains a pipeline of orders 
that now extends to £3.9 billion. There is 
a need for Costain to continue to innovate 
in order to win further work and maintain 
a leading position in the sector which 
could be at risk from: 
 • Competition and failure to win work from 
core customers.
 • Costain not being able to demonstrate 
the ability to provide an end-to-end 
delivery function as demanded by 
our customers.
Costain has no appetite 
for winning work that 
will impact the financial 
strength of the business:
 • Only sectors and 
customers which form 
part of the Group strategy 
to be pursued.
 • Target cost is the 
preferred contract form.
 • All contracts to be at least 
cash neutral.
 • Operations are to 
be in line with the 
Group Commercial 
Expectations document.
 • Opportunities should 
be pursued alone unless 
there is a compelling 
reason otherwise.
 • The order book at year end stands at £3.9 billion, 
providing long-term visibility of earnings. 
 • A focus on blue-chip customers whose major 
spending plans are underpinned by strategic 
national needs, regulation commitments or essential 
maintenance requirements by following the Group’s 
unique 'Engineering Tomorrow' strategy.
 • The accelerated implementation of programme 
management and technology services via 
strategic acquisitions.
 • Continuing to develop and maintain strong 
relationships with customers across key markets 
on the back of our track record for delivery.
 • Regularly monitoring pipeline opportunities and 
ensuring resources are centrally allocated to the 
most advantageous business development activities.
 • Continuously striving to broaden the skills and 
breadth of our capability (organically and by 
acquisition) to meet the increasingly broad 
requirements of the market.
 • Continuing to develop the Group’s market 
proposition through the introduction of new 
technologies and the strong Costain brand.

5. Operational delivery
Costain delivers works through a number 
of often large contracts containing defined 
output requirements. There is a risk that 
Costain is unable to deliver these services 
to the time, cost or quality required in the 
contract as a result of:
 • A failure to accurately assess our works 
(including costs and time required) or 
contractual terms at tender.
 • Design faults that result in additional 
works to rectify.
 • An interruption to our supply chain that 
provides part of the services or materials 
to complete the works.
 • Refusal of claim by insurers following 
a loss.
 • Compensation events or increase in 
scope not being fully reimbursed by 
our customers.
All operations to follow 
the Costain Way.
Only approved suppliers 
to be used.
All legislation and 
regulations to be complied 
with at all times.
 • The Costain Way provides a comprehensive 
management system including policies, processes 
and procedures for all parts of the contract life-cycle; 
from tendering to contract close-out. 
 • The use of experienced and qualified staff to prepare 
bids and manage the contracted works.
 • Defined delegated authority levels for approving all 
tenders where all significant contracts are subject to 
escalation from the Executive Investment Committee 
to the Board.
 • Extensive review of the supply chain strength prior to 
engagement and a requirement to use performance 
bonds where they are appropriate. 
 • Regular contract leaders’ meetings are used 
to discuss safety, progress, quality, financial 
performance, end forecast, risk, etc.
 • Work on site is audited by in-house specialists and 
reports are prepared so that corrective action, where 
required, can be taken.
 • A senior executive is responsible for overall quality 
issues, the updating of best practice and ensuring 
compliance in both existing operations and in line 
with the changing business.
 • Enhanced controls regarding the administration of 
insurance claims and the management of contracted 
design was developed in 2015 including the evolution 
of processes to minimise exposure to the customer, 
whilst preserving subrogation with the Group’s supply 
chain.
 • Compensation events are closely monitored by 
our project teams, and are included in the monthly 
reporting process through to senior management. 
Robust processes are in place to ensure compliance 
with contractual requirements regarding such 
compensation events, including timely notification, 
documented discussions with the client, and 
maintenance of appropriate supporting records.
6.  People and skills
The success of the Group is built on the 
strength and experience of our people. 
Failure to continue to attract, retain 
and develop our best-in-class team in 
an increasingly competitive market may 
limit the Group’s ability to grow the business 
as anticipated, or cause a short-term impact 
on performance.
The right skills and 
capabilities to carry 
out Group operations 
are essential.
 • The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to 
attract and retain high-calibre individuals and 
to remunerate fairly, whilst not encouraging 
inappropriate business risk to be taken.
 • The Group has a high staff retention rate and 
engaged workforce. 
 • Pay and conditions of employment are regularly 
reviewed against the prevailing market and bench 
marked against competitors to ensure that the Group 
remains competitive at all levels.
 • An internal recruitment team provides a dedicated 
service to the identification and enrolment of new 
staff who are provided with training as part of 
a comprehensive induction process.
 • A well-developed succession planning process 
is regularly monitored.
 • Talent reviews and ongoing personal development 
are proactively supported at all levels.
 • Active liaison with employees is achieved through 
the Costain Ground Force employee committee 
and engagement surveys.

CHANGE  
IN 2017
7. Pension liabilities
 The Group has a deficit of £73.5m in 
its defined benefit pension scheme 
which was closed to new members from 
1 June 2005 and to future accrual on 
30 September 2009. Failure to manage 
the scheme so that the liabilities are within 
a range appropriate to its capital base could 
have an adverse impact on the Group’s 
operational results.
All current and future 
pension arrangements 
to be on a defined 
contribution basis.
 •  Regular reviews, including the use of independent 
professional advisers, are held to mitigate long-
term risk associated with the legacy defined 
benefit scheme.
 • Ongoing active management of the obligations 
of the scheme including the transfer of assets 
into the scheme and the implementation of 
Enhanced Transfer Value and Pension Increase 
Exchange exercises.
 • An actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 
31 March 2016 has been carried out and an 
associated deficit recovery plan has been agreed  
with the Trustee.
8. Acquisitions
 The Group has a growth plan that is 
partly facilitated by the effective acquisition 
of companies that will enhance the 
achievement of its strategy. Failure to 
integrate successfully an acquired business 
or recognise and mitigate new and related 
risks could have a damaging impact on 
the Group’s future revenue and profits.
Acquisitions must focus on 
the creation of shareholder 
value through capability-
broadening opportunities 
that can be cross-sold via 
our existing customer base.
 • Full due diligence is carried out before 
any acquisition is made.
 • Integration plans are put in place and managed 
by a dedicated and experienced team.
 • Regular progress reports using pre-agreed 
performance indicators are made to the Board. 
 • Lessons are fed back into future integration exercises.
9. Failure of IT systems
 Costain has a high reliance upon IT systems 
to operate efficiently, process transactions 
and report on results. The failure of a 
system as well as the failure to store key 
documentation securely could cause 
financial loss to the Group and expose the 
Group to breaches of legislation and fines. 
It may also have a negative effect on the 
ability to secure further contracts. This risk 
has increased due to increasing levels of 
cyber security threats within society.
All critical systems are to 
be regularly backed up 
and a disaster recovery 
contingency plan put 
in place.
 • Transition underway to cloud-based systems 
for enhanced security and monitoring.
 • There is at least duplication in core hosting systems 
supporting data recovery efforts.
 • A suitably qualified team for support, including 
specialist outsourced suppliers, ensures knowledge 
is maintained.
 • Regular internal and external testing and assurance 
exercises are carried out.
 • Established business continuity systems and 
procedures, routinely tested and developed, 
ensure rapid recovery and data retrieval.
 • Security training is provided for safe usage and 
storage of documentation for all staff.
 • The system is accredited to the ISO 27001:2013 
Information Security Management System providing 
independent assurance of best practice.

the effective implementation of the 
Group’s focused strategy which has 
continued to deliver good financial 
results over a number of years.”
Anthony Bickerstaff | Finance Director
This review brings together the key 
financial metrics of the Group and sets out 
the matters of financial significance. 
Overview
In 2016, the Group had another year of 
strong financial performance with increases 
in revenue and profit and finished the year 
with a record order book and an excellent 
net cash position. This performance 
reflects the effective implementation of 
the Group’s focused strategy which has 
continued to deliver good financial results 
over a number of years. 
In addition, investment has been made 
in enhancing the Group’s skills and 
capabilities through the acquisition made 
in the period. The Group continues to 
attract good support from its banking and 
surety bond providers and has enhanced 
and extended its facilities during the year. 
Revenue, including share of joint ventures 
and associates, was £1,658.0 million 
for the year to 31 December 2016 
(2015: £1,316.5 million). The Group 
generated a 24% increase in underlying 
operating profit to £41.1 million 
(2015: £33.2 million). The increased 
profit reflects the Group’s continued 
focus on long-term repeat orders with 
blue-chip customers.
Reported revenue, excluding share 
of joint ventures and associates, 
was £1,573.7 million for the year to 
31 December 2016 (2015: £1,263.6 million).
Profit before tax, before other 
items, for the year was £37.5 million 
(2015: £29.9 million). Basic earnings per 
share, before other items, amounted 
to 31.5 pence (2015: 25.1 pence). 
Reported profit before tax for the year 
was £30.9 million (2015: £26.0 million). 
Reported basic earnings per share were 
25.7 pence (2015: 21.8 pence). 
The Group secured a number of new 
contracts and extensions and the Group’s 
order book was maintained at £3.9 billion 
(31 December 2015: £3.9 billion).
The results of the Group’s operating 
divisions are considered in the 
Divisional review section and are 
shown in the segmental analysis 
in the financial statements.

STRATEGIC REPORT
34 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Other items
In order to aid understanding of the 
underlying performance of the Group, 
throughout the Annual Report underlying 
operating profit and underlying 
profit before tax have been used. 
These measures exclude ‘other items’ 
which are acquisition related charges 
including amortisation of intangible assets 
and deferred consideration treated as an 
employment expense. These ‘other items’ 
are shown in a separate column in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Acquisitions 
On 5 July 2016, the Group acquired SSL 
a provider of technology-based solutions, 
primarily for the highways sector, but 
with the potential for wider applications 
across the Group. SSL was acquired for 
a total cash consideration of £17.0 million 
on a debt free/cash free basis with 
normalised working capital. £1.5 million 
of consideration has been deferred and 
is payable in July 2019. 
In 2015, the Group acquired Rhead Group, 
a professional services consultancy with 
a focus on programme and commercial 
management. The acquisition was made 
for a total consideration of £36 million 
on a debt free/cash free basis with 
normalised working capital. £3 million of 
the consideration was deferred and was 
payable in two equal tranches with the 
first paid in August 2016 and the second 
is payable in August 2017. 
Also in 2015, the Group, by mutual 
agreement with its joint venture partner, 
reorganised the net assets held by the 
non-core Costain-Santander joint venture 
(JV) in Spain. The reorganisation resulted 
in Costain acquiring the partner’s 50% 
stake in the JV and the partner acquiring 
certain real estate assets owned by the JV. 
Interest
Net finance expense amounted 
to £4.2 million (2015: £3.5 million). 
The interest payable on bank overdrafts, 
loans and other similar charges was 
£3.3 million (2015: £2.7 million) and the 
interest income from bank deposits and 
other loans and receivables amounted to 
£0.6 million (2015: £0.8 million). In addition, 
the net finance expense includes the 
interest cost on the net liabilities of 
the pension scheme of £1.1 million 
(2015: £1.3 million) and £0.4 million 
(2015: £0.3 million) unwind of discount 
on deferred consideration.
Tax
The Group’s effective rate of tax was 
14.6% of the profit before tax (2015: 14.6%). 
The lower than normal rate of tax arose 
owing to Research and Development 
tax relief and the reversal of timing 
differences including the use of tax losses 
not previously recognised as deferred 
tax assets.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend for the year of 8.4 pence per 
share (2015: 7.25 pence per share) to bring 
the total for the year to 12.7 pence per 
share (2015: 11.0 pence per share). 
In accordance with the pension deficit 
recovery plan agreed with the Trustee 
of The Costain Pension Scheme (CPS), 
the Group will make an additional cash 
contribution to the pension scheme 
to match the total deficit contribution 
to the total amount of dividends paid 
to shareholders.
Shareholders’ equity
Shareholders’ equity decreased in the 
year to £99.6 million (2015: £120.6 million). 
The profit for the year amounted to 
£26.4 million and other comprehensive 
expenses to £39.8 million. The movements 
are detailed in the consolidated statements 
of comprehensive income and expense 
and changes in equity in the financial 
statements, the decrease in the year is 
primarily due to the re-measurement 
of the Group’s legacy pension scheme 
defined benefit obligations to reflect 
current market-based assumptions. 
Pensions
As at 31 December 2016, the Group’s 
pension scheme deficit in accordance 
with IAS 19, was £73.5 million 
(2015: £36.7 million). The scheme deficit 
position has increased primarily as a 
result of a decrease in the discount rate 
used to calculate the liabilities, which 
is based on corporate bond yields, and 
an increase in the assumed inflation rate 
partially offset by the return on assets 
and Company contributions.

of the pension scheme deficit calculation:

Present value of defined 
benefit obligations (827.5) (687.4)
Fair value of scheme assets 754.0 650.7

Principal actuarial assumptions 
(expressed as weighted averages) % %
Discount rate 2.70 3.80 
Future pension increases 3.10 2.95
Inflation assumption 3.20 3.00
In accordance with the pension 
regulations a triennial actuarial review 
of the Costain defined benefit pension 
scheme was carried out as at 31 March 
2016. In February 2017, an updated 
deficit recovery plan has been agreed 
with the scheme Trustee resulting in cash 
contributions of £10.0 million for the 
12 months to 31 March 2017 and then 
£9.6 million per annum (increasing annually 
with inflation) until the deficit is cleared, 
which would be in 2031 on the basis of the 
assumptions made in the valuation and 
agreed recovery plan. 
In addition, as previously implemented, 
the Group will continue to make an 
additional contribution so that the total 
deficit contributions match the total 
dividend amount paid by the Company 
each year. Consequently, the total amount 
of contribution is anticipated to be at 
the same overall level to that under the 
previous plan. Any additional payments 
in this regard would have the effect of 
reducing the recovery period in the 
agreed plan. 
Cash flow and borrowings
The Group has a positive cash 
balance, which was £210.2 million as at 
31 December 2016 (2015: £146.7 million) 
and borrowings of £70.0 million 
(2015: £38.5 million). This included cash 
held by joint operations of £68.1 million 
(2015: £42.7 million).
The increase in the net cash position 
reflects positive operating cash flow and 
working capital, in particular benefiting 
from the timing of receipts at the year-
end. These positive movements have 
been partially offset by the payment of 
acquisition related consideration, dividend 
payments and pension deficit contributions 
made during the year. The average 
month-end net cash balance during 2016 
was £69.1 million (2015: £103.7 million).
Contract bonding and 
banking facilities
The Group’s long-term contracting 
business is dependent on it being able 
to supply performance and other bonds 
as necessary. This means maintaining 
adequate facilities from banks and surety 
bond providers to meet the current 
and projected usage requirements. 
During the year, the Group has increased 
its contract bonding and banking 
facilities to £555 million and extended 
the maturity date to 25 June 2021 with its 
relationship banks and surety companies. 
These facilities are made up of £400 million 
of contract bonding, a £125 million 
revolving credit facility and a £30 million 
term loan.

STRATEGIC REPORT
36 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Treasury
The Group’s treasury and funding activities 
are undertaken by a centralised treasury 
function. Its primary activities are to 
manage the Group’s liquidity, funding 
and financial risk, principally arising from 
movements in interest rates and foreign 
currency exchange rates.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that 
adequate liquidity and financial resources 
are available to support the Group’s 
growth development, while managing 
these risks. The Group’s policy is not 
to engage in speculative transactions. 
Group Treasury operates as a service 
centre within clearly defined objectives and 
controls and is subject to periodic review 
by internal audit.
Liquidity risk
The Group finances its operations primarily 
by a mixture of working capital, funds 
from shareholders, retained profits and 
borrowings. The Directors regularly 
monitor cash usage and forecast usage to 
ensure that projected financing needs are 
supported by adequate cash reserves or 
bank facilities.
Foreign currency exposure
Translation exposure: the results of the 
Group’s overseas activities, mainly non-
core activities in Spain, are translated 
into sterling at rates approximating to the 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates 
of the transactions. The balance sheets of 
overseas subsidiaries and investments are 
translated at foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the balance sheet date. The Group holds 
a currency hedge against the assets held in 
its Spanish subsidiary.
Transaction exposure: the Group has 
transactional currency exposures 
arising from subsidiaries’ commercial 
activities overseas and from overseas 
supply purchases for business in the UK. 
Where appropriate, the Group requires 
its subsidiaries to use forward currency 
contracts to minimise any currency 
exposure unless a natural hedge exists 
elsewhere within the Group.
Interest rate risks and exposure
The Group enters into financial 
instruments, where necessary, to finance 
its operations. Various financial instruments 
(for example, trade receivables and 
trade payables) arise directly from the 
Group’s operations.
The main exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations within the Group’s operations 
arises from surplus cash, which is generally 
deposited with the Group’s relationship 
banks, and bank borrowings.

STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION I have two key objectives as your 
Chairman. First, the Board must maintain 
and encourage the highest standards

Board must be effective, particularly

Dr Paul Golby CBE | Chairman
Chairman’s summary statement
Dear Shareholder
I joined the Board and succeeded David Allvey as Chairman at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2016. 
I have two key objectives as your Chairman. First, the Board must 
maintain and encourage the highest standards of corporate 
governance. My fellow Directors and I will continue to promote a 
robust governance framework that encourages transparency and 
accountability, as well as a meticulous and efficient approach to internal 
control and risk management.
Secondly, the Board must be effective, particularly in ensuring that the 
Group has a robust strategy and the best management team in place 
to implement it. 
Successfully achieving these objectives facilitates the continuing 
development, growth and sustainability of the business.
INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
GOVERNANCE
38 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Some of the key priorities 
during the year were:
Strategy
This year, the Board has again undertaken 
wide-ranging discussions on key strategic 
issues. This has included a number of 
workshops attended by members of the 
Group Executive Board and third-party 
advisers. These conversations continued 
to be focused on implementing our 
unique, focussed and continually evolving 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy. A three-
year business plan was approved in 
December 2016. 
Risk
During the year the new Group Risk 
Manager has further reviewed and 
enhanced the risk management and 
monitoring framework and the clarity 
of reporting to the Audit Committee 
and Board in this area. 
Board composition and 
succession planning
The report from the Nominations 
Committee on pages 57 to 58 explains 
the process the Board and Nominations 
Committee followed in undertaking a 
search for a new Chairman. Board and 
senior management succession has 
been a regular feature of our Board 
and Nomination meetings.
Board effectiveness
Each year, the Board undertakes a formal 
evaluation of its effectiveness and that of 
its Committees. This year the process has 
been internally facilitated and led by me 
as the Chairman. It has built on the work 
carried out two year’s ago by independent 
external facilitators, SCT Consultants Ltd. 
In addition, James Morley, the Senior 
Independent Director, has also led a 
review of my performance with input from 
the other Directors. Further details of the 
evaluation process can be found on page 
58. Following this review, I am satisfied that 
the Board and its Committees are working 
effectively and that there is the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, diversity 
and independence. 
On the following pages, we explain 
our approach to corporate governance, 
demonstrating how the Board and 
its Committees have fulfilled their 
responsibilities to ensure robust 
governance practices are embedded 
throughout the Company.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  45 expressed as the number of meetings 
that each Director attended out of the 
number that they were eligible to attend. 
In addition, ad-hoc meetings were 
arranged to deal with matters between 
the scheduled meetings as appropriate.
Board roles
For more information please refer 
to diagram on pages 44 to 45. 
Board independence
The Board considers each of its Non-
Executive Directors to be independent in 
character and judgement and there are no 
relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect (or could appear to affect) 
the judgement of such Non-Executive 
Directors, notwithstanding that, in the 
case of Mr James Morley, the Senior 
Independent Director, he has served 
on the Board for more than nine years 
as at the date of this report.
At the time of his original appointment in 
May 2016, the Chairman of the Company 
was considered independent by the Board. 
However, in accordance with the Code
1
, 
the ongoing test of independence is not 
applicable in relation to the Chairman.
The Company complies with the 
requirement under provision B.1.2 of 
the Code that at least half of the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, should comprise 
Non-Executive Directors determined 
by the Board to be independent, 
notwithstanding that this requirement is 
waived in respect of smaller companies, 
such as the Company, which is a member 
of the FTSE SmallCap Index.

at www.frc.org.uk.

Role of the Board
For more information please refer 
to diagram on pages 44 to 45. 
Board composition and attendance
The Board currently comprises the 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and 
four independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The membership of the Board and 
biographical details of all the Directors 
can be found on pages 40 and 41.
The biographies illustrate that the 
Non-Executive Directors have a range of 
business and financial experience that is 
important and relevant to the management 
of the Company. The Board believes that 
there is an appropriate balance between 
Executives and Non-Executives and that 
this balance is enhanced by the varying 
lengths of service, gender balance and 
expertise of the Non-Executive Directors 
which is depicted in the pie charts on 
this page. 
The Board recognises the importance 
of greater diversity (including gender 
diversity) in the boardroom and throughout 
the business, further details of which are 
given in the Nomination Committee report 
on pages 57 and 58.
The Board meets regularly, with eight 
scheduled meetings having taken place 
during the year. The Directors’ attendance 
record at the scheduled Board meetings

46 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 JULY 2016 BOARD VISIT 
TO LONDON: 
Offsite visits and Board meetings 
give the Board further insights into 
the business. In July 2016, a 3 day 
Board visit to London included:
• Site visit to London Bridge 
Station Redevelopment project
• Site visit to Crossrail C610 project
• Presentation by participants 
of the Emerging 
Leaders Programme
• Board dinner with senior 
managers and other 
invited guests
Appointments to the Board and 
retirement of Directors
David Allvey retired from the Board as 
Non-Executive Chairman at the conclusion 
of the Company’s AGM on 5 May 2016 with 
Dr Paul Golby CBE being appointed as his 
successor. Dr Golby’s biography can be 
found on page 40.
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Code, 
the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. The Articles of Association 
may be amended by a special resolution 
of the Company’s shareholders. 
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require that all Directors should be subject 
to election by shareholders at the first 
opportunity after their appointment and 
to re-election thereafter at intervals of no 
more than three years. The Company’s 
Articles of Association also provide that 
Non-Executive Directors who have served 
for longer than nine years should be 
subject to annual re-election. Accordingly, 
the aforementioned provisions of the 
Company’s Articles of Association comply 
with provision B.7.1 of the Code, as 
applicable to smaller companies below 
the FTSE 350.
The Executive Directors have contracts 
of employment with the Company, 
terminable on 12 months’ notice, whilst 
the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
all have letters of appointment with the 
Company. An independent Non-Executive 
Director’s appointment is for an initial 
period of three years, at the expiry of 
which time the appointment is reviewed 
to determine whether the appointment 
should continue. All contracts and letters 
of appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours.
In accordance with an Undertaking entered 
into in October 1997 , UEM Group Berhad had 
been entitled to appoint a Non-Executive 
Director as long as they held more than 7% 
of the aggregate nominal value of the then 
issued share capital of the Company, although 
they had not taken advantage of this option 
since 4 December 2009. In November 2016 
UEM’s holding in the Company fell below 7% 
and as 31 December 2016 they no longer held 
any interest in the Company’s shares.
The Company therefore complied with 
provision B.2.3 of the Code throughout 
the whole of the year, which requires that 
all Non-Executive Directors should be 
appointed for a specific term.
Board effectiveness
Performance
The Board has established a formal process 
for the evaluation of the performance of 
the Board and its principal Committees 
and further details are provided on page 
58 of the Nomination Committee report. 
The Board considers that the performance 
evaluations demonstrate that each Director 
continues to contribute effectively and 
the Board as a whole demonstrates 
good practice on the key indicators 
of Board effectiveness. 
Board induction and training
On appointment, the Directors take part 
in an induction programme, pursuant 
to which they receive information about 
the Group, the role of the Board and the 
matters reserved for its decision, the 
terms of reference and membership of 
the principal Board Committees and the 
powers delegated to the Committees, the 
Group’s corporate governance practices 
and procedures, and the latest financial 
information about the Group.
As regards the continuing professional 
development of the Executive and Non-
Executive Directors, Board members, 
independent of any formal training 
arranged by the Company, are encouraged 
to attend seminars and conferences on 
issues relevant to their appointment as 
Directors of a public company, particularly 
matters concerned with corporate 
governance, audit and remuneration 
issues. In addition, Board site visits are 
considered essential to ensure that 
Directors have a thorough understanding 
of the business operations and issues that 
affect the Group. The Board also takes 
part in the Company’s Health and Safety 
training programmes. 
I find these site visits 
provide the Board with 
further insight into the 
business and assist the 
Board in supporting 
executive management 
in the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy"
David McManus
Non-Executive Director
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  47 Operation of the Board
The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda 
and ensures that adequate time is 
available for discussion of all agenda 
items. In order to discharge their duties, 
the Directors are provided with full and 
timely access to papers prior to Board 
meetings via a fully encrypted electronic 
portal system. Directors have access to 
all information relating to the Group and 
are free to seek any further information 
they consider necessary. After each 
meeting, the Company Secretary operates 
a comprehensive follow-up procedure 
to ensure that actions are completed as 
agreed by the Board.
Senior executives below Board level are 
invited to attend Board meetings from time 
to time in order to deliver presentations on 
issues that are relevant to their particular 
business sector or function. During the 
year, the Directors set aside several days to 
combine scheduled Board and Committee 
meetings with visiting regional offices 
and operational sites in order to provide 
the Non-Executives with an opportunity 
to meet both senior managers and other 
members of staff and to obtain a greater 
insight into particular aspects of the 
business and projects that the Company 
is engaged in. 
In July 2016, the Board travelled to London 
in order to visit the Company’s London 
Bridge and Crossrail projects and the 
highlights of their visit are detailed in 
the table shown on page 47.
In addition, between Board meetings, the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
have access to the Chief Executive, Finance 
Director and Company Secretary in order 
to progress the Company’s business. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors also receive a weekly report from 
the Chief Executive, monthly management 
accounts, internal audit reports and regular 
management reports and information, 
which enable them to scrutinise the Group 
and its management’s performance 
against agreed objectives. The Board is 
also kept up to date on legal, regulatory 
and governance matters by both the 
Company Secretary and external advisers. 
An example of training undertaken this 
year was a session held for all the Directors 
by the Company’s corporate lawyers on 
the new Market Abuse Regulations which 
came into force in July 2016.
All Board members have access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring 
that Board procedures are followed and 
applicable rules and regulations are 
followed, and who is also the Company’s 
Legal Director. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is 
a matter reserved for Board approval. 
The Board also obtains advice from 
professional advisers as and when required 
at the expense of the Company.
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with Article 78 of the 
Company’s Articles of Association and 
provision B.7.1 of the Code, Dr Paul Golby, 
James Morley and Alison Wood are due 
to offer themselves for re-election at the 
2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
Dr Paul Golby, having been appointed by 
the Board since the last AGM, is required 
to stand for re-election. Alison Wood, 
having served on the Board at the time 
of the two preceding AGMs without 
retiring, and James Morley having been 
in office for a continuous period in excess 
of nine years, are also both required to 
stand for re-election at the 2017 AGM. 
Dr Paul Golby, James Morley and Alison 
Wood have letters of appointment with 
the Company, details of which are set out 
in the Directors’ Remuneration report on 
page 67.
Having due regard to the results of 
the externally facilitated review of the 
Board’s performance conducted by SCT 
Consultants Ltd, and to periodic internal 
evaluations (further details provided on 
page 58 of the Nomination Committee 
report), the Board confirms that it is of 
the opinion that each of the Directors 
standing for re-election continues to be 
independent in character and judgement. 
The Board also confirms that these 
Directors continue to perform effectively, 
and that they demonstrate commitment to 
their particular roles and that they ensure 
that proper time is devoted to Board and 
Committee meetings and should therefore 
be re-elected at the forthcoming AGM.

48 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Directors’ conflicts of interest and 
external appointments
The Non-Executive Directors may serve 
on a number of other company boards 
provided they continue to demonstrate 
the requisite commitment to discharge 
their duties to the Company effectively 
and such external appointments are 
seen as being beneficial to the overall 
decision-making process of the Board as 
a whole. The Company also encourages 
the Executive Directors to take up non-
executive positions, with the prior consent 
of the Company, in the belief that such 
appointments broaden their skills and 
enhance the contribution which they can 
make to the Company’s performance. 
Generally, no more than one such 
appointment may be undertaken by 
the Executive Directors. The Company 
has procedures in place for managing 
conflicts of interest. Directors are required 
to declare all external appointments or 
relationships with other companies and the 
Board has adopted appropriate processes 
to manage and, if appropriate, approve 
any such appointment or relationship 
which could result in a possible conflict 
of interest. The Board has satisfied 
itself that there is no compromise to 
the independence of the Directors who 
have appointments on the boards of, 
or relationships with, other companies. 
Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
The Board receives reports from the 
Company’s CR Director and monitors 
progress on a regular basis.
Remuneration
Details of the Company’s remuneration 
policy and how it has been implemented, 
together with the activities of the 
Remuneration Committee are to be 
found on pages 59 to 78 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration report.
Shareholder communication 
and engagement
The Company remains committed to 
maintaining good relationships with both 
institutional and private shareholders. 
There continues to be regular dialogue 
with institutional investors and brokers.
At the time of the announcement 
of the full-year and half-year results, 
presentations are made to brokers’ 
analysts, the press and institutional 
investors. These presentations are 
available on the Company’s website 
at costain.com. In addition, there are 
meetings with analysts, financial journalists 
and institutional investors throughout the 
year including a ‘Capital Markets Day’ 
which took place in June 2016. 
The Chairman is available to discuss 
strategy and governance issues with 
shareholders, and James Morley, as 
the Senior Independent Director, is 
available to shareholders if they have 
any concerns that have not been, or 
cannot be, addressed through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive 
or Finance Director.
The Company obtains feedback from its 
brokers, Investec and Liberum Capital, 
on the views of institutional investors on 
a non-attributed basis. As a matter of 
routine, the Board reviews reports from 
its brokers on issues relating to recent 
share price performance, trading activity 
and institutional sentiment. The Board 
also receives copies of relevant analysts’ 
reports on an ad-hoc basis.
The Board regards the AGM as an 
important opportunity to communicate 
directly with shareholders. The AGM 
provides shareholders with an opportunity 
to ask questions of the Directors during the 
meeting and also on a more informal basis 
following the conclusion of the meeting, 
at which senior members of staff are also 
present. The AGM also gives shareholders 
an opportunity to listen to a presentation 
from the Chief Executive on the current 
trading performance and developments 
within the business. Board members, 
including the Chairs of the Remuneration, 
Nomination and Audit and Risk 
Committees, attended the 2016 AGM and 
propose to attend the 2017 AGM, where 
they will be available to answer questions.
Shareholders may raise issues or concerns 
by contacting the Group’s Investor 
Relations Director via the email address 
stated on the Company’s website or 
by writing to the Company Secretary.
The Company remains 
committed to maintaining 
good relationships with 
both institutional and 
private shareholders.
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  49 Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Board is required by the Code 
to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the 
Company’s position and prospects and 
reference is made to the statement of 
Directors’ responsibilities on page 83 
together with the statement on the status 
of the Company as a going concern 
and the financial viability statement on 
page 28. 
The preparation of this Annual Report and 
Accounts involved input from a number of 
functions across the Group and the Board 
was involved at an early stage to enable 
review, challenge and discussion ahead 
of approving the final publication.
The Board also recognises that its 
responsibility to present a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment also 
extends to interim and other price-sensitive 
reports that the Company may publish 
from time to time.
Business model
The Strategic report on pages 01 to 37 
gives details of the Company’s business 
model and the strategy for delivering the 
objectives of the Company.
Risk management and 
internal control
Risk management
Risk management is firmly established 
and plays a critical role ensuring the 
Group continues to meet its objectives. 
The Board is responsible for making a 
robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity and 
for ensuring that appropriate mitigating 
actions are in place to manage them. 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Company at the date of this report 
can be found on pages 30 to 33 of the 
Strategic report.
Enterprise Risk Management approach
The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
approach assesses and manages on an 
ongoing basis the most significant risks 
to the Group’s objectives. The ERM 
process covers all types of risk including 
operational, financial, legal and regulatory. 
The Company’s assessment of risk includes 
explicit consideration of the possible 
impacts of the risks on the reputation 
of the Group as a whole, analysing both 
the potential causes and impact of risk. 
Using this process, suitable consideration 
of the controls needed to minimise the 
likelihood of risks occurring and those 
which can help to maximise resilience 
to risks are made.
The ERM framework is recurrent; reviewing 
risk levels regularly and ensuring frequent 
monitoring of control implementation. 
Whilst coordinated and supported by 
the Group Risk Management function, 
ownership of risk is maintained at the 
relevant business unit level. 
The ERM process ensures the Costain 
Way, a common platform which contains 
all governance, controls, policies and 
procedures for the Company, is further 
fine-tuned to enhance the control

review and development of the formal 
and informal controls necessary to ensure 
we meet our objectives.
The preparation of 
this Annual Report

input from a number 
of functions across the 
Group and the Board

Enterprise Risk Management Process
Our risk focus for 2017
During 2016, the emphasis on risk 
management was more strategic in nature, 
with the Group’s broader market activities 
being monitored in order to ensure further 
development of the competitive edge. 
For 2017, there is a focus on resilience and 
critical business functions, as well as the 
strategic and operations management.
The overall assessment is that there is a 
strong risk management culture within 
the Group which is continuing to develop, 
supported centrally by the Group Risk 
Management function. 
Ensuring the effectiveness of the 
system of risk management and 
internal controls 
The Board is responsible for the effective 
and ongoing monitoring and review of 
the Group’s system of internal controls. 
In addition, the Board supported by the 
Audit Committee also carries out an annual 
review of the effectiveness of the systems. 
Such a system, however, can only manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The Board maintains full control over 
strategic, financial, operational and 
compliance issues. The Chief Executive 
has full authority to act subject to the 
matters reserved to the Board and to 
the requirements of Group policies, 
and is expressly responsible for Health 
and Safety.
The Board and Group Executive Board 
receive regular reports on Safety, Health 
and Environmental performance and 
significant operational matters. The Group 
Executive Board is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with Company procedures.
Operational controls
The Company uses the Costain Way, 
its operational management system, to 
detail controls and procedures, including 
Group policy statements, procedure 
manuals and other written instructions, 
which are reviewed and updated regularly. 
The objectives of the Costain Way are 
to provide assurance that: 
• Company activities across the business 
are compliant with appropriate 
legislation and codes of practice;
• Company systems, procedures and 
processes are effective at mitigating 
identified risks; 
• customer expectations are understood, 
communicated and effectively delivered;  
The Company’s 
assessment of risk 
includes explicit 
consideration of the 
possible impacts of the 
risks on the reputation 
of the Group as a whole, 
analysing both the 
potential causes and 
impact of risk.
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  51 • management controls are consistently 
applied across the Group; and
• performance is reviewed, validated 
and continually improved. 
The Costain Way has been externally 
certified by BSI as compliant to 
management standards including ISO 
9001 (quality), ISO 14001 (environment), 
OHSAS 18001 (health and safety), ISO 
22301 (business continuity), ISO 27001 
(information security) and BS 11000 
(collaboration).
Each contract leader is wholly accountable 
for performance of their operations. 
They complete a monthly report that 
provides detailed information on Safety, 
Health and Environmental performance, 
cash flow, value, cost and profit, claims and 
variations, risk management, progress and 
staffing levels. This enables management 
to monitor performance and intervene 
where appropriate. All contracts operate 
within a controlled framework of best 
practice assured by second (system 
design and senior management review) 
and third (internal and third-party audit) 
line defences. 
Financial controls
There is a comprehensive annual 
budgeting system, linked to the annual 
strategy review, for each business unit 
within the Group. The budget for the 
following year is reviewed and finalised 
by the Executive Board, alongside the 
three-year business plan, before final 
approval by the Board each December. 
The Company has in place internal controls 
and risk management systems in relation to 
the Company’s financial reporting process 
and the Group’s process for preparation of 
consolidated accounts. These are designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements 
for external reporting purposes. 
Each division’s performance is reviewed 
monthly by management and reported 
against budget to the Board and Executive 
Board. The reports cover profit and loss 
and cash flow with an accompanying 
narrative on significant issues underlying 
the financial reports. Furthermore, a review 
of the consolidated financial statements 
is completed by management to ensure 
that the financial position and results of the 
Group are appropriately reflected therein. 
The Group Treasurer and Group Taxation 
Manager report to the Audit Committee, 
via the Finance Director, on any issues 
of significance to the Group. 
Compliance
The Company expects the highest 
standards from all employees, suppliers 
and joint venture partners. The Group’s 
policies contain a statement on business 
conduct, emphasising the legal, ethical 
and moral standards that must be 
employed in all the Company’s business 
dealings. This statement is regularly 
reviewed and updated as appropriate 
to ensure compliance with any change 
in legislation. 
Internal Audit monitors compliance 
against the Costain Way using a 
risk-based approach to ensure the focus 
is on high-risk activities and thus verify the 
appropriate implementation of controls. 
This independent assurance ensures 
risks inherent to the Company’s business 
processes are reasonably controlled 
and assists management in assessing 
requirements for further controls.
In the event of a critical legal issue, a 
legal report is submitted to the Board. 
An annual review of all litigation valued 
above £50,000 is submitted to the Board 
for review. Significant legal and regulatory 
changes are notified to the appropriate 
staff and training given where necessary.

TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available from 
the Company Secretary and are 
published on the Company’s 
website at costain.com. These are 
reviewed annually, and following 
review this year no amendments 
were considered to be required 
at this time.
During 2016, the Committee held 
4 meetings. The meetings of the 
Committee are normally also attended 
by the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the 
Finance Director, the Group Risk Manager, 
the Head of Internal Audit, the Group 
Financial Controller and the External 
Auditor. Other senior executives will attend 
as required to provide information on 
matters being discussed which fall into 
their area of responsibility. The Committee 
also regularly meets privately with the 
External Auditor, the Group Risk Manager 
and the Head of Internal Audit. 
Role of the Committee
In accordance with its terms of reference 
and in compliance with the Code, the 
Committee is responsible for:
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s 
performance, and reviewing significant 
financial judgements contained in them;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls 
and the processes for management 
of the risks facing the Group;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and approving, 
in consultation with the Chief Executive, 
the appointment and termination of 
employment of the head of that function;
• monitoring the effectiveness of the 
external audit process and making 
recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment, 
reappointment and remuneration 
of the External Auditor;
• ensuring that an appropriate relationship 
between the Group and the External 
Auditor is maintained, including 
reviewing non-audit services and fees;
• reviewing the Group’s systems for 
detecting fraud, preventing bribery 
and allowing employees to raise 
concerns in a safe and confidential 
manner; and
In 2016 the Committee continued to focus 
on the integrity of the Group’s financial 
reporting, the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal controls 
systems and the robustness of the internal 
and external audit processes.
Our control functions have continued 
to develop during the year, benefiting 
from the first full year appointment of a 
dedicated Group Risk Manager, who has 
enabled a more integrated approach to 
risk management and an increase in the 
scope and depth of reviews across the 
business. This has also led to increased 
oversight by the Audit Committee on 
issues such as the management of joint 
ventures and cyber security.
More details of the Group’s principal risks 
can be found on pages 30 to 33. 
The External Auditor plays a critical 
role in ensuring the integrity of the 
Group’s financial reporting. This year, the 
Committee conducted a full tender of the 
External Auditor position. Following the 
completion of that process, the Committee 
recommended the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC as the 
Company’s statutory auditor, subject to 
shareholder approval. Further details of the 
External Auditor tender process are set out 
in this report.
Operation of the Committee 
The Committee is comprised exclusively 
of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The members of the Committee and details 
of their attendance at meetings are given 
on page 46. The Company Secretary is the 
Secretary to the Committee. 
The Company considers that I as 
Chairman, possess the necessary recent 
and relevant financial experience to 
effectively contribute to the Committee. 
In addition, the Company considers 
that all the members of the Committee 
possess relevant skills and experience to 
meaningfully support the activities of the 
Committee. Full details of their experience 
can be found in their biographies shown 
on pages 40 to 41.
Chairman’s summary statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Board, 
to present our report on the work of the Audit Committee (the 
Committee) in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  53 and processing waste. These facilities 
are all either fully completed or in the 
warranty period under the terms of the 
contract during which further work and 
plant modifications are to be completed. 
In the period, the Group has incurred 
further costs and has taken additional 
provisions to reach Final Acceptance on 
the contract, which is now targeted this 
year; and to complete the remaining works 
when access is available in accordance with 
the operational running of the plants under 
an agreed schedule to 2019. Costain has 
received significant payments from, and 
remains in discussions on further payments 
with, relevant contract counterparties and 
the Group’s insurers regarding the issues 
that have arisen on this contract. It has 
been the Group’s policy since 2009 not to 
pursue fixed price contracts of this nature.
On the basis of its review of material 
contracts, the Committee concluded that 
it was content with the judgements that 
had been made by management and that 
appropriate disclosures had been made 
at the relevant times.
(B) Pension
The Group’s defined benefit scheme 
requires significant judgements to be 
made in relation to the assumptions 
for inflation, future pension increases, 
investment returns and member longevity 
that underpin the valuation. Each year, in 
selecting the appropriate assumptions, 
the Company takes written advice 
from an independent qualified actuary. 
These assumptions and sensitivities are 
set out in Note 20 on pages 124 to 126.
A triennial actuarial review was also carried 
out as at 31 March 2016 and in February 
2017, an updated deficit recovery plan 
was agreed with the scheme Trustee.
(C) The carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets
As set out in Note 11 on pages 111 to 
112, the goodwill and acquired intangible 
balances within the Group relate to 
companies acquired by the Group. 
In particular, the Committee reviewed 
the carrying value of the goodwill 
within the Natural Resources Division. 
The Committee also critically reviewed 
the analysis performed by management 
on the valuation of intangibles on the 
acquisition of Simulation Systems Limited 
and the impairment considerations in 
respect of the goodwill and intangibles. 
The Committee agreed with the 
amortisation charge in respect of 
intangibles, and the conclusion that no 
impairment to goodwill was necessary. 
• reviewing its terms of reference and 
its effectiveness from time to time and 
recommending to the Board any changes 
required as a result of the review.
Principal activities during the year 
In 2016, the principal activities of the 
Committee and the manner in which 
it discharged its responsibilities were 
as follows:
Financial statements
The Committee reviewed and evaluated 
the Group’s draft financial statements, 
preliminary and interim results and 
reports from the External Auditor on the 
outcome of its reviews and audits in 2016. 
At the Board’s request, it also considered 
whether the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, was fair, balanced 
and understandable and provided the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Significant accounting matters 
The Committee considered key accounting 
issues, matters and judgements in relation 
to the Group’s financial statements and 
disclosures relating to:
(A) Key contract judgements
As more fully explained in Note 2 on pages 
101 to 102, a significant proportion of 
the Group’s activities are undertaken via 
long-term contracts. These contracts are 
accounted for in accordance with IAS 11, 
which requires estimates to be made for 
contract costs and revenues. These costs 
and revenues may be affected by a 
number of uncertainties that depend on 
the outcome of future events, and may 
need to be revised as events unfold and 
uncertainties are resolved.
Management uses detailed contract 
valuations and cost forecasts when 
formulating its judgements of costs 
and revenues and its assessments of 
the expected outcome of each long-
term contractual obligation. Given the 
Company’s portfolio of contracts, the 
Committee spent time during the year 
reviewing the positions and judgements 
taken by management on a number of 
material contracts across the Group. 
This was mainly achieved through 
discussions with management and the 
External Auditor. 
This review included, amongst other 
things, consideration of the Manchester 
Waste Disposal Authority PFI contract 
awarded in 2007. As reported previously, 
all 46 facilities on the scheme are operating

54 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Internal audit
The Group has an internally resourced 
internal audit function which reports 
directly to the Committee. The Committee 
is responsible for monitoring and reviewing 
the operation and effectiveness of 
this function and approves the scope 
of its annual plan. During the year, 
the Committee undertook an internal 
assessment of the effectiveness and 
independence of the internal audit 
function which evidenced continued 
improvement across all areas, including 
better alignment between audit planning 
and the Group’s strategic objectives, 
resulting in the improved effectiveness of 
internal audit reporting. Accordingly, the 
Committee is satisfied that the quality, 
experience and expertise of the function 
is appropriate for the business.
The Committee has received regular 
reports on the internal audit function’s 
programme and findings at each of its 
meetings during the course of the year, 
and has been presented with action plans 
to resolve any highlighted areas. As part 
of the integration of risk management and 
internal audit, during the year, the roles 
of the Group Risk Manager and Head of 
Internal Audit were replaced with a new 
role, Head of Risk and Assurance. This new 
role will have direct reporting access to the 
Committee and will manage the risk and 
internal audit resources and will commence 
in March 2017. 
Independence of the External Auditor
The Company’s External Auditor for the 
year ended 31 December 2016 was KPMG 
LLP (KPMG) who have been the Company’s 
auditors for more than 20 years. 
In accordance with best practice and 
professional standards, the Company 
requires its External Auditor to adhere 
to a rotation policy whereby the audit 
engagement partner is rotated after five 
years. The External Auditor is also required 
to periodically assess whether, in its 
professional opinion, it is independent and 
to share those views with the Committee.
The Senior Statutory Auditor (who has 
signed the Audit report on behalf of KPMG 
on page 86) is Andrew Marshall, who was 
appointed as the lead audit partner at the 
beginning of 2013.
In order to ensure the independence 
and objectivity of the External Auditor, 
the Committee monitors the non-audit 
services being provided to the Group 
by its External Auditor, and has adopted 
a policy on the provision of non-audit 
(D) Going concern and viability statement
The Committee reviewed the Group’s 
processes for the management of cash flow 
and working capital, committed funding, 
its ability to generate cash and its ability 
to raise further funding. It also challenged 
management’s sensitivity analysis 
including in relation to mitigating actions. 
The Committee also considered the period 
over which the Viability Statement (set 
out on page 28) should apply. Based on 
this analysis, we recommended to the 
Board that it could approve and make the 
Viability Statement and that the Group can 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
its financial statements.
(E) Future IFRS and UK GAAP 
developments
During the year, the Committee received 
a management report from the External 
Auditor regarding the future accounting 
developments likely to affect the 
presentation of the Group’s financial 
statements, including capitalisation of 
operating leases and revenue recognition 
on long-term contracts.
Evaluation of effectiveness 
of the Committee
An internal effectiveness review of 
the Committee’s performance has 
been carried out in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2016 as part of 
the review into the effectiveness of the 
Board conducted at the end of 2016. 
The review concluded that there were 
no significant areas for concern in respect 
of the performance of the Committee 
or any of its members. 
Risk management and internal controls
Details of the Group’s internal controls and 
risk management framework are more fully 
set out on pages 28 to 29 of the Strategic 
report and pages 50 to 52 of the Corporate 
Governance report.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, 
has evaluated the effectiveness of the 
systems of risk management and internal 
controls operated within the Group 
pursuant to the FRC’s guidance on internal 
control. The evaluation covered all material 
controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. The review did 
not identify any significant weaknesses 
in the system of internal control and 
risk management.
The Committee has also considered the 
confidential reporting and whistle-blowing 
procedures the Company has in place and 
is satisfied with these procedures.

STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  55 Audit tender and new external Auditor
As indicated last year, the Committee 
has considered the requirements of the 
Code and other recent changes to the EU 
regulatory framework. Taking a number of 
factors into consideration, the Committee 
decided to undertake a competitive tender 
for external audit services. KPMG, as 
long-standing external auditors, were not 
invited to tender, but no other professional 
firms were precluded from participating in 
the process.
This tender process was managed by a 
senior member of the Company’s finance 
team, and involved:
• The provision of information to all 
tendering firms via a shared data room;
• Individual meetings of the tendering 
firms with the Chairman of the 
Committee, executive management, 
and members of divisional and group 
finance functions;
• Written proposals; and
• A final presentation to the full 
Committee, chaired by the Chairman of 
the Committee, which was also attended 
by Executive Directors and the Chairman 
of the Group.
Following a rigorous and transparent 
selection process, the Committee 
recommended, and the Board agreed, that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) should 
be appointed, subject to Shareholders’ 
approval at the forthcoming AGM, as 
the Company’s new External Auditor. 
During the audit tender process, PwC 
satisfied the key selection criteria of audit 
quality and cultural/corporate compatibility, 
including by demonstrating a strong 
alignment with the Company’s values and 
their ability to meet strict independence 
and objectivity requirements. 
In order to ensure a smooth handover 
of the External Auditor role, PwC 
have “shadowed” KPMG through the 
31 December 2016 year end process, 
and attended Committee meetings, in 
preparation for their formal appointment. 
The Committee expresses its gratitude 
to KPMG for their contribution as the 
Company’s auditors over many years.

services by the External Auditor, with the 
objective of ensuring that such services do 
not impair the independence or objectivity 
of the External Auditor.
The policy also sets out a number of key 
principles that underpin the provision of 
non-audit services by the External Auditor: 
the External Auditor should not audit 
its own firm’s work; make management 
decisions for the Group; have a mutuality 
of financial interest with the Group; or be 
put in the role of advocate for the Group.
Approval of the Committee is required 
for any services provided by the External 
Auditor where the fee is likely to be 
in excess of £25,000. The Committee 
reviews all services being provided by 
the External Auditor annually to assess 
the independence and objectivity of the 
External Auditor, taking into consideration 
relevant performance and regulatory 
requirements, so as to ensure that these 
are not impaired by the provision of 
permissible non-audit services.
In 2016, the External Auditor performed 
very limited non-audit services in respect 
of which fees payable to the External 
Auditor were less than £0.1 million 
(2015: less than £0.1 million).
The Committee is satisfied that the 
independence of the External Auditor 
is not impaired given that the audit 
engagement partner is regularly changed 
and that the amount of non-audit fees 
are of a level that does not impact upon 
KPMG’s objectivity and independence. 
Audit quality and effectiveness
As part of a formal review process, external 
audit effectiveness questionnaires are 
completed by members of the Committee, 
the Executive Directors, other members 
of the Executive Board and certain 
members of the finance team. Based on 
the responses to the questionnaires, the 
Company Secretary produces a report for 
detailed consideration by the Committee.
Based on its consideration of the report, 
together with its own ongoing assessment, 
for example, through the quality of the 
External Auditor’s reports and the audit 
partner’s interaction with the Committee, 
the Committee remained satisfied with 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
external audit in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2016.

MAIN ACTIVITIES 
DURING THE YEAR 
In 2016, the Committee discharged 
its responsibilities by performing 
the following activities:
• Identifying and nominating for 
the Board’s approval, a candidate 
to fill the vacancy of Chairman. 
• Reviewing the overall size, 
structure and composition 
of the Board;
• Undertaking Board evaluations 
as detailed below;
• Receiving notifications from

interest might arise;
• Reviewing/recommending to 
the Board the reappointment of 
those Directors who are due to

at the Annual General Meeting 
in accordance with the Articles 
of Association, following due 
consideration of the Board’s 
policy on independence and 
the results of periodic Board 
performance reviews;

senior employees. 
also reviews management training 
and succession planning arrangements 
in respect of the Company’s senior

Board diversity
Boardroom diversity continues to be an 
important area of focus for the Committee 
with the aim of attracting and maintaining 
a Board which has a broad range of 
skills, backgrounds and experience 
whilst ensuring that the best people are 
appointed. Within this context, and as 
part of the ongoing process of refreshing 
the Board, the Company continues to 
encourage and welcome interest from 
a wide range of candidates who will add 
to the Board’s diversity. 
The Committee notes the Hampton-
Alexander Review on gender balance in 
FTSE leadership published in November 
2016, recommending an increase in the 
voluntary target for women represented 
on FTSE 350 Boards to 33% by 2020. 
Also, aiming for and disclosing progress 
towards, women representing a minimum 
of 33% of the senior leadership team 
(being the Group Executive Board and its 
direct reports). Costain is fully supportive 
of such principles (notwithstanding that, 
as a member of the FTSE SmallCap Index, 
it is not subject to such recommendations) 
which is reflected in the composition of 
our Board and Group Executive Board, 
further details of which can be found on 
pages 40 to 41 and 42 to 43 of this Annual 
Report respectively. 
Succession has been a key area of focus for 
the year, and on 6 April 2016 the Company 
announced that I would be joining the 
Board and succeeding David Allvey as 
Chairman with effect from the close of the 
Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2016. 
My appointment followed a process, led 
by James Morley, Senior Independent 
Director. JCA Partners LLP was appointed 
to facilitate this process and, having no 
other connection with the Company, 
was considered to be independent. 
The Committee provided JCA with a full 
specification of the skills, experience and 
knowledge required. The Committee 
considered a number of candidates before 
recommending that I be appointed.
Apart from the process of appointing 
a new Chairman, the main focus of 
the Committee during the year was 
on reviewing the size, structure and 
composition of the Board and considering 
succession planning for both the Board and 
high performing individuals below Board 
level. This will continue to be a focus of the 
Committee during 2017.
Role of the Committee
The principal role of the Committee is to 
review the structure and composition of 
the Board and to identify and propose 
to the Board suitable candidates to fill 
Board vacancies.
The Committee directs the periodic 
Board effectiveness reviews, both 
internal and external, which form

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  57 Board evaluations
The Board has established a formal process 
for the evaluation of the performance of 
the Board and its principal Committees.
For the 2016 financial year, the Board’s 
annual evaluation was carried out 
internally. It was facilitated by the 
Company Secretary under the direction 
of the Chairman. The process involved 
each of the Directors completing a high-
level questionnaire and a comprehensive 
discussion between the Chairman and 
each of the Board members. Separately, 
the Senior Independent Director met with 
the other Non-Executive Directors, without 
the Chairman being present in order to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance.
After reviewing the outcomes of the 
evaluation process, the Chairman prepared 
a summary report that was discussed 
by the Board. It was concluded that 
the Board’s strength continued to be 
demonstrated through its composition, 
clarity of roles and clear focus on strategy.
The procedures, effectiveness and 
development of the Board will continue 
to be kept under review. The last externally 
facilitated Board review was conducted by 
SCT Consultants Ltd in respect of the 2014 
financial year. 
The next independently facilitated review 
is expected to take place in respect of 
the 2017 financial year in accordance 
with provision B.6.2 of the Corporate 
Governance Code, notwithstanding that 
this requirement is waived in respect 
of smaller companies, such as the 
Company, which is a member of the 
FTSE SmallCap Index. 
The performance reviews show that 
each Director continues to have sufficient 
time, knowledge and commitment to 
contribute effectively to the Board and its 
Committees, and that the Board as a whole 
demonstrates good practice on the key 
indicators of Board effectiveness. 
Succession planning
The Committee adopts a formal and 
transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new Directors to the Board.
In the year under review, the Committee 
received updates from Sally Austin, the 
Group Human Resources Director, on 
the talent management processes in the 
Group including the progress of senior 
leaders. The Committee also reviewed 
the succession for members of the 
Group Executive Board and other senior 
employees. This has involved development 
initiatives for senior executives, international 
business school training, executive 
coaching and non-executive director 
mentoring. Committee members have 
also participated in several diversity 
related initiatives throughout the year.

58 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 ALISON WOOD
Chairman
This year we reduced the number of 
measures under the 2016 AIP to simplify 
the plan and reinforce the messages 
around the key underlying measures which 
underpin the delivery of our ‘Engineering 
Tomorrow’ strategy. Over half is linked to 
EBITA and the remainder to continuing 
to improve our Health and Safety 
performance, building a profitable order 
book, cash management and the delivery 
of critical project and corporate activities 
which are the personal responsibility of 
our Executive Directors. 
Based on 2016 EBITA of £41.3 million and 
taking into account performance in the year 
against the other AIP performance metrics, 
the Chief Executive and Finance Director 
will both receive 75.4% of their maximum 
AIP opportunity respectively. Further details 
are set out on page 71.
The LTIP award granted on 7 May 2014 was 
subject to an aggregate EPS target for the 
three financial years ended 31 December 
2016 of 83.9 pence (15% vests) to EPS of 
92.9 pence (100% vests). The origin of these 
targets set in 2014 was from an unusually high 
base point due to profit on disposals in 2013 
and as a consequence and despite strong 
performance, particularly in 2016, the LTIP 
will not vest. Full details are provided on 
page 71.
Our previous policy was adopted in 2014 
and, as we are required to put the policy 
to shareholders every three years, we will 
be putting a proposed new policy to our 
shareholders for their approval at this 
year’s AGM. We have used this opportunity 
to review the appropriateness of the policy 
in the context of the business environment, 
our continued strategy and the 
remuneration landscape. The Committee 
considers that the Company’s current 
remuneration framework continues to 
effectively support the delivery of our 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’ business strategy 
and the creation of shareholder value. 
Consequently, we are not proposing a 
radical overhaul of our policy. The changes 
proposed, which are outlined below, refine 
the current policy and are intended to 
ensure that we have sufficient flexibility 
to support potential changes to business 
needs over the next three years. 
Performance and variable pay 
outcomes for the year ended 
31 December 2016
The Company has delivered another 
strong result during the year, with 
continued growth in both revenue and 
profit, and has maintained a record high 
quality forward order book of £3.9 billion 
and a strong net cash position of over 
£140 million. The strategic nature of 
Costain’s long‑term customer relationships 
has once again ensured that over 90% of 
the order book comprises repeat business. 
Performance against the strategic priorities 
is set out on pages 19 to 23 of the 
Strategic report.
Chairman’s summary statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our remuneration report, on behalf 
of the Board, for the year ended 31 December 2016, together 
with details of our proposed new remuneration policy. 
We have reviewed our 
binding remuneration 
policy this year as it is 
required to be put to 
shareholders at the 2017 
AGM. The Committee 
is proposing limited 
changes which refine the 
current structure and no 
changes to quantum.”

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  59 Remuneration Policy
The following is an overview of how our remuneration policy supports the strategic 
priorities of the business:
Health and Safety remains our 
highest priority.
• AIP includes Health and Safety performance metrics.
Encourage behaviours 
which facilitate the delivery 
of innovative and sustainable 
solutions to increasingly 
complex and large‑scale 
national needs, to ensure 
we remain competitive 
and continue to deliver 
shareholder value. 
• Performance targets are set to reward sustainable business 
performance, whilst not encouraging inappropriate business risks to 
be taken.
• AIP performance metrics aim to balance earnings growth and other key 
financial objectives with non‑ financial indicators.
• One‑ third of any AIP award earned is deferred into shares to ensure that 
executives consider the longer term impacts of their decisions and the 
effect on the sustainability of the business.
• Our LTIP captures long‑ term growth in earnings. An additional two 
years’ deferral on 50% of any LTIP award which vests further supports 
longer term alignment between executives and shareholders.
Develop a best‑ in‑ class team. • Our remuneration policy is designed to attract and retain high‑calibre 
individuals in an increasingly competitive market and to remunerate 
executives fairly and responsibly.
Our proposed new policy is set out in 
full on pages 62 to 68. Our proposed 
amendments to our existing policy seek 
to support our strategy further and these 
changes are summarised below:
At least 50% of the Annual 
Incentive Plan (“AIP”) to be 
based on financial measures
Under the current Policy 75% of AIP 
must be based on financial metrics. 
This change allows greater flexibility to 
ensure that the AIP measures are aligned 
with the key financial and strategic areas 
of business (such as EBITDA, Strategic 
Development, Cash and Health and 
Safety). The Committee’s intention is 
that the majority of the AIP will continue 
to be based on financial metrics and 
the 2017 AIP metrics will be weighted 
75% as regards financial metrics and 
25% as regards non‑ financial metrics. 
For these purposes Health and Safety 
and Strategic Development metrics are 
non‑financial metrics. Details of financial 
and non‑financial AIP metrics, including 
their weighting, are disclosed in the 
forward looking section of the 2016 
Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The Committee will continue to provide 
detailed disclosure of AIP performance 
targets and the performance achieved 
on a retrospective basis.
Introduce flexibility for a greater 
proportion of variable pay to be 
based on long term performance 
without increasing the overall 
maximum variable pay opportunity
This is currently delivered as a maximum 
AIP award of 150% of salary and a 
maximum LTIP award of 100% of salary. 
The updated policy allows flexibility to 
alter this balance so a greater proportion 
is based on long term performance which 
further aligns the long‑ term interests of 
executives with shareholders. The overall 
maximum of 250% is maintained and 
neither the LTIP nor the AIP can exceed 
150% of salary. Subject to those limitations, 
the Committee may decide how the overall 
250% opportunity for any year is split 
between AIP and LTIP. This is intended 
to ensure there is flexibility over the next 
three years to support succession planning 
and potential changes to business needs. 
The policy will also allow up to 25% of the 
LTIP to vest at threshold if the Committee 
considers this appropriate. The ability 
to increase the threshold vesting under 
the LTIP from 15% to 25% maintains the 
expected value of the package if the 
AIP opportunity is reduced and the LTIP 
opportunity is increased. A threshold LTIP 
opportunity of up to 25% of maximum 
is also positioned in line with the market. 
There is no current intention to change the 
level of threshold vesting and we would 
only change this as part of wider changes 
to the structure taking into account the 
balance of short and long term pay, the 
level of stretch within targets and the 
overall package value.
No changes are proposed to the AIP 
or LTIP quantum or the level of threshold 
vesting for 2017.
Shareholding guideline increased 
to 200% of salary for any Executive 
Director who is awarded an LTIP 
opportunity above 100% of salary
No change to 100% of salary shareholding 
guideline for any Executive Director awarded 
an LTIP opportunity of up to 100% of salary.

Reward for 2017
We approved salary increases for 
the Executive Directors of 2.5% with 
effect from 1 April 2017 after carefully 
considering their performance and the 
range of salary increases awarded to 
other employees. 
No changes are proposed to the quantum 
or structure of the AIP for 2017, details of 
the performance measures are provided on 
page 73 and the targets with performance 
against them will be provided in the 2017 
Remuneration Report.
For the 2017 LTIP award we are proposing 
to introduce a cash measure in addition 
to the current EPS metric, recognising that 
a single measure of performance does 
not reflect how we manage and measure 
our business internally and the long term 
behaviours we are seeking to encourage 
across our senior team who participate 
in the LTIP. The sustainable generation 
of cash backed profits is a key element 
of the future success of the Company 
and in enhancing value to shareholders. 
Consequently, the Committee is intending 
to grant awards with a Cash Conversion 
metric which accounts for 25% of the 
2017 LTIP award. 75% of the 2017 LTIP will 
continue to be based on EPS. Full details 
of the 2017 LTIP performance measures 
and weightings are provided on pages 73 
to 74. 
Following a review of fees in February 
2016, no further fee increase has been 
awarded to the Non‑ Executives for 2017. 
Fees for our new Chairman, Dr Paul 
Golby, who joined the Board in May 2016, 
were set at a level which reflected Paul’s 
experience and breadth of skills and will 
remain unchanged in 2017.
Conclusion
Overall, given the Company’s performance 
over the one and three‑ year periods to the 
end of the 2016 financial year, we believe 
that the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors in respect of 2016 continues 
to reflects our success in the delivery 
of our ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy 
and the drive for profitable or sustainable 
long‑ term growth for our shareholders. 
The following pages describe in further 
detail how we have implemented our 
remuneration policy in respect of 2016, 
together with our approach for 2017. 
We remain committed to a responsible 
approach to executive pay as I trust that 
this Remuneration Report demonstrates 
and hope that you are supportive of the 
proposed changes to the remuneration 
policy outlined above and that we can 
rely on your continued support at our 
AGM in May 2017.

Remuneration disclosure
This report, approved by the Board, has been 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium‑ sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). It also meets 
the requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing 
Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
It is unaudited unless otherwise stated. In this report 
we describe how the principles of good governance 
relating to Directors’ remuneration, as set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’), are 
applied in practice. The Remuneration Committee 
(‘the Committee’) confirms that throughout the 
financial year the Company has complied with 
these governance rules and best practice provisions.
The report is in two sections:
• Remuneration Policy. This section sets out the full 
remuneration policy for which approval is sought 
at the 2017 AGM under a binding vote.
• The Annual Report on Remuneration. This section 
sets out details of how our remuneration policy was 
implemented for the year ended 31 December 2016 
and how we intend for the policy to apply for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 and is the subject 
of an advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM.
STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION
 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  61 Policy report
This report sets out the Company’s policy on the remuneration of its Directors and will be put to a binding shareholder 
vote at the Annual General Meeting in 2017. Subject to shareholder approval the policy will take formal effect from the 
end of that meeting.
The remuneration policy was first approved at the Company’s 2014 AGM with support from over 97% of our shareholders. 
As set out in the Chairman’s summary statement of the Director’s remuneration report on pages 59 to 61, we are not 
proposing a radical overhaul of our remuneration policy. The changes proposed refine the policy approved at the 2014 
AGM and are intended to ensure that we have sufficient flexibility to support potential changes to business needs over 
the next three years. In summary the changes made are as follows:
• At least 50% of the Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) to be based on financial measures. This change is intended to provide 
flexibility to ensure that the AIP measures are aligned with the key financial and strategic areas of business. For these 
purposes Health and Safety and Strategic Development measures are treated as non‑ financial measures.
• Introduce flexibility for a greater proportion of variable pay to be based on long term performance without increasing 
the overall maximum variable pay opportunity. Neither the AIP opportunity nor the LTIP opportunity for a year will 
exceed 150% of salary and the combined maximum opportunity of 250% of salary is maintained. 
• To maintain the expected value of the package if the AIP opportunity is reduced and the LTIP opportunity is 
increased and to reflect market practice, the 2017 policy permits vesting of up to 25% of an LTIP award for threshold 
performance. We would only change the vesting threshold as part of wider changes to the structure taking into account 
the balance of short and long term pay, the level of stretch within targets and the overall package value. 
• Shareholding guideline increased to 200% of salary for any Executive Director who is awarded an LTIP opportunity 
above 100% of salary. 
• Other minor changes have been made to the policy to refine it and aid its administration. For example:
 – In line with the LTIP rules approved by shareholders, the updated policy explicitly references the ability to select long 
term performance measures that are aligned with the key financial and strategic areas of business.
 – In line with the rules of the Share Deferral Plan (under which the deferred element of the AIP award is granted) and 
the LTIP rules approved by shareholders, dividend equivalents may be earned in the period from grant to vesting 
on shares which vest.
Further details regarding the changes to the policy and rationale are set out in the Chairman’s summary statement of 
the Directors’ remuneration report on page 59 to 61. No changes are proposed to the AIP and LTIP quantum or the 
proportion of the AIP based on financial measures or the level of threshold vesting under the LTIP for 2017. 
The Committee also determines the remuneration policy for the Company Secretary and such other members of the 
executive management team as it is designated by the Board, with the aim of promoting the long‑ term success of the 
Company. The framework has been designed as an integral part of the Company’s overall business strategy. For the 
avoidance of doubt, although the policy for employees below the Board follows similar principles and structure to that 
for the Executive Directors, the remuneration policy set out below governs the policy for the Board only.

either given or received, on the date of vesting). 
Deferred share awards may be granted as 
conditional awards or nil or nominal cost options.
• The Committee may decide not to operate 
deferral where the amount of the bonus 
otherwise to be deferred would, in the opinion 
of the Committee be so small as to make 
deferral unduly administratively burdensome. 
Executives may, with the approval of the

the reinvestment of dividends. 
• Shares provided under the AIP are typically 
purchased by a trust on behalf of the 
Group so as to not lead to any dilution of 
shareholder interest.
• Awards may be subject to malus and clawback  
as described below. 
• The Committee considers 
and approves the 
performance measures 
and targets at the start

internal budgets and, 
where applicable 
investors’ expectations.

to financial measures 
are based on a sliding 
scale between 0% and

Notes
Performance measures
The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the AIP reflects the Committee’s aim that our annual incentives should balance the delivery of 
stretching financial performance with non‑ financial indicators, particularly Health and Safety targets, and specific individual objectives. The LTIP financial 
metrics capture long‑ term earnings performance, and if appropriate, may be extended to include return based and cash measures which we believe 
are closely aligned with the financial performance expected by our shareholders. LTIP measures may also include strategic measures to incentivise the 
behaviours needed to deliver the Company’s overall strategy. 
AIP and LTIP performance measures may be adjusted if an event occurs which causes the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend 
the performance measures (e.g. a material acquisition or divestment) so that they achieve their original purpose. 
Recovery provisions
The AIP (including the deferred awards delivered under the SDP) and LTIP awards are subject to “malus” and “clawback” provisions as follows. 
For up to two years following the payment of the cash element of an AIP award, the Committee may require repayment of all or part of the bonus in the 
event of a material misstatement or error in assessing performance measures which has led to an overpayment of the bonus or in the event of dismissal 
due to gross misconduct in the bonus year or in the event of criminal behaviour. Some or all of a deferred share award under the SDP may be clawed back 
(via a cancellation of the award) prior to vesting in equivalent circumstances. 
For up to two years following the vesting of an LTIP award (or part of an LTIP award) the Committee may require the repayment of all or part of the award 
(which may be effected by the cancellation of unvested LTIP awards) in the event of a material misstatement or error in assessing performance measures 
which has led to an the award vesting to a greater degree than would otherwise have been the case or in the event of dismissal due to gross misconduct.

GOVERNANCE
64 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Incentive plan operation
The Committee will operate the AIP, SDP and LTIP according to their respective rules. 
Share awards under the SDP and LTIP (and any applicable performance conditions) may be adjusted in the event of a 
variation of the Company’s share capital or a demerger, special dividend or other event which affects the market price 
of a share. Shares awards under the SDP and LTIP may be satisfied in cash and may vest early, in accordance with the plan 
rules, in the event of a change of control or other relevant event (such as a winding‑ up or demerger). Where an LTIP award 
vests early, the extent of vesting will be determined taking into account the extent to which the performance condition 
has been satisfied (as assessed by the Committee) and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the proportion 
of the vesting period that has elapsed. A copy of the plan rules is available on request from the Company Secretary.

Tony Bickerstaff – Finance Director 
LTIP Annual Bonus Base salary, beneﬁts and pension
The chart above illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors vary under three performance 
scenarios: Minimum, On‑ Target and Maximum.
Assumptions:
• Maximum AIP award of 150% of salary and maximum LTIP award of 100% of salary.
• Minimum performance – fixed pay only, including salary effective 1 April 2017, 22% pension allowances and benefits 
as paid in 2016.
• On‑ Target performance – fixed pay, plus 60% of the maximum payout under the AIP (including any deferred share 
award under the SDP), and 50% LTIP vesting.
• Maximum performance – fixed pay, plus 100% of the maximum payout under the AIP (including any deferred share 
award under the SDP), and 100% LTIP vesting.
Service agreements and loss of office
The Executive Directors have service contracts that can be terminated by either party on the giving of 12 months’ notice. 
There is no entitlement to the payment of a predetermined amount on termination of employment in any circumstances. 
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation on termination within the Executive Directors’ service 
agreements. The Executive Directors’ service agreements do contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice, but these 
are at the Company’s sole discretion.
The Company seeks to avoid any payment for failure. The circumstances of the termination (taking into account the 
individual’s performance) and an individual’s duty and opportunity to mitigate losses are taken into account in every case. 
Our policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Executive Directors to the extent that they receive 
remuneration from other employment during the compensation period and that any such payments would be paid 
monthly in arrears.
It is the Committee’s intention that any future service contracts will be made in accordance with the policy stated above.

Base salary plus benefits paid monthly

provided in connection with termination 
may include for example, pension, 
outplacement fees, payments in respect 
of accrued holiday and legal fees.
No other specific 
entitlements are 
contained within 
our contracts.
No additional 
provisions other than 
those contained in 
the “Termination 
payment” column.
The treatment of any incentive payment on termination will be determined in accordance with the rules of the AIP, SDP 
or LTIP. The principal provisions of the rules are summarised below. 
AIP Ordinarily, there will be no entitlement to a bonus unless the participant is employed and not under notice at the bonus 
payment date.
In the event of termination due to death, redundancy, injury, ill‑ health, disability or retirement (a “good leaver”) a time pro‑ rated 
bonus may be earned. The Committee has discretion to pay the bonus following the end of the year (subject to assessment of  
the performance measures) or at termination (with reference to on‑ target measures). 
A good leaver will ordinarily only be entitled to a bonus calculated by reference to the proportion of his AIP award which would 
have been paid in cash, and not to an SDP award. However, the Committee retains discretion to pay the whole of the AIP award 
for the year of termination (and prior year) in cash (after assessment of performance and application of time pro‑ rating). 
SDP In the event of termination due to injury, disability, or any other reason at the Committee’s discretion, unvested SDP awards shall 
continue and vest on the normal vesting date. If a participant dies, his unvested SDP awards will vest at that time. 
Unvested SDP awards shall lapse on termination for any other reason. 
LTIP Unvested LTIP awards will usually lapse on termination. 
However, in the event of termination due to injury, disability, or any other reason at the Committee’s discretion, unvested LTIP 
awards shall continue and vest on the normal vesting date. The extent of vesting will be determined by reference to the extent 
to which the performance conditions are satisfied and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting 
period that has elapsed at the date of cessation. 
If a participant dies, his unvested LTIP awards will vest at the date of cessation, with the extent of vesting determined by reference 
to the extent to which the performance conditions are satisfied at that date (as assessed by the Committee) and, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed at the date of cessation. 
Where a new director is granted a “buy out” award as described below, the leaver provisions would be determined 
at the time of grant. 
Recruitment remuneration
In the cases of hiring/appointing a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will typically align the 
remuneration package with the approved Remuneration Policy. However, the Committee retains the discretion to make 
payments or awards which are outside the Policy to facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required 
to implement the Group’s strategy, subject to the principles and limits set out below. The individual will move over time 
onto a remuneration package that is consistent with the approved Policy.
The Remuneration Committee will not use its discretion to make payments or awards outside the Policy to offer 
a non‑performance related incentive payment (for example a “guaranteed sign ‑ on bonus”). 
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including the quantum and nature of remuneration) to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Costain 
and its shareholders. This may, for example, include (but is not limited to) the following circumstances:
• an interim appointment is made to fill an Executive Director role on a short‑ term basis;
• exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non‑ Executive Director takes on an executive function 
on a short‑ term basis;
• an Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long‑term 
incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance; subject to the limit on 
variable remuneration set out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be 
transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis;
• the Executive Director received benefits at his previous employer that the Committee considers it appropriate 
to recognise. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED
GOVERNANCE
66 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 The Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the annual bonus 
or long‑ term incentive, subject to the rules of the scheme, if the Committee determines that the circumstances of the 
recruitment merit such alteration. The rationale will be clearly explained.
The Remuneration Committee may make an award in respect of hiring to ‘buy‑ out’ remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Remuneration Committee will take account of relevant factors 
regarding the forfeited arrangements, which may include any performance conditions attached to awards forfeited 
(and the likelihood of meeting those conditions), the time over which they would have vested and the form of the 
awards (e.g. cash or shares). It will generally seek to structure buy‑ out awards on a comparable basis to remuneration 
arrangements forfeited. These payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration 
referred to below. However, the Remuneration Committee’s intention is that the value awarded would be no higher 
than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements. Where considered appropriate, buy‑ out awards will be subject 
to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation, travel and subsistence costs. The Remuneration 
Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary. 
The maximum level of variable remuneration (excluding buy‑ out awards) which may be awarded to a new Executive 
Director is 350% of base salary. Subject to this overall maximum, variable remuneration, incentive awards may be granted 
within the first 12 months of appointment above the normal maximum annual award opportunities. The Remuneration 
Committee will ensure that such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance 
measures and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Company’s existing share 
plans. If necessary, and subject to the limits referred to above, in order to facilitate the awards mentioned above, the 
Committee may adopt a new arrangement in accordance with the provisions of the Listing Rules which allow for the grant 
of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall 
be allowed to continue according to the original terms. 
Fees payable to a newly‑ appointed Chairman or Non‑ Executive Director will be in line with the fee policy in place 
at the time of appointment. 
External directorships
The Company encourages Executive Directors to take up Non‑ Executive appointments, with the prior consent of 
the Company, in the belief that such appointments broaden their skills and the contribution which they can make to 
the Company’s performance. Generally, no more than one such appointment may be undertaken. There must be no 
conflict of interest and the time devoted to the external appointment must be reasonable in relation to the individual’s 
commitment to the Company. Fees paid for external appointments may be retained by the individual concerned.
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors
The Non‑ Executive Directors have letters of appointment. The appointment of an independent Non‑ Executive 
Director can be terminated by not less than one month’s notice on either side without compensation for loss of office. 
Each Non‑Executive Director is subject to election at the first AGM following their appointment, subsequent re ‑ election 
at intervals of no more than three years and re‑ election at each AGM if they have served on the Board for more than 
nine years.
The dates of each Non‑ Executive Director’s original appointment are as follows:

Director is required to be re‑ elected

Maximum opportunity
Fees • Attract and retain high 
performing individuals.
• Remuneration for Non‑ Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, 
is determined by the Board, following consultation between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive. The Chairman’s fee is determined 
by the Board following consultation between the Committee and the 
Chief Executive. Fees are reviewed annually and any increase is usually 
effective from 1 April.
• Remuneration for Non‑ Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, 
comprises a basic annual fee for acting as Non‑ Executive Director of 
the Company and additional fees for the Senior Independent Director, 
and chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
• Overall fees will remain within the limit set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association.
• The Chairman and Non‑ Executive Directors do not participate in any 
variable pay or share scheme arrangement, although their fees may 
be paid in cash or shares.
• May be entitled to benefits such as travel and subsistence and 
secretarial support, or other benefits as appropriate.
N/A
Share

Guidelines
• Alignment of interests between 
Costain Board and shareholders.
• Non‑ Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain 
a shareholding worth not less than 100% of their annual fee.
N/A
Legacy arrangements
The Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payment or payment for loss of office outside the policy 
in this report where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect provided, in the case of 
a payment whose terms were agreed after the 7 May 2014 (the date of approval of the Company’s former Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy) and before this policy came into effect, the payment was permitted under that former policy. 
For these purposes, ‘payment’ includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award 
over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted. 
Consideration of employee views
There is no employee representation on the Committee. However, the Company liaises actively with employees through 
the Costain Ground Force employee committee and engagement surveys. The Group HR Director briefs the Board on 
employees’ views, ensuring that the Committee’s decisions are taken with appropriate insight to employees’ views. 
Consideration of shareholder views
• The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting following the 
AGM. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered 
as part of the Company’s annual review of remuneration policy.
• When there are material issues relating to executive remuneration or proposed changes in policy, we engage actively 
with major shareholders to ensure we understand the range of their views. When significant changes are made within 
the policy, the Committee Chairman will inform shareholders of these.
• Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report and any matters 
discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Advice provided to the Committee
Advice was sought where appropriate from a number of sources. During the course of the year, the Chief Executive, the 
Finance Director, the Group’s Chairman, the Group HR Director, and the Legal Director and Company Secretary were invited 
to attend various meetings of the Committee, although none was present when their own remuneration was being discussed.
To assist the Committee in ensuring that the Company’s remuneration practices take due account of market and best 
practice, the Committee has access to experienced specialist independent consultants. During the year, the Committee 
took advice, as appropriate, from Deloitte LLP (a member firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited).
It is the policy of the Committee to put the remuneration consultant function out to tender on a periodic basis to ensure 
that the Company continues to receive independent support and advice of a high standard. Following a tender process 
in 2014 by the Committee, Deloitte LLP was appointed in place of New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt 
Limited) to act as the Company’s remuneration consultants. Deloitte LLP received fees of £37,440 for the year ended 
31 December 2016. 
Deloitte LLP is a founder signatory to the Remuneration Consulting Group’s Code of Conduct and is considered by the 
Committee to be independent. During the year, Deloitte LLP also provided advice to the Company in relation to the 
operation of the Company’s share plans. 
Voting on the remuneration report at the AGM in 2016
Last year’s remuneration report was approved by shareholders with a 99.68% (2015 AGM: 99.26%) vote in favour 
(including discretionary votes).

votes) at the Company’s 2014 AGM.

Additional Notes to the single total figure of remuneration
(a) Taxable benefits provided to Executive Directors
The main benefits available to the Executive Directors during 2016 (and their approximate values) were a car allowance 
of £12,000 (2015: £12,000) for Andrew Wyllie and £10,500 (2015: £10,500) for Anthony Bickerstaff, together with private 
medical insurance for both Executive Directors of £1,322 (2015: £1,346). This package of benefits was unchanged 
from 2015.
(b) Determination of the 2016 Annual Incentive 
The maximum AIP opportunity for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director for the year ended 31 December 2016 
remained unchanged from 2015 at 150% of base salary, with one third of the earned AIP award to be deferred into 
shares for a further two years and two thirds of the earned AIP award paid in cash. Grants will be made under the SDP in 
April 2017.
The performance measures established by the Committee for the 2016 AIP continued to align reward with the Company’s 
‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy whilst not encouraging inappropriate business risks to be taken. These included inter 
alia a maximum target of £44.6 million for Group EBITA
1
. 
The achievement of the performance measures has been reviewed, with appropriate input from the Audit Committee, 
following the end of the 2016 financial year. The maximum 2016 AIP opportunity against each of the performance 
measures is shown below, together with the AIP award actually achieved.

(c) Vesting of the 7 May 2014 LTIP award 
The LTIP award granted on 7 May 2014 was based on performance to the year ended 31 December 2016.
This award has the following performance condition:
Aggregate EPS for the financial years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016 Vesting level
Below 83.90 pence 0%
83.90 pence 15%
Between 83.90 pence and 92.9 pence 15% – 100% pro rata
92.9 pence or more 100%
For the purposes of the LTIP, EPS is adjusted by the Committee to take account of relevant events (such as acquisitions or 
disposals) and to ensure that the performance measures are assessed on a consistent basis year‑ to‑ year. Aggregate EPS 
for the financial years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016, calculated on an adjusted basis approved by the 
Committee, was 81.89 pence. As a result of which the LTIP award granted on 7 May 2014 will not vest. 
(d) Pensions and life assurance
Under their terms of engagement, the Executive Directors are entitled to an annual pension allowance of 22% of base 
salary. Life assurance cover of four times base salary is provided through the Costain Life Assurance Scheme. The annual 
premiums payable in respect of life assurance for Andrew Wyllie and Anthony Bickerstaff were £2,236 (2015: £2,161) and 
£1,482 (2015: £1,432) respectively.
The Group offers a Group Flexible Retirement Plan which was set up in 2009 with Standard Life for employees and senior 
management. Neither Executive Director participated in the scheme.
(e) Chairman
Remuneration for the Chairman comprises a basic annual fee of £160,000 with effect from the date of the Chairman’s 
appointment, being 5 May 2016 (as at 5 May 2015 the former Chairman’s fee was £136,056 per annum). 
(f) Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration for Non‑ Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, comprises a basic annual fee for acting as a 
Non‑Executive Director of the Company and additional fees for the Senior Independent Director and chairmanship

72 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 2017 Annual Incentive 
Executive Directors and other senior management are eligible for annual bonuses under the AIP to encourage improved 
performance, with targets established by the Committee to align rewards with the Company strategy. The targets 
are clearly aligned with the delivery of our ‘Engineering Tomorrow’ strategy. Their achievement will be reviewed, with 
appropriate input from the Audit Committee, at the end of the year.
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director for the year ended 31 December 2017 
will remain unchanged from 2016 at 150% of base salary, with one third of earned bonus deferred into shares for a further 
two years, to be awarded under the SDP, and two thirds of earned AIP paid in cash.
The performance measures for the 2017 AIP are as follows:
Performance Measures
2017 AIP Opportunity –  
Maximum Percentage of Bonus
Andrew  
Wyllie
Anthony  
Bickerstaff
Group EBITA 55% 55%
Group Health and Safety 10% 10%
Order Book percentage of target gross profit 10% 10%
Cash flow (average month end cash balances) 10% 10%
Personal Performance 15% 15%
Total 100% 100%
The Committee has chosen not to disclose in advance the performance targets for the year ended 31 December 
2017, as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. The Committee will continue to 
provide retrospective disclosure of performance targets in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration to the extent the 
Committee determines these measures are not commercially sensitive.
2017 LTIP Grant
The grant level for the Executive Directors remains at 100% of salary. Subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions as set out below, half of the award will vest after three years and the other half will vest after five years (the 
final two years being subject only to continued service), thereby ensuring long‑ term alignment of the Executive Directors’ 
and shareholders’ interests. It is anticipated that the 2017 LTIP awards will take place in April 2017.
For the 2017 LTIP award the Committee are also proposing to introduce a cash measure in addition to the current EPS 
metric, recognising that a single measure of performance does not reflect how we manage and measure our business 
internally and the long‑ term behaviours we are seeking to encourage. Consequently the Committee is intending to grant 
awards with a Cash Conversion metric which accounts for 25% of the 2017 LTIP award; 75% of the 2017 LTIP will continue 
to be based on EPS.
It is proposed that the targets for the 2017 LTIP awards will be as follows:
EPS performance condition
Sum of the EPS for the financial years ending 31 December 2017, 2018 and 2019 Vesting level for awards
Below 101.4 pence 0%
101.4 pence 15%
113.6 pence or more 100%
Between 101.4 pence and 113.6 pence Between 15% and 100% pro rata on a straight‑ line basis
The Committee believes that EPS remains an appropriate metric to use under the LTIP, as growth in EPS is one of the 
key drivers of the Company’s share price. As with previous LTIP awards, EPS shall be calculated on an adjusted basis as 
determined by the Committee to take account of relevant events (such as acquisitions or disposals) and ensure that the 
performance measures are assessed on a consistent basis year‑ to‑ year.

Below 80% 0%
80% 15%
100% 100%
Between 80% and 100% Between 15% and 100% pro rata on a straight‑ line basis
Cash conversion is adjusted cash flow from operations (excluding cash movements in provisions and pension deficit) 
divided by EBITDA. It is measured as average cash flow conversion over the three year period ended 31 December 2019.
Adjusted cash flow from operations for the year ending 31 December 2017 will be adjusted to recognise exceptional cash 
in flows at the end of 2016.
The Committee has the discretionary power to vary these targets should circumstances change so that the original 
targets are no longer considered appropriate for example in the case of a material acquisition or divestment in 
the Group.
A clawback and malus provision is incorporated in the AIP and the LTIP (and the legacy DSBP) with regard to any material 
misstatement to audited accounts, an error in calculation of targets resulting in an overpayment, gross misconduct 
or criminal behaviour on the part of a participant.

Performance graph
The graph below shows the value, to 31 December 2016, of £100 invested in Costain Group PLC on 1 January 2009 
compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE SmallCap Index. The Committee believes that the SmallCap Index 
is a more appropriate index to use than the FTSE All‑ Share Index as it is the index in which the Company is a constituent 
and comprises companies of a more similar size to Costain.

The Governance reports on pages 38 to 78 and the 
Strategic report on pages 01 to 37 (and in particular pages 
20 and 23 with regard to information about employee 
involvement and greenhouse gas emissions) are also 
incorporated into this report by reference.
The Company has chosen to include the disclosure of

Incorporation and constitution 
Costain Group PLC is domiciled in England and 
incorporated in England and Wales under Company 
Number 1393773.
Profit and dividend payments
The profit after tax for the financial year ending 
31 December 2016 amounted to £26.4 million 
(2015: £22.2 million). An interim dividend of 4.3 pence 
per share (2015: 3.75 pence) amounting to £4.4 million 
(2015: £3.9 million) was paid on 21 October 2016. A final 
dividend at the rate of 8.4 pence per share (2015: 7.25 
pence) amounting to £8.8 million (2015: £7.4 million) will also 
be recommended to shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) to be held on 8 May 2017. If approved, 
the dividend will be paid on 19 May 2017 to shareholders 
registered at close of business on 7 April 2017.
Dividends and other distributions 
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, from time 
to time declare dividends not exceeding the amount 
recommended by the Board. Subject to the Companies 
Act 2006, the Board may pay interim dividends, and also 
any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial position 
of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies its 
payment. If the Directors act in good faith, they are not 
liable for any loss that shareholders may suffer because a 
lawful dividend has been paid on other shares which rank 
equally with or behind their shares.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of 
any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the 
Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25% interest in 
a class of the Company’s shares if such a person has been 
served with a restriction notice after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Companies 
Act 2006.
Share capital
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares 
with a nominal value of 50 pence each.
The issued share capital of the Company as at 
31 December 2016 was £52,117,095.50, consisting 
of 104,234,191 ordinary shares of 50 pence each. 
Further details of the share capital of the Company can 
be found in Note 21 on page 128.

in May 2016 over 598,131 ordinary shares of 50 pence 
each with a nil exercise price. Further details regarding 
the vesting of the 2013 LTIP awards can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration report on page 76.
Share options granted under the Company’s Save As You 
Earn Scheme (SAYE) in November 2011 (at an option price 
of 169.33p) and in November 2013 (at an option price of 
206.55p) matured as at 1 November 2016, resulting in the 
exercise of options as at 31 December 2016 over 1,257,563 
ordinary shares of 50 pence each. Further details of the 
SAYE Scheme can be found on page 77 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration report.
At the 2016 AGM, shareholders approved the renewal of 
the scrip dividend scheme which authorises the Directors 
to offer and allot ordinary shares in lieu of cash dividends 
to those shareholders who elect to participate in the 
scrip dividend. This authority was granted for a period 
of three years (until the conclusion of the 2019 Annual 
General Meeting), which is in line with the guidelines of 
the Investment Association (IA) which requires shareholder 
approval to be sought to renew the Directors’ authority 
to offer a scrip dividend scheme at least once every 
three years. 
In May 2016, 114,972 ordinary shares of 50 pence 
each were allotted to shareholders in respect of the 
final dividend for 2015 and, in October 2016, 163,108 
ordinary shares of 50 pence each were allotted to 
shareholders in respect of the interim dividend for 2016. 
Further information on the scrip dividend scheme is set 
out on page 138. Details about joining the scrip dividend 
scheme can also be found on the Company’s website 
at costain.com.
Restrictions on transfer of securities
There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in 
the Company, except:
• that certain restrictions may from time to time be 
imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws); and
• pursuant to the Company’s Share Dealing Code, 
whereby the Directors and certain employees of the 
Company require the approval of the Company to deal 
in the Company’s ordinary shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities.

Major shareholders
As at 31 December 2016 the Company has been notified, 
under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (DTR5), of the 
following voting interests in its ordinary share capital:
Shareholder
Number of

BlackRock Inc 5,829,557 5.59
Henderson Group plc 6,250,500 6.00
JO Hambro Capital  
Management Group Limited 5,085,708 4.88
Miton Group plc 5,101,741 4.89
The Company did not receive any further notifications 
pursuant to DTR5 in the period from 31 December 2016 
to the date of this Report (being a date not more than one 
month prior to the date of the Company’s Notice of Annual 
General Meeting).
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
In accordance with the Articles of Association, the 
Company can issue shares with any rights or restrictions 
attached to them provided such rights or restrictions do 
not restrict any rights or restrictions attached to existing 
shares. These rights or restrictions can be decided either 
by ordinary resolutions passed by the shareholders or 
by the Directors as long as there is no conflict with any 
resolution passed by the shareholders. Subject to the 
Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and other 
shareholders’ rights, the issue of shares is at the disposal 
of the Board.
Authority to issue shares
The Directors may only issue shares if authorised to 
do so by the Articles of Association or the shareholders 
in general meeting. At the Company’s AGM held on 
5 May 2016, shareholders granted an authority to the 
Directors to allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £17.0 million. As at 31 December 2016, 
the only shares that had been allotted were in order to 
satisfy awards under the Company’s share schemes and 
scrip dividends. 
As this authority is due to expire on 8 May 2017, 
shareholders will be asked to renew and extend the 
authority, given to the Directors at the last AGM, to allot 
shares in the Company, or grant rights to subscribe for, 
or to convert any security into, shares in the Company 
for the purposes of Section 551 of the Companies Act 
2006. Further details on the resolution are provided 
in the Notice of this year’s AGM.
Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
If the Directors wish to allot new shares and other equity 
securities, or sell treasury shares, for cash (other than in 
connection with an employee share scheme) company 
law requires that these shares are offered first to 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. 
There may be occasions, however, when the Directors 
need the flexibility to finance business opportunities by 
the issue of shares without a pre‑ emptive offer to existing 
shareholders. This cannot be done under the Companies 
Act 2006 unless the shareholders have first waived their 
pre‑emption rights. 
At the AGM, shareholders will be asked to pass two 
special resolutions to grant the Directors powers to 
disapply shareholders’ pre‑ emption rights under certain 
circumstances. Further details on the resolutions are 
provided in the Notice of this year’s AGM.
Power in relation to the Company buying back its 
own shares
The Directors may only buy back shares if authorised to do 
so by the Articles of Association or by a special resolution 
of the shareholders at a general meeting. Any shares 
which have been bought back may be held as treasury 
shares, and either be resold for cash, cancelled (either 
immediately or in the future), or used for the purposes 
of the Company’s share schemes. Any cancelled treasury 
shares will thereby reduce the amount of the Company’s 
issued share capital.
At the AGM authority will be sought from the shareholders 
to grant authority for the Company to repurchase up 
to 10%. of the issued share capital of the Company. 
Further details on the resolution are provided in the 
Notice of this year’s AGM. 
Securities carrying special rights
No person holds securities in the Company carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. 
In accordance with an Undertaking entered into in 
October 1997, UEM Group Berhad had been entitled to 
appoint a Non‑ Executive Director as long as they held 
more than 7% of the aggregate nominal value of the then 
issued share capital of the Company, although they had 
not taken advantage of this option since 4 December 2009. 
In November 2016, UEM’s holding in the Company fell 
below 7% and as at 31 December 2016 they no longer 
held any interest in the Company’s shares.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general 
meeting or class meeting in respect of any share held by 
him/her if any call or other sum then payable by him/her 
in respect of that share remains unpaid or if a member 
has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in 
the Articles of Association) after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Companies 
Act 2006.
GOVERNANCE
80 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 The Company is not aware of any agreement between 
holders of securities that may result in restrictions 
of voting rights.
Employee Share Trust
As at 31 December 2016, ACS HR Solutions Share Plan 
Services (Guernsey) Limited, as Trustee of the Costain 
Group Employee Trust, held 0.32% of the issued share 
capital of the Company on trust for the benefit of those 
employees who exercise their share awards/options 
under the Company’s Long‑ Term Incentive Plan, Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan, Share Deferral Plan and Save As You 
Earn Scheme (in respect of ‘good leavers’ who leave 
the employment of the Company before their contract 
matures). The Trustee does not exercise any right to vote 
or to receive a dividend in respect of this shareholding.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Companies Act 2006 and any directions given to the 
Company by special resolution, the business of the 
Company will be managed by the Board, who may exercise 
all the powers of the Company. In particular, the Board 
may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow 
money, to guarantee, to indemnify, to mortgage or charge 
any of its undertaking, property, assets (present and 
future) and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and 
other securities and to give security for any debt, liability 
or obligation of the Company or of any third party.
Amendment of Articles of Association
Unless expressly specified to the contrary in the Articles 
of Association of the Company, the Company’s Articles 
of Association may be amended by special resolution 
of the Company’s shareholders. A copy of the Articles 
of Association is available on the Company’s website 
at costain.com.
Political donations
No political donations were made during the year ended 
31 December 2016 (2015: nil). The Company has a policy 
of not making donations to political organisations. As a 
precautionary measure, shareholder approval is being 
sought at the forthcoming AGM for the Company and its 
subsidiaries to make donations and/or incur expenditure 
which may be construed as ‘political’ by the wide 
definition of that term included in the relevant legislation. 
Further details on the resolution are provided in the 
Notice of this year’s AGM.
Directors’ interests 
No Director had any material interest in any contract 
of significance with the Group during the period under 
review. Details of Directors’ emoluments and interests in 
shares in the Company, including any changes in interests 
during 2016, are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration 
report, which appears on pages 70 and 78.
Independent auditors
KPMG LLP have notified the Company that they are not 
seeking re‑ appointment as the external Auditor. It is 
proposed that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) are 
appointed as Auditor of the Company and that they will 
hold office from the conclusion of the AGM in May 2017 
until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which 
the accounts are laid before the Company. See page 56 
of the Audit Committee report and the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting, available on the Company’s website at 
costain.com, for further details.
Significant agreements – change of control
The Directors are not aware of any significant agreements 
to which the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries or 
associates are a party that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a 
takeover bid, save in respect of the Facility Agreements 
relating to the Company’s banking and surety bonding 
facilities, which would become terminable upon a 
change of control. There are no agreements between 
the Company and its Directors or employees providing 
for compensation for loss of office or employment as a 
result of a successful takeover bid except that provisions 
of the Company’s share schemes and plans may cause 
options and awards to be granted to employees under 
such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.
Research and development
The Group is involved in research and development in 
all the sectors in which it operates. The Group’s engineers 
and technical staff in these named sectors seek to 
develop and deliver technical advances. In undertaking 
certain elements of this research and development work, 
the Group is supported by arrangements with certain 
British universities and various technology specialists.

The Directors shall be not less than two and not more than 
18 in number. The Company may by ordinary resolution 
vary the minimum and/or maximum number of Directors.
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed by 
the Board holds office only until the next AGM of the 
Company and is then eligible for reappointment. 
At every AGM of the Company, any Director who has been 
appointed by the Board since the last AGM, or who held 
office at the time of the two preceding AGMs and who did 
not retire at either of them, or who has held office with the 
Company, other than employment or executive office, for 
a continuous period of nine years or more at the date of 
the meeting, shall retire from office and may offer himself/
herself for reappointment by the members.
The Board, or any Committee authorised by the Board, 
may from time to time appoint one or more Directors to 
hold any employment or executive office for such period 
and on such terms as they may determine and may also 
revoke or terminate any such appointment. 
The Company may by special resolution remove any 
Director before the expiration of his/her period of office. 
The office of a Director shall also be vacated under a 
number of situations which are set out in the Articles of 
Association of the Company. These include: a Director 
wishing to resign, being required to step down due to ill 
health, becoming bankrupt; or being prohibited by law 
from being a Director.
Employee information
The average number of employees within the Company 
and Group is shown in Note 5 to the financial statements 
on page 107.
Apart from ensuring that an individual has the ability 
to carry out a particular role, the Company does not 
discriminate in any way. The Company endeavours 
to retain employees if they become disabled, making 
reasonable adjustments to their role and, if necessary, 
looking for redeployment opportunities within the 
Group. The Company also ensures that training, career 
development and promotion opportunities are available 
to all employees irrespective of gender, race, age 
or disability.
The Company maintains a strong communication 
network and employees are encouraged to discuss with 
management matters of interest and issues affecting 
the day‑ to‑ day operations of the Group. Employees are 
kept informed of the financial and economic factors 
affecting the Company’s performance, and other matters 
of concern to them as employees, through various means 
including regular updates from the Chief Executive 
and other senior managers and a Costain online news 
service. Employees also have the opportunity to provide 
feedback and ask questions at the annual staff road shows 
which take place around the country. Further details 
of the actions taken to introduce, maintain or develop 
arrangements aimed at employees are described in the 
Strategic review on page 20.
Essential contracts or other arrangements
Given the scope and diversity of the Company’s activities, 
the Company does not consider that it has contractual 
or other arrangements which are essential to the business 
of the Group and which are required to be disclosed.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information (as defined in Section 
418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s 
external Auditor is unaware and that each Director has 
taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a 
Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
external Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of 
the Companies Act 2006.

82 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration report and accounts 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts 
for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group and Company accounts 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU).
Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that these 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and the Company 
accounts, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the accounts and the Director’s Remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the 
Group accounts, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, 
Directors’ Remuneration report and Corporate 
Governance statement that comply with that law and 
those regulations.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
The Directors consider the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s and the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors of the Company confirms that, 
to the best of his or her knowledge:
• the Group accounts, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profits/losses of the Company (and of the Group 
taken as a whole); and
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company (and of the Group taken as a 
whole), together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  83 Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1  Our opinion on the financial statements 
is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Costain Group 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expense, 
the Consolidated and Company Statement of Financial 
Position, the Consolidated and Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company 
Cash Flow Statement and related notes. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements the risks of material misstatement, in 
decreasing order of audit significance, that had the 
greatest effect on our audit were as follows (2015: Contract 
accounting estimates and Accounting for acquisitions): 
Contract accounting estimates (risk vs 2015):
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report) and pages 
101 – 102 (accounting policies).
• The Risk: The Group recognises revenue and profit 
in accordance with IAS 11 based on the proportion 
of contract costs incurred for the work performed 
to the balance sheet date, relative to the estimated 
total forecast costs of the contract at completion. 
The recognition of revenue and profit therefore relies 
on estimates in relation to the forecast total costs on 
each contract. Cost contingencies may also be included 
in these estimates to take account of specific uncertain 
risks, or disputed claims against the Group, arising within 
each contract. These contingencies are reviewed by 
the Group on a regular basis throughout the contract 
life and adjusted where appropriate. The revenue 
on contracts may also include compensation events, 
variations and claims. Compensation events, variations 
and claims are recognised on a contract-by-contract 
basis. This occurs when the Group’s negotiations with 
the customer indicate that for compensation events 
and variations it is probable that they will be agreed 
and for claims that they have reached an advanced 
stage such that it is probable that the customer will 
accept the claim and in all cases when the amount can 
be measured reliably. In certain circumstances recoveries 
from insurers are also included in forecasts where legal 
entitlement has been established and receipt is deemed 
to be probable. Therefore there is a high degree of risk 
and associated management judgement in estimating 
the amount of revenue and associated profit to be 
recognised by the Group up to the balance sheet 
date and changes to these estimates could give rise 
to material variances.
• Our Response: Using a variety of quantitative and 
qualitative criteria we selected a sample of contracts 
to assess and challenge the most significant and 
complex contract estimates. We obtained the detailed 
project management review papers from the Group 
to support the estimates made and challenged the 
judgements underlying those papers with senior 
operational, commercial and financial management. 
Procedures varied across projects depending on the 
risks identified, they included:
 – evaluating the financial performance of contracts 
against budget and historical trends;
 – completing site visits to certain higher risk or 
larger value contracts and identifying areas of 
complexity through observation and discussion 
with site personnel;
 – challenging the Group’s judgement in respect 
of forecast contract out-turn, contingencies, 
settlements and the recoverability of contract 
balances via agreement to third party certifications 
and confirmations and with reference to our own 
assessments, historical outcomes and industry norms;
 – analysing correspondence with customers around 
compensation events, variations and claims and 
considering whether this information is consistent 
with the estimates made by the Group;
 – analysing correspondence with insurers around 
recognised insurance claims, challenging management 
on the issues raised and considering whether 
this information supports the recoverability of 
recognised amounts;
 – inspecting selected contracts for key clauses; 
identifying relevant contractual mechanisms such as 
pain/gain shares, design bonuses, liquidated damages 
and success fees and assessing whether these key 
clauses have been appropriately reflected in the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements;
 – taking into account the risks and opportunities 
on each contract, assessing whether the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements resulting from 
the estimates and assumptions made are appropriate 
and in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement requirements of IAS 11: Construction 
Contracts; and
 – considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in respect of contract accounting and the key risks 
relating to these amounts.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF COSTAIN GROUP PLC ONLY 
GOVERNANCE
84 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Carrying value of Natural Resources goodwill £38,600,000 
(2015: £38,300,000) (risk vs 2015) (New risk)
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report) and pages 
101 – 102 (accounting policies).
• The Risk: The Group has previously recognised goodwill 
of £38.3 million allocated to the Natural Resources cash 
generating unit (CGU). In accordance with IAS 36, the 
Group is required to assess goodwill for impairment on 
an annual basis. There is inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, which 
are the basis of the assessment of recoverability. 
Our assessment of the risk to this balance has increased 
in the year due to the trading performance of the 
division and, accordingly, this year we highlight this 
as a significant risk in our audit report.
• Our Response: Our audit procedures over the carrying 
value of the goodwill for the Natural Resources CGU 
included the following procedures:
 – testing the mathematical accuracy of the Group’s 
discounted cash flow model by recalculating each 
year’s net present value and the terminal value using 
management’s inputs;
 – comparing the cash flows used in the impairment 
model to the output of the Group’s budgeting process 
and against the understanding we obtained about the 
business areas through our audit;
 – assessing the historical accuracy of the forecasts used 
in the Group’s impairment model by considering 
actual performance against prior year budgets;
 – using external data, such as forecast growth rates, 
and our own internal valuation specialists to evaluate 
the key inputs and assumptions for growth and 
discount rates;
 – performing sensitivity and break-even analysis for 
the key inputs and assumptions; and
 – evaluating the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
related to the judgements and assumptions over 
recoverability of goodwill in note 11.
Risks determined to no longer be significant
In 2015 we identified accounting for the acquisition 
of the Rhead Group Limited as a significant audit risk. 
We continue to perform procedures over accounting for 
acquisitions. However, the acquisition completed during 
2016 was less significant than the acquisition completed 
in 2015. Accordingly, we have not assessed this as one 
of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and, 
therefore, it is not separately identified in our audit report 
this year.
3  Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
Materiality amount £1.49 million 
(2015: £1.45 million)
basis 4.8% of Group profit before 
taxation (2015: 4.9% of 
Group profit before taxation 
and finance charges)
Range of component 
materialities
£0.73 million to £1.49 million 
(2015: £0.75 million to 
£1.45 million)
Threshold for 
reporting corrected 
or uncorrected 
differences to the 
Audit Committee
£74,500 (2015: £72,500) 
plus any lesser differences 
if warranted on 
qualitative grounds
In 2016 we changed our benchmark for determining 
materiality from Group profit before taxation and 
finance charges to Group profit before taxation as 
Group profit before taxation is considered the industry 
standard benchmark.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed 
by component auditors at the key reporting components 
in Spain, Aberdeen and by the Group audit team at the 
Group’s head offices. These procedures covered 99% 
of total Group revenue (2015: 99%), 96% (2015: 99%) of 
total Group profit before tax and 99% (2015: 99%) of total 
Group assets. The segment disclosures in Note 3 set out 
the individual significance of specific countries.
4  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic report and the Directors’ report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:

parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statements, set out on page 28 in relation 
to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on 
page 39 relating to the Company’s compliance with the 
11 provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities

COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT
YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
96 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016
1 General information
Costain Group PLC (the Company) is a public limited company 
incorporated in the UK. The address of its registered office 
and principal place of business is disclosed on page 138 of 
this Annual Report. The principal activities of the Company 
and its subsidiary undertakings (collectively referred to as 
‘the Group’) are described in the Strategic report.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended 31 December 2016 comprise the Group 
and the Group’s interests in associates, joint ventures and 
joint operations. The parent Company financial statements 
present information about the Company as a separate entity 
and not about its Group.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the 
Directors on 28 February 2017.
2  Summary of significant 
accounting policies
Both the Company financial statements and the Group 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted 
IFRS) and their related interpretations. On publishing the 
parent Company financial statements here together with the 
Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage 
of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 
not to present its individual income statement and related 
notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, 
rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. The financial 
statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
that financial assets and derivative financial instruments are 
stated at their fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making the judgements 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are 
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. Judgements made by 
management in the application of IFRS that have a significant 
effect on the financial statements and estimates with 
a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year 
are discussed later in this Note.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities and the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Strategic report. The financial position of the Group, 
its cash flows, liquidity position, borrowing and bonding 
facilities, use of financial instruments and hedging activities, 
exposure to credit risk and its objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital and financial risk are 
described in the Financial review section of these financial 
statements and in Note 17.
The Group’s principal business activity involves long-term 
contracts with a number of customers, virtually all in the UK. 
To meet its day-to-day working capital requirements, it uses 
cash balances provided from shareholders’ capital and 
retained earnings and its borrowing facilities. As part of its 
contracting operations, the Group may be required to provide 
performance and other bonds. It satisfies these requirements 
by utilising its committed bonding facilities from banks and 
surety companies. These facilities have financial covenants 
that are tested quarterly.
The Directors have acknowledged the guidance 
‘Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors 
of UK Companies 2009’ published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in October 2009. The Directors have considered 
these requirements, the Group’s current order book and 
future opportunities and its available bonding facilities. 
Having reviewed the latest projections, including the 
application of reasonable downside sensitivities, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic 
outlook. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless 
otherwise stated, been applied consistently by the Group 
and the Company to each period presented in these 
financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations are effective 
for the year ended 31 December 2016:
• ‘Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations’ 
(Amendments to IFRS 11).
• ‘Clarification of Acceptable methods of Depreciation and 
Amortisation’ (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38).
• ‘Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements’ 
(Amendments to IAS 27).
•  ‘Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and 
its Associate or Joint Venture’ (Amendments to IFRS 10 
and IAS 28).
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle.
• Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1).
• ‘Agriculture: Bearer Plants’ – Amendments to IAS 16 
and IAS 41.
• ‘Investment entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception’ 
– Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28.
The impact of these standards is limited to minor 
disclosure changes and alignment of accounting policies 
has not necessitated any prior year restatements.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  97
2  Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
(a)  The Group’s financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group and 
control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has the 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the entity. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until 
the date that control ceases.
(b)  Associates are operations over which power exists to 
exercise significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of 
the voting rights. Associates are accounted for using 
the equity method.
(c)  Joint ventures are those joint arrangements where control 
is shared with another entity, and where the Group has 
rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures 
are accounted for using the equity method from the date 
that the joint venture commences until the date that joint 
control of the entity ceases.
(d)  The presentation of investments in associates and joint 
ventures in the statement of financial position restricts 
the minimum carrying value to £Nil. Where the cost of 
investment would be negative, due to losses incurred, 
then an amount up to the value of the negative position 
is applied to any outstanding loan balance with the 
investment or, where future funding commitments exist, 
a provision is made up to the value of the commitment. 
Any such transfers of excess losses from the carrying 
value of investments are shown within reclassifications 
in Note 13. 
(e)  Joint operations are those joint arrangements over 
which joint control exists, established by contractual 
agreement, which are not legal entities and where the 
parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities relating to the arrangement. Where a joint 
operation exists, then the Group entity involved records 
the assets it controls, the liabilities and expenses it 
incurs and its share of income. Such joint operations are 
reported in the consolidated financial statements on the 
same basis. Transactions between Group companies and 
joint operations eliminate on consolidation.
(f)  Intra-group balances and transactions together with any 
unrealised gains arising from intra-group transactions 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions 
with associates, joint ventures and joint operations are 
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the entity or 
operation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same 
way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there 
is no evidence of impairment.
Currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at 
the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated to pounds sterling at the exchange 
rate ruling at the statement of financial position date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are 
recognised in the income statement.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated 
to pounds sterling at exchange rates ruling at the statement 
of financial position date. The revenues and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at rates 
approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates 
of these transactions.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations and of related hedges, 
to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recognised 
directly in equity and those that have arisen since 1 January 
2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a 
separate component of equity. Any remaining differences are 
recognised in profit or loss. Cumulative exchange differences 
are released into the income statement upon disposal. 
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition 
to IFRS in respect of all foreign operations are not presented 
as a separate component.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, net of value added tax and includes 
the share of revenue of joint operations. Over 95% of the 
Group’s revenue arises from long-term contracts. 
(a) Long-term contracts
Revenue arises from increase in the value of work performed 
and the value of services provided during the year. Where the 
outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably 
and it is probable that the contract will be profitable, 
revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage 
of completion of the contract activity at the statement of 
financial position date. Stage of completion is assessed by 
reference to the proportion of contract costs incurred for the 
work performed to date relative to the estimated total costs.
Compensation events, variations and claims are included 
in revenue where it is probable that the amount, which can 
be measured reliably, will be recovered from the customer. 
When the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the 
extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable those 
costs will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised 
as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed 
total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised 
as an expense immediately. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2  Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition continued
Contract work in progress is stated at cost plus profit 
recognised to date less a provision for foreseeable losses 
and less amounts billed and is included in amounts due from 
customers for contract work. Cost includes all expenditure 
related directly to specific projects and an appropriate 
allocation of fixed and variable overheads based on normal 
operating capacity. Amounts valued and billed to customers 
are included in trade receivables. Where cash received from 
customers exceeds the value of work performed, the amount 
is included in credit balances on long-term contracts.
(b) Other revenue
Revenue from other services contracts is recognised when 
the service is provided.
Revenue from the sale of land is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer, the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably and it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Income statement presentation – Other items
In order to aid understanding of the underlying and overall 
performance of the Group, certain amounts are shown in 
the consolidated income statement in a separate column 
headed ‘Other items’. Items are included under this heading 
where the Board considers them to be of a one-off and 
unusual nature or related to the accounting treatment of 
acquisitions, this includes amortisation of acquired intangibles 
and employment related and other deferred consideration. 
These are adjusted because they are not long term in nature 
and, hence, will not reflect the long-term performance of 
the Group.
Pre-contract costs
Costs associated with bidding for contracts are written off 
as incurred.
Research and development
Research and development activities are usually directly 
attributable to a project and accounted within project costs.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the 
fair value of the consideration over the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity and 
goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included 
in non-current assets. The attributable costs of acquisitions 
are expensed to the income statement. 
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is included 
when determining the profit or loss on subsequent disposal 
of the business to which it relates.
Other intangible assets comprise acquired intangible assets 
(customer relationships, order book, brand and intellectual 
property) and computer software. Customer relationships 
and other intangibles acquired are measured at the present 
value of cash flows attributable to the relationship less an 
appropriate contributory asset charge. Computer software 
is carried at cost; subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in 
the specific asset to which it relates, otherwise expenditure is 
expensed as incurred.
Amortisation begins when an asset is acquired or, in the case 
of computer software, available for use and is amortised over 
the following periods:
Brands –  on a straight-line basis up 
to three years
Order book –  in line with expected profit 
generation up to three years
Customer relationships –  on a straight-line basis up 
to seven years
Other intangibles –  on a straight-line basis up 
to five years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment 
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items. Cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable 
costs. Freehold land is not depreciated. For all other 
property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values 
of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold buildings – shorter of 50 years  
or lease term
Plant and equipment –  remaining useful life  
(generally 3 to 10 years)
Marina (Alcaidesa) –  concession period  
(20 years remaining)
Golf courses (Alcaidesa) – 50 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial 
position date.

accounting policies continued
Investments – Company
Company investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost 
less provisions for impairment.
Impairment of non-financial assets
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the cash generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating 
units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro-rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in a subsequent period.
The carrying amounts of other assets, except inventories 
and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each statement 
of financial position date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, 
the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset, or its cash generating unit, is less than 
the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised 
in the income statement.
An impairment loss (other than in relation to goodwill) is 
reversed if there has been a change in the estimates resulting 
in the recoverable amount rising above the impaired carrying 
value of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the carrying amount of the assets does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net 
of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position 
when there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect 
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the 
expected benefits to be derived from a contract are lower 
than the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under 
the contract.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of UK corporation tax 
and overseas tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and 
is accounted for using the statement of financial position 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all temporary differences except for those 
specific exemptions set out below and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial 
position date. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or other assets and liabilities, other than in a 
business combination, in a transaction that affects neither 
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
interests in joint arrangements, except where the Group is 
able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax 
rates based on those enacted or substantially enacted at the 
statement of financial position date. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited in the income statement except when it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Additional taxes arising from the distribution of dividends 
are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
100 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016
2  Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
Leases
Leases principally comprise operating leases. Payments made 
under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Any incentives to enter into operating leases are recognised 
as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on 
a straight-line basis. 
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts 
to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance 
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, 
the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until 
such time as it becomes probable that a payment under the 
guarantee will be required.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as distributions in the period 
in which they are declared. Dividends proposed but not 
declared are not recognised but are disclosed in Note 10 
to the financial statements.
Share-based payments
These comprise equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
compensation plans.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant and the fair value is expensed over 
the vesting period, based on the estimate of awards that 
will eventually vest. For cash-settled share-based payments, 
a liability equal to the portion of the services received is 
recognised at its current fair value determined at each 
statement of financial position date. Fair value is measured 
by the use of a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Where options are granted over shares in the Company to 
employees of subsidiaries, the Company recognises in its 
financial statements an increase in the cost of investment in 
its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based 
payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries’ financial 
statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised 
directly in equity.
Retirement benefit obligations
A defined benefit pension scheme is operated in the UK, 
which provides benefits based on pensionable salary. 
The details are included in Note 20. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. 
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected 
unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a 
high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency 
to the liability. The liability recognised in the statement of 
financial position in respect of the defined benefit pension 
scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
less the fair value of scheme assets at the statement of 
financial position date.
Administration costs of the scheme are recognised in the 
income statement. The interest cost on the scheme’s net 
liabilities is included in finance expense. Remeasurements of 
the net liability are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
in the Group’s statement of financial position when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
(a) Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as loans and receivables. 
The classification depends on the nature and purpose 
of the financial asset and is determined at the time of 
initial recognition.
A financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from that asset expire, or it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the asset to another entity.
Loans and receivables
Loans and other receivables with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables and measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are 
stated at their initial value less impairment losses.
Impairment of financial assets
Estimated recoverable amounts are based on the ageing of 
the outstanding receivable and provisions against individual 
receivables are recognised when management deems the 
amounts are not collectible.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for 
the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  101
2  Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
(b) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with 
interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
Where borrowings are the hedged item in an effective 
fair value hedge relationship, the carrying value is adjusted 
to reflect the fair value movements associated with the 
hedged risk. Financial liabilities are derecognised only 
when the obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(c) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks 
arising from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates 
and inflation and are measured at their fair value. The fair 
value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market 
value at the statement of financial position date.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as 
cash flow hedges in line with established risk management 
policies and classified as follows:
•  Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes 
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or
•  Cash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash 
flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the 
hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the income 
statement and adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
hedged item.
For cash flow hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion 
in the income statement. When hedged cash flows result 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity 
are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. 
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are 
recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement 
in the same period in which the hedged cash flow affects 
the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the hedged transaction occurs. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative 
gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of 
derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges 
are recognised in the income statement.
Fair value measurement
When measuring the fair value of a financial or non-financial 
asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data 
as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different 
levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in 
the valuation techniques as follows:
•  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets and liabilities.
•  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
•  Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset 
or liability might be categorised in different levels of 
the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement 
is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant 
to the entire measurement.
Significant areas of judgement and estimation
The estimates and underlying assumptions used in the 
preparation of these financial statements are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised 
if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of 
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
The most critical accounting policies and significant areas 
of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for 
long-term contracts under IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’, 
the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
and the assumptions used in the accounting for defined 
benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’.
Long-term contracts
The majority of the Group’s activities are undertaken via 
long-term contracts and these contracts are accounted 
for in accordance with IAS 11, which requires estimates to 
be made for contract costs and revenues. In many cases, 
these contractual obligations span more than one financial 
period. Both cost and revenue forecasts may be affected by 
a number of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of 
future events and may need to be revised as events unfold 
and uncertainties are resolved. Cost forecasts take into 
account the expectations of work to be undertaken on the 
contract. Revenue forecasts take into account compensation 
events, variations and claims to the extent that the amounts 
the Group expects to recover can be reliably estimated and 
the receipt is probable. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
2  Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued 
Significant areas of judgement and 
estimation continued 
Management bases its judgements of costs and revenues and 
its assessment of the expected outcome of each long-term 
contractual obligation on the latest available information, this 
includes detailed contract valuations, progress on discussions 
over compensation events, variations and claims with clients 
and forecasts of the costs to complete and, in certain limited 
cases, assessments of recoveries from insurers. The estimates 
of the contract position and the profit or loss earned to date 
are updated regularly and significant changes are highlighted 
through established internal review procedures. The impact 
of any change in the accounting estimates is then reflected 
in the financial statements.
Management believes it is reasonably possible, on the basis 
of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial 
year could require material adjustment. Given the pervasive 
impact of judgements and estimates on revenue, cost of sales 
and related balance sheet amounts, it is difficult to quantify 
the impact of taking alternative assessments on each of the 
judgements above.
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
Reviewing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
recognised on acquisition requires judgements, principally, 
in respect of growth rates and future cash flows of cash 
generating units, the useful lives of intangible assets and the 
selection of discount rates used to calculate present values 
are set out in Note 11.
Defined benefit pension schemes
Defined benefit pension schemes require significant 
judgements in relation to the assumptions for inflation, future 
pension increases, investment returns and member longevity 
that underpin the valuation. Each year in selecting the 
appropriate assumptions, the Directors take advice from an 
independent qualified actuary. The assumptions and resultant 
sensitivities are set out in Note 20.
IFRSs not applied
The following IFRSs having been endorsed, will be applicable 
as stated below:
•  IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – Published in July 2014 
and replacing the existing guidance in IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.’ IFRS 9 
includes revised guidance on the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments, including a new 
expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on 
financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting 
requirements. It also carries forward the guidance on 
recognition and derecognition of financial instruments 
from IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early 
adoption permitted. 
The Group is assessing the potential impact on its 
consolidated financial statements resulting from the 
application of IFRS 9.
•  IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was 
issued in May 2015 and will be effective for Costain 
Group PLC for accounting periods beginning on or before 
1 January 2018. We will adopt IFRS 15 in both our half-year 
and full-year 2018 accounts and at that time we will restate 
the 2017 results as required.
IFRS 15 replaces existing revenue recognition standards: 
IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, 
and moves away from the ‘risks and rewards’ concept of 
revenue recognition used by IAS 18 to a concept of ‘transfer 
of control’. Its core principle is that revenue should be 
recognised when (or as) an entity transfers control of goods 
or services to a customer.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of these and 
other accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 15. It is 
important to remember that, while IFRS 15 may affect the 
timing of revenue recognition over the life of individual 
long-term contracts (without changing the total amount 
of revenue recognised), there will be no changes to the 
treatment of cash flows and cash will still be collected 
in line with the contractual terms.
Based on the work, which we have undertaken to date, 
the areas we expect that could be most affected by the 
adoption of IFRS 15 include:
• The timing of recognition of variable revenue, 
including pain/gain agreements, incentives, claims and 
liquidated damages;
• Framework contract performance obligations;
• The timing of recognition of revenue for work on 
uninstalled off-site components.
Further work is required to fully evaluate the impact and 
to prepare for adoption in 2018 including:
• finalisation of methodology for recognition of revenue 
on contracts including, for example, the impact on risk 
and revenue sharing agreements;
• modelling the detailed impact on our historical results 
and to determine the actual transition adjustments;
• finalisation of the procedures required to operate under 
the new requirements;
• completion of the evaluation and implementation for 
all businesses.
The following IFRS has yet to be endorsed by the EU:
• IFRS 16: ‘Leases’ will apply for the year ended 31 December 
2019. IFRS 16 will bring the net present value of future 
lease liabilities and an equivalent right of use asset onto 
the balance sheet for all leases (with the exception of small 
value and short-term leases). It also changes the profile 
of income statement charges for current operating leases 
from the current straight-line model to one which is forward 
loaded to reflect the financing component of leases. We are 
at an early stage of quantifying the impact. STRATEGIC REPORT  |  GOVERNANCE  |  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  |  OTHER INFORMATION

3 Operating segments
The Group has two core business segments: Natural Resources and Infrastructure plus Alcaidesa in Spain. The core segments 
are strategic business units with separate management and have different core customers or offer different services. 
This information is provided to the Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker. The segments are discussed 
in the Strategic report section of these financial statements.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting 
policies. The Group evaluates segment performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before interest and tax 
expense before and after other items. The segment results that are reported to the Chief Executive include items directly 
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Intersegment sales and transfers are not material.

Factors that may affect future tax charges
The rate of UK corporation tax reduces to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. If the deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2016 
were reduced to reflect rate of 17%, the effect would be a tax credit of £1.6 million through the consolidated income statement 
and a charge of £3.2 million through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The Group and Company have potential deferred tax assets in their UK operations that have not been recognised at the

The net book value of other acquired intangible assets includes £1.3 million (2015: £2.1 million) relating to order book.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable cash generating units of the Infrastructure segment (£15.5 million) and the 
Natural Resources segment (£38.6 million).
As described in Note 2, the Group reviews the value of goodwill and in the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests 
are based on internal value in use calculations of the cash generating unit (CGU). The key assumptions for these calculations are: 
discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital and the risks specific to the CGU. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the Infrastructure 
CGU was 9.2% and for the Natural Resources CGU was 10.3%.
The value in use calculations utilise the Group’s three-year cash flow forecasts, which are based on the expected revenues of 
each CGU taking into account the current level of secured and anticipated orders, extrapolated for future years by the expected 
growth applicable to each CGU as follows:
Growth rates
Infrastructure 
%
Natural 
Resources 
%
Years 3-4 2.5 2.5
Year 5 1.5 2.5
Long-term average 1.5 1.5
At 31 December 2016, based on the internal value in use calculations, management concluded that the recoverable value of the 
cash generating units exceeded their carrying amount. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
112 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016
11 Intangible assets continued
There is substantial headroom on goodwill for both CGUs. Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the goodwill in relation 
to each CGU by changing the key assumptions applicable to each CGU. In respect of the Natural Resources segment, which has 
the smaller headroom, the assumptions would have to change as follows for any single assumption change to bring headroom 
down to £nil:
•  Discount rate – increase from 10.3% to 14.3%;
•  Growth rate – reduce from positive 2.5% to a negative value;
•  Underlying operating margin – reduce by 3%.

14 Trade and other receivables continued
At 31 December 2016, amounts due from customers for contract work falling due within one year include retentions of 
£27.1 million (2015: £25.6 million) relating to long-term contracts in progress. Other receivables falling due after more than 
one year include retentions of £7.1 million (2015: £7.7 million) relating to long-term contracts in progress.
With respect to trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications at the reporting date that the 
payment obligations will not be met. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade, other receivables and amounts 
owed by joint ventures and associates approximates to their fair value.
The average credit period within trade receivables on amounts billed for contract work and on sales of goods is 35 days 
(2015: 34 days). The analysis of the due dates of the trade receivables was £82.4 million (2015: £61.1 million) due within 30 days, 
£19.3 million (2015: £18.8 million) due between 30 and 60 days and £0.1 million (2015: £3.6 million) due after 60 days.
These balances include receivables, with a carrying amount of £5.6 million (2015: £5.3 million), which are past due at the 
reporting date and for which no provision has been made as there has been no significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are considered recoverable. No collateral is held over these balances. The analysis of the overdue amounts was 
£1.0 million (2015: £1.7 million) overdue by less than 30 days, £0.7 million (2015: £1.0 million) overdue by between 30 and 60 
days and £3.9 million (2015: £2.6 million) overdue by more than 60 days.
The provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is £0.3 million (2015: £7.1 million).
The aggregate amount of costs incurred plus recognised profits, less recognised losses, for all contracts in progress at the 
statement of financial position date was £3,776.3 million (2015: £3,103.1 million). Progress billings and advances received from 
customers under open contracts amounted to £3,672.0 million (2015: £2,997.7 million). Advances for which work has not started, 
and billings in excess of costs incurred and recognised profits are included in credit balances on long-term contracts.

 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016  117
17 Financial instruments – Fair values and risk management
a) Risk management
The Group's centralised treasury function manages financial risk, principally arising from liquidity and funding risks and 
movements in foreign currency rates, interest rates and inflation rates, in accordance with policies agreed by the Directors.
The Group does not enter into speculative transactions.
The Company does not have any forward foreign currency contracts or other derivatives.
i) Capital management
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to provide 
resources to grow the business, in order to provide returns for shareholders and other stakeholders. The current capital base 
of the Group is driven by equity capital from shareholders and retained earnings. The Board of Directors ('Board') continues to 
seek to strengthen the Group by growing the business and improving profitability; the Strategic report describes the Group's 
strategy and its operations. It is the Board's policy to progressively increase dividends paid to shareholders based on growth in 
underlying earnings per share after taking account of the investment and capital needs of the business. There were no changes 
in the Board's approach to capital management during the year.
ii) Liquidity and funding risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity and funding risk rests with the Board, which has put in place a monitoring and reporting 
framework to manage funding requirements. 
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring actual and forecast short-and medium-term cash flows and the maturity profile of 
financial assets and liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves and bank facilities. The nature and timing of the 
contract cash flows causes the cash balances to vary over the month with the balance usually highest at month end.
The average month end net cash balance during the year was £69.1 million (2015: £103.7 million).
Customers awarding long-term contracting work may, as a condition of the award, require the contractor to provide 
performance and other bonds. Consequently, the Group is reliant on its ability to secure bank and surety bonds. It has 
facilities in place to provide these bonds and monitors the usage and regularly updates the forecast usage of these facilities.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had banking and bonding facilities, including a £125.0 million (2015: £125.0 million) Revolving 
Credit Facility and a £30.0 million Term Loan, extending to 25 June 2021. The facilities, which were increased by the Term Loan 
and extended by one year during 2016, have financial covenants based on interest cover and leverage measured quarterly.

* Element of above facilities available for borrowings 2.5  2.5 
At 31 December 2016, the utilisation of these bonding facilities amounted to £78.7 million (2015: £154.9 million).
iii) Credit risk
The Group focuses on major blue-chip private sector and large public sector customers. It uses an external credit scoring 
system to assess a potential customer's credit quality and will enter into a contract only if that assessment is satisfactory. 
Deposits in the UK are placed with the bank facility providers or, in joint operations, with banks agreed by the partners. 
Overseas deposits are placed with major banks operating in those countries. Transactions involving derivative financial 
instruments are with bank or insurance company counterparties with high credit ratings that are monitored regularly and 
with whom there are signed netting agreements. Given the high credit ratings of the banks and insurance companies used, 
management does not expect any counterparty will fail to meet its obligations.
At the year-end date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented 
by the carrying amounts of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, and the individual constituents of 
amounts due from customers for contract work in the statement of financial position. Further information on the exposure to 
credit risk is set out in Note 14. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
118 COSTAIN GROUP PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2016
17 Financial instruments – Fair values and risk management continued
a) Risk management continued
iv) Interest rate risk
The Group has cash balances in the UK and overseas and bank borrowings in the UK. The largest constituents are UK balances 
denominated in pounds sterling. A 1% rise in interest rates would have increased the annual interest income on net cash 
balances by £0.7 million (2015: £1.0 million).
During the year and at 31 December 2016, there was no interest rate hedging undertaken by the Group.
v) Foreign currency risk
Transactional currency exposures arise from sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than their functional 
currency. The current strategy is to hedge both committed and forecast foreign currency exposures, where applicable, and 
where the transaction timing and amount can be determined reliably and no natural hedge exists. The Group only enters into 
forward contracts when a contractual commitment exists in respect of the foreign currency transaction and the Group's policy 
is to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivative to match the terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness.
The Group's subsidiary, Alcaidesa Holding SA, a company based in Spain is denominated in euro. At the year-end, the net 
carrying value of the assets was £26.3 million (2015: £23.4 million). A 10% strengthening in the euro would have adversely 
impacted the results by £0.1 million (2015: £0.2 million).
The Group's investment in Alcaidesa Holding SA is hedged by euro currency contracts (6 sale contracts (2015: 6 sale 
contracts)) which mitigate the foreign currency risk arising from the subsidiary's net assets. The fair value of the forward sales at 
31 December 2016 was €30.5 million (2015: €32.0 million). No ineffectiveness was recognised from the net investment hedge. 
The Group's investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged.
As a consequence, a 10% strengthening in the euro would have no impact on the statement of financial position (2015: £Nil).
b) Cash flow hedges
Forward currency contracts that hedge forecast transactions are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value based on 
a Level 2 valuation method, using quoted forward exchange rates. The terms of the foreign currency contracts match the terms 
of the commitments.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had foreign currency contracts (16 sale contracts (2015: 5) and 52 purchase contracts 
(2015: 51)) designated as cash flow hedges of future transactions and summarised below. The 2015 figures have been reclassified 
to exclude the net investment hedge. The carrying value represents the fair value of the contract; the contractual cash flows 
represent the pounds sterling commitments. There were no ineffective hedges at the year-end (2015: none).

rates at a margin over Base, LIBOR or EURIBOR.
The Company's financial assets comprised cash at bank of £Nil (2015: £0.1 million) and trade and other receivables of 
£133.4 million (2015: £97.4 million) with 123.1 million (2015: £88.8 million) denominated in pounds sterling and £10.3 million 
(2015: £8.6 million) denominated in euros and all maturing within one year.
The Company's financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables of £27.2 million (2015: £26.2 million) denominated in

20 Employee benefits
(a) Pensions
A defined benefit pension scheme is operated in the UK and a number of defined contribution pension schemes are in place 
in the UK and overseas. Contributions are paid by subsidiary undertakings and, to the defined contribution schemes, by 
employees. The total pension charge in the income statement was £12.1 million comprising £11.0 million included in operating 
costs plus £1.1 million included in net finance expense (2015: £11.2 million, comprising £9.9 million in operating costs plus 
£1.3 million in net finance expense).
The Company does not operate a pension scheme.
Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new members on 31 May 2005 and from 1 April 2006 future benefits were 
calculated on a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis. The scheme was closed to future accrual of benefits to members 
on 30 September 2009. A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2013 and this was updated to 
31 December 2016 by a qualified independent actuary. At 31 December 2016, there were 2,820 retirees and 3,234 deferred 
members. The weighted average duration of the obligations is 17.3 years.

All equities are listed. The multi-credit fund invests in a portfolio of primarily floating rate debt of non-investment grade 
or unrated borrowers. The PFI investments is the portfolio of interests in ten PFI investments transferred by the Group to 
The Costain Pension Scheme in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The absolute return fund targets a lower volatility return by investing 
primarily in long/short equity strategies.
The investment portfolio comprises 41% index linked gilts, which are targeted to hedge inflation risk, plus a portfolio of other 
assets targeted, as a whole, to generate a higher return over the long-term than the cost of the liabilities. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Increase discount rate by 0.25%, decreases pension liability and reduces pension cost by 34.7  1.2

Increase life expectancy by one year, increases pension liability and increases pension cost by  28.1  2.8 
In accordance with the pension regulations, a triennial actuarial review of the Costain defined benefit pension scheme was 
carried out as at 31 March 2016. In February 2017, the valuation and an updated deficit recovery plan were agreed with the 
scheme Trustee resulting in cash contributions of £10.0 million for the 12 months to 31 March 2017 and then £9.6 million per 
annum (increasing annually with inflation) until the deficit is cleared, which would be in 2031 on the basis of the assumptions 
made in the valuation and agreed recovery plan. 
In addition, as previously implemented, the Group will continue to make an additional contribution so that the total deficit 
contributions match the total dividend amount paid by the Company each year. Consequently, the total amount of contribution 
is anticipated to be at a similar level to that under the previous plan. Any additional payments in this regard would have the 
effect of reducing the recovery period in the agreed plan. The Group will also pay the expenses of administration in the next 
financial year.
Any surplus of deficit contributions to the Costain Pension Scheme would be recoverable by way of a refund, as the Group 
has the unconditional right to any surplus once all the obligations of the Scheme have been settled. Accordingly, the Group 
does not expect to have to make provision for these additional contributions arising from this post balance sheet agreement 
in future accounts.
Defined contribution schemes
Several defined contribution pensions are operated. The total expense relating to these plans was £8.5 million 
(2015: £7.7 million).

(b) Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of share-based payment plans as described below. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Shareholders approved a new Long-Term Incentive Plan at the 2014 AGM that allows for conditional awards with a maximum 
face value of up to 100% of base salary to be awarded. Performance conditions such as those based on earnings per share, 
are determined by the Remuneration Committee of the Board at the time of grant.
Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)
Executive Directors and other senior management are eligible to participate in the Company's Annual Incentive Plan, under 
which one third of the award is payable in shares. The total AIP award of up to 150% of base salary has performance conditions 
based on adjusted EBIT (Earnings before interest, tax and other items) (at least 50% of the award) and other measures. 
The share award element vests on the second anniversary of the date of grant and will be satisfied by shares purchased by a 
trust on behalf of the Group. It will not lead to any dilution of shareholder interest. Participants must be in employment with 
the Company and not under notice of termination (either given or received) on the date of vesting. 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)
Prior to 2014, Executive Directors and other senior management were eligible to participate in the Company's Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan which allowed for conditional awards with a face value of up to 50% of base salary with a performance condition 
based on adjusted EBIT (Earnings before interest, tax and other items). The deferred bonus award was satisfied by shares 
purchased by a trust on behalf of the Group, so did not dilute shareholder interests. The last grant under the DSBP was made 
in 2014 and vested on 31 March 2016.
Save As You Earn Plans (SAYE)
The Company operates a SAYE scheme that is open to all eligible employees who pay a fixed amount from salary into a 
savings account each month and elect to save over three or five years. At the end of the savings period, employees have 
six months in which to exercise their options (after which the options expire) using the funds saved. If employees decide not 
to exercise their options, they may withdraw the funds saved. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within 
the Group (except where permitted by the rules of the scheme).
Share-based payment expense
The amounts recognised in the income statement, before tax, for share-based payment transactions with employees was 
£2.8 million (2015: £2.4 million); the entire charge relates to subsidiaries.
Options outstanding at the end of the year
The outstanding LTIPs (exercise price £1 per individual grant), AIP (Nil-cost option) and DSBPs (Nil-cost option), which arrange

(b) Share-based payments continued
The fair value of options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The aggregate fair value of options 
granted during the year was £3.8 million (2015: £3.4 million). The assumptions used in valuing the grants were:
2016 2015
Expected volatility 20% 20%
Expected life (years) 2.7 – 5.0 2.7 – 5.0
Risk-free interest rate 2.6% 2.6%
Expected dividend yield 2.8% 2.8%
The expected volatility is based on the historical share price volatility over a term matching the expected life. The expected 
life is based on management's best estimate having regard to the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.

25 Acquisitions
On 5 July 2016, the Group purchased the share capital of Simulation Systems Limited (now Costain Integrated Technology 
Solutions Limited). The business is based in the UK and provides innovative technology based solutions, primarily in the 
highways sector.
The initial consideration was £17.6 million. A further payment of £1.5 million was deferred over three years. This is dependent 
on continued future service and, in accordance with IFRS 3, will be expensed to the income statement.
Costain's strategy is to focus on major customers spending billions of pounds addressing national needs in energy, water and 
transportation. These customers are consolidating their supply chains and seeking an increasingly integrated service offering 
from their service providers through larger, longer-term collaborative contracts. The Group believes the acquisition will further 
enhance its technology capability as part of its focus on delivering a broad range of innovative integrated services.
The contributions to revenue and operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles and employment related 
consideration within the Group's results of this acquisition was revenue £11.5 million, operating profit £0.5 million, including 
integration costs.
The proforma figures as required by IFRS 3, assuming that the acquisition had been part of the Group throughout the year, 
were revenue £19.0 million and operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles of £0.7 million.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group's assets and liabilities:
£m
Cash consideration 17.6
Acquired intangible assets – Customer relationships 2.8 
Acquired intangible assets – Other 2.5 
Property, plant and equipment 0.1 
Cash 1.6 
Other current assets 2.6 
Other current liabilities (3.9)
Deferred tax (1.1)
Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities recognised 4.6 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions 13.0 
Based on the provisional assessment of the recognised values of assets and liabilities, the goodwill arising on the acquisition 
is expected to be £13.0 million.
Costs of £0.4 million were incurred by the Group in relation to the acquisition and have been expensed in administrative 
expenses within the income statement.
The acquisition of Rhead Group Holdings Limited, acquired in July 2015, was adjusted by £0.3 million with a corresponding 
increase in the goodwill. There was no change to the acquisition fair values of Alcaidesa Holding SA, the joint venture that 
became a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2015, following a reorganisation in which the assets were split between the two partners. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Dividend mandate
Shareholders can arrange to have their dividends paid directly 
into their bank or building society account, by completing a 
bank mandate form. The advantages of using this service are:
• the payment is more secure as you can avoid the risk of 
cheques getting lost in the post;
• it avoids the hassle of paying in a cheque; and
• there is no risk of lost, stolen or out-of-date cheques.
A mandate form can be obtained from the Company’s 
website, or by contacting Equiniti on 0371 384 2250* 
(+44 (0) 121 415 7047 if calling from outside the UK) 
who will be pleased to assist you and can also be obtained 
via the shareholder website at shareview.co.uk (see below 
for further details). Alternatively, you will find one attached to 
the ‘dividend tax confirmation’ of your last dividend payment. 
Overseas shareholders can arrange for their dividends to 
be paid in their local currency and more information can 
be obtained from shareview.com/overseas
Shareview service
The Shareview service from our Registrar, Equiniti, allows 
shareholders to manage their shareholding online, giving:
• direct access to data held on their behalf on the share 
register including recent share movements and dividend 
details; and
•  the ability to change their address or dividend payment 
instructions online.
To sign up for Shareview you need the ‘shareholder reference’ 
printed on your proxy form or dividend stationery. There is 
no charge to register.
When you register with the site, you can register 
your preferred format (post or email) for shareholder 
communications. If you select email as your mailing 
preference, you will be notified of various shareholder 
communications, such as annual results, by email 
instead of post.
If you have your dividends paid straight to your bank account, 
and you have selected email as your mailing preference, you 
can also collect your ‘dividend tax confirmation’ electronically. 
Instead of receiving the paper ‘dividend tax confirmation’, you 
will be notified by email with details of how to download your 
electronic version. Visit the website at shareview.co.uk for 
more details.
Details of software and equipment requirements are given 
on the website.
Unsolicited mail
The Company is legally obliged to make its share register 
available to the general public. Consequently, some 
shareholders may receive unsolicited mail, including 
correspondence from unauthorised investment firms. 
Shareholders who wish to limit the amount of unsolicited 
mail they receive can contact:
The Mailing Preference Service  
Freepost 29  
LON20771  
London W1E OZT
Further guidance on this issue can also be found on the 
Company’s website at costain.com
ShareGift
The Orr Macintosh Foundation (‘ShareGift’) operates a charity 
share donation scheme for shareholders with small parcels 
of shares whose value makes it uneconomic to sell them. 
Details of the scheme are available on the ShareGift website 
at sharegift.org. Equiniti can provide stock transfer forms 
on request. Donating shares to charity in this way gives rise 
neither to a gain nor a loss for Capital Gains Tax purposes. 
This service is completely free of charge.
* Lines are open Monday to Friday 08.30am to 05.30pm, excluding 
UK bank holidays.

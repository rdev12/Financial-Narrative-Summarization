CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
BUSINESS REVIEW
I am pleased to report continued
growth in sales, operating profit and
cash generation during the year.
Our strategy to increase the scale of
the Group both organically and by
acquisition has resulted in significant sales growth, cash
generation and improved profits.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group has adopted International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”) in these results for
the first time and the comparative figures have been
restated accordingly. The impact of adoption of IFRS on the
Group’s income statement for the period ended 31 August
2008 has been to increase the retained profit, as compared
to UK GAAP, by £259,000 (2007: £109,000) as a result of
the changes in accounting for employee benefits, business
combinations and lease inducements. 
Sales have risen by 29% to £14.8m compared with last
year. Operating profit has increased 258% to £666,000
(2007: £186,000). The profit before tax has increased by
201% to £454,000 (2007: £151,000).  Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
were £1,139,000 (2007: £573,000). The retained profit for
the year was £324,000 (2007: £141,000) and the basic
earnings per share was 0.19p (2007: 0.10p).
The balance sheet remains strong with an increase in cash
during the year of £686,000 to £2,903,000  
(2007: £2,217,000) after repayment of bank loans and loan
notes of £732,000.
The directors do not propose a dividend. (2007: £ nil).
Average headcount for the year has increased from 105 to
137, with 140 at the year end.

UNICUS
The earn-out period relating to the acquisition of Unicus
Regulatory Services Limited ended on 31 July 2008. The
liability for deferred consideration has been increased from
£250,000 to £815,000, reflecting the strong 
post-acquisition performance of the business.
BOARD CHANGES
I informed the Board of my intention to stand down as
Chairman at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to
be held on 22nd December 2008. Mr Grahame Cook
joined the Board on 28 August 2008 as a non–executive
Director and Chairman designate. In addition, Mr Frank
Condella and Mr Ken Lacey joined the Board as non-
executive Directors on 25 September 2008. With these
additions, I am convinced Fulcrum Pharma has a strong
Board, capable of delivering the Company’s strategy.
I would also like to thank Dr Jon Court, who stepped 
down from the Board on 31 March 2008, for his years of
leadership of the Fulcrum Pharma business.
CONCLUSION
I am encouraged by the improved performance of the
Group in terms of operating profit and cash generation.
The Board remain committed to growing Fulcrum Pharma’s
professional services business both organically and by
acquisition.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
STRATEGIC REVIEW
Following my appointment as Chief Executive
on 1 April 2008, I have conducted a strategic
review of the business with the Management
Team and Board. The review has refined the
Group’s Mission, service offerings and branding
and confirmed that the Group is committed to
increasing scale through both organic growth
and selective acquisitions.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
2008 2007 Increase
Sales (£’000) 14,826 11,503 29%
Cash generated by Operations (£’000) 1,493 874 71%
COMMERCIAL, SALES AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
The refined Mission is that “Fulcrum Pharma is a professional service
company providing clients with expert solutions for the development of
therapeutic products”.  
The Group has undertaken a rebranding exercise based on a new
Vision, Mission and Values. 
Following on from the Strategic Review, the main elements of the
business strategy are
• to build a substantial Regulatory business
• to deliver bigger projects from diversified clients from the Product
Development Consultancy business, and 
• to opportunistically pursue chances to add complementary skills to
Fulcrum Pharma’s offerings and alliances with other service providers.
The corporate website has been redesigned and there has been wide
participation at major scientific, biotechnology and partnering
conferences in the US, Europe and Japan. The Group has continued to
look for opportunities to sell services across its geographical regions
and provide complete and expert solutions to clients. In particular, the
business development efforts of the Japanese subsidiary have
generated significant fee sales from Japanese clients for the Europe and
US businesses.
The organisation has been strengthened with the creation of a
focussed Commercial Operations group to lead sales and business
development and a Professional Development group to support staff
development and training. 
As part of the strategy to expand Pharmacovigilance services, Fulcrum
Pharma has formed a strategic collaboration with Quantum Solutions,
India. This collaboration enables Fulcrum Pharma to deliver high
capacity processing and reporting of safety information whilst
maintaining necessary quality standards.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CONSULTANCY
Dr Sarah Arbe-Barnes has been appointed as General Manager for
Product Development Consultancy (PDC).  This specialist group has
been established to provide global, strategic consultancy to the pharma
and biotech industries, the investment community and the neglected
diseases sector and to lead Fulcrum Pharma’s development
programmes. PDC has the target of winning larger drug development
projects from a more diverse client base, and to pursue opportunities to
retain a greater amount of the project work within the Fulcrum Pharma
organisation. PDC operates on a global basis with staff based in Europe
and the US.
EUROPE
On 1 April 2008, Fulcrum Pharma Developments Limited was renamed
Fulcrum Pharma (Europe) Limited and became the single trading entity
in Europe, with Dr Phil Birch  appointed as General Manager.  Fulcrum
Pharma (Europe) integrated the businesses of the acquired subsidiary
companies, Quadramed Limited and Unicus Regulatory Services Limited
(“Unicus”) with Fulcrum Pharma Developments Limited.  This change
of structure has enabled the integration of processes across Europe and
has simplified the organisational structure.
In 2008, additional market leading services were added
to the Fulcrum Pharma portfolio. These additions
triggered a corporate rebranding exercise that repositions
Fulcrum Pharma as the leading professional service
company in our selected field.
A new brand logo and corporate image defined the new
corporate identity, and a clear marketing strategy to
develop industry awareness was set in place to ensure
the name Fulcrum Pharma represented a professional
image in the market place.
Rebranding Fulcrum ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
7
Sales in Europe have grown by 20% to £9.8 million (2007: £8.2
million) reflecting the full year contribution of Unicus, which was
acquired in March 2007.  The initial issues experienced with Unicus
have been resolved and the strong sales performance has
demonstrated the value created by the acquisition of Unicus by the
Group.
US
The US business recorded a strong performance. Sales grew by 72% to
£2.4 million (2007: £1.4 million) reflecting the recovery of the business.
Mr John Larus joined the Company as General Manager for the US and
has restructured the US organisation in preparation for future growth.
Staff numbers have increased from 16 to 22 with expanded operational
and business development resource including extending the Group’s US
presence with the opening of an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan in
November 2007. Additionally, in order to better service the needs of
the clients, a dedicated regulatory affairs group, with electronic
submission capabilities, has been established in the US.
JAPAN
The Japanese organisation has continued to consolidate its position as
a leading specialist CRO in the oncology field.  Organic growth over the
last year has seen sales increase by 35% to £2.6 million (2007: £1.9
million) and headcount increase by 20%. The domestic client base is
predominately first tier Pharma companies and government funded
organisations. Long-term, stable contracts with these clients allow the
Japanese business to maintain an order book showing a good level of
predictability in a two year horizon.
FUTURE STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
The Group continues to see a trend for increased demand for
outsourcing as clients target more productive research and
development outputs.  The turbulent market conditions have increased
the focus of all clients on selective and efficient use of capital in
progressing drug development projects.  While the Group has

Business Review

products. A review of the business during the year ended 31 August 2008 and future developments are set out in the Chairman’s statement and
the Chief Executives review on pages 4 to 7.
The Directors believe that, given the Group’s current stage of development, the Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) are fee sales and net cash
generation. A review of the KPIs is contained in the Chairman’s Statement on page 4.
The key risks to the business are deterioration of the funding climate for biotech and smaller pharmaceutical companies and changes in health
authority regulations which may create additional uncertainty and cost for drug development programmes.
Results and dividends
The retained profit for the year after taxation was £324,000 (2007: £141,000). No interim dividend (2007: £Nil) was paid and the Directors do

In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:-
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
company and the group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the group web site, www.fulcrumpharma.com. Legislation in the UK governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Company’s shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange. The Group is therefore subject to
the AIM Admission Rules of the London Stock Exchange and is consequently not required to comply with the best practice corporate governance
provisions contained within the Combined Code (2003) and its 2006 revised version appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority.
The Board
The Board currently comprises the executive and non-executive Directors. Following the recent Board changes in September 2008, the Board now
has a majority of non-executive Directors. A minimum of six Board meetings are held annually. The Board is responsible for overall strategy, major
finance matters and internal financial control. It also monitors executive management in the business through its review of financial, strategic and
operational matters. All Directors are subject to retirement by rotation.
Board committees
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees, each with defined terms of reference. 
The Audit Committee comprises Mr G Cook, Professor Sir C George, Dr M Carter and Mr K Lacey. It meets at least twice each year and is
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored, for meeting the auditors and reviewing
the reports from the auditors relating to the financial statements.
The Remuneration Committee comprises Dr A Bell, Mr G Cook and Mr F Condella. It meets at least twice each year and reviews the performance of
the executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration having due regard to the interests of the shareholders. The Committee
also manages the share option schemes.
The Nominations Committee was established during the year and is composed of at least three members, the majority of which are non-executive
Directors. It meets as appropriate to review the structure, size and composition of the Board, give full consideration to succession planning for
Directors and other senior executives and keeps under review the leadership needs of the Group.
Internal financial control
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal financial control to provide them with reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial information used within the business and that the assets are safeguarded. There are inherent limitations in any
system of internal financial control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance with
respect to the preparation of financial information and the safeguarding of assets.
The Group, in administering its business, has put in place strict authorisation, approval and control levels within which senior management operates.
These controls reflect the Group’s organisational structure and business objectives. This control system includes clear lines of accountability to cover
all areas of the organisation. The Board operates procedures to identify the major business risks facing the Group and controls those risks. The
Group also has a budgeting and reporting system in place with results compared to budget, variance analysis and re-forecasting of projected results.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budgets and forecasts with respect to its financial position as at 31 August 2008. After taking into
consideration the cash flow implications of these plans, the Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to produce the Group financial statements on
a going concern basis.

>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
For the year ended 31 August 2008 Fulcrum ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
13
We have audited the Group and the Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Fulcrum Pharma plc for the year ended
31 August 2008 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated and Company balance sheets, the Consolidated and
Company cash flow statements, the Company statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and
the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s statement and the Chief
Executive’s review that is cross referred from the Business review section of the Directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s review and all of the other information listed
on the contents page. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state
of the Group’s affairs as at 31 August 2008 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended; and
• the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 August 2008 and cash
flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Fulcrum Pharma Plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”) are professional service companies providing clients with expert
solutions for the development of therapeutic products. The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England. The
address of its registered office is Hemel One, Boundary Way, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, HP2 7YU, UK.
The Company is listed on the London AIM stock exchange.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European
Union and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. These are the
Group’s and Company’s first financial statements prepared under IFRS and IFRS 1 has been applied. Details of how the Group’s results and financial
position are affected by the change to IFRS are set out in Note 29.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain items that have been measured at fair value as
detailed in the individual accounting policies below. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The accounting estimates that have the most risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying value of assets and liabilities are in relation to the impairment of goodwill, as discussed below.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently for all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an
opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 September 2006 for the purpose of the transition to IFRS.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the results of Fulcrum Pharma plc and its subsidiaries and the Employee Share Option Plan Trust
(“ESOP Trust”) drawn up to 31 August 2008. The results of all the subsidiaries, with the exception of Fulcrum Pharma (Europe) Limited, have been
consolidated using the principles of acquisition accounting. Fulcrum Pharma (Europe) Limited, which was acquired in March 2000, has been
consolidated using the principles of merger accounting.
Inter-company transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in full on consolidation.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985.
Revenue recognition
Revenue, which is stated net of value added tax, represents amounts invoiced to third parties, excluding pass-through costs from suppliers, except in
respect of long-term contracts where turnover represents the sales value of work performed in the year, including estimates in respect of amounts
not invoiced. Revenue in respect of long-term contracts is calculated as that proportion of total contract value which costs incurred to date bear to
total expected costs for that contract.
Profit on long-term contracts is recognised as the work is carried out if the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The profit
included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the year end, on a contract by contract basis, by
recording turnover and related costs as contract activity progresses. Revenue derived from variations on contracts is recognised only when they have
been agreed with the client. Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Milestone payments due under contractual relationships are recorded as revenue when all work related to the milestone is completed.
Government grants
Government grants which are granted under job creation schemes are recognised in the income statement on a basis that matches the costs of
employment. The grants receivable are credited to the profit and loss account as the criteria for payment of each instalment are met.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. The Group
determines the functional currency of each entity and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional
currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the
income statement.
>NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 August 2008 Fulcrum ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008
20
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year and
the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation
of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those undertakings at the average rate, are taken to reserves
and are reported in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement in
the year in which they arise and are included in operating profit.
As permitted by IFRS 1 “First time adoption of IFRS”, the Group elected to deem the cumulative translation differences arising on the consolidation
of overseas subsidiaries at the date of transition to IFRS to be nil.
Employee benefits — Share-based compensation
The Group issues equity-settled share payments to certain employees. In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payments”, equity-settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the
Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest. The Group has applied the exemption available and has applied the provisions of
IFRS 2 only to those options awarded after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 1 September 2006. At each balance sheet date, the
group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. The Group recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates,
if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of
the instrument.
Investments
Investments are recognised at the trade date. Investments (other than investments in subsidiary undertakings) are classified as available-for-sale and
are recognised at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised directly in equity,
until the security is disposed of or it is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is
included in the net result for the year within finance income or finance costs.
Investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less impairment.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost. Interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts is written off to the income statement using
the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that gives a residual interest in the assets of the group or company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Compound financial instruments.
Compound financial instruments are split between the liability and equity components at the date the financial instrument is issued. The fair value
of the liability element is calculated using the market interest rate of an equivalent non-convertible loan. The residual amount, representing the
value of the equity conversion option, is included in equity.
Pensions
The Group makes contributions to individual personal pension plans. The contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they are
incurred.
Trade payables.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Segment reporting.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risk and returns that are
different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic
environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit reported in the income statement because the
former excludes items of income or expense that are either taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible, and it
includes tax reliefs that are not included in the income statement. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability
method. Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full on temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided using the rates of tax
that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Business combinations and goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of net fair value of
the acquired entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell, and value in use. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is
less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
At the acquisition date of a subsidiary, goodwill acquired is recognised as an asset and is allocated to each of the cash-generating units.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 September 2006 (the date of transition to IFRS) was retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to
being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible fixed assets
Acquired intangible assets are stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is provided on intangible fixed
assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic
life, as follows:
Trade name — one year
Customer relationships — six years
Order book — one year 
Database — three years
The carrying values of intangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful economic life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements — over the lease term
Fixtures and fittings — five years
Computer equipment — two — five years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable.
Trade receivables and other receivables.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments, available with no
penalty, with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Fulcrum ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Finance and operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been
purchased outright. Assets under these leasing arrangements are recognised at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease and depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives and the lease term.
The assets are included in fixed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases. The lease
rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the
interest element is charged to the profit and loss account. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and
the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
ESOP Trust
The Group has adopted SIC 12 “Consolidation — special purpose entities” in accounting for the ESOP Trust in the consolidated financial
statements. The Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP Trust in its own financial statements, and shares held by the trust are
recorded at cost less impairment as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees. 
Recent accounting developments
At the date of the authorisation of these financial statements, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have been
published. The Company has not early adopted any standards, amendments or interpretations.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to impact upon the Company are:
IAS 23 (Amendment) “Borrowing costs’” — the amendment to the standard requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to
the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of
the cost of that asset. The option of immediately expensing borrowing costs is removed. The amendment will apply to the Group from the annual
period commencing 1 September 2009.
IAS 1 (Amendment) ‘”Presentation of Financial Statements” — this amendment prohibits the presentation of items of income and expense (that is
‘non-owner changes in equity’) in the statement of changes in equity. Revised IAS 1 also sets out the additional disclosure requirements for entities
making restatements or reclassifications. The amendment will apply to the Group from the annual period commencing 1 September 2009.
IFRS 2 (Amendment) “Share-based payments’” — this amendment clarifies that vesting conditions are service and performance conditions only.
It also specifies that all cancellations should receive the same accounting treatment, whether cancelled by the entity or by other parties. The
amendment will apply to the Group from the annual period commencing 1 September 2009.
IFRS 3 (Amendment) “Business combinations’” — this amendment includes some significant changes to how the acquisition method is applied to
business combinations. This amendment applies to the Group from the annual period commencing 1 September 2009.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have any material impact on the financial statements of the
Company:
IFRS 8 “Operating segments” applies to the Group from the annual period commencing 1 September 2008. IFRS 8 amends the current segmental
reporting requirement of IAS 14 and requires ‘management approach’ to be adopted so that segment information is presented on the same basis as
that used for internal reporting purposes.
IAS 27 (Amendment) “Consolidated and separate financial statements” applies to the Group from the annual period commencing 1 September
2010. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in
control.
IAS 32 (Amendment) “Financial Instruments: Presentation” and IAS 1 (Amendment) “Presentation of Financial Statements - Puttable Instruments
and Instruments with Obligations Arising on Liquidation” applies to the Group from the annual period commencing 1 September 2009.
IFRIC 12 “Service concession arrangements” applies to Group and Company from the annual period commencing 1 September 2008.
IFRIC 13 “Customer loyalty programmes” applies to the Group and Company from the annual period commencing 1 September 2008.

3. SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Primary reporting format — Business segments
Based on the risks and returns, the Directors consider that the primary reporting format is by business segment. The Directors consider that there is
only one business segment, being professional services to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the disclosures for the primary segment have
already been given in the financial statements.
Secondary reporting format — Geographical segments
Although the Group is located in several different geographical areas, sales and costs are cross-charged around the group to such an extent that the
results of each location are significantly dependent on the activities of the others. The geographical segments are therefore considered to be the
secondary reporting format.

£’000 £’000 
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 454 151

— Research and development tax credits (181) (153)
Income tax expense 111 10
The weighted average applicable tax rate was 35.5% (2007: 35.1%). The reduction is caused by a change in the profitability of the group’s overseas
subsidiaries.
Effective from 1 April 2008, the rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom reduced from 30% to 28%.

number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding those shares held by the ESOP Trust.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive potential
ordinary shares.

Goodwill
Goodwill acquired on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are any
indications that the goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units
according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on value in use calculations. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial
forecasts over a period of six years. These cash flow projections have been discounted at 10%, the Group’s average cost of borrowings, and
approved by management. The key assumptions for the net present value calculations are those regarding growth rates and profitability during the
period.
Management estimate the growth rates based on industry growth forecasts of between 12% and 15% and a reasonable estimate of achievable
market share. Net profit is estimated at up to 15% based on industry averages and management’s expectations of the cash-generating units.
At 31 August 2008 and 2007, impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use exceeds the carrying value of goodwill by between 30% and 90%.
Management have concluded that there has been no impairment loss against goodwill for the years ended 31 August 2008 and 31 August 2007.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets consist of £470,000 of customer relationships, £66,000 of trade name and £75,000 of database validation acquired as part
of the purchase of Unicus Regulatory Services Limited in April 2007. These assets are being amortised over 1 — 6 years, being the expected life of
the assets from the date of purchase. Amortisation charges in the year have been charged to administrative expenses. There are no events that
would indicate any impairment.

cost. During the year, it was listed on the Tokyo Mother’s Market stock exchange and is therefore marked to market at 31 August 2008. In the year
to 31 August 2008, the Group recognised a net impairment of £197,000 (2007: £Nil) after exchange adjustments. The impairment arose as a result
of a delay in listing the investment as planned, a further private fundraising and subsequent dilution.

The Group’s policy requires clients to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. The settlement terms are generally due within 30 days from the
end of the month of sale and do not bear any effective interest rate. All trade receivables are subject to credit risk exposure. However, the Group
does not identify specific concentrations of credit risk with regards to trade and other receivables, as the amounts recognised resemble a large
number of receivables from various clients. The Group does not hold any collateral or security. The Group has a strict credit control process. As the
majority of the Group’s clients are large companies with whom the Group has long standing relationships, the risk of default is considered to be low
and write offs due to bad debts are extremely low. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of
receivable mentioned above.
The Company has no trade receivables.
Trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies for the Group:

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The financial risks faced by the Group include market risk (including foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and
liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
The Group’s main objectives in using financial instruments are the maximisation of returns from funds held on deposit and, when appropriate, the
generation of additional cash resources for Group operations through financing arrangements for capital assets and through the issue of shares and
other financing instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide working capital for the Group’s operations in the UK,
Japan and US.
The Group’s policy is to raise cash when it is required and when market conditions are appropriate, using those financial instruments that can be
negotiated with the providers of finance at that time. These instruments include bank loans and finance leases.

Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained cash reserves, finance leases and bank loans. The policy of the Group is to monitor
exposure to interest rate risk and take into account potential movements in interest rates when selecting methods of financing. However at present,
the level of Group borrowings is low and the interest rate risk at present is not considered to be significant. Fulcrum ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

Financial liabilities
The finance leases are at various variable rates of interest. The total of these liabilities outstanding at 31 August 2008 was £6,000 (2007: £16,000),
with a weighted average outstanding period of 9 months (2007: 16 months) and a weighted average interest rate of 2.83%(2007: 2.74%). The
bank loan facilities incurred interest at rates between 1.8% and 7.75% during the year. The total amount of bank loans outstanding at 31 August
2008 was £930,000 (2007: £1,133,000). The total amount of convertible loan notes outstanding at 31 August 2008 was £443,000 (2007:
£586,000) which incurred interest charges of 2% above the base rate of National Westminster Bank plc.
The Company has estimated that £443,000 of convertible loan notes will be issued as deferred consideration for the acquisition of Unicus
(see Note 26). The terms of the conversion are that the holder of the notes shall be entitled to convert the value of the notes into ordinary share
capital of the Company on the basis that the issue of one ordinary share satisfies 6 pence of loan note indebtedness. There is interest payable on
the convertible loan notes at the lower of 2% above the base rate of National Westminster Bank plc or 7.5%.
A 0.5% increase in LIBOR would reduce the Group’s profit by £7,000 and the Company’s profit by £6,000 in 2008. A 0.5% decrease would have
the opposite effect.

The Group maintains sterling, euro, US dollar and yen accounts in which all cash and bank balances are held. The Company maintains sterling
accounts only. Cash and bank balances represent floating rate cash held in current accounts and deposit accounts with banks at interest rates based
on interbank rates. Short-term deposits represent fixed rate deposits placed with major clearing banks for up to three months earning interest at
rates of 4.75% — 5.37% (2007: 1.60% — 5.12%).
Currency risk profile
The Group’s functional currency is sterling, and the majority of its transactions are denominated in that currency. The Group operates in US dollars,
yen and euros. The Group also has overseas subsidiaries where the US subsidiary’s functional currency is US dollars and the Japanese subsidiaries’
functional currency is yen. The Group’s currency exposures, comprising foreign currency bank accounts at 31 August 2007, are shown below:

The Company has no financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Liquidity risk
The Board monitors the level of cash and liquid resources on a regular basis and manages it on a daily basis, to ensure that the Group has sufficient
liquid funds to enable it to continue as a going concern. This is achieved through the production and review of cash forecasts.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk arises from credit exposure to clients and Group companies and also with banks with which cash is held.
The Group has a strict credit control process. As the majority of the Group’s clients are large companies with whom the Group has long standing
relationships, the risk of default is considered to be low and write offs due to bad debts are extremely low.
The Board consider the risk of default of Group debtors to be negligible.
The Board ensures that deposits are only placed with banks which have a minimum credit rating of AA (Standard and Poor’s rating). Fulcrum ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

Capital risk management
The Board’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Fair values
There is no material difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the Group’s and Company’s financial assets and liabilities at
31 August 2008.

unpaid contributions outstanding at the year end of £10,000 (2007: £3,000).
26. ACQUISITIONS
On 19 March 2007 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Unicus for an initial consideration of £2.3 million in cash, of which
£159,000 was refunded by the vendor pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement, and further consideration of £200,000 which was paid in
employee benefits. Deferred consideration of £815,000 based on the turnover of Unicus during the year ended 31 July 2008 is payable and had
been estimated at £250,000 in the financial statements as at 31 August 2007. The deferred consideration will be payable in cash and convertible
loan notes. The convertible loan notes are repayable in three equal instalments within the period 1 May 2009 to 1 May 2010. The terms of the
conversion are stated in Note 23.
27. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates various share option schemes including an Employee Share Ownership Plan under which options are exercisable at a price equal
to middle market quotation from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant.
The various schemes allow for granting of share options up to 15% of the issued ordinary share capital except for the grant of options over a
maximum of 20,000,000 shares to Directors and senior employees which was approved at the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting on
12th April 2007. Grants are normally made within 42 days following the announcement of final or interim results of the company. No payment is
required for the grant of the share option. Performance criteria only apply to the grant of the maximum of 20,000,000 shares approved on
12th April 2007. The usual minimum vesting period is three years but options can vest earlier in certain circumstances such as staff incentive
arrangements in newly acquired subsidiaries, or events of redundancy or death.

29. EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
Transitional arrangements
Under the provisions of IFRS 1 “First time Adoption of IFRS” specific exemptions may be applied in certain areas as part of the transition of the
financial statements to IFRS. The Group has elected to apply the following exemptions:
• IRFS 3 “Business Combinations”
IFRS 3 has been adopted from the transition date and is only being applied to acquisitions made on or after 1 September 2006.
IFRS also requires goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews carried out at least annually. The Group has applied the
standard from the transition date and so the net carrying value of goodwill at 31 August 2006 has been brought forward as the
cost at 1 September 2006, with no amortisation charge from that date.
• IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”
Under IAS 21 cumulative translation differences arising on the consolidation of overseas subsidiaries are being accumulated for each
individual subsidiary from the date of transition to IFRS and not from the original acquisition date.
IAS 17 “Leases”
IAS 17 requires companies to make an adjustment with respect to ‘Rent Free’ periods. Under UK GAAP , lease inducements such as rent free periods
are apportioned over the lease term until the first break point of the lease; under IFRS, the inducement is spread over the full term of the lease.
IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”
IAS 19 requires companies to make an accrual for holiday pay.
IAS 38 “Intangible assets”
Under UK GAAP , goodwill is amortised over its expected useful life. IAS 38 does not permit amortisation and instead is reviewed annually for
impairment.
IAS 39 “Financial asset available for sale”
Under UK GAAP , financial assets are carried at historic cost. Under IAS 39, the asset is “marked to market” and shown on the balance sheet at the
current market value and using the current foreign exchange rate. Movements in market value are recorded in equity unless there is an impairment,
in which case the cumulative loss is reported in the income statement.
IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”
IFRS 3 deals with accounting for business combinations including goodwill and intangible assets.
Under UK GAAP , the Group adopted FRS 10 “Goodwill and intangible assets” from March 2000 and goodwill arising on acquisitions after this date
was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, which was presumed to be ten years. Goodwill arising before this date was eliminated
against reserves. In addition, the Group tested for impairment when there was an indication that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired.
Under IFRS 3 this policy has been replaced by impairment tests performed annually or whenever there is an indication that the carrying value of an
asset might be impaired. Goodwill amortisation has also ceased.
At the transition date, the Group had goodwill assets with a net book value of £1,216,000, which under the transitional arrangements laid out in
IFRS 1 was deemed to be the costs carried forward for these assets from that date.
Although the Group has adopted IFRS 3 from the transition date, 1 September 2006, the Group completed the acquisition of Unicus Regulatory
Services Limited on 19 March 2007. The accounting treatment of this acquisition has therefore been reviewed in accordance with the requirements
of IFRS 3. As a result of this review, intangible assets have been separately identified, and goodwill has been reduced by the corresponding net
amount. The newly identified intangible assets are being amortised over one to six years.
Revenue reclassification
Historically, pass through sales have been included within revenue under UK GAAP . To reflect the underlying contractual arrangements and to give a
more accurate reflection of the actual trading, these zero-margin pass through sales have been eliminated in the IFRS financial statements.
The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS does not change the cash flows of the Group nor does it impact Group strategy or commercial decisions.

Explanations of resolutions
Resolution 1 – Financial statements
The Directors of the Company are obliged to present to shareholders the report of the Directors and the audited financial statements for the
Company for the year ended 31 August 2008. That report and those financial statements, and the report of the Company’s auditors on those
financial statements, are set out on pages 9 to 49 of this document.
Resolution 2 – Re-appointment of auditors
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at which financial statements are laid, to hold office until the next general
meeting. The present auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are willing to continue in office for a further year and this resolution proposes their
re-appointment and, in accordance with standard practice, authorises the Directors to determine the level of the auditors’ remuneration.
Resolution 3 – Re-election of a Director
After the first Annual General Meeting at which all of the Directors retired from office, at every subsequent general meeting one third of the
Directors for the time being (other than those appointed since the latest Annual General Meeting) are required to retire. If the number of relevant
Directors is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not greater than one third of the Directors should be obliged to retire. Directors
due to retire by rotation are those who have been longest in office since their last re-election and as between persons who become or were last
re-elected on the same day those due to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot. A retiring Director is
eligible for re-election. Dr M G Carter who retires by rotation is offering himself for re-election.
Resolutions 4, 5, 6 and 7 – Re-election of Directors
A Director appointed to the Board as an additional Director holds office only until the next Annual General Meeting, when he must be re-appointed
in order to remain in office. Dr F M Armstrong, Mr G D Cook, Mr F C Condella and Mr K L Lacey are retiring in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association and, being eligible, are offering themselves for re-election.
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot
This resolution grants the Directors authority to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £593,136 being an amount equal to
one third of the issued share capital of the Company. It is not the Directors’ current intention to allot relevant securities pursuant to this resolution.
This authority replaces the existing authority to allot relevant securities but does not affect the ability to allot shares under the share option schemes.
This authority expires at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 15 months from the date of passing the resolution,
whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 9 – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
This resolution disapplies the statutory pre-emption rights which would otherwise apply on an issue of shares for cash pursuant to a rights issue
where the securities attributable to the interests of all shareholders are proportionate (as nearly as may be) to the number of shares held and
generally up to £444,852, being a sum equal to 25% of the issued share capital of the Company. This replaces the existing authority to disapply
and expires at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 15 months from the date of passing the resolution, whichever
is the earlier.

Chairman’s review
Following a year of transition,
Northern Foods is a simpler, leaner 
and more competitive business
Anthony Hobson
Chairman Northern Foods plc Chairman’s review 03
Overview
This has been a year of transition 
for Northern Foods. A year ago we
set out our plans to create a focused
and competitive company, capable
of driving improved shareholder
returns. We proposed a radical
restructure of Northern Foods 
to create a strong financial and
operational platform for future
growth. I am pleased to report that
we have made measurable progress
against our stated objectives.
Our share price has reflected this
progress, as we delivered a total
shareholder return of 29.7% during
the year ended 31 March 2007.
In January 2007, we successfully concluded
the disposal of five businesses (chilled Pastry,
Cakes, Speciality bread, Flour milling and chilled
Distribution). These businesses represented
40% of the prior year’s group revenue but 
a contributed profit from operations* of only
£1.3m for the year. We concluded that these
businesses were not core and that other
owners had a better opportunity to achieve 
an appropriate return. The disposals were
achieved ahead of time and in excess of our
£200m target. We also delivered the first
benefits from our Chilled division simplification
programme. We have realised a £9m saving 
in the first twelve months of our two year
central cost reduction programme; and
embedded a rigorous culture of cash and
capital management, generating £83.0m 
in free cash flow.
Northern Foods now comprises a portfolio 
of five focused businesses – Ready meals,
Sandwiches & Salads, Frozen, Biscuits and
Puddings – operating across our Chilled,
Frozen and Bakery divisions – in both the
retailer own brand (ROB) and branded arenas.
Each business unit has real potential for future
performance improvement and is led by a
strong management team with a clear vision
and strategy for growth. Whilst performance 
in some areas, particularly Biscuits, has
disappointed, progress in the year, particularly
in the Chilled division, demonstrates the
ability of these teams to create value for 
our customers and shareholders.
Y our Board
Significant change in the business has been
accompanied by change in your Board. Your
Chief Executive since 2004, Pat O’Driscoll,
stepped down from the Board on 1 February
2007. She led the business through a period 
of transformation, beginning the process 
of transition to a lower cost, more effective
and efficient business. This culminated 
in the successful delivery of our disposal
programme in January 2007. I would like 
to express my appreciation, and that 
of the Board, to Pat for her leadership of,
and dedication to, Northern Foods.
Pat also created a strong management 
team. From this team, she was succeeded 
as Chief Executive by Stefan Barden, with
effect from 5 February 2007. Stefan joined
Northern Foods in January 2006 as Executive
Director of the Chilled division, latterly
assuming additional responsibility for 
the Bakery division. Stefan has extensive
experience in the food industry, most 
recently as Managing Director of Heinz UK
and Ireland from 2003 to 2005. Since joining
Northern Foods, he has begun the process of
delivering a step change in the performance 
of our Chilled business. His deep knowledge 
of the food industry, combined with his
understanding of Northern Foods, means 
he is well positioned to deliver value for 
our customers and our shareholders alike.
We also welcomed Tony Illsley to the Board 
in September 2006 as a non-executive
director. Tony’s experience of the food sector,
including roles as President of Pepsi Cola
International (Asia Pacific) and President 
of Walkers Snack Foods, has proved of
immense value to the Board.
Summary
Northern Foods is a simpler, leaner and more
competitive business. We are building upon 
a solid foundation, with a strong focus 
on our retained businesses and a talented
management team in place. We have much
work to do, but we are totally committed 
to realising the potential of this business 
for our employees, our customers and our
shareholders.
Anthony Hobson
30 May 2007
Performance
In 2006/07, we achieved continuing underlying
revenue growth of 3.1% while continuing
profit before tax* rose by 21.2%. The group’s
return on net assets* (RONA) increased by
1.2%, as we made good progress in reducing
our asset base and in generating returns from
our investments. Our pension deficit has 
been substantially reduced and net debt more
than halved, creating the capacity to consider
careful and selected future investment.
During the past year we have taken decisive
action to focus the group and establish a
strong financial and operational foundation 
on which to build future profitable growth.
We have disposed of underperforming and
non-core assets; enhanced cash flow; rebased
the dividend to reflect the size of the new
group; and reduced the burden of corporate
central costs, whilst ensuring effective
governance processes lie at the heart of
everything we do. The total cost of restructuring
was £55.4m, resulting in a loss for the year 
of £22.5m.
The markets in which we operate remain
fiercely competitive. Our customers require
exceptional service and product quality and
our cost base is under continual pressure from
rising input prices. Future progress will depend
on leveraging the heritage, innovation and
operational skills of our business to drive
selective growth and better profitability. We
have talented people and the right businesses
to deliver on our objectives. Our focus is on
building performance; delivering outstanding
food and excellent customer service; introducing
exciting innovation; and continuing to deliver
rigorous cash management. This will ensure
that we deliver value for our shareholders.
Dividend
Following the rebasing of the final dividend
last year to reflect the scale of the new group,
the Board is recommending a full year dividend
of 4.25 pence per share (2005/06: 4.25 pence
per share), including a final dividend of 
2.75 pence per share.
Our employees
This has been a year of very significant 
change for our business. I would like to extend
the Board’s thanks and appreciation to all
Northern Foods’ employees, both those who
continue to work in our retained businesses
and corporate centre, as well as those who
have left to work elsewhere. The smooth and
efficient transition of our disposed businesses
to new owners has only been possible through
the collective effort of many people. The
foundation we have built during the year 
is strong and a credit to the team we now
have in place. 04 Chief executive’s review Northern Foods plc

Stefan Barden
Chief executive Northern Foods plc Chief executive’s review 05
Delivering our agenda
The past year has been one of 
real progress for Northern Foods.
The strategic review, announced in
May 2006, set out our plans to create
a firm foundation on which to build.
We set out to:
> create a more focused business around
strong brands and growing retailer own 
label relationships through a major 
disposal programme;
> simplify our Chilled division;
> achieve strong positive cash generation 
and effective capital management; and
> reduce corporate central costs.
I am pleased to report that we have successfully
delivered our disposal programme and have
achieved measurable progress against our
other objectives, providing a firm foundation
for future growth across Northern Foods.
Creating a foundation for future growth
From this sound foundation, I believe we can
deliver operational and revenue improvements
for the future.
We have a clear strategy, to:
> focus on attractive market segments;
> partner with customers who require
quality, innovation and high levels 
of service;
> deliver through a low cost, high
performance business model.
Attractive market segments
We will focus particularly on markets with strong
growth potential, which reflect the consumer
drivers of convenience, indulgence and a healthy,
balanced lifestyle. Five of our market segments
grew by an average of 9% last year – Ready meals,
Sandwiches, Salads, Pizza and Christmas puddings –
and in four of these segments we were ranked
number one or two in terms of revenue.Another
key market for us is Biscuits.While it is not a major
sales growth opportunity for us, we recognise
significant profit improvement potential and 
we remain committed to achieving this.
These six segments account for 87% of our
revenue.Top line growth will be limited to where
this can be delivered profitably. In some areas 
we are capacity constrained but investment 
will be limited to ensure adequate returns are
achieved, while we will continue to exit business
which remains unprofitable.
Partnering selected customers
We partner with customers and invest 
in assets that can give them competitive
advantage in their product ranges. Since we
focus on the premium tiers in retailer own
brand (ROB) ranges – such as Finest, Extra
Special or The Best – our products are
disproportionately important in building
retailers’ own brand images. We strive to
deliver ‘shopper loyalty’ and above average
sales growth for retailers – not just products.
Our customers ask for slightly different things,
but in general they all agree that they want:
> great tasting food;
> made safely;
> delivered correctly; and
> at the right price.
Success will come from continuing to listen 
to our customers and profitably delivering what
they require better than other manufacturers,
and we are working to deliver this success:
> Independent tests show that many 
of our products taste better than those 
of our competitors. Repeat purchase rates 
for many of our products are regularly
amongst the best in our markets;
> Our food safety processes and technologists
are amongst the very best in the country.
We are the only food manufacturer with 
a food laboratory that has dual accreditation
from the UK Government’s Accreditation
Service (UKAS). This covers both our food
testing laboratories and on site technical
evaluation activities and means we are 
able to deliver independent third party
audits and assessments. We have been
instrumental in codifying many of the
chilled food industry’s hygiene and
manufacturing policies and standards;
> Our service delivery to customers remains
consistently at the very highest levels.
We regularly receive customer accolades
and awards in this area. We are building 
a reputation as a ‘can do’ manufacturer,
able to respond to customer requests
quickly, be it step changes in product
demand or delivering a high quality 
new product brief within days; and
> Our products are seen as being good value
for money (although we do not focus on
lower quality, ‘value’ products).
Low cost operating model
Our strategy is being delivered through the
expert management teams we have in place 
in each of our retained businesses. Each team
has responsibility and accountability for its
own performance. Each knows its market and
customer base and can respond quickly and
profitably to opportunities and challenges 
in their target market.

6 06 Chief executive’s review Northern Foods plc
Chilled division
Our Ready meals business competes in 
a market created by Northern Foods and 
M&S in partnership some 30 years ago.
This business has been one of our most
challenging in recent years. In spite of making
great products, we have failed to deliver an
acceptable level of profitability. Excess market
capacity and a high ‘cost to serve’ operating
model have adversely impacted margins.
Our Chilled simplification programme is
starting to deliver demonstrable improvement.
The UK retail ready meals market is now worth
more than £1.5 billion and is growing at nearly
7% annually
6
. Increasingly constrained market
capacity, coupled with our complexity
reduction programme, should allow margin
recovery ahead of considering new investment.
Our Ready meals revenue continues to
improve, and in the last quarter we became
market leader with a 19% value share
10
.
Our great tasting meals reflect the unique
skills of our chefs and production teams,
coupled with our ingredient sourcing and
manufacturing capabilities. These drive 
high levels of repeat purchase and resultant 
retailer demand on which we are capitalising.
Concurrently, we are working to improve our
margins, through correctly pricing our core
business and ensuring we charge fully for 
the value of meeting customers’ additional
requirements.
Our Ready meals recovery programme will
take time to deliver and may not be a smooth
path, but we believe we have the right plans in
place to continue this business unit’s recovery.
Our other Chilled business unit is Sandwiches
& Salads. This business requires an exceptional
focus on service due to the very short shelf life
of its chilled products; less than 48 hours from
time of manufacture and sometimes even
shorter. We have a critical role in helping
retailers maximise their own sales, while
minimising waste, by delivering their daily
orders exactly as requested. This is a real
challenge in the changeable British climate,
which causes day to day orders to fluctuate
significantly.
The largest market within this business unit is
sandwiches. The UK multiple retailer sandwich
market is worth £577m and is growing at 13%
annually
7
. Consumers are reducing homemade
consumption in favour of quality products in
an ever increasing choice of carriers (breads)
and fillings. Northern Foods is ranked number
three in this market with a 14%
7
share, and
our two sandwich customers, Tesco and M&S,
are the market leaders, offering good growth
potential for us. Our customers’ summer
product launches will benefit from our strong
innovation capability, with many of our breads
and wraps coming directly from our in house
traditional bakery.
The wet and prepared salads markets together
are worth £407m and are growing at an
average of 15% annually
8
. Healthy living 
and summer eating are driving demand and
Northern Foods’ market share reached 18% 
in 2006/07
8
, putting us at number two in 
the market. Again, outstanding service and
premium quality credentials underpin our
success.We operate close to capacity in the peak
summer months and have committed to a
£9m expansion of our Corby production facility.
Frozen division
Our Frozen business produces and markets
strong brands which we continue to expand
and develop. In Pizza, we have the UK’s
number one brand, Goodfella’s, with 31.5% 
of the frozen segment
8
. We are not, however,
restricted to frozen pizza. The total UK pizza
market is valued at nearly £700m and growing
at 9% annually
8
. In addition to Goodfella’s,
we produce the leading ROB chilled pizza
range for Tesco. We are currently exploring
how best to leverage our market leadership
and technology capability across the combined
frozen and chilled segments. At the same time,
we continue to grow and consolidate our
leadership in frozen, successfully innovating
and refreshing the product range; indeed,
Goodfella’s Solos was named the fastest
growing brand in the UK in 2006
11
.
With frozen Pizza representing 51% of
divisional revenue, our other frozen food
brands represent valuable parts of our
portfolio. Both the Green Isle and Donegal
Catch brands are market leaders in Ireland and
are well placed to capitalise on healthy eating
trends. For example, our Donegal Catch fish
business has grown 20% over the past year
through the delivery of healthy, innovative
product ranges. We see significant scope to
expand our product portfolio through different
routes to the consumer and we will update 
on these programmes when appropriate.
Meanwhile, Grassington’s Food Co., our 
Meat-free range of vegetable meals and meal
accompaniments, has consolidated its position
in the UK. Our total Meat-free market share
has overtaken Linda McCartney to become
number two in the market
8
. At the same 
time, we are working to resolve our areas of
underperformance within the Frozen division,
which have been adversely affected by healthy
eating trends. The meat and pastry markets
have faced significant challenges in the past
year as consumers change their diets. As a
result our Dalepak meat grill and Holland’s
meat pie brands have disappointed and we are
working hard on plans to improve performance
to meet our strict shareholder return criteria.

Ready meals Sandwiches & Salads Pizza Biscuits Puddings Northern Foods plc Chief executive’s review 07
Bakery division
In Biscuits we participate in one of the largest
snacking product markets, worth £1.87 billion
annually, but a combination of our limited
market share at 11%
12
and annual market
growth of only 1%
8
make this a difficult space
in which to operate. However, after a recent
profit decline, we do believe that we have
stabilised the business and that there is good
value to be created through focusing on product
innovation and selected investment. Our
initiatives focus on simplification, automation,
and innovation driven top line growth.
To deliver this improvement better, we have
reorganised our management team around
three segments, each of which addresses a
different consumer need; requires a different
customer sales pitch; and has a different
supply chain structure and assets:
> ‘Everyday’ biscuits, under the Fox’s brand,
continues to meet consumer needs through
its strong stable of sub-brands, including
Rocky, Echo and Classic, and will be
supported by expansion into the ‘indulgent’
and ‘children’s biscuits’ segments, where
market growth exists;
> In ‘Seasonal’ biscuits we enjoy segment
leadership with a portfolio led by the
Creations brand, and a large range of
bespoke products for retailers. Production 
is complex and labour intensive and 
will benefit from targeted automation;
> In ‘Retailer Own Brand’ biscuits we are a
strong and innovative partner for our retailer
customers and will exploit surplus capacity
from our asset base where a low cost
position can be sustained.
Overall, we look to deliver medium term
improvement in our Biscuits business as our
newly installed teams implement their plans.
Finally, our Puddings business has good
growth potential. Over two thirds of all
Christmas puddings purchased are made 
by us
9
and we have identified a further
expansion opportunity in the premium
Christmas market. This year we will test
market a premium Matthew Walker Christmas
pudding. Drawing on original Victorian recipes,
this will be the definitive Christmas Pudding.
Consumer research has helped develop an
exciting concept from the ‘original’ Christmas
Pudding maker and retailers will benefit from
the branded price premium.
Reduced factory complexity costs will result
from offering the brand to many of our
smaller trade customers who currently have
their own bespoke recipes at high cost to both
partners. A successful test will result in a full
launch in 2008.
Outlook
The past year has been one of real progress 
for Northern Foods, as we delivered against
our key objectives, successfully completing 
our disposal programme and creating a
focused business for the future.
This year will see further progress in the
transition of the group. We expect to see
continued opportunities for revenue growth
and improved performance, particularly 
in the attractive Chilled markets. However,
challenges remain, especially in Biscuits,
where we are experiencing a sustained
increase in input costs.
Nonetheless, I am confident that our increased
focus and improved financial position mean
we are well placed to deliver steady top 
and bottom line growth and create value 
for shareholders.

Our performance culture is

Performance overview
Following a year of transition,
in which we successfully completed
the disposal of businesses representing
40% of total annual revenue,
Northern Foods is a simpler, leaner
and more competitive business.
We are building on a solid foundation,
with a strong focus around our 
five businesses and an experienced
management team in place.
The continuing business achieved a 21.2%
increase in profit before tax*. This was driven
by reduced financing costs, resulting from 
both the successful disposal programme 
and excellent cash management. Profit from
operations* was maintained at the prior year
level. We have made encouraging progress in
improving profitability in our Chilled division
with its operating margin* markedly improved
to 5.0% (2005/06: 2.9%). Corporate centre
costs (which are allocated to divisions) have
been reduced by over £9m during the year,
a significant component of the target savings
identified at the start of the year.
These improvements in performance have
been offset by a year on year decline in the
profitability of the Frozen and Bakery divisions.
While we continued to deliver good growth in
Pizza, driven by our market leading Goodfella’s
brand, the Biscuits business, in particular, has
continued to underperform.
Our renewed focus on cash management 
has delivered a strong cash performance with
improved free cash flow and, together with
disposal proceeds, net debt more than halved.
This will allow future growth through cautious
investment in existing capacity and selective
acquisition.
The company has reached agreement to 
make a special pension contribution of
£57.0m, funded from disposal proceeds.
Once the final special pension contribution 
of £22.0m is made in June 2007, the group’s
post retirement benefits deficit of £8.6m 
at 31 March 2007 is expected to have been
eliminated (measured under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)). Subject
to market conditions, no further special
contributions will be required to fund the
principal UK pension scheme.
With common systems and service functions
successfully established and delivering
significant cost and synergy benefits, we have
adopted a simplified operating structure for
our five retained business units. Across each
business we have strong leading brands or high
growth, retailer own brand (ROB) positions.
Each business offers opportunities to capitalise
on selective market growth, margin
improvement and cost optimisation. Each
business is led by a dedicated management
team and, by devolving decision making 
to these teams while retaining appropriate
corporate governance, we are sharpening
decision making, improving responsiveness 
to customer needs and streamlining costs.
Summary financial performance
The group has balanced top line revenue
growth with opportunities to reduce costs,
improve margin and generate cash. Continuing
revenue* increased to £888.5m (2005/06:
£862.0m), with underlying revenue up 3.1%,
driven by a return to growth in the attractive
chilled market. As expected, full year operating
margin* at 6.6% was slightly below the prior
year margin of 6.8% with the second half year
ahead of the first half (H2 operating margin*:
7.1% (2005/06: 7.2%)), reflecting our seasonal
bias to the winter period. Full year profit from
operations* was maintained at £58.2m, in line
with prior year (2005/06: £58.2m).
Profit before taxation and restructuring items
for continuing operations improved to £40.0m
(2005/06: £33.0m). With an effective tax rate
of 20.3% (2005/06: 16.0%), earnings per share
for continuing operations before restructuring
items increased by 14.8% to 6.52p (2005/06:
5.68p). With restructuring items for continuing
operations after taxation of £3.9m (2005/06:
£11.6m), profit for the period for continuing
operations was £28.0m (2005/06: £16.1m).
As reported at the first half year, contribution
from discontinued businesses was significantly
reduced, with profit from operations* of £1.3m
in the period prior to their sale (2005/06:
£12.1m). As a result, total group profit before
taxation and restructuring items reduced to
£41.3m (2005/06: £45.1m). With significant
restructuring costs in the disposed businesses,
including a book loss on disposal, the group
had an overall loss for the period of £22.5m
(2005/06: loss £5.0m).
Free cash flow was £83.0m (2005/06: £30.6m).
The strong focus on cash generation saw
capital expenditure reduced to £29.5m
(2005/06: £54.0m), only 52% of depreciation
(2005/06: 84%). Net debt more than halved
to £174.2m (2005/06: £363.1m), despite
special pension contributions paid of £53.0m.
Key programme delivery
In the year, we delivered against each of the
four key programmes announced in May 2006:
> Business disposals: completed ahead of 
the targets for both value and timescale,
we disposed of five businesses which were
non-core, operated in lower relative margin
categories or which required significant
restructuring. The sale of NFT, our chilled
distribution business, was concluded in
August 2006 and chilled Pastry, Cakes,
Speciality bread and Flour milling in
January 2007. The disposed businesses’
profit from operations was £1.3m in the
year (up to the date of disposal). Gross
disposal proceeds were £211.2m;
£888.5m
Continuing revenue* increased to
£888.5m (2005/06: £862.0m)
1 5.5%
RONA* (return on net assets)
up to 15.5% (2005/06: 14.3%)
£83.0m
Free cash flow increased to 
£83.0m (2005/06: £30.6m) 10 Performance review Northern Foods plc
> Chilled simplification: this programme 
has begun to address underperformance 
in this core business, as demonstrated 
by an improvement in operating margin*
from 2.9% to 5.0%. A wide range of
initiatives are reducing complexity, through
product rationalisation, standardisation 
of production between plant facilities,
streamlining of low volume production
runs and ongoing overhead cost reduction;
> Reduced central costs: the transition 
to a core focused group has supported 
a £9m reduction in corporate central 
costs during 2006/07. Non-essential 
costs have been eliminated and a number
of non-strategic services outsourced.
The adoption of a flatter business structure
has enabled elimination of the divisional
management tier. Further cost savings
have been identified, once transition
support agreements providing services 
to the divested businesses end, allowing
delivery of the total target set of £12m
over two years;
> Cash and capital management: excellent
progress has been made in embedding
rigorous cash management. Each business
has focused on driving cash flow, focusing
on essential capital investment, eliminating
excess inventory, reducing overdue
receivables, optimising supplier terms,
and exploring the sale of unrequired assets.
This has driven a significant reduction in
working capital, capital spend and interest
charges compared to the previous year.
Key performance indicators
Alongside profit and debt, the group uses
several financial key performance indicators
(KPIs) to measure progress, as follows:
KPI 2006/07 2005/06
Revenue growth 
(underlying)* 3.1% 2.9%
Operating margin* 6.6% 6.8%
Return on net assets 
(RONA)* 15.5% 14.3%
Free cash flow £83.0m £30.6m
Debt ratio 1.8 times 2.5 times
Return on invested 
capital (ROIC) 7.8% 8.4%
Each KPI is defined and assessed within this
review. Non-financial KPIs are featured in 
the Corporate responsibility report.
Revenue
The group pursues selective revenue increase
through targeting market growth and innovation.
We pursue growth only in areas where margin
is enhanced. Unprofitable business is exited
through selective range rationalisation.
Continuing revenue* increased to £888.5m
(2005/06: £862.0m) with underlying revenue
growth of 3.1%, although growth rates varied
markedly by division. Underlying volumes 
grew by 3.1% while average sales prices across
the group remained flat. The overall market
remained highly competitive and only limited
price increases were delivered to recover 
rising input costs. Sales to the group’s top five
customers by value represent 76% (2005/06:
77%) of total revenue.
Operating margin & RONA
Profit from operations before restructuring
items for continuing operations was in line
with prior year at £58.2m (2005/06: £58.2m).
A strong performance in Chilled was offset 
by a decline in Frozen and Bakery. All three
divisions benefited from savings in corporate
central costs and a lower pension charge.
Operating margin* reduced slightly to 6.6%
(2005/06: 6.8%). Following relatively benign
raw material price volatility conditions,
the second half saw a return to rising prices
for several key commodities and ingredients.
Given very limited input cost recovery through
increased selling prices, the group has focused
on improved productivity and commercial
innovation. A structured programme of 
value analysis to reduce costs has included
improved sourcing, investment in efficiency
orientated capital projects and outsourcing 
of non-strategic activities.
In addition to improving operating margin,
each business is targeted to improve its 
asset utilisation. The combination of these 
is measured through return on net assets
(RONA) – profit from operations* divided 
by average operating assets* invested in the
business. RONA improved from 14.3% to
15.5%, reflecting a reduction in operating
assets through reduced capital investment 
and working capital.
We delivered against each of our four key programmes:
> Business disposals > Reduced central costs
> Chilled simplification > Cash and capital management Northern Foods plc Performance review 11
Profit from continuing operations
Net finance costs before restructuring items
decreased by £7.0m to £18.2m (2005/06:
£25.2m), reflecting strong cash generation
from the combination of completion of the
disposal programme and successful cash
management across the group. As a result,
profit before taxation and restructuring items
for continuing operations increased by 21.2%
to £40.0m (2005/06: £33.0m). The effective
taxation rate increased to 20.3% (2005/06:
16.0%) with a benefit from the successful
resolution of previous tax computations offset
by an additional provision for tax charges.
The charge for restructuring items before
taxation for continuing operations was £5.6m
(2005/06: £15.7m), reflecting significantly
lower levels of rationalisation within the more
stable retained businesses, primarily in central
cost reduction and a reduction in the number
of Frozen manufacturing facilities, partly
funded by a £2.5m profit on sale of land.
The charge for restructuring items comprised
£3.6m in cash and £2.0m in non-cash items.
Profit for the period from continuing
operations was £28.0m (2005/06: £16.1m).
Profit from discontinued operations
Profit before taxation and restructuring items
for the discontinued operations was £1.3m
(2005/06: £12.1m). The chilled Distribution
and Flour milling businesses continued 
to perform well; however, profitability 
was significantly reduced in chilled Pastry,
Cakes and Speciality bread. The Speciality
bread business suffered a major fire at its
Sheffield facility in July 2006, with the
resultant loss claim settled with insurers for
£34.0m (including self-insurance of £4.0m) in
November 2006 (of which £30.0m principally
relating to the reinstatement of the plant 
was transferred to the new owner on disposal).
Sale of the chilled Distribution business
completed in August 2006 for gross proceeds
of £51.2m, including £6.7m in loan notes
repayable within twelve months. Disposal of
the remaining four discontinued businesses
completed in January 2007 for £160.0m in
cash, following shareholder approval.
A restructuring charge of £56.3m (2005/06:
£45.5m) in the discontinued businesses
comprised a profit of £2.4m (2005/06: £45.5m
charge) from operations, with a £19.0m net
gain arising from the fire in Speciality bread,
offset by £16.6m of rationalisation charges,
primarily in chilled Pastry and Cakes, and a
book loss of £58.7m (2005/06: nil) on the
business disposals. The rationalisation charge
comprised £11.6m in cash and £5.0m in 
non-cash items.
The loss for the period from discontinued
operations was £50.5m (2005/06: £21.1m loss).
Loss for the period
Total group loss for the period was £22.5m
(2005/06: £5.0m). Adjusted EPS increased 
by 14.8% to 6.52 pence (2005/06: 5.68 pence).
Including restructuring items and discontinued
operations, basic EPS was a loss of 4.60 pence
(2005/06: loss 1.03 pence).
Dividend
Subject to shareholder approval, the final
dividend of 2.75 pence per share (2005/06:
0.85 pence per share) is payable on 24 August
2007 to shareholders on the register at 27 July
2007. In line with the rebasing of the dividend
last year, the total dividend payable in respect
of 2006/07 is 4.25 pence per share (2005/06:
4.25 pence per share). This represents adjusted
EPS cover of 1.53 times, supported by the
strong cash generation of the group. Future
dividend growth will be driven by performance
improvement, with dividends covered between
1.5 times and 2 times adjusted EPS and fully
covered by free cash flow in the medium term.

Comprising two continuing
businesses – Ready meals and
Sandwiches & Salads – the division
delivered underlying revenue growth
of 7.5% on continuing revenue* 
of £446.7m (2005/06: £416.1m).
Average selling prices were 1.0%
higher, while volumes grew across
both businesses.
Continuing profit from operations* for 
the Chilled division increased by 82.0% to
£22.2m (2005/06: £12.2m). This encouraging
improvement in profitability was achieved
through a combination of growth, innovation
and cost reduction. The division also benefited
most from the reduction in corporate central
costs and pensions. The improved profitability,
together with greater control over capital
investment and working capital, delivered an
improved RONA* of 13.1% (2005/06: 6.4%).
Operating margin* improved to 5.0%
(2005/06: 2.9%). Having suffered from 
a high cost to serve in very competitive
market conditions, the division has begun 
to target efficiencies, rationalise unprofitable
products and deliver better value for 
its superior service and product quality.
While these programmes are ongoing,
the initial benefits are visible and encouraging.
The discontinued businesses – chilled Pastry
and chilled Distribution – delivered a profit
from operations* of £1.1m (2005/06: £5.5m) 
prior to disposal, on sales of £175.5m
(2005/06: £331.6m).
The Ready meals business has made initial
progress in the first year of its simplification
and profit improvement programme. It is
addressing a high cost to serve which has
reflected excessive complexity and cost 
across a fragmented product range and
manufacturing base. Additionally, this business
has experienced a long term reduction in its
share of existing customers’ trade. The Ready
meals team has focused on stabilising sales
volumes, securing new customer business,
optimising the manufacturing footprint based
around centres of excellence specialising in
individual product areas, removing non-value
added cost, and improving prices where this 
is supportable. Initial signs are encouraging.
Underlying revenues increased by 6.5% in
Ready meals, with the fourth quarter seeing
growth with all customers, regaining our
number one market position. An active
innovation programme included the
introduction of a range of nutritionally
balanced ready meals, soups and organic
vegetable accompaniments. Excellent repeat
purchase patterns allow us to demonstrate the
value we deliver to our customers and
consumers alike. At the same time, the
consolidation of ready meal production onto
the retained sites following the disposals will
allow greater efficiency, as well as improved
quality, to be delivered from a smaller asset
base. Once operating performance improves,
selective further capacity additions will be
carefully considered.
There remains much work to do within this
business, including continuing to fulfil
customer needs in a highly competitive and
unconsolidated market, but selective growth,
demand for high quality premium food and
opportunities to improve manufacturing and
supply chain efficiency, bode well for the
ongoing recovery programme.
The Sandwiches & Salads business continued
to perform strongly, building on excellent 
sales and improved operational efficiency.
Underlying revenues rose 8.1%, benefiting
from consumer requirements for convenience,
a healthier eating positioning and good
demand during the warm summer period.
With further growth as customers expand
their convenience space, investment in
selective capacity expansion will occur in 
a careful and targeted way, in order to ensure
adequate returns are achieved.
In the sandwiches market, value for money,
ingredient quality and visual perception are
key consumer requirements. Premium ranges
are also expanding and there is an increasing
drive to maximise freshness across the product
range. We continue to drive improved cost
efficiency from our key manufacturing facilities.
Good sandwich demand was complemented
by growth in both wet and prepared salads,
the former including products such as
premium pasta salads and the latter, salads 
as meal solutions. Supported by exemplary
customer service responsive to sudden
improvements in the weather, this growing
business focuses on premium products,
combining indulgence with the inherently
healthy appeal of the sector. This business also
produces ROB chilled Pizza and Sushi, with the
UK chilled pizza market overtaking the frozen
pizza market in scale and increased consumer
interest in sushi.

With strong brands and leading
positions in several markets, the
division delivered steady growth in
the year with revenue of £244.5m
(2005/06: £238.1m) and underlying
revenue up 2.6%. Our leadership 
in Pizza is supported by strong 
local positions in Fish & Vegetables.
Only the Pastry and Meat grill
categories have disappointed.
Average selling prices were 0.5% higher with
overall volumes increasing by 2.1%. Continuing
profit from operations* for the Frozen division
decreased 17.0% to £19.0m (2005/06: £22.9m).
This reflected a reduction in profitability in 
the struggling Pastry and Meat grill categories.
By contrast, a robust performance was
delivered in Pizza and Fish & Vegetables.
The difficult trading backdrop in Pastry and
Meat grills impacted the divisional operating
margin* which declined to 7.8% (2005/06:
9.6%), also reflecting the impact of increased
volumes through promotional activity, and
RONA* declined to 15.4% (2005/06: 18.1%).
Pizza continued to achieve good growth, with
revenue 7.5% higher, as the Goodfella’s brand
successfully built on its market leadership in
the UK and Irish market. The Goodfella’s brand
continued to consolidate its position, through
range extension, responding to healthier eating
trends by reducing overall fat and salt content,
removing hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVOs)
and developing a ‘lighter eat’, while continuing
to deliver superb restaurant quality products.
Solos continued to grow in the convenient,
‘single eat’ segment and was named the fastest
growing brand of 2006 by The Grocer magazine.
Leadership in Pizza was supported by the
market leading Donegal Catch brand in Fish
and the Green Isle vegetable brand. Donegal
Catch drove strong revenue growth in Ireland,
up 20%, with range extensions including
unbreaded fish fillets and recipe ideas, as
consumer demand for fish continues to grow,
reflecting its healthy attributes. Delivering
ongoing manufacturing efficiency is also key
and 2006 saw the closure of the Boyle facility
in Ireland, allowing breading operations to be
rationalised onto one site. The Green Isle brand
grew 7% within the Irish market.
Within the division, the frozen Pastry and
Meat grill businesses disappointed. Holland’s
saw continued decline in sales in the brand’s
core fish shop and frozen retail distribution
channels, which were further impacted by 
the hot summer. Retail margins were impacted
by significant promotional discounting.
Although some volume was recovered through
the successful launch of the brand into chilled
retail, margins are significantly lower in this
channel. Similarly, the own label and co-pack
pastry business suffered, as retailers and
branded producers reduced inventories.
The Meat & Meat-free business continued 
its strategy to move demand progressively
from declining sales of meat products into 
the growing meat-free arena. Since the launch
of the Grassington’s Food Co. brand in January
2006, our Meat-free market share has reached
10.8%
8
. Nevertheless, it will take time for the
Meat-free brand to fully replace the decline 
in sales and profitability in the meat grills area;
consequently we continue to support product
and brand development in the latter category.

In recent years, the Bakery division
has been a key profit generator 
for the group. However, from 
the second half of the prior year,
market conditions have been 
difficult for most of the divisional
operations and profitability 
has declined steadily.
As a result, the division was streamlined 
during the year, with the sale of three
businesses including the loss making Cakes
business. This has allowed management to
focus on stabilising the performance of the
core Biscuits business, including the key 
Fox’s brand, and to explore opportunities 
to grow the niche Puddings business, which
has year round production for the seasonal
Christmas market.
The continuing businesses experienced 
overall revenue decline to £197.3m (2005/06:
£207.8m). Underlying revenue was down 
by 5.1% in the full year, although, following 
a drop of 9.2% in the first half, this decline
decelerated in the second half to 1.8%,
as market share in the Biscuits business was
stabilised and Puddings delivered a steady
Christmas performance. Average selling 
prices were 2.1% lower, reflecting the impact 
of heavy promotion in the biscuit market,
in spite of increasing commodity prices.
Continuing profit from operations* for the
Bakery division declined by 26.4% to £17.0m
(2005/06: £23.1m). Both businesses suffered
some profit erosion, although the largest
impact was in Biscuits. Likewise, operating
margin* declined to 8.6% (2005/06: 11.1%),
impacted by a loss of volume in Biscuits,
which reduced overall efficiency due to the
high operational leverage of the business, and
the impact of increasing commodity costs.
Action is in hand to reduce costs and improve
promotional spend effectiveness. Reduced
capital investment helped limit the decline 
in RONA* to 20.4% (2005/06: 25.4%).
The discontinued businesses delivered a profit
from operations* of £0.2m (2005/06: £6.6m)
prior to disposal on revenue of £141.9m
(2005/06: £244.6m).
Biscuits performance gradually stabilised as
the year progressed, despite adverse impacts
on volume from the hot summer following 
a weak 2005/06 exit. Underlying revenue
declined by 5.9% in the year, reflecting 
a decline in Fox’s key sectors of everyday
biscuits and chocolate biscuit bars. Brand
performance in these core segments improved
during the second half and our share of these
core segments ended the year ahead of prior
year at 9.6%
13
.
The second half year saw investment 
behind the Fox’s brand, including new 
product development such as the launch 
of our Naturally Fox’s range and a new
premium range of Delicious Cookies. These
were supported by prime time TV advertising
and a packaging refresh which successfully
helped to build product trial. These initiatives
are helping to offset the impact of continued
aggressive promotional activity in the overall
market and continued increases in raw
material costs, particularly impacting flour,
cocoa and dairy products. Production
improvements at the three biscuits sites
included commissioning of a new £5m high
speed automated production line at the Batley
facility. Further small scale capital improvements
are targeted to improve cost efficiency,
coupled with overhead cost reduction 
to aid profitability. Separate management
teams now focus on three different segments
organised around our Fox’s branded all year
round products, our seasonal ranges best
known under the Fox’s Creations name, and
ROB. Each of these has different consumer,
customer and supply chain requirements.
Our Puddings business had another good
Christmas and maintained clear market
leadership in this niche sector. Continued
interest in premium products saw the launch
of a wide range of extremely high quality own
label puddings, both for lovers of traditional
recipes and for those seeking alternatives such
as nut-free or gluten-free puddings. Building
on its strong position, Christmas 2007 will 
see us test market the Matthew Walker brand.
This will create an exciting premium branded
consumer offering to sit alongside our existing
ROB range and the foodservice and export
range of Christmas puddings.

Internal estimates Capital management
Embedding a culture of cash and capital
management across the business has required
each business to assess its capital requirements.
Limited revenue growth, combined with
rationalisation of unprofitable products, has
enabled a reduced capital programme to be
delivered, at just £29.5m (2005/06: £54.0m).
While opportunities exist for selective capacity
expansion in growth markets, capital expenditure
in existing products and markets is expected
to remain at or below depreciation over the
next two years. In addition, working capital
levels have been reviewed in inventories,
accounts receivable and accounts payable,
and working capital reduced by £33.6m during
the year (2005/06: £9.7m increase). Surplus
unproductive assets were identified and 
£6.7m of cash was received, in addition 
to the business disposal programme.
The success of our approach is demonstrated
by the group’s strong ‘free cash flow’, the cash
generated by the business before business
disposals, special pension contributions,
dividends and financing/trade investment
activities. Free cash flow generated in the 
year was £83.0m (2005/06: £30.6m).
In addition, the business disposal programme
generated gross proceeds of £211.2m, ahead
of the target set in May 2006, principally in
cash on completion, with £6.7m in secured
loan notes due in August 2007. Disposal fees
totalled £9.3m. The disposals were made debt
and cash free, including adjustment against a
target working capital based on average levels,
and with the benefit of the rights to the
insurance proceeds relating to the rebuild 
of the Sheffield facility.
During the year, special pension contributions
were made, amounting to £18m relating 
to the existing agreements with the trustee 
of the principal UK scheme, £10m on disposal
of NFT and an escrow payment of £25m 
on disposal of the other businesses. A lower
dividend payment of £11.5m (2005/06:
£44.2m) resulted from the rebasing of the final
and interim dividends. Net debt was reduced
by £188.9m (2005/06: £36.8m increase).
Balance sheet, net debt & ROIC
As a result of the strong net cash flow, the
group’s ‘debt ratio’, being net debt to EBITDA
14
(calculated under ‘frozen UK GAAP’ (the
accounting system used when the group’s
current financing facilities were established)),
improved to 1.8 times (2005/06: 2.5 times).
Net debt reduced significantly to £174.2m
(2005/06: £363.1m).
The disposal of underperforming assets at a net
loss resulted in total equity declining to £121.2m
(2005/06: £152.1m).‘Return on invested capital’
(ROIC), measuring the pre-tax return on
shareholders’ invested capital
15
, declined
slightly during the year to 7.8% (2005/06:
8.4%), benefiting from lower average invested
capital as a result of the recent disposal but
reduced by the lower level of group profit.
Pensions
Within its defined benefit pension schemes,
Northern Foods has been working closely with
the trustee to increase protection of member
benefits at an affordable cost for the company
and its shareholders. Significant progress has
been made towards achieving this, as follows:
> Future service accrual – following closure
of the principal UK scheme to new
entrants in March 2005, the company 
cash contribution rate is 9.9% of payroll,
a cash cost in 2006/07 of £14.0m
(2005/06: £21.6m). The future cost 
of delivering benefits is currently under
review in light of current benefit costs 
and the scheme investment strategy;
> Past service deficit funding – the company
made £18m of previously agreed special
contributions towards funding the past
service deficit in the principal UK scheme
during 2006/07. Following completion 
of the disposal programme, the company
agreed to pay a further £35m during the
year 2006/07 and a further £22m to be
paid in June 2007. Thereafter, no further
special pension contributions are currently
anticipated or required under the
agreement
16
. This will remain subject 
to periodic review between the company 
and the trustee to assess the ongoing
impact of changes in key assumptions,
including interest rates, inflation rates,
asset performance and mortality.
As a result of these actions, the deficit 
for total group retirement benefit schemes
calculated under International Accounting
Standard (IAS) 19, reduced from £90.2m 
pre-tax (£63.7m net of tax) at 1 April 2006 
to £8.6m pre-tax (£2.1m net of tax) at 
31 March 2007. The company and the trustee 
are currently conducting a joint investment
review to identify opportunities to reduce
future volatility of the scheme funding position.
Financing and treasury management
The group has a centralised treasury function,
which operates within a policy framework
approved by the Board. The policy was
reviewed by the Board in 2006/07 and 
the Board receives a monthly update on
compliance. The principal areas of treasury
management and respective policies cover 
the management of liquidity risk, interest 
rate risk and currency risk.
Liquidity risk management ensures sufficient
debt funding is available for the group’s day 
to day needs. Board policy is to maintain
reasonable headroom of unused, committed
bank facilities in a range of maturities (at least
twelve months beyond the year end). Current
committed facilities are a 2010 £460m
revolving facility and Senior loan notes
2012–2017 US$155m and £54.3m private
placement bonds. Part of the latter is
repayable at face value in 2007 if proceeds
from the business disposals have not 
been reinvested in acquisitions or capital
investment. The facilities remain committed
and available subject to certain conditions,
which are in line with typical commercial
borrowing arrangements.The principal
conditions require sufficient coverage of 
the last twelve month EBITDA to each of
net debt and interest charge (‘covenants’),
which are tested half yearly (see debt ratio
under KPIs above).
Interest risk management balances debt
financing as a tool to improve returns
through leverage in the capital structure
with the potential for higher interest rates
to impact profits negatively. Board policy 
is to operate with fixed rate borrowings
within a range of 20% to 50% of total 
net borrowings over the medium term
(although the group may operate outside
this range in the short term, as applied 
at year end following the major business
disposals). The US private placement bonds
were raised as fixed interest debt. At the
year end, 81% of the group’s net debt was
fixed in this way. Board approval is required
for use of any interest rate derivative.
‘Interest cover’ at year end (the ratio of
EBITDA to net interest charge, measured
under ‘frozen’ UK GAAP) had improved to
6.2 times (2005/06: 6.1 times).
Currency risk management occurs at a
transactional level (for example, in purchasing
ingredients in foreign currencies) and at a
translational level (for example, in relation
to Irish operations or foreign currency debt).
Board policy is to hedge transactional
exposures using forward foreign exchange
contracts wherever material and feasible,
while translational exposures are generally
unhedged. The US private placement debt
has been hedged using currency swaps of
similar maturity (subject to a one off right
for the counterparty bank to break the swap
after seven years).
Risks and uncertainties
The operation of a public company involves
a series of risks and uncertainties across 
a range of strategic, commercial, operational
and financial areas. Northern Foods has a
robust internal control and risk management
process, as outlined in the Corporate
governance report, which is designed to
provide assurance but which cannot avoid
all risks. Below we have outlined potential
risks that could impact the company’s
performance, causing actual results to 
vary from those experienced previously 
or described in forward looking statements
within this document. These risks are
24 Performance review Northern Foods plc
14
EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation. It is calculated as profit from operations 
before restructuring items plus depreciation and amortisation
15
ROIC is calculated as adjusted profit from operations 
(being profit from operations before restructuring items for
continuing operations, adjusted to exclude the non-service
charge elements of pension costs) divided by average
invested capital (net equity adjusted to exclude retirement
benefit obligations net of deferred tax, and net debt,
together with accumulated goodwill previously written off)
16
No past service deficit contributions will be required subject
to ongoing achievement of the assumptions underpinning
the company-trustee agreement. The IAS19 deficit reported
in these accounts would have been eliminated as at 
31 March 2007 if the disposal based special pension
contributions had been completed as of that date monitored on an ongoing basis through 
the company’s risk management processes.
Additional risks and uncertainties, currently
unknown or excluded from the analysis below,
may also have an adverse material effect on 
the company.
> Customer relationships – the company
seeks to manage the risks presented by 
its consolidated customer base, and the
highly competitive environment that
characterises the industry, through its 
high service, high quality, low cost model
targeted across a portfolio of markets
where it has strong positions. This is
supported by product development
programmes and by maintaining and
developing strong robust relationships 
with customers;
> Consumer trends – exposure to changing
consumer trends can impact profitability.
The company seeks to manage these
through portfolio changes, with greater
weight towards growth trends (which
include health, convenience and indulgence),
for example, by managing new product
innovation to expand sales in these areas,
while managing the exposure to declining
market sectors. The company is working
actively with its retail customers, both
through its brands and its actions on
healthy eating (set out in the Corporate
responsibility report);
> Operational disruption – the short lead
times involved in servicing our customers
can lead to an adverse impact from
disruption of our manufacturing and
distribution facilities (for example, by fire,
health and safety failure, problems of supply,
information systems failure, workforce
action or environmental incident). This 
is managed through a process including
systems of standard operating procedure,
regulatory compliance, dedicated steering
groups, monitoring, audit, consultation 
and multiple sourcing. Insurance cover 
is maintained where appropriate but 
may not cover all risks and losses;
> New legislation, regulation and litigation 
– Northern Foods manages a range 
of regulatory requirements regarding 
the production, sale, safety, labelling,
composition/ingredients and disposal of 
its products. Compliance monitoring and
proactive initiatives seek to manage this
risk. Litigation claims and proceedings 
can have an adverse effect on the
company’s results;
> Change management, recruitment and
retention – ongoing change requires close
management attention and the company
has experience of managing such risks 
and has action plans to mitigate them,
including Board oversight and project
management processes. Failure to
implement and complete change 
can impact financial results, employee
recruitment and retention, with the latter
also subject to the availability of a suitable
pool of domestic and overseas staff.
Proactive initiatives for this are included 
in the Corporate responsibility report;
> Managing procurement costs – exposure
to price and supply fluctuations for raw
materials and services is managed by 
a central procurement function, to better
negotiate with relationship based suppliers,
agreeing forward prices where appropriate.
The company seeks to pass on costs,
where possible, to its customers through
price rises but constraints in achieving 
this can affect the company’s results;
> Food safety – appropriate product
manufacturing, storage and avoidance 
of contamination are critical. Standard
manufacturing and distribution protocols
are in place, together with proven product
recall processes for product recovery.
Widespread food scares can impact
directly through the sale of a contaminated
product or indirectly through lack of
supply or reduced consumer demand;
> Financing, pensions and taxation – 
the company has committed financing in
place, which can only be withdrawn in the
event of a breach of financing agreement,
such as covenants, when the company
might be restricted in its ability to operate
normally and could be required to dispose
of assets to pay down debt and incur
additional costs. Pension schemes could
require increases in future company funding
and pension regulation could restrict the
freedom of the company to undertake
certain corporate activities (including
disposals and return of capital to
shareholders). The company has certain 
tax exposures totalling £28.0m which are
provided for but which, in the event of 
an adverse finding by taxation authorities,
could result in a substantial payment of cash.
Key accounting judgements
Taking into account this analysis of risks and
uncertainties, the key accounting judgements
which could impact future financial
performance include the following:
> Pensions – movements in equity markets,
interest rates and life expectancy could
materially affect the level of surpluses 
and deficits in the pension schemes.
The key assumptions used to value
pension liabilities are set out in the 
notes to the financial statements;
> Tax – the group carries out tax planning
consistent with a group of its size, and
makes appropriate provision, based on 
best estimates, until tax computations 
are agreed with the tax authorities;
> Impairment – the group has reviewed the
carrying value of goodwill and fixed assets
and, from time to time, has impaired
certain fixed asset values on a value in 
use basis. Future changes in performance
or disposals could impact these values.
In addition to its key accounting judgements,
the group has significant accounting policies
for revenue recognition, foreign currencies,
property plant and equipment, intangible
assets, inventories, and derivative financial
instruments and hedge accounting, which 
are set out in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.
Basis of preparation
This financial information has been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS. The comparative
information for 2005/06 has been restated 
to reflect the impact of the business disposals
in 2006/07.
Forward looking statements
Forward looking statements are made
throughout this Annual report, including in 
the Performance review, the Report of the
directors and the Directors’ remuneration
report. These forward looking statements are
based on a number of assumptions concerning
future events and information currently
available. The user of these accounts should
not rely unduly on these forward looking
statements, which are not a guarantee of
performance and which are subject to a
number of uncertainties and other facts,
many of which are outside of the company’s
control and could cause actual events to differ
materially from those in these statements.
Although Northern Foods believes that the
expectations reflected in those forward 
looking statements are reasonable, it cannot
assure users that those expectations will prove
to be fulfilled. In addition to those factors
described under ‘Important factors’ could
cause actual results to differ materially from
our expectation, including economic and
political conditions, changes in laws, regulation
and accounting standards, customer
relationships and actions, effectiveness of
spending and marketing programmes and
unusual weather patterns. No guarantee can
be given of future results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements.
Comparative statements
In this report, Northern Foods makes 
certain statements with respect to its 
market position or its products’ or its brands’
market positions by comparisons with third
parties or their products or brands. These
statements are based on both internal 
sources and independent sources and 
are accurate to the best of the knowledge 
and belief of Northern Foods.

At Northern Foods we are committed 
to making great tasting food in a
responsible way
Corporate responsibility report
Special ‘sherpascopic’ platforms help 
employees work safely at height Northern Foods plc Corporate responsibility report 27
In 2006/07 Northern Foods made
good progress with its corporate
responsibility (CR) agenda.
We are committed to making great food in a
responsible way and our CR programme is built
around three core principles: that all activities
should be aligned with our business strategy;
that these activities form part of the company’s
approach to managing risk and reputation; and
that we comply with legislation and good
governance standards.
To fulfil that agenda, CR initiatives are managed
under three headlines:
> Delivering a trusted supply chain 
> Building a good and safe place to work
> Promoting healthy balanced lifestyles.
In 2006/07, a year in which the food industry
has been under major scrutiny, this framework
has stood us in good stead. It has helped us
develop and communicate our response to
significant issues such as the obesity debate,
consumer concerns about food provenance,
carbon emissions, food waste and skills
shortages.
It is clear that scrutiny of the food industry
will not dissipate. The Stern Review on the
Economics of Climate Change, published 
in October 2006, added urgency to the
environmental debate and in March 2007 
the government set out proposals for a 
new climate change bill. This bill sets out 
a framework for reducing carbon emissions 
to which Northern Foods, along with the 
rest of the industry, is responding.
At the same time, a growing number of
consumers are considering wider supply 
chain issues when deciding what to eat.
They are putting pressure on retailers and
manufacturers to give them answers to
questions such as ‘how healthy is my food?’,
‘where has it come from?’ and ‘has it been
made with minimal environmental impact?’.
Accordingly, in reporting on CR activity during
2006/07, we have described our key CR
initiatives, provided commentary on some of
the external drivers affecting our business and,
where possible, we have provided updates on
targets published at the start of the financial
year. Some targets are under review reflecting
the new shape of Northern Foods following
the disposal programme and this is indicated,
where appropriate, in the report.
Delivering a trusted supply chain
Northern Foods manages 
a number of initiatives under 
the trusted supply chain strand 
of its responsibility agenda.
These relate firstly to our impact 
on the environment in the key areas 
of energy, water and waste, and
secondly to our activities around
responsible sourcing.
Every year we procure over £500m of
ingredients, raw materials and services from
over 4,000 suppliers. We make food in 19
production sites and we deliver to over 1,000
supply points. By driving efficiencies across 
this supply chain, both energy costs and
carbon emissions can be reduced. Similarly,
minimising manufacturing and packaging
waste both reduces costs and environmental
impact.
Our actions reflect both our statutory
responsibilities and Northern Foods’ own
initiatives to better manage the resources 
it uses. Our responses also help us to address
one of the key consumer issues that has
emerged in the last twelve months: ‘Can you
tell me that my food has been made with
minimal impact on the environment?’ It is a
question that we, and the industry as a whole,
have to answer.
Overall we have made good progress in 
this area, as set out below. Our previously
published targets for energy, water and waste
reduction are being reviewed in light of the
business disposal programme completed in
January 2007 and Food Industry Sustainability
Strategy (FISS) targets suggested in 2006.
We await the publication by the Department
for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) 
of the FISS Champions’ Group’s work in
determining the feasibility of these targets,
the measures necessary for making progress
and the means of monitoring success.
Northern Foods has chaired the FISS
Champions’ Group on waste and has positively
contributed to the sustainability agenda.
Energy
Northern Foods has continued to meet its
obligations under the UK Climate Change Levy
Agreement. In meeting our third bi-annual
milestone target in December 2006 we have
been able to drive a steady reduction in
energy consumption since the 1999 base year.
This reduction has been achieved through
concerted energy saving efforts at site,
co-ordinated by on site energy champions.
In partnership with the Carbon Trust, we have
been working towards estimation of both the
total carbon footprint for our UK operations
and the potential for minimising individual
product specific carbon footprints. The total
carbon footprint study carried out during the
year confirmed the key contributors to our
footprint and will allow further development
of our carbon reduction strategy. On individual
product specific carbon footprints we are now
engaging with the Carbon Trust to consider,
in partnership with other food manufacturers
and retailers, the development of a single
methodology for determining product specific
contributions, as at present no such agreed
methodology exists.
Saving energy
Driving energy savings in the boiler house,
Derek Bailey is one of our on site energy
champions.
Saving energy Responsible sourcing
Our long term commitment to transparent
sourcing strategies for our materials has
helped us address consumers’ interest about
the provenance of their food. Clear policies
and processes provide tangible evidence of 
our commitment and expertise in an area
which is increasingly under the spotlight.
For example, our industry leading Farm
Assurance Code of Practice, first published in
2000, was updated in December 2006 and was
relaunched to our supplier base. It remains the
case that all products we produce are non-GM.
We also seek to source products, where
possible, from the UK and Ireland.
Our integrated farm management approach
minimises reliance on pesticides and our best
in class animal welfare code protects animals
throughout their life cycle and supports the
five basic freedoms: freedom from thirst,
hunger and malnutrition; freedom from
discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and
disease; freedom to express normal patterns of
behaviour and freedom from fear and distress.
Our commitment to SEDEX, a secure web
based system on which companies maintain
data on labour standards at their production
sites, is ongoing. We have contributed to the
development of a SEDEX risk assessment tool
to aid identification by companies of the 
most vulnerable parts of the supply chain.
The business will continue to encourage
membership of SEDEX across its major
suppliers in 2007/08.
Case study: Energy reduction
In a systematic approach to reducing
energy, it was recognised that the use 
of monitoring and targeting could help 
support efficiency gains. For example, by
installing controls in a number of chilling
units at one site, we were able to trigger 
the defrost cycle as and when needed
instead of relying on an automatically 
timed defrost cycle. Elsewhere hot water
clarifiers, used in steam generation, were
replaced with heat exchangers enabling
more efficient heating and usage of water
whilst a vacuum regeneration desiccant 
drier was installed in the compressed 
air system, resulting in a significant 
energy saving.
Water 
We have continued our programme of driving
efficient water usage through the extension 
of the application of monitoring and targeting
methodology. For example, our Carlisle ready
meals site achieved a reduction of over 24,000
cubic metres of water through a unique
metering system that controls the flow of
water to the potato blanchers. Continual real
time monitoring allowed the minimisation 
of water usage and targeting improvement
resulted in increased efficiency.
Waste 
Our overall objective is to reduce total waste,
by reducing waste going to landfill and by
increasing the amount of waste being recycled.
To achieve our ambition of diverting all waste
away from landfill, we have entered into an
agreement with Encycle LLP, a waste to energy
infrastructure initiative, for the conversion of
our non-recyclable waste into bio fuel which
will then be used to generate green electricity.
The first Encycle waste to energy plant, which
Northern Foods, and others in the food industry,
have played a major role in supporting, is
expected to ‘go live’ in the next 15 months.
Once operational, this process will allow
Northern Foods to rapidly reduce waste being
sent to landfill sites to zero in the UK.
In a further move to address the waste
agenda, Northern Foods became one of the
first three food manufacturers to sign up to
the Courtauld Commitment in November
2006. In doing so we joined forces with the
UK’s major retailers in helping deliver the
Commitment’s aims of:
> designing out packaging waste growth 
by 2008
> delivering absolute reductions in packaging
waste by March 2010
> identifying ways to tackle the problem 
of food waste.
We are currently working with the Waste
Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to
identify the opportunities for reduction that
will allow us to meet these stated aims.
Case study: Improving the segregation 
of waste 
By improving the segregation of waste,
Gunstones Bakery was able to improve
performance to the extent that over 
90% of the total waste generated is now 
diverted away from landfill. Cardboard 
and plastic waste is recycled separately
where appropriate, whilst recyclable food
waste is disposed of to a local incinerator
for energy recovery.

28 Corporate responsibility report Northern Foods plc Building a good and safe place 
to work
Northern Foods’ focus on supporting
its employees is captured in our
good and safe place to work
initiatives. These recognise our
responsibilities to our people and
address our need to attract, retain
and develop talent in an industry
characterised by skills shortages.
For us, a good place to work is a safe place 
to work and employee health and safety is
therefore at the top of our agenda. We have
focused on driving improvement in this area
and are pleased with progress to date. Our
approach is diverse, ranging from specific
initiatives to tackle issues such as working
safely at height, through to ensuring that 
our multi-cultural workforce is equipped 
with information, in the language they need,
to work safely.
In a sector characterised by a growing skills
gap we believe that a reputation for great
people management is the best way to 
attract and retain talent. We want our
employees to benefit from their work with
Northern Foods, whether they are being
encouraged to acquire a new skill on the 
shop floor, or they are a manager developing
their career. To that end we have continued
our focus on supporting learning and
development and encouraged a culture of
open communication where ideas can be
shared. We have also worked hard during the
year to support initiatives which will benefit
the wider industry, such as our sponsorship 
of the Northern Foods Foundation for Science
and Technology, a bursary scheme for students
of food science or related degree courses.
Safety & wellbeing
Reducing the accident frequency rate 
In our 2005/06 Annual report we committed
to reducing our accident frequency rate by
30% over three years and significant progress
has been made. Protecting our employees
through the delivery of a good health and
safety performance is a priority for Northern
Foods and progress in this area is the first
agenda item at the management team’s
monthly update and on the main Board
agenda. During 2006/07 Northern Foods
revisited many of its health and safety
standards. A key outcome of this review was
the introduction of a revised audit protocol
with increased focus on operational risks.
This generated detailed improvement plans
where standards were below expectation.
This emphasis on wider safety management
improvement has helped us deliver a 28%
reduction in the accident frequency rate in 
the 2006/07 financial year, well ahead of the
15% target we set, and building on a 21%
reduction in 2004/05. This is a strong result
but we believe an even greater improvement 
is achievable.
To deliver sustained improvement, all senior
personnel and those with direct operational
responsibility have specific health and safety
objectives as part of their performance
contracts and training packages have been
developed for middle level managers.
As part of the group wide focus on operational
risk reduction, several initiatives were
implemented to reduce the incidents of
process related fires. These included a review
of oven fire suppression standards, auditing on
fryer operations, and the completion of several
workshop events, at which all sites with oven
equipment were represented. This process 
was led by the chief executive. As a result 
of these initiatives, and investment in site
improvements, the group has achieved a 
near 50% reduction in process fires and 
a very robust reporting culture is now in place.
To further embed a Safety First culture into
day to day operations, internal Best Practice
Awards were successfully launched this year.
The business also achieved six Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accident awards, further
underlining the commitment to occupational
health and safety across the group.
Case study:Working safely at height
An initiative across the Sandwiches & 
Salads business unit has helped to reduce
work at height risk and ensure compliance
with the Work at Height Regulations 2005.
New sherpascopic platforms which provide
additional legs for stability and a safe work
zone were introduced to replace ladders.
Users were re-trained, and improved
inspection procedures were implemented.
As a result, there have been no accidents 
in this financial period involving employees
working at height. Employees have
responded positively to the procedures 
and a best practice model for the rest 
of the business has been created.
Learning and development
Northern Foods supported a range of initiatives
in this area during the year. In October 2006,
the company formally signed a unique multi-
union, multi-site National Learning Agreement
in which it set out its goals to promote,
support and monitor learning activities for 
all employees. Progress is being monitored
quarterly through a joint Northern Foods and
unions committee.

In January 2007, the company launched The
Northern Foods Foundation for Science &
Technology. This charitable body will provide
grants to 30 new students a year throughout
their degree course at three of Britain’s leading
food science education establishments, Leeds,
Nottingham and Reading Universities. The
scheme, which will be available to the
September 2007 intake, will raise awareness in
schools of food industry career opportunities
and enhance the number and quality of
applications to food science or related degree
courses.
Over the year, the company also worked
closely with Improve, the sector skills council
for the food and drink industry, in its efforts 
to address the skills gap.
Northern Foods also remains committed to 
the provision of learning centre resources
which provide our workforce with access to 
a wide range of basic skills training such as
English Language or IT basics. However, the
business disposal programme affected our
target, set last year, of doubling these resources
to twelve within three years. The company now
operates three centres, including one opened
during 2006/07 and we believe six operational
centres by 2008/09 is now an appropriate
target. Planning has begun for two further
centres to open in 2007/08.
Open communication
In a year of major transition, which saw
employee numbers reduce from over 20,000
to 10,700, Northern Foods has placed great
emphasis on communication, consultation 
and recognition to ensure that people have
understood the impact, or indeed, the
opportunities of change. Accordingly, open 
and regular communication has been a
characteristic of the year with key information
cascaded in a timely and consistent manner,
backed up by comprehensive support materials
such as detailed Q&As. The communications
process was further supported by the provision
of an independent advice helpline.
The company’s formal employee consultation
mechanism, The Northern Foods Forum, met
twice in the year, both at a national and
divisional level, to discuss and consult on
employee issues, whilst the local site Forums
remain an active part of the consultation
mechanism. The Divisional Forum is under
review in line with the company’s adoption 
of a business unit operating structure.
Also introduced during the year was an
induction pack for all shop floor employees,
which is translated into Polish, Portuguese 
and Urdu, which, after English, are the most
common languages spoken across the
business. This pack means that essential
messages on food safety and health and 
safety can be delivered.
Case study: Employee opinion survey
As part of a strategy to increase levels 
of employee communication and
involvement, an annual employee opinion
survey is conducted by the Sandwiches &
Salads business unit. A total of 2,000
employees were able to participate in the
2006/07 survey and the process attracted 
a response rate of 80%. With responses 
fed into the business planning process,
the survey helps the business to highlight
and respond to issues raised and build on
positives. This year, as a result of feedback,
the business unit ran a number of internal
training days for Joint Consultative
Committee members, aimed at enhancing
communication processes across the
business. Also new in 2006/07 was an
employee support counselling service 
in which volunteers were trained to work
alongside their colleagues to help resolve
any issues they may have, both inside and
outside of work.
Promoting healthy balanced
lifestyles
As one of the UK’s leading food
manufacturers, we have a
responsibility to encourage healthy
eating and to help consumers make
informed choices about the food
they eat.
Our approach in this area is also in line with
the government’s 2004 White Paper, Choosing
Health. This states that the food industry has 
a role in helping to change the UK’s eating
habits and in helping to tackle diet and 
health issues such as reduction of salt intake
and obesity.
During the year we have continued our focus
on ensuring that the food we make includes 
a wide choice of ‘healthy’ options and we are
pleased with the progress we have made.
We have also supported initiatives which help
consumers make informed choices about the
food they are eating.
Providing choice
At the beginning of the financial year we set 
a target of increasing the provision of healthier
eating options in all of our main product
categories over the next three years.
A combination of product innovation and
recipe reformulation during 2006/07 means
that Northern Foods is now able to provide
healthier eating options across all of its main
categories. This successfully builds on a
platform of 40% in 2005/06, thereby
achieving our target within one year.

Developing 
future talent  Northern Foods plc Corporate responsibility report 31
Opinions vary as to the contribution of
individual food products to a healthy diet and
a healthy balanced lifestyle. For some it means
taking ingredients out, such as reducing salt
content, removing hydrogenated vegetable oils
(HVOs) or producing low calorie versions of
classic favourites. For others, it can mean
putting goodness in, for example incorporating
‘super foods’ such as seeds, broccoli or berries
into recipes or using only organic ingredients.
We define ‘healthier’ foods as those which
offer nutritional benefits over their standard
products. We seek to provide consumers with
real options for choosing healthier alternatives,
both through innovation and through the
improvement of existing recipes. Examples of
products introduced during the year include 
a range of nutritionally balanced ready meals,
organic soups and an egg salad sandwich with
added Omega 3.
Salt reduction
Good progress on salt reduction continues,
through ongoing product reformulation across
our branded and own label ranges. We have
worked closely with the FSA since 2003 in
support of its target to reduce consumer salt
intake to 6g per day by 2010 and in March
this year we welcomed the FSA’s proposed 
self reporting framework which will allow us 
to report on reductions. Salt content is shown
on all our products to aid consumer choice.
Removal of HVOs
The company has continued with its planned
removal of HVOs. The majority of branded
products are now free from HVOs with the
remaining HVOs to be removed by September
2007. We have also worked closely with our
customers to help them achieve their own
targets for this area.
Case study: Naturally Fox’s
A range of great tasting biscuits using
simple store cupboard ingredients and
nothing else is the promise of Naturally
Fox’s. The new range of five biscuits,
including Wholemeal Y orkshire Shortbread
and Dark Chocolate and Macadamia Nut,
were successfully launched in January 
2007 to meet growing consumer 
demand for products made with natural,
wholesome ingredients with no additives 
or preservatives. The ingredients and the
recipes are detailed on the pack to 
reinforce the ‘Naturally’ positioning.
Informing choice
Helping the next generation to understand
how to eat more healthily was the driver
behind our continued sponsorship of the
PhunkyFoods programme in 2006/07.
PhunkyFoods is a curriculum based schools
programme which teaches primary school
children fundamental life skills relating to
nutrition, physical activity and food choice.
All lesson materials are written and developed
by independent registered nutritionists and
teachers and draw from a wide range of
sources including the British Nutrition
Foundation, the British Heart Foundation 
and the FSA.
As a result of Northern Foods’ funding over
the last two years, 100 schools in Yorkshire
have now taken part in the programme.
Research of the pilot in September 2006
showed that, by following the lesson plans
provided, children’s ability to identify healthier
food choices increased over a six month
period. The success of these early pilots means
that PhunkyFoods has now attracted the
support of Local Education Authorities from
across the UK.Additionally, through Northern
Foods’ mentoring, PhunkyFoods has also
attracted further food industry sponsorship,
allowing it to be rolled out nationally. It is
anticipated that over 375 schools will be
participating in the programme at the start 
of the new school year in September 2007.
To further support informed consumer choice,
the company also took steps during the year
to introduce front of pack nutritional labelling
across its branded products, a process which is
being implemented on a rolling basis over the
next two years. We continue to monitor the
debate regarding guideline daily amounts
(GDAs) and ‘traffic lights’ labelling.
Charity and community involvement
During the year the group funded a number 
of community related programmes. These
included ongoing support for PhunkyFoods 
and sponsorship of the Business in 
The Community (BITC) Rural Action Award,
which recognises companies that can
demonstrate the positive impact of their
business in rural areas. Our work with local
communities is driven primarily at site level,
while programmes such as PhunkyFoods
demonstrate how an aligned CR programme
can benefit the communities in which we
operate at a wider level. In addition to the
above, Northern Foods donated £59,600
(2005/06: £89,000) to various charities.
Conclusion
In outlining our CR framework last year, we
said that the integration of CR initiatives into
our day to day decision making would help
produce a sustainable approach to our
business that benefits all stakeholders over the
long term. In particular, many retailers have
made public commitments about CR targets
and suppliers such as ourselves will play an
important role in supporting these targets.
We believe we have made good progress
against this objective during 2006/07 both
through the initiatives outlined above and
through the active role we have played 
behind the scenes in contributing to policy
debate at government and industry level.
Our overall progress was recognised in May
2007 when Northern Foods’ approach to 
CR was recognised in the Business in the
Community ‘100 Companies that Count’
rankings, a business led benchmark of
responsible business practice.
Continued support for PhunkyFoods
Encouraging healthy eating through our
continued sponsorship of the PhunkyFoods
programme – over 375 schools are expected
to participate from September 2007.

Stefan Barden, who joined the Board in January 2006, was appointed
Chief Executive on 5 February 2007, following the resignation of Pat
O’Driscoll. Tony Illsley, who was appointed to the Board on 2 October
2006, retires and, as required by the Combined Code, offers himself for
election by shareholders at the Annual general meeting in July 2007,
being the first Annual general meeting following his appointment.
Under the company’s articles of association and the provisions of the
Combined Code directors are required to stand for re-election at the
third anniversary of their appointment. Under these provisions no
director is required to stand for re-election at this year’s Annual
general meeting.
The executive directors’ service contracts are referred to in the
Directors’ remuneration report set out on pages 40 to 51. The executive
directors’ service contracts are terminable by the company giving 
one year’s notice.
Other than service contracts, no director has a material beneficial
interest in any contract to which the company, or any of its
subsidiaries, was a party during the year.
Details of the remuneration of individual directors, and their interests
in the share capital of the company, are shown in the Directors’
remuneration report.
Indemnity of directors and officers
The company’s articles of association include provision for the
indemnity of directors, the company secretary and other officers of
the company to the extent permitted by the Companies Act 1985.
This currently permits the company to provide indemnities to cover
defence costs in civil and criminal proceedings. The director, employee
or officer would still be liable to pay damages and to repay defence
costs to the company if his/her defence was unsuccessful. During 2006
the company executed deeds of indemnity for the benefit of each
director of the company in respect of liabilities which may attach 
to them in their capacity as directors of the company or associated
companies. These provisions are qualifying third party indemnity
provisions as defined under s.310(b) of the Companies Act 1985 and
copies are available to shareholders at the company’s registered office.
Employees and employment policies
Northern Foods takes its responsibilities to its employees seriously.
The group’s policy is to provide opportunities for active participation
and personal development with the goals of motivating individuals
and helping them to enhance their skills and maximise their potential.
The group is committed to:
> Providing equality of opportunity for all existing and potential
employees. It aims to treat all of its employees fairly in every
aspect of employment.
> Ensuring that employees have access to information that enables
them to contribute and participate fully in the group’s
achievement of its objectives.
> Providing employees with clear and fair terms of employment and
competitive remuneration packages.
The company encourages involvement in the company’s performance
in a variety of ways, including senior management briefings, in-house
publications and via the company’s intranet. The philosophy of
encouraging employees to contribute to the performance of the group
is reinforced by a number of incentive schemes. This year will see the
introduction, subject to shareholder approval, of a new Savings-related
share option scheme, aimed at maximising employees’ involvement
and interest in the success of the company as a whole, through share
ownership. In addition, shareholders will also be asked to approve 
a new performance share plan.

Compliance
Northern Foods is committed to high standards of corporate
governance. The Board has overall responsibility for corporate
governance and is accountable to the company’s shareholders 
for good governance.
The directors recognise the importance of this responsibility and can
confirm that the company has complied fully throughout the year
with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance (‘the Combined Code’) published in 2003 
and the associated Turnbull Guidance, as annexed to the Listing Rules.
This section provides a current view of the company’s governance
policies and explains how the company has applied the main and
supporting principles of the Combined Code.
Directors
The Board
The Board determines the strategic direction of the company and
reviews its operating and financial position. It has a schedule of
matters specifically reserved to it, which can only be amended by 
the Board itself and which is reviewed annually.
These matters include approval of the overall group strategy and
financial policy, membership of the Board and its committees,
acquisitions and divestments, and major capital expenditure. This
schedule is available on the company’s website. All other matters
relating to the management of the company are delegated to the
Operating board within clearly defined limits of authority. The Board
monitors the performance of management and aims to ensure that
the strategy, policies and procedures adopted are not only in the long
term interest of shareholders but also meet the needs of Northern
Foods’ customers, employees, suppliers and the local communities in
which it operates. The Operating board is responsible to the Board for
developing the strategy and the overall performance of the group and
for managing the group’s businesses as defined by the Board.
The Board, chaired by Anthony Hobson, has seven directors, comprising
two executive directors and five non-executive directors. The executive
directors are Stefan Barden, who joined the company in January 2006
and was appointed Chief Executive on 5 February 2007, following the
resignation of Pat O’Driscoll; and Jez Maiden, Chief Finance Officer.
Orna G Ni-Chionna is the senior independent director. Following 
the resignation of Colin Dyer in September 2006, Tony Illsley was
appointed to the Board on 2 October 2006 as a non-executive
director. The non-executive directors possess a range of skills and
experience and bring independent judgement to bear on issues of
strategy, performance and resources that are vital to the success 
of the group.
Attendance at Board meetings and committees of the Board
There were eight Board meetings held during the year. The chairman
held two separate meetings with the non-executive directors without
the executive directors being present. These discussions covered Board
related issues including Board structure and succession planning. The
non-executive directors also met once without the chairman present
to appraise his performance. The Board holds meetings in London 
and Leeds.
The following table shows the number of meetings of the Board,
audit, remuneration and nomination committees held during the year,
and the number of meetings attended by each director. The directors

Senior executives below Board level are periodically invited to attend
Board meetings to make presentations on their areas of responsibility.
The chairman is not a member of the remuneration committee but
attends by invitation.
Chairman and chief executive
There is a clear, written division of responsibility between the chairman
and the chief executive. The chairman is responsible for leadership of 
the Board, setting the agenda and ensuring its effectiveness. He is also
responsible for ensuring that the directors receive accurate, timely and
clear information, and for effective communication with shareholders.
The chairman’s other significant commitments and any changes during
the year, and up to the publication of this report, are detailed in his
biography on page 32. The chief executive is responsible for operating 
the business and implementing the Board’s strategies and is supported
in these matters by the Operating board.
Board balance and independence
The company complies with the requirement of the Combined Code
that there should be a balance of executive and non-executives such
that no one individual has unrestricted powers of decision. There is 
a succession plan, approved by the Board, to ensure continual review 
of the balance of skills and experience.
The Board uses criteria to assist in arriving at its decision that the
non-executive directors are independent. These include:
> a deep appreciation of the group’s business and activities so 
that a thorough evaluation of information received can be made
> objective decision making after debate
> objective challenge of management
> a clear and consistent approach demonstrating that he/she has the
good of the group uppermost in his/her behaviour when challenging
others and defending his/her viewpoints.
Following the annual review of their independence, the Board is of the
opinion that all of the current non-executive directors are independent
by these criteria and are free from any relationship or circumstance
which could affect, or appear to affect, their independent judgement.
Influence is balanced within the Board by virtue of the strong
independent elements of a non-executive senior independent director
and a further three non-executive directors whose skills and business
experience are invaluable in constructively challenging and developing
the group’s strategy and direction. The Board was further enhanced by
Corporate governance report 36 Corporate governance report Northern Foods plc
the appointment of Tony Illsley who brings a wealth of knowledge in 
a variety of roles and relevant experience, having held senior positions
within the food industry, including at Pepsico and Walkers Snack Foods.
Appointments to the Board
Appointments to the Board are the responsibility of the full Board on
the recommendation of the nomination committee. There is a formal,
rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new
directors which is made on merit and against objective criteria. In
October 2006, Tony Illsley was appointed to the Board following such
a process and using external consultants, Odgers Ray & Berndtson.
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors
are available for inspection at the company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and at the Annual general meeting 
(for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting).
Information and professional development
All directors have unlimited access to information regarding the
company, the advice and services of the company secretary, whose
appointment and removal requires the approval of the Board, and 
they may obtain external advice, as required, at the expense of 
the company.
In the week prior to each scheduled Board meeting, the chairman and
the company secretary ensure that the directors receive all relevant
papers so that they are properly appraised of the company’s current
performance and information on any other matter which is referred 
to the Board for consideration.
There is a comprehensive induction process, tailored to the needs of
the individual directors, which is arranged by the company secretary.
This includes meetings with management and external advisors so
that the new director receives an appreciation of the activities of 
the group, the key drivers of business performance and the significant
current issues. Visits to operational sites are encouraged. The training
also covers the role of the Board and its committees, corporate
governance practices and procedures, and the duties, responsibilities
and liabilities of a director of a public listed company. Following his
appointment, Tony Illsley has undertaken such an induction process.
Additional training is arranged, by the company secretary, on a group
or individual basis as needs arise; for example when a non-executive
director is appointed to a Board committee.
During the year, in order to assist them in their duties, the directors
received presentations on the developments in financial reporting
since March 2006, changes to the regulatory regime following the
implementation of the Transparency Directive in January 2007 and 
the Companies Act 2006 and on new ABI guidelines issued in
December 2006.
Board performance evaluation
The performance of the Board, the chairman and its principal
committees is evaluated annually. As in the previous two years, this
has taken the form of obtaining completed detailed questionnaires
(which have been revised this year) from all Board members, analysing
the responses, and providing opportunity for directors to comment 
on any issues not covered directly by the questionnaire. The results 
of the evaluation were considered by the Board. It was agreed that 
the results confirmed the effectiveness of each directors’ contribution,
each committee, and of the Board as a whole.
Orna G Ni-Chionna, senior independent director, has analysed
responses to a pro-forma detailed questionnaire designed to evaluate
the performance of the chairman. The results of the survey were
discussed with the executive and non-executive directors when 
the chairman was not present. The outcome of these discussions
confirmed that the performance of the chairman continued 
to be effective and he provides strong leadership to the Board.
The chairman assesses the independence and performance of 
the non-executive directors, after consultations with the executive
directors and the senior independent director.
Re-election of directors
Under the company’s articles of association all directors are subject 
to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their
appointment and then to re-election at intervals of no more than
three years. Retiring directors may offer themselves for re-election.
Tony Illsley, appointed to the Board on 2 October 2006, as required,
puts himself forward for election by shareholders at the Annual general
meeting. His biographical details are contained on page 32 of the 
Annual report and in the explanatory notes contained in the Notice 
of meeting. No other director is required to stand for re-election under
the provisions of the company’s articles of association at this year’s
Annual general meeting.
Remuneration
Remuneration is covered by the Remuneration report on pages 40 
to 51 and the work of the remuneration committee is set out on 
page 38 of this report.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Board is required to present a balanced and understandable
assessment of the company’s position and prospects. This
responsibility extends to annual and half year reports and other 
price sensitive reports. The company is also required for the first time
to present interim management statements covering the first and 
third quarter trading for the financial year 2007/08 following
implementation of the Transparency Directive in January 2007.
The Board is satisfied that it has met its obligations in presenting 
a balanced and clear assessment of the company’s position and
prospects. This assessment is primarily provided in the Chairman’s
review, the Chief executive’s review and the Performance review
contained in this report. The statements of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the financial statements are set out on page 52.
Internal control and risk management
During the year under review and up to the date of approval of the
Annual report, the company has complied with principle C2 of the
Combined Code, that the Board should maintain a sound system 
of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the
company’s assets, this system is regularly reviewed by the Board 
and is prepared in accordance with revised guidance.
The Board has overall responsibility for the company’s system of
internal controls which covers all aspects of the business. Key risks 
are identified in the Performance review on pages 8 to 25 and include
strategic, commercial, operational and financial risks. These risks 
are managed through a comprehensive internal control and risk
management system as outlined below.
Underlying this process is the Board’s aim to safeguard shareholders’
investments and the company’s assets. It also aims to ensure that
proper accounting records are maintained, and that the financial
information used within the business and for publication is accurate,
reliable and fairly presents the financial position of the company and
results of its business operations.
Corporate governance report
continued Northern Foods plc Corporate governance report 37
In line with the Turnbull Report, Internal Control: Guidance for Directors
on the Combined Code (Turnbull), the directors regularly review the
effectiveness of the group’s system of controls and risk management.
The directors believe that the company maintains an effective,
embedded system of internal controls and complies with Turnbull.
The system is designed to provide reasonable (not absolute) assurance
of effective operations and compliance with laws and regulations.
As part of its review process, the Board considers new and emerging
risks and also considers key external business drivers such as market
trends and competitive activity. The Board also plays an important 
role in driving continuous improvement in the management of risk 
by encouraging the sharing of best practice across the business.
A summary of the principal control structure and processes in place
across the group is set out below.
Control structure and processes
The Board assesses key areas of internal control and risk management
and sets policy accordingly. It tasks each business unit to identify and
document each significant risk and to implement appropriate controls
for that risk. The Board also requires the business units to manage,
monitor and report on the effectiveness of these controls.
The business units are supported by appropriate corporate
management resource which provides the technical skills and expertise
needed to supplement the business units’ own resource and to provide
overall assurance for the major areas of risk. There are clearly defined
lines of authority and accountability.
Both the internal and external auditors have reviewed the overall
approach adopted by the company towards its risk management
activities.
The audit committee oversees both internal and external audit
procedures and monitors response to any significant control 
issues raised.
Roles and responsibilities for each area of identified risk are outlined
below:
> Strategic delivery: through its regular meetings the Board
assesses performance against objectives. In doing so it considers
performance data and also considers external dynamics, such as
shifting customer and consumer trends that could affect the delivery
of these objectives.
> Health and safety: a central team provides professional advice on
best practice, audits health and safety procedures, and coordinates 
the investigation of all major reportable incidents.
A dedicated risk management steering group identifies and
manages fire risk through site audit and implementation 
of recommendations and standards, together with sharing 
of best practice.
> T alent management and human resources: a central team
ensures the adequacy of existing management and plans
succession through its organisational capability review.
> Food safety and quality: the technical services team assesses
and approves raw material suppliers, audits the quality management
systems in the group, provides guidance on compliance with food
related and environmental legislation, sets technical standards and
offers expertise on a wide range of food science and technology.
That expertise and governance is reflected in the independent
accreditation of the team as UKAS Certification Body No.199 
and UKAS Testing Laboratory No. 2087.
> Asset management and engineering: the engineering team
approves contractors in respect of building, engineering and
professional services. It also provides an expert consultancy 
for the acquisition, management and disposal of physical assets,
as well as assessing and approving suppliers of capital equipment
and non-saleable revenue items.
> Procurement: the central procurement team identifies and
manages key suppliers on a group wide basis.
> Finance: each business unit prepares detailed annual budgets and
strategic plans, which are reviewed and updated on a regular basis.
Weekly and monthly accounts are prepared for each business unit
and performance is monitored against the original budget, and
updated forecasts. The group’s chief executive and chief finance
officer meet on a formal basis each month to review the
performance of each business unit with its managing director.
During the year, a capital committee met every two months 
to set policy, to oversee the capital expenditure planning and
budgeting process, and to approve expenditure up to an agreed
level delegated by the full Board.
The internal audit function reviews the standard of internal
financial control and the accuracy of financial reporting through 
a rolling cycle of audit visits under a programme of activity
approved by the audit committee.
The central finance function obtains advice and provides adequate
insurance cover for major losses with appropriate levels of
deductibles, through a group programme with external insurance
brokers. This cover is reviewed and negotiated annually.
Financial and treasury management oversee the principal areas 
of treasury risk including liquidity, interest and currency risk.
> Information technology: the Information Services function
provides appropriate infrastructure and back up services to 
the business.
> Legal: provides and obtains advice on a full range of legal issues
across the group, and ensures good title to properties and
intangible assets.
> Corporate responsibility: there are effective systems in place 
for evaluating and managing social, environmental and ethical
(SEE) risks. Further information is provided in the Corporate
responsibility report on pages 26 to 31.
Review process 
An ongoing review process includes an assessment of internal controls,
in particular, internal financial controls. It also includes reports from
the internal audit function as well as the external auditor on matters
identified in the course of its statutory audit work.
Business units and specialist functions report by exception on any
matters arising during the year to the monthly performance review
meetings. The results of the formal half yearly reviews are taken
forward to the audit committee.
The Board is therefore able to confirm that there is an ongoing process
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by
the group, that it has been in place for the year under review and up
to the date of approval of these financial statements, and that it is
regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with Turnbull guidance. 38 Corporate governance report Northern Foods plc
Audit committee and auditors
A principle of the Combined Code is that the Board should establish
formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it should
apply the financial reporting and internal control principles and for
maintaining an appropriate relationship with the external auditors,
Deloitte & Touche LLP. These responsibilities are delegated to and are
discharged by the audit committee whose work is described below.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The Board attaches great importance to maintaining good
relationships with all shareholders, who are kept informed of
significant company developments. Presentations are made of 
the half year and full year results, briefings are given to analysts,
and other meetings to discuss company direction are held with
institutional shareholders on a regular basis.
The chief executive and chief finance officer are closely involved in
investor relations and report back to the Board the views of major
shareholders. Investor meetings are arranged through the company’s
broker, UBS Investment Bank, and others. The chairman, the senior
independent director and other non-executive directors are available
to meet major shareholders whenever necessary, and the chairman
regularly did so during the year.
All material information reported to the regulatory news services 
is simultaneously published on the company’s website affording 
all shareholders full access to company announcements. In addition,
the group has introduced an electronic communication facility to
allow shareholders to receive information more quickly and in a
manner more convenient for them. The company is also proposing 
to take advantage of provisions under the Companies Act 2006 which
allow the use of the website to communicate with shareholders as 
an alternative to receiving hard copies. A resolution to this effect will 
be proposed at the company’s Annual general meeting and further
information is contained in the Notice of meeting.
Constructive use of the Annual general meeting
The Board regards the Annual general meeting as an opportunity 
to communicate directly with private investors. Wherever possible,
all directors attend the Annual general meeting. Tony Illsley will not 
be attending this year’s Annual general meeting due to a previous
engagement, to which he was committed prior to his appointment.
A presentation is made at the Annual general meeting to facilitate
greater awareness of the group’s activities. Shareholders are invited to
ask questions and are able to meet the directors informally. Separate
resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate issue and the
number of proxy votes cast for and against each resolution, as well 
as the number of votes withheld, are announced to the meeting
following voting by a show of hands. A poll would be called on any
resolution where it was appropriate or required. The company offers 
an electronic voting facility to investors.
Details of proxy voting by shareholders, including votes withheld, are
announced through the London Stock Exchange and are also placed
on the company’s website.
Board committees
Each Board committee has written terms of reference which define
the role and responsibilities of the committees and are reviewed
annually. The terms of reference of each committee are available from
the company secretary or can be viewed on the company’s website.
Appointments to the committees are made on the recommendation
of the nomination committee but subject to Board approval. Those 
to the audit committee are for periods of up to three years, normally
extendable by no more than two additional three year periods.
Appointments to the remuneration committee and nomination
committee are reviewed annually as part of the Board performance
review. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Board
committees.

times. When the need for a new director is identified, the criteria in
respect of the background and competencies of potential candidates
are approved by the Board before the search is started. This specification
is drawn up after consideration of the skills, knowledge and experience
of existing Board members. The committee also ensures that candidates
have enough time available to devote to the position. Search consultants
have been used extensively in the identification of new Board
appointments and during the year Tony Illsley was recruited using 
the services of Odgers Ray & Berndtson.
The committee also reviews annually the need for succession
planning, particularly for the chairman, chief executive and other 
key Board positions, and makes recommendations accordingly.

No director is permitted to be present when his/her own remuneration
is being discussed, nor to vote on his/her own remuneration.
The committee also determines the nature and scale of incentive
performance arrangements that encourage enhanced performance 
and which reward individuals in a fair and responsible manner for their
contribution to the success of the business. In setting the remuneration
policy for executive directors and senior managers, the committee 
also takes into account the reward policies for managers generally.
An integral part of the role of the remuneration committee is to carry
out an appraisal of the performance of the chief executive.

The main duties of the committee, set out in its terms of reference,
are to:
> make recommendations on the appointment and remuneration 
of external auditors and to monitor their performance
> approve and monitor the policy for non-audit services provided 
by the external auditors to ensure that the independence of the
auditors is not compromised
> review and advise the Board on the company’s financial statements,
its accounting policies and on the control and mitigation of its
financial and business risks
> review the nature and scope of the work to be performed by the
external and internal auditors, the results of their audit work and 
of the response of management
> review and advise the Board on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control environment, including its ‘whistleblowing’ procedures.
D T Nish took over the chair of the committee on his appointment 
to the Board. He is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Scotland and is Group Finance Director of Standard Life plc. He is
considered to have the recent and relevant financial experience required
by the provisions of the Combined Code. The other members of 
the committee have a wide range of business experience, which 
is evidenced by their biographical summaries on page 32.
Meetings
The committee invites executive directors, management, external and
internal auditors to attend meetings as it considers appropriate for the
matters being discussed.
Work of the committee
During 2006/07, the audit committee met on four occasions and
reported its conclusions to the Board. It met privately with the internal
and external auditors without executives present. It also met with
senior managers and executive directors.
The committee discharged its obligations in respect of 2006/07 
as follows:
Financial reporting
During the year the committee reviewed the half year and annual
financial statements. The committee received a report from the
external auditors setting out the accounting or judgemental issues
which required its attention. The auditors’ reports were based on 
a full audit (Annual report) and a high level review (Interim report)
respectively.
The committee has also advised the Board on accounting policies,
disclosure and controls.
Internal controls and risk management 
The committee considers reports at the half year and year end from
internal audit on the operation of, and issues arising from, the group’s
internal control procedures, together with observations from the
external auditors. The committee monitored the effectiveness of the
group’s risk management process, which considers the key risks, both
financial and non-financial, facing the group and the effectiveness of
the group’s controls to manage and reduce the impact of those risks.
Internal audit
It is the role of internal audit to advise management and the Board 
on the extent to which systems of internal control are effective and 
to provide independent and objective assurance that the processes 
by which significant risks are identified, assessed and managed 
are appropriate and effectively applied. The internal audit plan,
which covers the scope, authority and resources of the function,
is determined through a structured process of risk assessment and 
is approved by the audit committee.
The nature and scope of the work of the internal audit team 
was reviewed and approved, the reports of results received and 
the responses of management considered. The plan set out at the
beginning of the year was achieved and the outcome of the work was
in line with expectations. To ensure the independence of the internal
audit function, the senior internal auditor has the right of direct access
to the chair of the committee and to the chairman of the Board:
this right was not invoked in the year under review.
External audit
The committee reviews auditor independence annually. The committee
also monitors the cost effectiveness and objectivity of the external
auditors. To assist in ensuring independence, the appointment of 
the senior audit partner on the audit is rotated every five years. The
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors is considered
in line with the committee’s terms of reference. During the year,
the auditors also provided tax advice, amongst other services. In
addition, the auditors report annually on the actions taken to comply
with professional and regulatory requirements and on current best
practice required to ensure independence.
Operating board 
During the year, in line with the simplification of the business, the
Northern Foods’ Operating board was restructured. It now comprises
the chief executive, the chief finance officer and five managing
directors with responsibility for the individual business units.
Going concern 
The directors are satisfied that the company has adequate resources
to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the
financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007 have
been prepared on the going concern basis.

Company Secretary
30 May 2007 40 Directors’ remuneration report Northern Foods plc
1 Introduction
The Board has prepared this report in accordance with the requirements
of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets 
the relevant requirements of the Revised Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the Combined
Code’) and is prepared for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007.
This report to shareholders sets out the remuneration policy and
explains the policy under which the executive and non-executive
directors and management team were remunerated for the year 
ended 31 March 2007. It also provides details of the salary, incentives,
share and pension interests of all the directors for the year and,
subject to ongoing review by the remuneration committee, outlines
remuneration policy for the forthcoming and subsequent years.
A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual
general meeting of the company.
The auditors are required to report to the company’s members 
on the audited element of the Directors’ remuneration report and 
to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
Unaudited information
The information in this following section of the remuneration report
has not been audited by the company’s external auditors.
2 Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is a committee of the Board and 
the members, all of whom are independent, during the year were 
O G Ni-Chionna (Chair), R J S Bell, D T Nish, C Dyer (resigned 6 September
2006) and A K Illsley (appointed 2 October 2006). Details of attendance 
for the committee are provided in the Corporate governance report on
page 35.At the invitation of the chair of the committee, the chief executive
and corporate services director attend committee meetings to provide
background and context on matters relating to executive remuneration.
The corporate services director attended the committee meetings until 
he left the company in March 2007; S Brooker, Group HR Director, now
attends the committee’s meetings.A J Hobson, Chairman of the Board,
is not a member but attends the committee by invitation.The secretary 
to the committee is C Williams, Company Secretary.
The role of the remuneration committee is to approve, implement and
keep under review the remuneration policy and practice of the group,
and specifically to:
> agree with the Board the framework and the value of the remuneration
of the chairman, executive directors and senior managers
> agree the terms of the executive directors’ and company secretary’s
service contracts and remuneration
> determine the nature and scale of short and long term
performance incentive arrangements that encourage enhanced
performance and reward individuals in a fair and reasonable
manner for their contribution to the success of the group.
In undertaking this role, the committee considers remuneration 
policy and rewards across the company and not just at Board level.
The committee has been formally delegated the authority, by the
Board, to establish policy in respect of all terms of employment for
executive directors. No director plays a part in any discussion about
his or her remuneration.
The Board believes that a properly constituted remuneration committee
is essential in establishing a system of remuneration which clearly
aligns the interests of executive directors and senior managers 
with those of shareholders, and links incentives to improvements 
in the absolute performance and relative competitiveness of the
company. The committee’s terms of reference are published on 
the company’s website.
3 Advisers to the remuneration committee
Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Ltd, who are the appointed scheme 
Actuary to the principal Northern Foods UK pension schemes,
continued to provide advice to the committee on matters of
remuneration policy during the year.
The committee also retained A M Judes as its independent adviser
throughout 2006. For the period from 1 January 2006 to 5 July 2006,
he was retained under a letter of engagement between the committee
and his then employer, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow. Thereafter the
committee appointed A M Judes through his own consultancy,
Strategic Remuneration. The committee retained DLA Piper UK LLP 
as solicitors to advise on matters relating to directors’ contracts and
specific employment law advice. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
(who have provided no other services to the company during the year),
were retained to provide advice relating to the development of its
long term incentive arrangements. The committee appointed Pinsent
Masons to design a new Savings-related share option scheme.
The committee identified no conflict in the nature of the services
provided by its advisers. The terms of business of Hewitt Bacon &
Woodrow, Strategic Remuneration, DLA Piper UK LLP, New Bridge
Street Consultants LLP, and Pinsent Masons are available from the
company secretary.
In determining executive directors’ remuneration for the year,
and in considering proposals for the future, the committee consulted 
A J Hobson, Chairman; P A O’Driscoll, Chief Executive until her
resignation from the Board on 1 February 2007; and S Barden,
who was appointed as Chief Executive on 5 February 2007.
4 Remuneration policy
To deliver its objective of creating real increases in shareholder value
relative to its peers, the company needs to attract and retain the 
most capable and committed people and create the right employment
conditions and reward opportunities for them.
The company’s remuneration policy is designed to support the
recruitment, motivation and retention of such high calibre employees.
Remuneration is considered within the context of the sector of which
the company is a part, and the wider FTSE 350 community where 
the company competes for talent. The sector includes companies
operating as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies.
The committee reviewed the company’s remuneration policy in
2004/05. This review, detailed in the Annual report for that year,
set the objectives such that the remuneration of executive directors
and senior executives should be directly linked to the delivery 
of strategic objectives which are closely aligned with the interests 
of shareholders. The policy includes the introduction of differentiated
rewards, according to performance, based on the introduction of
rigorous individual performance measures against the delivery of these
strategic objectives. This practice of linking pay to performance was
implemented for the first time in 2005/06 and continued in 2006/07.
In spring 2007, the committee again reviewed elements of its strategy
and, following consultation with major shareholders, together with the
ABI and NAPF, is submitting to shareholders for approval a new long
term incentive arrangement, a performance share plan. The proposals
are set out below and in Appendix 1 to the Notice of meeting.
The policy continues to be to reward employees at the relevant 
mid-market level for on target performance, whilst delivering
competitive rewards for outstanding performers, with a package
designed to align their interests with those of shareholders. In the 
case of senior executives, this includes a significant proportion of total
remuneration being dependent upon individual and group performance.
As salaries were determined prior to Northern Foods’ restructuring,
the company’s market dimensions have changed and consequently,
the committee is reviewing the salary structure. The policy for
directors is described in more detail below.
Directors’ remuneration report Northern Foods plc Directors’ remuneration report 41
5 Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three
years with the expectation that, subject to satisfactory performance,
they will be invited to serve a second and third three year term.
The dates of the chairman’s and current non-executive directors’
letters of engagement, the dates on which their appointment took
effect and the current expiry dates are as follows:
Date of Effective date Expiry date
commencement of current term of current term
R J S Bell 1 Sep 05 1 Sept 05 31 Aug 08
A J Hobson 28 May 02 28 May 05 27 May 08
A K Illsley 2 Oct 06 2 Oct 06 1 Oct 09
O G Ni-Chionna 28 May 02 28 May 05 27 May 08
D T Nish 1 Jul 05 1 Jul 05 30 Jun 08
The appointments of the chairman and the non-executive directors
may be terminated by the company on six months’ notice and by 
the chairman and the non-executive directors on three months’ notice.
No compensation is payable by the company on termination of an
appointment with due notice.
Fees for the non-executive directors are reviewed regularly on the
recommendation of the executive directors and are then subject to
approval by the Board. Fees are set with regard to a range of external
information for equivalent companies.There are no other emoluments for
non-executive directors, except where the company meets authorised
expenses incurred on the company’s activities. They are not eligible 
for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of 
the company’s annual or long term incentive schemes. Fees were last
increased as of 1 October 2005. The next assessment in June 2007 
will determine the fees to be paid.
6 Remuneration policy for executive directors
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that the company’s
executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions
to the group’s performance. The committee’s policy is to offer
differentiated remuneration packages, dependent upon performance,
which are capable of attracting, retaining and motivating executive
directors of high calibre, particularly during a time of change. The
approach is designed to ensure that the company is managed effectively
to the benefit of shareholders and will create real increases in
shareholder value.
The committee also takes account of, and seeks to align this remuneration
with, management remuneration throughout Northern Foods. The
committee continues to aim for a structured and balanced remuneration
package by looking at each element of reward, as well as the package
as a whole.
The committee believes that a significant proportion of the total
remuneration of a director should be performance related. Accordingly,
a rigorous approach has been adopted to the assessment of individual
performance, facilitating differentiation in awards whereby significant
emphasis is placed upon the individual’s contribution to the group’s
overall performance. This is to ensure that the remuneration package
for executive directors is aligned closely with shareholder interests.
The four main components of the ongoing remuneration package 
for executive directors and senior management in 2007/08 are:
> basic annual salary, targeted at market median, but it is recognised
that it may be necessary to pay above this to attract sufficiently
high calibre executives
> an annual incentive plan, based upon the delivery of annual
operating plans for the group and individual strategic objectives
described in performance contracts
> participation in long term incentive plans based upon the
performance of the group and the individual 
> pension and other benefits.
The balance of the fixed and variable pay at current value for 2007/08,
exclusive of pension benefits and assuming that the new Performance
share plan (PSP) is approved by shareholders, is illustrated below 
for the two executive directors. The table is a theoretical model and
assumes that on target group performance is achieved for short term
incentives and the director’s individual performance, and that long
term incentives are valued at an expected value of 55% of the initial
value at the time of grant. It also ignores the value of S Barden’s
matching shares as that was a one off arrangement negotiated 
on his promotion.
Basic salary Annual bonus Long term
as a proportion as a proportion incentives as a

J K Maiden On target 41.0 25.0 34.0
Maximum 28.5 28.5 43.0
6.1 Salary
Salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually, taking into account
information from independent sources for comparable roles in the
industry and in other selected quoted companies. Reviews also reflect
the individual’s responsibilities, performance and development, and the
group’s performance. Basic salary is the only pensionable remuneration.
The executive directors’ salaries effective as at 1 April 2007 are:
Basic salary as at 1 April 2007
S Barden £450,000
J KMaiden £317,000
For J K Maiden, this represents an increase of 3% reflecting inflation.
For S Barden the increase is higher reflecting the change in his role 
and is considered to be no higher than a market median level for his
new role and was set at a lower level than that of his predecessor. 42 Directors’ remuneration report Northern Foods plc
6.2 Annual incentive plan
The remuneration committee believes that achieving annual
performance targets is a high priority for the executive directors.
Incentive targets for executive directors are set each year by the
committee to take account of current business plans.
The annual incentive plan drives differentiation in the level of award
based upon the individual’s contribution to group performance. The
target incentive for an executive director is 60% of basic salary for on
target performance. In the case of exceptional individual performance
and group results significantly above expectations, the incentive
payment increases up to a maximum of 100% of basic salary.
Under the annual incentive plan, 80% of annual bonus opportunity 
is linked to specific financial targets, including targets for profit from
operations and profit before tax, both measured before restructuring
items. The other 20% is directly related to the committee’s
assessment of the directors’ individual performance against their
personal performance contract, set at the start of the financial year,
which contains six individual performance targets. These are
considered appropriately stretching by the committee.
Of any annual incentive earned in 2006/07, 20% will be paid as
deferred shares through the company’s Share bonus plan. Shares
acquired through the Share bonus plan are purchased in the market
and held in trust for the executive for a period of three years. These
shares will be forfeited should the executive leave prior to the third
anniversary, unless exceptional conditions prevail. During this retention
period the participants will be entitled to dividends on the shares and
to instruct the trustee how to vote.
In determining the annual bonus payments for executive directors,
the committee considered the scale of the restructuring accomplished
during the year; the shareholder value added; and the results of each
division, and the group as a whole, against the achievements of the
targets that had been set at the beginning of the year (as recalibrated
to reflect restructuring).
In reviewing performance against these targets for 2006/07, the
committee believes that these executives met the targets set. These
include profit (in relation to continuing operations), as discussed in 
the Highlights and Performance review within this Annual report. Further,
the committee is satisfied that other individual performance measures
were exceeded. Profit was chosen as the target for the year because 
it was felt to be an appropriate measure of stabilisation and recovery.
The targets set for 2007/08 are made up of financial, business and
individual performance measures. The financial element includes 
group profit performance. The business element is related to specific
targets for group profitability and a number of commercially sensitive
strategic objectives for each individual and the executive team.
The performance targets selected are considered appropriately
stretching by the committee.
6.3 Long term incentive share plans
The company’s long term incentive policy has been developed to
reflect market practice and to provide long term management focus
and motivation. The committee believes that a significant element of
executive remuneration should be linked to the delivery of long term
returns for shareholders.
Previously, long term incentives have been provided to executive
directors in the form of share options and performance shares. While
the committee acknowledges that option schemes can be successful
in certain circumstances, as part of the company’s regular ongoing
incentive arrangements they are currently considered inappropriate.
The committee also notes that option schemes are now falling out 
of favour in the market generally for many reasons (for example,
accounting and share usage inefficiencies and the lack of a clear link
between performance and reward). At the same time, the company’s
existing Long term incentive plan (LTIP), which was introduced in 
July 1997, will shortly expire and it is therefore proposed, subject 
to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual general meeting,
that the LTIP will be replaced with the PSP in which executive directors,
other senior executives and senior managers (of up to approximately
80 participants in total) will participate. This will be the only long term
incentive used on an annual basis. The executive share option plan 
will be retained for use in exceptional circumstances, for example,
on recruitment. A summary of the rationale behind the introduction 
of the PSP is set out in 6.3.3, with full details of its principal terms
contained in the Notice of meeting.
6.3.1 Executive share option plan 2004
Participation in the company’s executive share option plan is at the
discretion of the committee. The plan comprises an Inland Revenue
approved section and an unapproved section. Options are generally
exercisable in the seven year period following the third anniversary 
of grant and before the tenth anniversary, provided that the executive
remains in employment and subject to satisfaction of the performance
condition. Should an employee leave the organisation by virtue of
redundancy or retirement, the requirement under the performance
condition remains in place. Company performance is measured on 
a pro-rated basis to assess the extent to which it has been met.
The performance condition for awards requires that, for grants with 
a market value of up to one times salary, the real growth in adjusted
earnings per share is greater than 3% per annum over the three year
performance period before the options can be exercised. In the event
that the committee makes grants with a market value of greater than
one times salary, the proportion of the award above this level that 
will vest is assessed by reference to a vesting scale detailed below;
> 4% real growth in earnings per share: allocations between 
100–149% of salary vest
> 5% real growth in earnings per share: allocations between 
150–199% of salary vest
> 6% real growth in earnings per share: allocations at 200% 
of salary vest.
The performance will be assessed by comparing the adjusted earnings
per share growth to the growth in the Retail Price Index (RPI) over 
the three year performance period. If the performance condition 
is not met at the end of three years there is no facility for retesting.
6.3.2 Long term incentive plan 1997
Under the LTIP, the committee awarded shares in the company to
senior management conditional upon the achievement of corporate
performance targets over a fixed period of three years.
Vesting of the LTIP is triggered by achieving two independent sets 
of performance conditions, with 50% of the vesting conditional upon
each set as follows:
> a measure of the company’s relative market performance as
assessed by growth in total shareholder return (TSR) against a
selected group of comparable companies from the constituents 
of the FTSE Food Producers Index; and,
> a return on capital measure, used as an absolute measure of
company performance. The committee determined return on capital
as a strategic priority for realising growth in shareholder value.
Directors’ remuneration report
continued Northern Foods plc Directors’ remuneration report 43
6.3.2.1 Total shareholder return
Vesting of 50% of the LTIP is triggered by comparing the growth 
in TSR, in terms of share price growth and dividends, to that of the 
TSR of the companies comprising a selected group of comparable
companies from the FTSE Food Producers All Share Index.
The committee selected relative TSR, as a measure that reflects
corporate performance relative to companies with similar
characteristics and subject to similar market conditions.
The comparable group companies chosen by the remuneration
committee for the award in July 2006 were:
Arla Foods plc RHM PLC
Cranswick plc Robert Wiseman Dairies plc
Dairy Crest plc Uniq plc
Premier Foods plc
The proportion of the award that will vest is assessed by reference to 
a vesting scale. If the group’s performance is ranked below the median,
this part of the conditional award will lapse. Where the company 
is placed at the median or above, the maximum number of shares
available for vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis with
20% of the conditional award being available when the company is
placed at the median and the maximum of 50% of the award being
available where the company is placed in the upper quartile.
6.3.2.2 Return on invested capital 
The proportion of the award that will vest is assessed by reference 
to a vesting scale. Potential vesting of this proportion of the LTIP 
is triggered by the achievement of a minimum growth in return on
capital of 100 basis points over three years, measured against a base
year. If the minimum target is not achieved this part of the conditional
award will lapse.
The maximum number of shares available for vesting will be calculated
on a straight line basis with 7.5% of the conditional award being
available if the company achieves growth of 100 basis points, and a
maximum of 50% of the award being available where the company
achieves growth of 200 basis points.
For the purpose of determining any reward, return on invested capital
(ROIC) is defined as profit from operations before restructuring items,
adjusted to exclude the non-service charge element of pension costs,
divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated
as net equity adjusted to exclude retirement benefit obligations net 
of deferred tax, and net debt, together with accumulated goodwill
previously written off.
In response to any significant events, including material trading 
events, the committee may at its discretion amend the performance
conditions to reflect these changes.
Shares awarded under the LTIP are retained in trust on behalf of the
participants for a further two years. During this retention period the
participants will be entitled to dividends on the shares and to instruct
the nominee how to vote. At the end of the retention period, the
shares will be transferred to employees from the Northern Foods
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT).
6.3.3 Performance share plan 2007 
The proposed introduction of the PSP is the result of a review 
of the group’s senior executive incentive strategy that has been
undertaken recently by the committee, following the appointment of
a new chief executive. The committee considered that this represented
an appropriate time to review the incentive arrangements for the
senior executives (including the executive directors); and to ensure
that the long term incentives were in line with current best practice,
as well as an efficient use of company resources in terms of cost and
share dilution.
Full details of the principal terms of the PSP are set out in Appendix 1
to the Notice of meeting. Subject to shareholder approval, the initial
awards will be granted shortly after the Annual general meeting 
(and annually thereafter), will normally vest three years after grant,
subject to ongoing employment and the satisfaction of pre-set
performance conditions.
In terms of quantum, participants may be granted annual awards 
over shares in the company worth no more than 200% of base salary.
In practice, the committee intends to operate within a limit of 150%
of salary for the initial awards made under the PSP for executive
directors with a lower limit applying to other participants.
The committee believes that the performance conditions for the 
PSP align the interests of senior executives with those of shareholders.
The benefits available to senior management participating in the PSP
will only accrue to them when the company has delivered significant
benefits to shareholders over a three year period. Accordingly, the
committee has decided that awards will vest three years after grant,
subject to the extent to which demanding performance conditions
have been achieved by the end of a single three year period.
Two performance conditions will determine the vesting of awards.
These will be based on growth in the company’s ROIC and its TSR
performance. Each will determine the vesting of one half of each award.
6.3.3.1 Return on invested capital 
The proportion of the award that will vest is assessed by reference 
to a vesting scale, as follows:
Percentage of the total number
Growth in ROIC over the of performance shares under
performance period an award that will vest 
Less than 100 basis points 0%
100 basis points 7.5%
Between 100 basis points Straight line vesting between
and 200 basis points 7.5%–50%
200 basis points or more 50%
As under the current LTIP, for the purpose of determining any reward,
ROIC is defined as profit from operations before restructuring items,
adjusted to exclude the non-service charge element of pension costs,
divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital is
calculated as net equity adjusted to exclude retirement benefit
obligations net of deferred tax, and net debt, together with
accumulated goodwill previously written off. 44 Directors’ remuneration report Northern Foods plc
In response to any significant events, including material trading 
events, the committee may at its discretion amend the performance
conditions to reflect these changes. In addition, the ROIC element will
only vest if the committee is satisfied that the investment level over
the performance period was appropriate for ensuring the business’
long term growth.
The base ROIC for measuring performance for the first awards 
under the PSP will be set at a higher level than the group achieved 
as a whole, reflecting the ROIC achieved last year by the ongoing
businesses in the group, in order to ensure that the targets are 
suitably challenging.
6.3.3.2 Total shareholder return
In order to focus executives on delivering outstanding returns to
shareholders, the committee has decided to set the TSR targets in
terms of improvement measured from the company’s share price
averaged over the three months immediately prior to the beginning 
of the 2007/08 financial year. The targets for the first awards under
the PSP are as follows:
Growth in TSR Percentage of the total number
at the end of the of performance shares under
performance period an award that will vest 
Less than 30% growth (from Nil
an effective base of £1.24 this 
is equivalent to a share price 
plus dividends of £1.61)
30% growth 7.5%
Between 30% growth and Straight line vesting between
80% growth 7.5% and 50% 
Growth of 80% or more 50%
(equivalent to a share price 
plus dividends of £2.23 or more)
The TSR will be calculated using the closing return indices over the
final three months of the performance period.
In addition, the TSR element will only vest to the extent that the
committee is satisfied that the company’s TSR over the period is
reflective of the underlying financial performance of the company.
Awards vest on a change of control or cessation of employment under
‘good leaver’ provisions, subject to the performance conditions having
been met, and are normally reduced to reflect the shortened
performance period.
As the implementation of this proposal requires the consent of the
company’s shareholders, the relevant resolution seeking that consent
is set out in the Notice of meeting. No awards under the company’s
existing long term incentive arrangements have yet been granted in
2007/08. Provided that the required resolutions are duly passed by 
the company’s shareholders, the first set of awards under the PSP 
will be granted in July 2007 immediately following the Annual general
meeting. No further awards will be made under the company’s 
long term incentive plans or the DSBP, although in exceptional
circumstances, such as recruitment, shares may be awarded under 
the Executive share option plan.
6.3.4 Award of matching shares to S Barden
As part of the terms of his recruitment as chief executive, the
committee offered S Barden the opportunity to commit to hold 
shares in the company worth up to 100% of his salary and in return
receive an award of matching shares of up to three shares for every
one share purchased. The matching award will be granted pursuant to 
the exemption from the need for prior shareholder approval contained 
in Listing Rule 9.4.2. The matching award has yet to be granted due 
to regulatory restrictions. The matching award will be non-pensionable
and non-transferable (other than on death). Half of the matching
award will vest on the third anniversary of grant with the other half
vesting on the fourth anniversary of grant to the extent that the
performance conditions are met and providing S Barden retains the
purchased shares and remains employed by the group. To the extent
that the award vests the relevant shares will be delivered free of
charge but, to the extent that it does not vest (in part or in full),
it will lapse.
The performance conditions attached to the matching award will be
the same as those that will apply to the initial PSP awards proposed to 
be granted shortly after the Annual general meeting as set out above,
save that threshold vesting of the TSR element will not occur unless
the company achieves growth in TSR of 35% over the relevant period.
The committee feels that, since this award is a one off, the targets
applying to vesting at threshold should be more demanding.
If S Barden ceases employment with the group before the fourth
anniversary of grant the outstanding part of the matching award will
lapse, unless he leaves in certain ‘good leaver’ situations. In this event,
it will vest on cessation (or, if the committee so decides, the normal
vesting dates) to the extent the performance condition is met at the
relevant time. This would be subject to time pro-rating to reflect the
period of time between the date of grant and the date of cessation
(rounded up to the next whole year), relative to the period of three
years, unless the committee concludes in its discretion that it is not
appropriate to apply the pro-rata reduction. On a change of control 
or winding up of the company, the award will vest early to the extent
that the performance conditions are met at that time and, again
unless the committee decides otherwise, subject to time pro-rating 
to reflect the period between the grant date and the relevant event 
on the basis set out above. The award may also vest on this basis in
the event of a demerger, special dividend or other similar event which,
in the committee’s opinion, materially affects the price of the
company’s shares.
The award will not, unless the committee decides otherwise,
vest on an internal reorganisation, but will instead be exchanged 
for an equivalent award over shares in the new holding company.
The award will not confer any shareholder rights on S Barden until 
it vests, except that he will be entitled to a payment (in cash and/or
shares, at the discretion of the committee) shortly after vesting to
reflect the dividends that would have been paid on those shares,
assuming such dividends were re-invested in further shares at the
closing price on the relevant ex-dividend dates. In the event of any
variation of the company’s share capital or any other event which
materially affects the price of the company’s shares, the award may 
be adjusted as the committee sees fit. The terms of the award may 
be amended in such manner as he and the committee may agree,
provided that amendments to his benefit may only be made with 
the prior consent of shareholders. The committee confirms that 
the matching award was considered to be necessary to facilitate 
his recruitment as chief executive and to honour commitments 
made to him on such recruitment.

6.4 Deferred share plans 
6.4.1 Deferred share bonus plan 2004
A deferred share plan was established in January 2004 to facilitate 
the recruitment of P A O’Driscoll as chief executive. Participation in
the scheme was restricted to P A O’Driscoll and on 29 March 2004 
an award of 81,453 shares was made in recognition of benefits
accrued at Shell Europe. These shares were not subject to a performance
condition and were transferred to her on 29 March 2007, following a
three year retention period.
6.4.2 Deferred share bonus plan 2006
A strategic restructuring plan was agreed by the Board, and comprised
specific structural changes linked to qualitative and financial milestones.
To support that strategy, a one off Deferred share bonus plan (DSBP)
was introduced in June 2006 so as to incentivise and retain the key
talent necessary to drive the specific performance improvements
required. This DSBP provided approximately 40 senior executives 
with an award of shares with a value up to 100% of base salary,
at the prevailing market price of 81.75 pence per share on the date 
of award. These shares will be satisfied by the transfer of existing
shares held in trust after the vesting date in July 2009.
Performance was to be assessed against key milestones over the
twelve month period to 31 May 2007. These four key milestones
related to improving free cash flow and reducing net debt as at 
1 April 2006 by £125m, reducing the run rate for central costs by 
£12 million per annum compared to 2005/06 and the successful
resolution of the pension deficit. These milestones have all been
achieved, or are expected to be achieved. In addition, share awards 
for the executive directors and the then Operating board were also
subject to a share price condition such that a minimum share price of
92 pence per share needed to be attained for five consecutive business
days over the twelve month performance period. This minimum price
condition was met. If the share price over a period of five consecutive
business days during the performance period was at least 120 pence
per share, the requirement to satisfy the key milestones would not
apply. This condition was also met.
The executives now need to remain in the employment of the group
for a further two year period before any share awards vest. During 
this time, awards will be subject to normal forfeiture policies. However,
awards may be retained under ‘good leaver’ provisions, although 
shares will not transfer until July 2009. Awards include a dividend
equivalent which will be paid on vesting. No further awards can be
made under this plan.
6.5 Savings-related share option scheme
The company is also proposing a HM Revenue & Customs approved
Savings-related share option scheme for all employees at the
forthcoming Annual general meeting. The sharesave scheme will 
be open to all employees (subject to eligibility), including executive
directors. Options are normally exercisable after either three, five or
seven years from the date of grant. The price at which options would
be offered is not less than 80% of the middle market price on the dealing
day immediately preceding the date of invitation. In accordance with
HM Revenue & Customs requirements, there are limits on the number
of shares which can be issued under the scheme. In addition, the use
of new issue shares under the scheme is limited to 10% of the issued
share capital of the company, taking account of shares issued or to 
be issued under any other company employee share schemes over 
the previous ten year period. The group intends to invite employees 
to participate in the scheme following the announcement of the 
half year results. Further details are set out in Appendix 2 of the
Notice of meeting.
6.6 Executive shareholding
Executives’ interest in both relative and absolute share price
performance is important, and this is facilitated by share schemes 
and the encouragement to build a significant personal shareholding 
in the company.
The company has introduced a policy requiring the executive directors
to build a significant level of shareholding. It is the view of the
committee that the act of building and maintaining a substantial
shareholding in the company creates a strong alignment of interest
between shareholders and executives.
6.6.1 Minimum shareholding requirements
Subject to the approval of the PSP at the forthcoming Annual general
meeting, the minimum shareholding requirements are detailed below:
> 300% of basic salary for the chief executive
> 200% of basic salary for other executive directors.
The executive would retain all shares acquired through share option
plans, long term incentive plans or deferred share plans (other than
those sold to meet income tax and NIC liabilities) until the required
minimum shareholding is achieved.
The number/value of shares required as the target will be fixed for 
a year. No purchases are required to respond to share price falls.
6.7 Benefits
In addition to basic salary all the executive directors receive certain
benefits, principally a car or car allowance, private medical insurance
and a pension.
6.7.1 Pensions
Until her departure from the company, P A O’Driscoll remained a
member of the Northern Foods Pension Scheme. Current executive
directors are members of the Northern Foods Pension Builder scheme
‘Pension Builder’. Their dependants are eligible for dependants’ pensions
and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
For all employees, including the executive directors, appointed after 
22 March 2005, the pension arrangements provided by Pension Builder
for pension on retirement at age 65 are based upon a career average
accrual of either:
> 1.25% of annual salary per annum revalued, before retirement,
by inflation up to 5.0%, with an employee contribution of 6.0%; or
> 1.0% of annual salary per annum revalued, before retirement, by
inflation up to 5.0%, with an employee contribution of 4.5%.
This scheme has an optional salary sacrifice arrangement. No other
payments to directors are pensionable.
Following the removal of the pension’s earnings cap and the
introduction of the lifetime allowance under the Finance Act 2004,
with effect from 6 April 2006, the company provides executives who
hold pension benefits in excess of the lifetime allowance with the
following options:
> Continue to accrue pension under Pension Builder subject to the
recovery charge; or
> A cash alternative, paid on a monthly basis, reflecting the company’s
long term contribution rate to Pension Builder. The cash alternative
for executive directors who are members of Pension Builder will be
10% of basic salary. 46 Directors’ remuneration report Northern Foods plc
6.8 Additional directorships
Executive directors are encouraged to hold one non-executive
directorship in a listed business in a non-competing sector. Fees 
for such directorships are retained by the executive director.
Currently, the executive directors do not hold any such directorships.
6.9 Directors’ contracts
It is the company’s policy that executive directors should have 
secure agreements, providing for a maximum of one year’s notice.
The contract of J K Maiden is, and that of P A O’Driscoll was, subject 
to one year’s notice by either party. S Barden’s contract is terminable
upon six months notice by him, one year’s notice by the company.
In the event of early termination, the contract of J K Maiden provides,
and that of P A O’Driscoll provided, for compensation up to a maximum
basic salary, company car, private medical insurance, outstanding holiday
and pension for the notice period. In the event of early termination,
the contract of S Barden provides for compensation up to a maximum 
of basic salary, car allowance, private medical insurance and outstanding
holiday. Pension benefits are not included in the payment.
The details of the contracts are summarised in the table below:

Resigned 1 February 2007
To protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,
the executive directors’ contracts contain restrictive covenants,
the principal terms of which prevent the executive directors:
> undertaking work for direct competitors, either during their
employment with the company or within six months, nine months 
in the case of S Barden, of their employment terminating, without 
the express permission of the Board
> enticing away from the group individuals or customers with whom 
the executive directors had dealt in the twelve months prior to
termination 
> enticing away from the group or employing senior or middle 
managers from within the business with whom the executive 
directors had direct contact or knowledge in the twelve months 
prior to termination.
P A O’Driscoll resigned from the Board on 1 February 2007 but 
remained employed by the company and continued to receive salary 
and benefits until 30 April 2007. The Board agreed that she would not
have to work the full period of her notice and, in accordance with the
agreed terms of her cessation of employment, she received a payment 
of £316,367 (equivalent to six months salary and pension) in May 2007.
In the event that she has not secured new employment, on or before 
1 November 2007, she will be entitled to receive a further payment 
of £158,183 (equivalent to three months salary and pension). All of 
the above amounts are subject to deduction of income tax and national
insurance contributions.
In addition, she received a payment of £25,000 as a severance payment.
This payment is not subject to income tax or national insurance.
She will continue to enjoy the use of a company car and receive 
private medical benefits until 1 February 2008, or the date she obtains
alternative employment (if earlier). In order to assist with finding new
employment, she will receive outplacement assistance up to a value 
of £10,000.
In accordance with the rules of the Executive share option scheme 
1994 and the company’s Share option plan 1998, she will be able to
exercise any outstanding share options previously awarded to her until
30 October 2007. The award of 81,453 shares made under the Deferred
share plan on 29 March 2004 was transferred to her on 29 March 2007.
The shares granted under these three schemes were awarded on
recruitment and in recognition of benefits accrued at Shell Europe and
were not subject to a performance condition. All shares awarded under
the company’s Share option plan 2004, the LTIP, and the DSBP lapsed 
on the cessation of her employment on 30 April 2007.
7 Performance graph
In accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies
Act 1985, the graph shows the company’s five year performance
measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index
also measured by TSR.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected as an appropriate comparison because
it represents a broad equity market index, of which Northern Foods is 
a constituent.
TSR measures share price growth with any dividends deemed to be
reinvested gross on the ex-dividend date. The TSR shown is based on 
daily spot prices.

Notes to T able 3
Note 1
The company provides executive directors who are members of Pension Builder with a pension, which is payable at age 65. The accrual rates and
member contributions for the scheme are set out in 6.7.1. Death in service cover is a lump sum of three times annual earnings. On the death of 
a director or a retired director, a spouse’s pension of 50% would be payable.
Early retirement may be granted with the consent of the company and the trustee of the scheme from age 55 but benefits are reduced by 
4% per annum for ages 55 up to 64 years. Once in payment, pensions are increased in line with Retail Price Index inflation up to a ceiling 
of 2.5% per annum. The trustee, with the consent of the company, has discretion to apply such greater increase as it considers appropriate.
Note 2
The company provided executive directors who were members of the Northern Foods Pension Scheme with a pension, which is payable at age 60,
equal to two thirds base salary, reduced where service to age 60 is less than 20 years. This Scheme is no longer applicable to any of the current
executive directors.
Note 3
The accrued pension at 31 March 2007 is the pension which the director would have been entitled to receive based on completed pensionable
service to 31 March 2007, payable from normal pension date (age 60 or 65 as appropriate) and subject to revaluation increases between leaving
and retirement.
Note 4
The transfer values are based on the accrued pensions at 1 April 2006 and at 31 March 2007 and are calculated as at 1 April 2006 and at 
31 March 2007 respectively based on actuarial factors. The transfer values are the lump sums which would have been paid to another pension
scheme for the benefit of the director if he/she left service at the respective dates. A transfer value cannot be paid to a director personally.

30 May 2007 52 Statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation to the financial statements Northern Foods plc
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with 
the auditors’ responsibilities set out in their report, is made with a
view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of
the directors and of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the
financial statements. The directors are required to prepare financial
statements for the group in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). Company law requires the directors 
to prepare such financial statements in accordance with IFRS,
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements
present fairly for each financial period, the company’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and
Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances,
a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable
International Financial Reporting Standards. The directors are also
required to:
> properly select and apply accounting policies;
> present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
> provide additional disclosures when compliance with specific
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The directors consider that in preparing the financial statements the
company and the group have used appropriate accounting policies,
consistently applied and supported by reasonable and accounting
judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which
they consider to be applicable have been followed. The directors are
also responsible for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation 
of a directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report which 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The 2007 financial statements will be published on the company’s
website (in addition to the paper version). The directors are responsible
for the maintenance and integrity of this electronic version of the
financial statements to the same extent as for the paper version.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation 
to the financial statements Northern Foods plc Independent auditors’ report – Group financial statements 53
To the members of Northern Foods plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Northern Foods plc
for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007 which comprise the
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated balance sheet,
the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated statement 
of recognised income and expense, the Consolidated statement of
changes in equity, the Reconciliation of net cash flow to movements 
in net debt and the related notes 1 to 38. These group financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies 
set out therein.
The Corporate governance report and the Directors’ remuneration
report are included in the individual company Annual report of
Northern Foods plc for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007. We have
reported separately on the individual company financial statements 
of Northern Foods plc for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007 and 
on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report included 
in the individual company Annual report that is described as having 
been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and 
the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union are set out in the Statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view, whether the group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also
report to you whether, in our opinion, the information given in the
Report of the directors is consistent with the group financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding directors’ transactions 
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance report reflects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual report for 
the above 52 weeks as described in the contents section and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited group financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any further information outside the Annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the group
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the group financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of its loss 
for the 52 weeks then ended;
> the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation; and
> the information given in the Report of the directors is consistent
with the group financial statements.

Notes: An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website,
including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether any changes may have
occurred to the financial statements since first published. These matters are the responsibility 
of the directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 General information
Northern Foods plc (Northern Foods) is a company incorporated 
in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address 
of the registered office is included within the Company information
section. The nature of the group’s operations and its principal
activities are set out in the segmental reporting note and in 
the Performance review.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
the group operates. Overseas operations are included in accordance
with the accounting policies.
2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These financial
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted
by the European Union and therefore the group financial statements
comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards
(IAS) Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Northern Foods’ management considers the following to be the 
most important accounting policies for the group. In applying these
accounting policies, management makes certain judgements and
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the period end date and the reported revenues and expenses
during the financial year. The financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with the group’s accounting policies described below.
Key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty 
Taking into account this analysis of risks and uncertainties, the key
accounting judgements which could impact future finance
performance include the following:
Pensions – movements in equity markets, interest rates and life
expectancy could materially affect the level of surpluses and deficits
in the pension schemes. The key assumptions used to value pension
liabilities are set out in the notes to the financial statements;
Tax – the group carries out tax planning consistent with a group 
of its size, and makes appropriate provision, based on best estimates,
until tax computations are agreed with the taxation authorities;
Impairment – the group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill
and fixed assets and, from time to time, has impaired certain fixed
asset values on a value in use basis. Future changes in performance 
or disposals could impact this value.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the company and entities controlled by the company
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March 2007, together known as 
the group. Control is achieved where the company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a
subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency
of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net
assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the
Consolidated income statement during the period of any acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries and businesses acquired or disposed of
during the period are included in the Consolidated income statement
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date 
of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with
those used by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
Disposal groups
Disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower
of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount
will be recovered primarily through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale
is highly probable and the disposal group is available for immediate
sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to 
the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and
other sales related taxes.
(a) Sales of goods
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title 
has passed.
(b) Sales of services
Sales of services are recognised on completion of the service.
(c) Finance income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable,
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount.
Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency
The individual financial statements of each group company are
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial
position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling,
which is the functional currency of the company, and the presentation
currency for the consolidated financial statements.
(b) Transactions and balances
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies,
transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded 
at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on 
the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of
monetary items are included in net profit or loss for the period. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity
and are translated at the closing rate.
(c) Group companies
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are
classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or an expense
in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease
involve the substantial transfer of all the risks and rewards of ownership
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group
at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned
between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so 
as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income,
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which 
case they are capitalised in accordance with the group’s general
policy on borrowing costs (see below).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on 
a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating
lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit or loss for the
period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are
taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where 
the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference,
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow 
all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
charged or credited to the income statement, except where it relates
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities, and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority, and the group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or
supply of goods, or for administrative purposes are stated in the
balance sheet at historical cost or deemed cost less depreciation.
Historical cost includes the expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the items. Deemed cost includes surpluses
arising on the revaluation of certain properties to their fair values
prior to the date of transition to IFRS. Land is not depreciated.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item 
will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to 
the income statement during the financial period in which they 
are incurred.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any
recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees which 
are capitalised in accordance with the group’s accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready
for their intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation 
of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line
method, on the following bases:
Property 20–50 years
(or over the remaining life of the lease if shorter)
Plant and equipment 5–15 years
Motor vehicles 4–10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter,
over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the
disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference
between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of
acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill
which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss
and is not subsequently reversed.
Northern Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 59 2 Significant accounting policies continued
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) amount subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under 
UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
(b) Computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant
or equipment is classified as an intangible asset and is held on the
balance sheet at cost. These costs are amortised over their estimated
useful lives of ten years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss 
(if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using a post tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money,
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less
than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised
as an expense immediately.
With the exception of goodwill, where an impairment loss
subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so
that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs
and those overheads that have been incurred bringing the inventories
to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call
with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on
the balance sheet.
Retirement benefit costs
(a) Pension obligations
The group operates a number of defined benefit retirement benefit
schemes. A defined benefit scheme is one where the amount of
pension benefit an employee will receive on retirement is dependent
on age, years of service and compensation.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing
benefits is determined using the Projected unit credit method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which
they occur. They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented
in the statement of recognised income and expense. All pension
movements that go to the income statement are included within
operating expenses.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the
fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation
is limited to the past service cost, plus the present value of the
available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the
benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight
line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
(b) Post retirement healthcare
The group provides post retirement healthcare benefits to eligible
retired employees. An employee is eligible if granted the benefit and 
if retirement occurred on or before 31 March 1999. Employees who
were granted the benefit, but retired after 31 March 1999, will not
receive this benefit in retirement. Post 31 March 1999, the benefit
was not granted to any employees.
The expected cost of this benefit has been computed using an
accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension
schemes. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience
adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised 
in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside
profit and loss and presented in the statement of recognised income
and expense. These obligations are valued annually by independent
qualified actuaries.
Financial instruments:
(a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts.
(b) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their
nominal value.
(c) Trading investments
The trading investments are available for sale financial assets and are
valued at fair value at the balance sheet date. Any gains and losses
arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss 
for the period.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue
costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss using 
the Effective interest rate method. They are added to the carrying
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled 
in the period in which they arise.
60 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Northern Foods plc
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The
group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap
contracts to hedge these exposures. The group does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the group’s policies
approved by the Board of directors, which provides written principles
on the use of financial derivatives. Further information on currency
and interest rate management is provided in the Performance review.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised
directly in equity. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in
the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment 
or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or 
a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the
associated gains or losses on the derivative that had been previously
recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the
asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of 
an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in
the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item
affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the
hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedging transaction is no
longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised
in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The company has cross currency interest rate swaps to provide 
a cash flow hedge against currency and interest rate movements 
on the US$155.0m Senior loan notes 2012-2017.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at 
the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Share based payments
The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share based
payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has
been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November
2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The group issues equity settled share based payments to certain
employees. Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair
value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions)
at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of
the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight
line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-
market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Government grants
Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to
deferred income and are released to profit over the expected useful
lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments. Grants of 
a revenue nature are credited to the income statement so as to
match them with the expenditure to which they relate.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Accounting standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of approval of these financial statements the following
standards and interpretations, considered relevant to the group,
were in issue but not yet effective and have not been applied in 
these financial statements:
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and
interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the
financial statements of the group, except for additional disclosures on
capital and financial instruments and operating segments when the
relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or
after 1 January 2007.
Non-GAAP measures
Definitions of non-GAAP measures used by Northern Foods are
shown below:
(a) Net debt
Net debt is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore 
be comparable with other similarly titled non-IFRS debt measures
reported by other companies. The group adopts this measure because
it is used in calculating the banking covenants. It is also the measure
used for internal debt analysis. In addition, the net debt balance
provides an indication of the net borrowings on which the company
is required to pay interest.
(b) Underlying revenue
Underlying revenue excludes the impact of currency rate changes,
product categories no longer manufactured and discontinued operations.
(c) Restructuring items
Items which relate to significant restructuring events and the impact
of the fire in the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007 are presented 
as a separate column within their relevant Consolidated income
statement category. Presentation of these items in a separate column
helps to provide a better indication of the group’s underlying business
performance. Restructuring items include costs or income associated
with the restructuring of businesses, gains or losses on the disposal 
of businesses and asset and financial instruments impairments and
gains arising from the group’s restructuring activities.

Restructuring items from continuing operations comprise primarily £4.5m in respect of central cost reduction initiatives including Information
Services (IS) outsourcing and headcount reduction, and £1.1m relating to the rationalisation of breading facilities in the Frozen division. The
restructuring charge in the Frozen division is net of a gain on sale of land which was used to fund the restructuring.
Restructuring items from discontinued operations include a net gain of £19.0m in respect of the asset reinstatement following the fire in 
the Speciality bread category, offset by a charge of £15.2m in respect of the simplification of chilled Pastry and a charge of £1.4m relating 
to the exit from the cream cake market. The net charge in respect of the chilled Pastry category primarily relates to the closure of Trafford Park
Bakery and includes a £10.0m asset impairment which is partly offset by a £5.0m reduction in a previous impairment of other operations in 
this category.
The loss on sale of discontinued operations relates to the disposal of the trade and assets of NFT Distribution and the statutory entity of the
Speciality bread company and the trade and assets of the chilled Pastry, Cakes and Flour milling businesses. Further information is disclosed 
in note 11.
Items which relate to significant restructuring events and the impact of the fire in the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007 are presented as a
separate column within their relevant Consolidated income statement category. Presentation of these items in a separate column helps to
provide a better indication of the group’s underlying business performance. Restructuring items include costs or income associated with the

the acquirer.
On 22 November 2006, the group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of its Speciality bread, chilled Pastry, Cakes and Flour milling
businesses (together called ‘the Assets’). The disposal was completed on 13 January 2007, on which date control of the statutory entity 
of the Speciality bread company (Fletchers Bakeries Limited) and the trade and assets of all other businesses passed on to the acquirer.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business
combination. The CGUs have been defined as the operating business to which the goodwill relates. The carrying amount of goodwill has been
allocated as follows:
2007 2006
£m £m
Solway Foods 30.1 30.1
Fletchers – 17.2
Green Isle 14.9 15.2
Park Cakes – 2.9
45.0 65.4
The disposals of goodwill relate to the sale of the Assets on 13 January 2007. For further details see note 11.
The group tests for impairment of goodwill at least annually.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations 
are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management
estimates discount rates using the group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and
extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector. The growth rate used is not more than
3.0% (2005/06: not more than 3.0%) and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is the group’s post tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.0% (2005/06: 7.0%).
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows.

At the period end, the group had entered into contractual commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment amounting to 
£1.6m (2005/06: £3.0m).
The carrying amount of the group’s leasehold property includes an amount of £nil (2005/06: £0.9m) in respect of assets held under finance leases.
Impairment – Discontinued operations 
A net £5.0m impairment charge was incurred during the period relating to discontinued operations. As part of its business review, management
identified impairment losses of £10.0m relating to the closure of the Trafford Park Bakery. This impairment was partly offset by a £5.0m
reduction in a previous impairment of other operations within the chilled Pastry category. The impaired assets have been sold during the period
as part of the sale of the Assets therefore the impairment has been included within discontinued operations.
The impairment losses identified represent the difference between the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and their recoverable
amount. The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations unless management is committed to closing or selling the
business. If the value of the business is to be recovered through sale or closure then the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices
and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using the group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and
extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector. The growth rate used is not more than
3.0% (2005/06: not more than 3.0%) and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is the group’s post tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.0% (2005/06: 7.0%).
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows.

The average credit period taken for trade receivables is 39 days (2005/06: 41 days).
The loan note is deferred consideration on the disposal of the trade and assets of NFT Distribution during the period. Interest is accruing at 
a variable rate. The loan note is repayable in full by the purchaser on or before 11 August 2007. Further information about the disposal is given 
in note 11.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value. The directors consider the
maximum credit risk at the balance sheet date is equivalent to the carrying value of trade and other receivables.
21 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less 
and bank overdrafts. The directors consider that the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
22 Credit risk 
The group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trading investments.
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for
doubtful trade receivables, estimated by the group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic
environment. The group’s top five customers, all leading UK retailers, represent more than 75% of the group’s revenue. These customers have
favourable credit ratings and consequently reduce the credit risk for the group’s overall trade receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds and
derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating
agencies. The amount written off in respect of credit risk was £0.3m (2005/06: £0.1m).

At the period end the group had available £375.0m (2005/06: £190.0m) of undrawn committed facilities on the revolving credit facility 2010 
and £14.6m bank overdrafts (2005/06: £18.8m), in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
Currency exposure
The group operates primarily in the UK with a functional currency of sterling. The functional currency of the overseas companies is euros,
giving rise to foreign currency exposure. The average and closing rates used in the accounts to translate euros to sterling were ¤1.464 = £1 
and ¤1.474 = £1 respectively (2005/06: ¤1.466 = £1 and ¤1.433 = £1 respectively).
26 Financing
Bank overdrafts
All bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured and repayable on demand, and are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow
interest rate risk. The interest rate on bank overdrafts is 1.0% (2005/06: 1.0%) above the Bank of England base rate.
Revolving credit facility 2010
The group holds a five year syndicated revolving credit facility of £460.0m. At the period end, the amounts due under the facility were £85.0m
(2005/06: £270.0m). The amount drawn down is repayable in periods of up to one year but is capable of being immediately refinanced as part
of the committed revolving credit facility 2010. The rate of interest fluctuates in line with market rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow
interest rate risk.
Senior loan notes 2012-2017
The company has approximately £142.7m of senior guaranteed loan notes in the US Private Placement debt market. Notes are in both US dollars
(USD) ($155.0m) and pounds sterling (£54.3m). The notes are fixed rate and unsecured. Part of the Senior loan notes 2012-2017 will be repayable
at face value during 2007/08 to the extent that a proportion of the proceeds from the business disposals have not been reinvested in acquisitions
or capital investment.
The maturity profile of the Senior loan notes 2012-2017 is as follows:
Tranche Maturity Amount (m) Rate
Series A December 2012 $35.0 5.63%
Series B December 2015 $82.5 5.77%
Series C December 2017 $37.5 5.87%
Series D December 2012 £28.5 5.47%
Series E December 2015 £25.8 5.47%
All US dollar cash flows are hedged using cross currency swaps. Northern Foods will receive each 20 December and 20 June (the bond interest
payment dates) fixed USD sufficient to fully cover interest due to holders of the USD denominated bonds, in exchange for payment of fixed pounds
sterling on the same date. The weighted average interest rate payable in pounds sterling by the company is approximately 5.5%. Additionally, the
swap contracts provide for an exchange of the principal amounts at maturity at the same rate of exchange as the initial principal was translated
(£1 = US$1.752).
Loan notes
The loan notes were all redeemed during the period (2005/06: £0.2m).The loan notes bore interest at 1.0% below the base rate, and could be
redeemed at amounts of £20,000 or multiples thereof at their nominal principal amount half yearly on 30 June and 31 December each year.
Loan notes not previously redeemed would have been redeemed at their nominal amount on 30 June 2008.

27 Derivative financial instruments 
Cross currency interest rate swaps
The company has cross currency interest rate swaps to provide a cash flow hedge against currency and interest rate movements on the
US$155.0m loan notes. Swap contracts with nominal value of US$155.0m (£88.5m) have fixed sterling interest payments at an average rate 
of 5.5% for periods up to 2017 and have fixed USD interest receipts at an average rate of 5.76%. As at the period end, swaps had a negative 
fair value of £6.5m (2005/06: £1.6m).
Other currency derivatives
From time to time the group has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exchange rate exposure. The instruments
purchased are denominated in euros. The total notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the group has committed 
is £nil (2005/06: £nil).
The fair value of the group’s currency derivatives is estimated to be approximately £nil (2005/06: £nil). These amounts are based on market
values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to £nil have been charged to the income statement in the year
(2005/06: £nil).
28 Analysis of net debt
References to net debt refer to the total borrowings of the group, including both short term and long term bank loans, bonds, loan notes and
finance leases, after offsetting the cash and cash equivalents of the business and short term investments. Net debt will also include the proportion
of the fair value of the currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the group’s dollar denominated loan notes.

Net debt
Net debt is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with other similarly titled non-IFRS debt measures reported by
other companies. The group adopts this measure because it is used in calculating the banking covenants. It is also the measure used for internal
debt analysis. In addition, the net debt balance provides an indication of the net borrowings on which the company is required to pay interest.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributable earnings of subsidiaries for which
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £4.3m (2005/06: £10.9m). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences
because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of losses of £4.0m incurred by Northern Foods Insurance Limited relating to the fire 
in the Speciality bread category. The losses will be carried forward for future offset but it is unclear as to when the asset will be realised. Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group’s share price over the previous three years. This will 
continue to be reviewed in the future. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. It was assumed that the employees would exercise the options
after vesting date.

Performance conditions – notes
A No performance condition attached.
B Performance condition measured by reference to total shareholder return (TSR). The company met the performance condition by finishing
above the median point against the comparator group of companies.
C Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share. The target requires that the real growth in earnings per share over the
three year performance period is greater than 3% per annum compound. The performance condition allows for retesting after years four
and five against the full period from the grant.
D Performance condition measured by reference to earnings per share. The target requires that the real growth in earnings per share over 
the three year performance period is greater than 3% per annum compound. The performance condition does not allow for retesting.
E The LTIP has two performance conditions:
TSR: The total number of shares that will vest will be up to 50% dependent on how the TSR in relation to an ordinary share of Northern Foods
over the relevant performance period compares with TSR in relation to the ordinary shares of the companies in the comparator group in the
same period.Where the TSR of Northern Foods over the performance period places it between the median and the upper quartile, the number
of shares will be calculated on a straight line basis with 20% of the shares being received when Northern Foods is placed above median, and
50% being received where Northern Foods is placed in the upper quartile.Where Northern Foods’ growth in TSR places it below median, no
shares will vest in relation to this element of the award.
Return on invested capital (ROIC): 50% of the total award vests on achievement of a minimum growth in ROIC over the performance period.
Growth in ROIC over the period has to be 100 or more basis points. The number of shares that each participant receives is calculated on a
straight line basis with 7.5% of the shares being received if Northern Foods achieves growth of 100 basis points and maximum of 50% being
received if the company achieves growth of 200 basis points.
F Under the Share bonus plan, 80% of annual bonus opportunity is linked to specific financial targets. The other 20% is directly related 
to individual performance against personal performance contracts set at the start of the financial year, which contain six individual 
and business performance targets which are considered appropriately stretching.
G The Deferred share bonus plan (DSBP) was introduced in June 2006 so as to incentivise and retain the key talent necessary to drive the
specific performance improvements required. This DSBP provided approximately 40 senior executives with an award of shares with a value
up to 100% of base salary, at the prevailing market price of 81.75 pence per share on the date of award. These shares will be satisfied by 
the transfer of existing shares held in trust after the vesting date in July 2009. For further information, see 6.4.2 in the Remuneration report
on page 45.

Exercisable at end of period 8,533,451 1.23 8,806,337 1.58
Forfeiture arises when the employee leaves within the vesting period. Expiration of shares occurs when the last date for exercise has passed and
the option has not been exercised.
The range of exercise prices for share options exercised during the period was £nil (2005/06: £1.28 – £1.70). The options outstanding had 
a weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.22 years (2005/06: 8.62 years). The weighted average fair value of the share options
outstanding is £0.25 (2005/06 £0.38).
The group recognised total expenses of £0.9m (2005/06: £0.2m) in the period relating to equity settled share based payment transactions. 80 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Northern Foods plc

36 Retirement benefit obligations 
Defined benefit schemes
The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees, principally the Northern Foods Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’)
and Northern Foods Pension Builder (‘Pension Builder’) in the United Kingdom and the Green Isle Foods Group Retirement and Death Benefit Plan
(‘the Plan’) in the Republic of Ireland. Under the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on pay
and service. The Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are funded schemes whilst there is a post retirement medical scheme which is unfunded.
The Scheme and the Plan are final salary schemes. The assets of the Scheme, Pension Builder and the Plan are held in trustee administered funds
separate from the finances of the group.
On 22 March 2005 the company announced the closure of the Scheme to new entrants and withdrew its agreement to allow early retirement on
an enhanced basis. Pension Builder was introduced on 1 May 2005 and is available to all UK based employees. Pension Builder is a defined benefit
scheme based on the career average principle.
The most recent valuation of the Scheme for the purpose of the financial statements and the present value of defined benefit obligations was
carried out at 31 March 2007 by an independent qualified actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost was measured using the Projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions
used for the purpose of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and Pension Builder are detailed below.
Valuation date
2007 2006
Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 3.7%
Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.9% 2.7%
Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.0% 3.0%
Discount rate 5.3% 4.9%
Inflation assumption 3.0% 2.8%
Sensitivities
The mortality assumptions used are based on mortality experience of the Scheme and anticipated mortality experience. The assumptions 
are below the national average reflecting the socio-economic make up of the Scheme membership. For the valuation at 31 March 2007,
the company has adopted the short cohort principle for the Scheme and Pension Builder. If life expectancy is increased or decreased by one year,
liabilities are estimated to increase or decrease by £20.0m respectively. The impact of a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would
decrease or increase liabilities by £15.0m respectively.
The life expectancy in years for a member aged 65 are as follows:
Valuation date
2007 2006
Y ears Years
Current pensioner – male 17.7 16.6
– female 19.8 18.7
Future pensioner – male 18.4 17.5
– female 20.5 19.7
Post retirement medical benefit scheme
Until 31 March 1999, the group operated a post retirement medical benefit scheme. The method of accounting, assumptions and the frequency
of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension schemes detailed above. The main actuarial assumptions are the underlying
medical cost inflation of 5.0% per annum (2005/06: 5.0%) and the discount rate of 5.3% per annum (2005/06: 4.9%).
If the assumed rate of underlying medical cost inflation increased or decreased by 1.0% per annum then the valuation of the liabilities 
is estimated to increase or decrease by approximately £0.4m (2005/06: £0.5m) respectively.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the group’s defined benefit schemes and post retirement medical benefit scheme are

been reported in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. Northern Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 81

Impact of business disposals on the Scheme
During the period a curtailment gain of £2.1m arose on the sale of the trade and assets of NFT Distribution and a gain of £19.0m arose on 
the disposal of the trade and assets of the Speciality bread, chilled Pastry, Cakes and Flour milling businesses. The curtailment gains have been
included in the profit or loss on disposal of the businesses. A curtailment gain reflects reduced liabilities of the Scheme due to removing the
salary link when formerly active members of the Scheme become deferred members. Further information on the disposal of these businesses 
is disclosed in note 11.
As a result of the disposal programme announced in May 2006, special pension contributions of £57.0m will be made to the Scheme.
As at 31 March 2007 special contributions of £35.0m had been made with the remaining £22.0m to be paid in June 2007.
Overall special pension contributions during 2006/07 to the Scheme were £53.0m being £10.0m in April 2006 completing the company’s
previous £50.0m programme of special pension contributions, a further £8.0m paid in October 2006 on an interim basis prior to the completion
of the disposal programme and £35.0m from the disposal programme.

To the members of Northern Foods plc
We have audited the individual company financial statements 
of Northern Foods plc for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007 
which comprise the Company balance sheet, the Company cash flow
statement, the Company statement of recognised income and
expense, the Company statement of changes in equity and the
related notes 39 to 58. These individual company financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set 
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements 
of Northern Foods plc for the 52 weeks ended 31 March 2007.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report, the
Directors’ remuneration report and the individual company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European
Union are set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the individual company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the individual company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
individual company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the IAS regulation. We also report to you whether,
in our opinion, the information given in the Report of the directors 
is consistent with the individual company financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not
complied with any of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure
requirements specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. These comprise the amount of each
element in the remuneration package and information on share
options, details of long term incentive schemes, and money purchase
and defined benefit schemes. We give a statement, to the extent
possible, of details of any non-compliance.
Independent auditors’ report – Company financial statements
We review whether the Corporate governance report reflects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
2003 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements 
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited individual company financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any further information outside the Annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the individual company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors 
in the preparation of the parent company financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the individual company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the individual company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
1985, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 March 2007;
> the individual company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
> the information given in the Report of the directors is consistent
with the individual company financial statements.

At the period end, the company had entered into contractual commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment amounting 
to £nil (2005/06: £nil).
Impairment – discontinued operations
A £2.0m impairment loss was incurred during the period. As part of its business review, management identified the impairment losses of £2.0m
relating to the closure of the Trafford Park Bakery. The impaired assets have been sold during the period as part of the sale of the Assets therefore
the impairment has been included within discontinued operations.
The impairment losses identified represent the difference between the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and their recoverable
amount. The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations unless management is committed to closing or selling the
business. If the value of the business is to be recovered through sale or closure then the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices
and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using the group’s weighted average cost of capital.
The company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and
extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector. The growth rate does not exceed 3.0%
(2005/06: does not exceed 3.0%) and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is the group’s post tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.0% (2005/06: 7.0%).
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows. 88 Notes to the company financial statements Northern Foods plc

to buy, sell or hold shares in Northern Foods plc. Shareholders who
are unsure of what action to take should obtain independent financial
advice. Share values may go down as well as up which may result in 
a shareholder receiving less than originally invested.
Capital gains tax
The base cost of a Northern Foods ordinary share at 31 March 1982
for capital gains tax purposes is 75.8 pence. This figure is the adjusted
price to reflect the effect of the rights issue in January 1992, the one
for one capitalisation issue in August of the same year, and the demerger
of Express Dairies plc on 30 March 1998.
Any gain arising on disposal may also need to be adjusted to take
account of indexation allowances and, since these adjustments will
depend on individual circumstances, shareholders are recommended
to consult their financial advisers.

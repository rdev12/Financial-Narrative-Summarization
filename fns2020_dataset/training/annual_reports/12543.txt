growth plan is to achieve a balance between 
financial security, return on equity and growth.

Chairman’s Statement
“ As Chairman  
of PTSG, I am 
extremely proud  
of our people and 
their achievements.”

Chairman
Overview of Results
PTSG’s results for the year ended  
31 December 2014 showed very strong 
growth and I am pleased to report our 
highest levels of turnover, gross profit  
and underlying profit before taxation  
since the Group’s formation in 2007.
Turnover increased by 30% to £18.0 
million (2013: £13.9 million). Gross profit 
increased by 23% to £10.3 million (2013: 
£8.4 million) and underlying profit before 
tax also increased by 22% to £3.7 million 
(2013: £3.0 million). Adjusted earnings  
per share increased by 39% to 3.77p 
(2013: 2.71p). Net debt at 31 December 
2014 was £5.0 million which was an 
increase of £0.4 million from the previous 
year end and which reflects the increased 
levels of working capital necessary to fund 
the larger scale of the Group together with 
£0.9 million of capital payments to acquire 
businesses, plant and equipment, net of 
asset disposals.
Profit before taxation after adjusting  
items was £1.2 million. Adjusting items  
are considered to be either one off or 
non-trading items in nature and include 
deferred consideration payable to previous 
business owners who remain as PTSG 
employees, head office rebuild costs and 
IPO costs.
2014 was an important year for PTSG for 
two reasons. First, we took an important 
step in establishing a high level cleaning 
division following the acquisition of the 
trade and certain assets of Acescott 
Management Services Limited – a leading 
high level cleaning, rope access and 
working at height specialist based in 
London. Second, we undertook the 
majority of work necessary to take PTSG 
public and we were formally admitted to 
AIM on 11 February 2015 as a result of a 
successful IPO process.
As admission occurred after the financial 
year end, no further dividends are 
proposed in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2014.
Operational Highlights
Although “buy and build” is an important 
part of our growth story – we have 
successfully executed 12 acquisitions 
since 2007 – it is not at the expense of 
organic growth. We achieved organic 
turnover growth of 16% in 2014 if the 
turnover of 2014 acquisitions is excluded. 
We secured both numerous new single 
service contracts with customers and a 
further number of multi service contracts 
with large FM customers. There are a 
number of aspects to our service delivery 
which we believe are “best in class” 
including our Contract Renewals, Key 
Accounts and Health and Safety support 
functions and these functions continue  
to be strengthened to assist with the 
increased scale of operations. Our 
retention rate on maintenance contract 
renewals is approximately 85%. Our gross 
margins remain consistently high and year 
on year comparisons are mainly impacted 
by the level of installation work to testing  PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic Report

Financial Statements
and repair work. Our business model is 
centred around a 20% return on turnover 
at the adjusted EBIT level and this target 
was once again achieved in 2014.
Strategy
PTSG has a very clear strategy and a tried 
and tested business model which can 
successfully convert that strategy into 
excellent financial performance. PTSG is  
a niche specialist services provider which 
seeks to be a market leader in every area 
in which it operates. Our Access & Safety 
and Electrical Services divisions already 
possess sufficient scale to be considered 
as leading businesses in their respective 
areas of operation. Our niche focus is a 
differentiator and the services offered to 
customers in the FM marketplace have 
high barriers to entry and regulatory 
drivers which need an established 
business model to successfully handle  
a high volume of low value transactions.
The Board
The Board has been strengthened in 
recent months to enable us to continue 
our path of profitable growth as a publicly 
quoted company. Roger Teasdale and 
Mark Watford have joined us as Group 
Managing Director and Group Finance 
Director respectively to strengthen our 
executive management team. Roger 
McDowell and Alan Howarth joined the 
Board as non-executive Directors in 
February 2015 when PTSG was admitted 
to AIM and have a wide range of public 
company experience to draw upon in  
their roles with PTSG. Paul Teasdale  
and I remain as Group Chief Executive  
and Chairman respectively. The Board 
recognises the value and importance of 
high standards of corporate governance 
and looks forward to working together to 
direct and oversee the next stage in 
PTSG’s development.
Our People
As a founding shareholder I can remember 
when our first employee joined in 2007. 
We now have 230 employees and we are 
growing with almost every passing month. 
Since formation we have all been a part  
of a successful story; we have won 
industry awards for our service delivery 
and grown in scale because of the 
partnership between the Board, our senior 
management and our employees. This 
partnership guides our thoughts and 
actions for the benefit of everyone involved 
in PTSG. As Chairman of PTSG, I am 
extremely proud of our people and their 
achievements and thank them for their 
continuing efforts.
Outlook
The first three months trading of 2015 
have been encouraging and in line with  
the Board’s expectations. We have  
a significant pipeline of acquisition 
opportunities which have been internally 
identified and we expect to conclude our 
first acquisition as a public company in  
the second quarter of 2015. We face the 
future with confidence.

Market position
PTSG is focused on the provision of specialist services to niches 
in markets that are characterised by high regulation and strong, 
long-term drivers, with many of its activities non discretionary  
for customers.
PTSG believes it can maintain and expand its position in its 
chosen markets due to its competitive advantage, ability to 
achieve and sustain high margins, strong organic growth 
potential due to its wide customer base and cross selling 
opportunities, coupled with its proven ability to successfully 
integrate acquisitions in complementary areas of activity.
Competitive advantage
  Established business model (delivers high margins) 
  Nationwide UK engineering coverage (economies of scale) 
  Bespoke operational and CRM software (leads to margin 
sustainability) 
  Broadening multi-service coverage 
  Huge customer base
Margin sustainability
  Contract renewal rates circa 85%
  Largest UK repair and maintenance contract base in Access 
and Safety 
  Seven year track record of £1 repair to £1 maintenance 
  Efficiency of model works in all sectors 
  Award-winning services create further FM supply agreements
Major customers and organic growth
In most cases, we start by delivering single services before being 
asked to deliver more. Cofely, Mitie and M&S are three examples 
of clients to whom we began by delivering access and safety 
services. Now, they are taking advantage of our wider service 
offerings including electrical and high level services. 
We have an extensive customer base with no significant exposure 
to any one customer and just 5% of our customers currently 
receive more than one service.
Although we are a market leader in a number of areas we still 
have less than 10% market share in our principal markets, which 
provides significant scope for further growth.
Key performance indicators
There are many financial and operating performance indicators 
regularly monitored by the Group; the primary financial 
performance indicators are:
  Revenue growth: 30% (2013: 15%)
  Gross profit percentage: 57.3% (2013: 60.5%)
  Operating profit before adjusting items £4,007,400

  Profit before tax before adjusting items £3,702,370

Acquisition Case Study 1 – Thor Lightning Protection +
Acquired in December 2010 for £1. Turnover 
of £572k and an operating loss of £167k for 
year ended 31 December 2010 and external 
debt of £35k.
Immediately after the acquisition, PTSG  
cut out unnecessary expenditure and 
implemented our operating procedures and 
policies. This coupled with the ability to offer 
new services to our existing customer base 
enabled the business to increase its turnover 
to £1.3m in 2011 and generate an operating 
profit of £374k* pre-exceptional items.
In 2012, we continued to successfully grow 
Thor and the outturn was an operating profit  
of £493k* on a turnover of £1.8m.
The knowledge gained through the successful 
integration of Thor gave the Group a strong 
base on which to develop its Electrical Services 
division.

Chief Executive’s 
Review
“ PTSG enjoyed another fantastic year 
in 2014 as we continued our rapid 
growth since foundation in 2007. 
 
It was a year structured with  
high-profile appointments,  
headline-grabbing contract  
wins and prestigious accolades.”
Paul Teasdale 
Chief Executive Officer
Overview
In 2014, PTSG comprised four offerings: 
Access and Safety, Electrical Services, 
High Level Cleaning and Specialist Training. 
We expanded into high level cleaning and 
maintenance with the acquisition of the 
trade and assets of Acescott Management 
Services Limited (“Acescott”) in July 2014, 
Acescott contributed £0.41m to adjusted 
operating profits in 2014. 
Topline performance has remained strong 
with turnover increasing to £18.0m (2013: 
£13.9m), and operating profits before 
adjusting items increasing by 27% to £4.0m 
(2013: £3.2m), driven by robust adjusted 
EBIT margins which remained consistently 
high at 22.3%, reflecting the specialist and 
skilled nature of our activities, our strong 
focus on cost control and operating model, 
while remaining competitive on pricing. 
Statutory profit before tax after adjusting 
items was £1.2m.
We have also delivered strong organic 
growth across the Group – most notably 
in electrical services where revenue grew 
by 58% and adjusted operating profits 
by 56%. Our niche specialist services 
are sold on a recurring basis under 
contract to a retained customer base. 
We have continued our high client 
retention figure of over 85% on annual 
orders, driven by the quality of service 
and our competitive pricing.
Market environment
Demand for our services is underpinned  
by regulatory requirements around the 
installation, maintenance and testing of 
access and safety systems, lightning 
protection and electrical equipment, as well 
as insurance compliance requirements, 
and general repair and maintenance.
Many of our customers are streamlining 
their businesses through supplier 
rationalisation, moving to single source 
supply, which is benefiting the Group  
and is expected to continue in the future.  11

Strategy
We aim to build our market share in  
each of our niche services, to markets 
characterised by high regulation, long-term 
growth drivers, and non-discretionary 
spend for customers.
As the UK’s market leader in access and 
safety services and one of the industry’s 
leading lightning protection businesses,  
we are well positioned to capitalise on our 
recent entry into the high level cleaning 
market, with organic growth and cross 
selling opportunities.
Our major customers include the US Air 
Force, Marks & Spencer plc, Royal Bank  
of Scotland plc, Unite, Sheffield Hallam 
University, Network Rail, Harrods, Motorola, 
Airbus, Morgan Sindall, Willmott Dixon, 
Carillion, Barclays, Land Securities, Land 
Rover and Manchester United plc.
Our strategy is to generate significant 
shareholder value through organic growth, 
including cross-selling, and complementary 
acquisitions. Just 5% of customers 
currently receive multiple lines of service, 
with considerable scope to improve  
this and increase profitability. 
While we are already a market leader in  
a number of our operations, we still have  
a less than 10% share in our principal 
markets and there is significant scope  
for growth. 
Acquisitions 
PTSG has a track record of successfully 
integrating acquisitions in complementary 
areas of activity and driving improved 
operational and financial performance.
We are committed to pursuing acquisition 
opportunities in existing and adjacent 
markets, with a view to cross-selling 
services and leveraging our client base.  
We are attracted to opportunities in our 
core markets, where owner-managers  
are interested in playing a role in the 
enlarged business. 
PTSG’s first acquisition, National Cradle 
Maintenance Limited, was in 2007, and  
was funded by £0.9 million of equity from  
the founders. Since then we have made  
11 subsequent acquisitions, at a total 
consideration of £7.2 million, and our  
most recent acquisition Acescott, was 
completed in July 2014. 
Our in-house acquisitions team considers  
a strong pipeline of opportunities, including 
bolt-ons to existing divisions and 
businesses with activities in new and 
adjacent sectors. The Board will consider 
acquisitions that allow the Group to enter 
attractive new markets where we can 
leverage our operational and managerial 
framework; expand existing operations 
geographically to increase our penetration 
of the UK market; and grow operations  
in an existing market and geography, 
leveraging economies of scale to improve 
margins. 
We have a pipeline of acquisition 
opportunities which will carry us through 
2015, 2016 and 2017. Our first acquisition  
is planned for the second quarter of 2015.
We already carry out training, but only on  
a limited scale, and we are confident that  
a training division will complement the 
Group’s other activities. Over 2015 and 
2016 we intend to significantly expand the 
Group’s specialist training activities by 
acquisition. For instance, certification is 
already an important part of the Access 
and Safety and Electrical Services 
divisions, and the Group also provides  
its own engineers with regular training to 
maintain their compliance with any changes 
to the inspection and testing regimes.
Divisional results 
We have achieved strong levels of organic 
growth by improving operational processes 
and efficiencies, reducing costs, being 
more competitive and establishing new 
partnerships and relationships. 
Over 2014, we spent £0.1m on software 
development to increase productivity, 
efficiency and reduce costs. We have also 
signed new supply chain and framework 
agreements, including Mitie and Interserve, 
and renewed our three year contract 
with M&S. 
Access and Safety is the Group’s largest 
and longest established division, and 
provides maintenance, inspection and 
testing solutions for the highly-regulated 
area of “working at height”, as well as the 
design and installation of permanently 
installed façade access and fall arrest 
equipment. Contracts often include both 
the initial installation of access solutions 
and ongoing maintenance. The majority of 
clients enter into a contract for a period of 
three to five years.
The division generated sales of £9.6m and 
adjusted EBIT of £1.7m for the year ended 
31 December 2014. 
Electrical Services is currently the Group’s 
second largest division, with sales of £6.6m 
and adjusted EBIT of £1.9m in the year 
ended 31 December 2014. The division is 
an established provider of lightning and 
surge protection systems, PAT testing  
and fixed wire testing services. It is involved 
in both installation services and the 
maintenance, testing and repair of systems. 
Lightning protection is the largest business 
within PTSG Electrical Services.
Our newest division is PTSG High Level 
Cleaning. Our acquisition of Acescott, an 
established business with expertise in the 
design and application of cleaning systems 
for large and complex buildings in July 2014, 
contributed £0.4m to adjusted operating 
profits and £1.8m of revenue to the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2014.
High Level Cleaning includes a wide  
range of specialist cleaning services, from 
commercial window cleaning to pressure 
washing of cladding, façades, guttering 
and rooftops and graffiti and chewing gum 
removal. Customers’ buildings include 
office blocks, shopping centres, factories 
and hotels. PTSG has a clear advantage  
in tailoring projects that require complex 
access systems to clean and maintain 
buildings externally with minimal 
disturbance to the occupiers.

Strategic Report
Corporate Governance 
Financial Statements
PTSG receives great feedback every day of the week, which is a great 
testament to the work that the team delivers day in, day out. Here are 
just a few of our customers’ comments about the company’s work.
New staff
We have a highly experienced management 
team with extensive industry experience 
that is focused on creating shareholder 
value through organic and acquisitive 
growth. Over 2014 we welcomed two  
new executive members to strengthen  
our Board, who each bring a wealth of 
experience and knowledge, and will help  
to drive PTSG forward and achieve our 
strategic goals. Mark Watford joined the 
Group as Finance Director in September 
2014 and is a Chartered Accountant. 
Previously, Mark was a vice president of 
finance at Smith & Nephew Plc. Roger 
Teasdale joined the Group as Managing 
Director on 17 November 2014, and was 
previously president of the advanced 
wound management division (divisional 
revenue of $1.4 billion, with 4,000 
employees) of Smith & Nephew Plc. 
Since the end of the year we have also 
welcomed Alan Howarth and Roger 
McDowell as Non-executive Directors. Alan 
was appointed as a director of Chamberlin 
plc in January 2007 and was previously a 
partner in Ernst & Young. He is chairman of 
Cerillion Technologies Limited and Essentia 
Limited and has further non-executive 
interests in a range of private companies.
Roger was managing director of Oliver 
Ashworth for 18 years and led its main 
market listing and subsequent sale  
to Saint-Gobain S.A. He is currently the 
chairman or a non-executive director of 
eight quoted companies. 
Outlook for 2015
We have had a good start to 2015  
and continue to trade in line with our 
expectations. Our first acquisition is 
planned for the second quarter of 2015, 
with a good pipeline of future opportunities.
On 11 February 2015 we listed on AIM, 
raising £5m for PTSG, and were delighted to 
become the first Yorkshire-based business

organically and through acquisition.

Strategic Report
Principal Risks
The Board carefully considers the risks 
facing the Group and endeavours to 
minimise the impact of those risks. 
The key risks are as follows:
Failure of product or system could 
result in litigation, damage to the 
Group’s reputation and potentially  
the loss of customers.
Description
The Group is obliged to comply with 
health & safety and environmental 
regulations. Although the Group performs 
internal health & safety audits, as well 
as being externally audited at regular 
intervals by quality accreditation bodies 
and large blue chip customers, there is 
no guarantee that it will be able to comply 
with these regulations. The Group carries 
out inspections of equipment and there is 
the possibility that human error will result 
in equipment that is unsafe to use being 
utilised by employees or third parties 
to whom the Group has a duty of care. 
This could result in personal injury and 
litigation proceedings against the Group in 
respect of health & safety matters, criminal 
prosecution and/or a civil claim.
There can be no assurance that claimants 
in any litigation proceedings will not 
be able to devote substantially greater 
financial resources to any litigation 
proceedings or that the Group will prevail 
in any such litigation. Any litigation, 
whether or not determined in the Group’s 
favour or settled by the Group, may be 
costly and may divert the efforts and 
attention of the Group’s management and 
other personnel from normal business 
operations.
If the Group is unsuccessful in its defence 
it could result in a loss of reputation and 
decreased sales, along with either a large 
settlement or an increase in the Group’s 
insurance premiums should the litigation 
claim be covered by the Group’s insurance 
policy. The Group’s insurance cover may 
also not be sufficient to cover fully any 
liability. Even if the Group was successful 
in defending a claim, the Group’s 
reputation could be damaged, by such an 
incident, potentially resulting in the loss of 
customers. Although the Group will benefit 
from the PTSG branding for marketing 
purposes, should an incident occur, this 
loss of reputation could impact other 
areas of business to a greater extent than 
if they had their own individual branding.
An incident involving personal injury could 
also result in an official investigation or 
enquiry in respect of health & safety issues 
concerning the Group’s operations. These 
investigations may result in a loss of the 
Group’s health & safety certifications and a 
loss of contracts where these certifications 
are a requirement.
Mitigation
The Group has strong risk management 
policies, procedures and management 
systems throughout the organisation. 
These have been assessed as compliant 
to regulatory requirements by our 
stakeholders and internal health  
& safety team.
The Group has been assessed, approved 
and registered as certified holders of the 
ISO 9001:2008, BS OHSAS 18001:2007 
and ISO 14001:2004 standards.
Ability to attract, retain and develop a 
sufficiently skilled and experienced 
workforce to meet the targets set by 
the Group and its customers.
Description
Our employees are critical in delivering 
our objectives, not having employees with 
appropriate skills and experience could 
lead to poor delivery of service which 
could impact on the performance of  
the business.
The Group is managed by certain key 
personnel including executive directors 
and senior management, who have 
significant experience within the Group 
and the wider sector and may be difficult 
to replace.
Mitigation
The Group has invested in staff training 
programmes, competitive rewards 
compensation packages, management 
incentive schemes and succession 
planning. In addition the Group has 
invested in apprenticeship programmes 
to provide a supply of qualified staff from 
within the Group.
The Group has entered into contractual 
arrangements including long-term 
incentive structures with key personnel 
to secure their services. Additionally a 
strong management structure has been 
developed, which would enable the Group 
to continue to operate effectively in the 
event of the departure of a member of the 
senior management team.
The Group’s IT systems could fail due 
to a severe IT fault or cyber crime 
resulting in a loss of business and/or 
sensitive data.
Description
The Group is reliant on a number of 
systems to manage the entire process 
from creating orders in the system 
through to payment. The systems used 
are dependent on each other to be able 
to complete their processes. Therefore, 
a failure of any of the core IT systems 
may result in failures of other IT systems 
as well, which in turn could result in 
interruption to the efficient operation of  
the Group’s services.
The Group relies to a significant degree on 
the efficient and uninterrupted operation 
of its computer and communications 
systems and those of third parties, 
including the internet.
Customer access to the customer portal 
and the speed with which customers 
and suppliers navigate and interact 
with the procurement process in their 
portal affects the sales of the Group and 
the attractiveness of its services. Any 
failure of the internet generally or any  PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic Report
Corporate Governance 
Financial Statements
failure of current or new computer and 
communication systems could impair 
the value of projects, the processing 
and storage of data and the day-to-day 
management of the Group’s business.
Mitigation
The Group maintains tight access 
controls over its data and IT systems 
and continually monitors performance. 
The Group’s internal IT team ensures all 
performance issues are resolved promptly.
The Group has disaster recovery and 
business continuity contingency plans. If 
a serious disaster affecting the business 
systems or operations occurred the 
recovery plan aims to enable the Group 
to recommence trading without loss of 
business. 
Commercial construction market  
and general economic conditions.
Description
A general downturn in the construction 
industry in the UK could affect the Group 
given the reliance, to an extent, of the 
installation activities of Access and Safety 
and Electrical Services on construction 
projects. A general economic downturn 
could lead to a decline on the volume of 
the Group’s sales.
Mitigation
The Board believes that a general 
downturn should not adversely affect the 
business of the Group as its business is 
not concentrated in one single area of 
construction, with involvement in public 
sector projects, as well as commercial 
and retail sectors. Also, the Group 
benefits from a significant proportion of its 
revenues being generated from ongoing 
contracts for maintenance driven by 
regulatory requirements, rather than solely 
installations which are largely driven by the 
rate of new build completions.
Acquisitions.
Description
The Directors will seek to target 
acquisitions in line with the Group’s 
strategic objectives. However, there is a 
risk that some of the expected benefits of 
such acquisitions will fail to materialise or 
that significant expense may be incurred 
with the integration. In addition, there can 
be no guarantee that there will be any 
suitable acquisition opportunities available.
Mitigation
The Group has already identified several 
businesses which the Board will consider 
acquiring in 2015. In addition the Board 
continually identifies new potential 
acquisitions and maintains ongoing 
dialogue with these, which would enable 
these acquisitions to be brought forward 
if any of the current acquisition targets do 
not complete.
The Group has a successful track 
record of acquiring and integrating 
businesses and conducts extensive due 
diligence before any purchase which 
will help mitigate any issues surrounding 
integration.
There can be no assurance that  
the Group will achieve increased 
market penetration and competition 
could increase.
Description
The Board believes that the Group can 
achieve greater market share across the 
three divisions. However, there can be no 
guarantee that this will be achieved. Also, 
competitive pressures could increase, 
including through new entrants to the 
market, which could detrimentally impact 
the Group’s performance. 
Mitigation
The Group has a strong track record of 
organic growth and has invested in its 
staff, systems and procedures to ensure 
that they deliver exceptional services 
to its customers. Such service will help 
retain existing customers and attract new 
customers. Complementary acquisitions 
will aid market penetration.
Third parties and retained 
sub-contractors.
Description
Third parties or sub-contractors retained 
by the Group may be involved in improper 
activities which result in penalties or loss 
of reputation.
Mitigation
The majority of work undertaken by 
the Group is undertaken by its own 
employees. In those cases when third 
parties or sub-contractors are used a 
rigorous vetting procedure is undertaken 
to ensure their capability and suitability, 
and once appointed, receive site rules.
Force majeure.
Description
A fire, explosion, flood, earthquake or 
hurricane at a major site could result in  
the inability to meet customer orders.
Mitigation
The Group has disaster recovery and 
business continuity contingency plans. If 
a serious disaster affecting the business, 
systems or operations occurred the 
recovery plan aims to enable the Group 
to recommence trading without loss of 
business. The Group’s disaster recovery 
plans were tested in March 2014 when a 
construction work related incident resulted 
in a significant temporary loss of primary 
data. However, the Group’s operations 
remained uninterrupted.

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance
The Board recognises the value and importance of high 
standards of corporate governance. Accordingly, whilst the UK 
Corporate Governance Code does not apply to AIM companies, 
the Board intends to observe the requirements of the Corporate 
Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Companies (“the 
Code”) published by the Quoted Companies Alliance to the 
extent they consider appropriate in the light of the Group’s size, 
stage of development and resources. In anticipation of Admission 
the Company established external, independent representation 
on the Board, by the appointment of Alan Howarth and Roger 
McDowell as independent non-executive directors on Admission.
Premier Technical Services Group PLC listed its Ordinary Shares 
on AIM on 11 February 2015 and therefore the requirements of 
the Code have only applied to the Company since that date. 
Accordingly, this report includes a description of how it intends  
to apply those principles since admission.
Board
The Board will be responsible for the overall management of 
the Group including the formulation and approval of the Group’s 
long-term objectives and strategy, the approval of budgets, the 
oversight of Group operations, the maintenance of sound internal 
control and risk management systems and the implementation 
of the Group’s strategy, policies and plans. Whilst the Board may 
delegate specific responsibilities, there will be a formal schedule 
of matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board. Such 
reserved matters will include, amongst other things, approval of 
significant capital expenditure, material business contracts and 
major corporate transactions. The Board will formally meet on a 
monthly basis to review performance.
The Board will have an audit committee and a remuneration 
committee with formally delegated duties and responsibilities.
Each of the Directors is subject to either an executive service 
agreement or letter of appointment. The Company’s Articles of 
Association require one third of directors to retire at every Annual 
General meeting.
Audit committee
The audit committee will be responsible for monitoring the 
integrity of the Company’s financial statements, reviewing 
significant financial reporting issues, reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal control and risk management systems, 
and overseeing the relationship with the external auditors 
(including advising on their appointment, agreeing the scope of 
the audit and reviewing the audit findings).
The audit committee comprises John Foley, Alan Howarth and 
Roger McDowell and will be chaired by John Foley. The audit 
committee meets at least three times a year at appropriate times 
in the reporting and audit cycle and otherwise as required. The 
audit committee will also meet regularly with the Company’s 
external auditors.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee will be responsible for determining 
and agreeing with the Board the framework for the remuneration 
of Board members and other designated senior executives and, 
within the terms of the agreed framework, determining the total 
individual remuneration packages of such persons including, 
where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share 
options or other share awards. The remuneration of Non-
executive Directors will be a matter for the Chairman and the 
executive members of the Board. No Director will be involved in 
any decision as to his or her own remuneration. 
The remuneration committee comprises John Foley, Alan 
Howarth and Roger McDowell and will be chaired by John Foley. 
The remuneration committee will meet at least twice a year and 
otherwise as required.
Board balance and independence
The Code recommends a balance between Executive and 
Non-executive Directors. The Company has two Non-executive 
directors in addition to the Chairman and three executive 
directors, thus providing balance within the Board.
The Directors consider all Non-executive directors to be 
independent.
Share dealing code
The Company has adopted a share dealing code for the Directors 
and applicable employees of the Group for the purpose of 
ensuring compliance by such persons with the provisions of 
the AIM Rules relating to dealings in the Company’s securities 
(including, in particular, Rule 21 of the AIM Rules). The Directors 
consider that this share dealing code is appropriate for a 
company whose shares are admitted to trading on AIM.
The Company will take proper steps to ensure compliance by 
the Directors and applicable employees with the terms of the 
share dealing code and the relevant provisions of the AIM Rules 
(including Rule 21).  PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Financial Statements
Information, meetings and attendance
The Board met regularly in 2014 and has a full programme 
of Board meetings planned for 2015. The Board receives a 
comprehensive pack and has a clearly defined agenda which 
covers all areas of the business. The pack provides a full trading 
analysis against budget and includes detailed financial data and 
analysis.
The company has external advisers on which it can call for expert 
advice on particular areas.
Prior to listing the executive directors received a briefing from 
N+1 Singer on their duties and responsibilities as directors of a 
publicly quoted company.
Board evaluation
Given that the majority of Directors were only appointed in the 
months preceding the listing in February 2015, the Board believes 
that a meaningful evaluation of the Board can only take place 
after it has been working together for a reasonable time. It is 
anticipated that the Board will in the future review its performance 
and that of its committees, a Non-executive director will carry out 
formal individual performance reviews.
Control procedures
The Board approves the annual budget each year. This process 
allows the Board to identify key performance targets and risks 
expected during the upcoming year. The Board also considers 
the agreed budget when reviewing trading updates and 
considering expenditures throughout the year. Progress against 
budget is monitored via monthly reporting of actual financial 
performance against budget and prior year actual results.
The Group has clear authority limits deriving from the list of 
matters reserved for decision by the Board including capital 
expenditure approval procedures.
There is no internal audit function due to the size of the Group 
and the close involvement of senior management over the 
Group’s accounting systems, however, this will be reviewed 
annually by the audit committee.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises and understands that it has a fiduciary 
responsibility to the shareholders. The Chairman’s Statement and 
Chief Executive’s Review include detailed analysis of the Group’s 
performance and future expectations. The Group’s website 
(www.ptsg.co.uk) allows shareholders access to information, 
including contact details and the current share price, as well as a 
link to “About us” which provides information on the business and 
the services offered by the divisions of the Group.
The Chief Executive is responsible for ongoing dialogue and 
relationships with shareholders, alongside the Finance Director 
and Chairman.
Additionally, the Annual General Meeting provides a platform 
for the Board to communicate with shareholders and the Board 
welcomes the attendance and participation of all shareholders.

Financial risk management
Due to the nature of the financial instruments used by the Group 
comprising bank balances, trade creditors, trade debtors and finance 
lease agreements, there is no exposure to price risk. The liquidity risk 
on the above areas is regularly monitored by the Directors.
The Group monitors credit risk closely and considers that its 
current policies meet its objectives of managing exposure to the 
risk. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
Employment policy
It is the policy of the Group to operate a fair employment policy. No 
employee or job applicant is less favourably treated than another 
on the grounds of their sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, 
religion, race, nationality, ethnic or national origin, colour or disability 
and all appointments and promotions are determined solely on 
merit. The Directors encourage employees to be aware of all issues 
affecting the Group and issues a quarterly newsletter to all employees 
informing them of all current developments within the business.
Environment
The Group adheres to all environmental regulations and has, 
where possible, utilised environmental-sustaining policies such  
as recycling and waste reduction.
Post balance sheet events
On 11 February 2015 the Company was admitted to AIM and 
£5,000,000 was raised (before expenses) for the Company  
(see note 29).
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held at 
13 Flemming Court, Whistler Drive, Castleford WF10 5HW on

in a separate Notice of Meeting which accompanies this report.
Independent Auditor
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union, and the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the group and parent company financial statements respectively;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Provision of information to auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
report confirm that there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken the 
steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Directors’ indemnities 
As permitted by the Articles of Association, the Directors have 
the benefit of an indemnity which is a qualifying third party 
indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006. The indemnity was in force throughout the last financial 
year and is currently in force. The Company also purchased and 
maintained throughout the financial year Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance in respect of itself and its Directors.

In our opinion, Premier Technical Services Group plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then 
ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Premier Technical Services Group plc’s financial statements comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 21, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Premier Technical Services Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of the 
registered office is: 13 Flemming Court, Whistler Drive, Castleford, WF10 5HW (registered company number is 06005074). The 
Company and its subsidiaries’ (together referred to as “the Group”) is a Niche Specialist Service Provider whose principal activities are 
the maintenance, inspection, testing, repair and installation of permanent façade access equipment, fall arrest systems and lightning 
protection systems together with fixed wire and portable appliance testing and high level cleaning. 
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(a) Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the AIM Rules, in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee’s (“IFRSIC”) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS.
The first consolidated financial statements which were prepared under IFRS as adopted by the European Union, are the Historical 
Financial Information included within the AIM Admission Document. A copy of these financial statements can be obtained from the 
Group’s website www.ptsg.co.uk. The date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2011, and disclosures concerning the transition from 
UK GAAP to IFRS are detailed in note 30 of the AIM Admission Document. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 do not constitute the first IFRS financial statements of the Group, and accordingly no associated 
disclosures are provided.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial information are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
(b) Going concern 
This consolidated financial information relating to the Group has been prepared on the going concern basis.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and for at least one year from the date of signing these financial statements. For these 
reasons they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements. 
The cash flow projections are the sole responsibility of the Directors based upon their present plans, expectations and intentions. In 
this context, the Directors have prepared and considered cash flow projections for the Group for a period extending one year from the 
date of approval of these financial statements. Based on these cash flows, and having regard to the provision of the debt facility as 
described in note 19 to these financial statements the Directors are satisfied that the Group is able to meet its liabilities as and when 
they fall due for the foreseeable future and for a minimum period of 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements.
(c) New standards, amendments and interpretations 
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the Group:
The accounting policies adopted in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements reflect the adoption of the following new 
standards as of 1 January 2014:
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ (effective from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). This standard builds on 
existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the 
consolidated financial statements. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in determining control where this is difficult to 
assess. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial information.
IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ (effective from periods beginning on or after 1 July 2013) reduces the types of joint arrangements to two: 
joint operations and joint ventures. The existing policy choice of proportionate consolidation for jointly controlled entities has also been 
eliminated. Equity accounting is mandatory for participants in joint ventures.
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ (effective from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) sets out the disclosure 
requirements in the financial statements in respect of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. The key additional disclosure above those already required 
under existing standards, is that additional information is required on the nature, risks and financial effects of the company’s interests 
in other entities. Further disclosure is required about the significant judgements and assumptions made in determining the 
classification of the investments.  Strategic Report

PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 
January 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to have a 
significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from 
an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the 
ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 
and early application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. The group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15. There are no other IFRS 
or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(d) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial 
information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control transferred to the Group 
until the date that control ceases. 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
(e) Property, plant and equipment 
Owned assets 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as 
separate items of property, plant and equipment. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement.
Leased assets 
Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as finance 
leases. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is recorded at fair value or, if lower, the present value of minimum 
lease payments at inception of the lease, less depreciation and any impairment.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in the other long-term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis. The property, plant and equipment under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the 
asset and lease term.
Depreciation 
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of 
the asset and the lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
• Leasehold improvements  – depreciated over term of lease
• Fixture and fittings  – 25% on cost
• Motor vehicles   – 33% on cost
• Equipment   – 25–33% on cost
• Plant and machinery  – 15–50% on cost
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Financial Statements
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(f) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Where necessary provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and 
defective stocks. Cost comprises the purchase price of goods and other directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the product to 
its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price reduced by all costs of completion, marketing, 
selling and distribution.
(g) Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions comprises the excess of the fair value of the consideration for investments in subsidiary undertakings 
over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries is 
included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and 
losses on the disposals of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Each of those cash-generating units represents 
the lowest level within the Group at which the associated level of goodwill is monitored for management purposes and are not larger 
than the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”.
Business Combinations
From 1 January 2011, the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. 
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2011, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration 
transferred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as 
equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2011, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the 
recognised amounts (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
(h) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets not subject to amortisation are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at 
the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets, other than goodwill 
that suffered an impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
(i) Financial assets 
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at 
initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that arise principally through the 
provision of services to customers. They are initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the 
reporting period. Loans and receivables comprise mainly cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.

PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Impairment of financial assets 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms 
receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. 
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being 
recognised within other operating costs in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the 
gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision. 
(j) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 
Cash and cash equivalents is reported at a net amount in the balance sheet as there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amount.
(k) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
(l) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings.
(m) Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material and 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is 
recognised in finance costs. 
(n) Share capital 
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium 
as a deduction from the proceeds.
(o) Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received as receivable (excluding value added tax and discount given) 
derived from the provision of goods and services to customers during the period.
a) Installation 
The Group enters into contracts to design and install façade access equipment, fall arrest systems and lightning protection systems. 
Revenue is recognised (to the extent to which performance has taken place at the balance sheet date in accordance with the 
percentage completion method) in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract at the balance sheet date and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total service 
to be provided.
b) Test, inspection and repair 
The Group maintains, tests, inspects and repairs façade access equipment, fall arrest systems and lightning protection systems. 
Revenue is recognised on completion of the relevant work and the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have 
been satisfied.
(p) Leases
The costs associated with operating leases are taken to the income statement on an accruals basis over the period of the lease. 
Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease 
is treated as a “finance lease”, the accounting policy for which is disclosed in (e).  PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(q) Net finance costs 
Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings and financial leases.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested.
(r) Income tax 
Income tax for the years presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of other assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; nor differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they 
are unlikely to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be 
realised. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred 
income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related 
dividend. 
(s) Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the Board of Directors which has been identified 
as the chief operating decision maker. The Board of directors consists of the Executive Directors and the Non-executive Directors. 
(t) Employee benefits: Pension obligations 
The Group operates a defined contribution plan. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not 
hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. 
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee 
benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
the future payments is available.
(u) Adjusting items
Adjusting items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide clearer understanding of 
the underlying financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due 
to the significance of their nature or amount.

3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The Directors consider that the following estimates and judgements are likely to have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements: 
Business combinations
On acquisition, the Company calculates the fair value of the net assets acquired. The assessment of assets is necessarily judgemental 
and therefore will directly impact on the value of goodwill carried on the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
based on the cash flows of the income generating unit to which it relates. Judgement is applied to assessing the future revenues to be 
achieved from an acquisition and the appropriate discount rate. These estimates affect whether an impairment of goodwill should be 
recognised. Further disclosures in respect of the impairment of goodwill are provided in note 12.
Revenue recognition
Certain of the Group’s installation contracts have a term of several months. The Directors assess the timing of the revenue according 
to the extent to which performance has taken place. As such, an element of judgement is required when assessing the stage of 
completion at a period end.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are continually reviewed for impairment and provided for where necessary. The directors assess the requirement for 
any provision based on the age of the debt compared to agreed terms, recent history of default and current economic climate. As 
such there is an element of judgement required in estimating the probable losses inherent in the trade receivables.
Deferred consideration 
Amounts payable in respect of acquisitions can depend in part upon the achievement of a number of financial and non-financial 
performance measures specified in the purchase agreements. The Directors estimate the amounts payable by assessing, amongst 
other things, the performance of the acquired businesses since acquisition against the measures specified in the purchase 
agreements. As such, an element of judgement is required in determining whether the performance measures will be achieved. 
4. SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Board of directors that are used 
to assess both performance and strategic decisions. Management has identified that the Board of directors is the chief operating 
decision maker in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’.
The Board of Directors organise the Group around products and services and considers the business to be split into three main types 
of business generating revenue; Access and Safety, Electrical Services and High Level Cleaning. There was no trade in the Training 
Solutions division.
All revenue originates in the UK. PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

In both years, the Group undertook a rebranding and restructuring exercise. Costs relating to these one off items have been included 
as an adjusting item. These costs have been charged to administrative expenses.
On 11 February, the Company was admitted to AIM. Certain costs relating to this have been charged in 2014.
There was a partial collapse of the Company’s Head Office. The full cost of the rebuild is being pursued through an insurance claim. 
The incident caused minimal disruption to the business.
The contingent payable relates to cash payments to the vendors of the businesses acquired in accordance with the terms of each 
Sale and Purchase Agreement and is based on the achievement of certain milestones. Contingent amounts payable in respect of 
acquisitions can depend in part upon the achievement of a number of financial and non-financial performance measures specified in 
the purchase agreements and in part subject to the continued employment of the vendor. Where payment is linked to the continued 
employment of the vendor, the arrangement to pay these additional amounts is accounted for separately to the business combination 
as remuneration. This benefit payable is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period in which the 
services are provided as an employment expense.

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Conditional upon and with effect immediately prior to the Placing and Admission, each existing ordinary share in the Company was 
converted into 100 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the capital reorganisation described in Note 22. The issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company immediately prior to the Placing and Admission is 77,142,800 Ordinary Shares of one penny each. 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per Ordinary Share is based on profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent and 
on 77,142,800 Ordinary Shares in issue immediately prior to the Placing and Admission. 
The calculation of basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2014 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary 
shareholders of £532,040 (year ended 31 December 2013: £1,900,023).

All amortisation charges have been treated as an administrative expense in the income statement. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) and is tested for impairment on an annual 
basis by comparing the carrying amount against the discounted cash flow projections of the CGU. CGUs are not larger than the 
operating segments of the Group. PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Total goodwill 3,615,748 3,539,257 
The recoverable amount has been determined based on the value in use calculations, covering approved budgets and forecasts for 
the next financial year, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows. The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were 
as follows:
• Pre tax discount rate 12%
• Sales growth was based on internal forecasts and a terminal growth rate of 2%
• Gross margins were projected based on recent trends
The Directors believe that there are no reasonably possible changes to a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.

14. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
As at 31 December 2014 there are options outstanding over up to 10,000 E shares. The E Shares have limited rights to a return of 
capital but a right to share in the proceeds of sale upon the sale of the entire issued share capital of PTSG or if a general offer is 
successfully made for the ordinary shares in the capital of PTSG within a 10 year period from 2 June 2014. In such an event the 
holders of the E Shares are entitled in aggregate to receive a sum equal to the profit on ordinary activities before taxation of PTSG 
Access and Safety Ltd as shown in the statutory accounts of PTSG Access and Safety Ltd for the financial period ending prior to the 
date of sale, subject to a limit of 10% of the proceeds of such a sale.

14. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued
Under the terms of his service agreement, the Company shall issue to Roger Teasdale (for nil or nominal consideration) additional 
equity calculated by reference to the then issued share capital of the Company when the following milestone targets are met in any 
given financial year on the first occasion only:
EBITDA (Statutory accounts) £8m £10m £12m £14m
2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5%
The above have been considered in accordance with IFRS 2, however as the directors consider it unlikely that there will be a sale of 
the company within the relevant timeframe and the milestone targets are unlikely to be met in the foreseeable future, there is no 
material charge to be reflected in the financial statements for the current year and no further disclosures have been made.
In addition to the above, under the terms of Roger Teasdale’s service agreement with the Company he is entitled, provided that he is 
still employed by the Company on or after 16 November 2015, to require the transfer to him, for nil consideration, ownership of 5% in 
aggregate of the current issued share capital of the Company, being approximately 4.4% of the enlarged share capital. Paul Teasdale, 
John Foley and Hawk Investments have undertaken to deliver such shares to him in proportion to their existing shareholdings for nil 
consideration.
The directors have fair valued the equity instruments at the grant date, being 16 November 2014 (the date at which the parties have 
shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement). The fair value of the option has been calculated based on the 
fair value of the shares at the grant date given that there are no performance conditions, a service condition of one year and the 
exercise price of £nil.
The fair value of the award is being expensed to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight-line basis with the 
corresponding credit to equity. As at 31 December 2014, the charge to the income statement was £165,418.

(b) Contingencies
The Company and its subsidiaries have given unlimited multilateral company guarantees on their respective bank facilities.
26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – RISK MANAGEMENT 
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management is carried out by the board of directors. 
(a) Market risk
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from the group’s borrowings as disclosed in Note 19. 
The Group has not entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate the variable interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2014, if the LIBOR denominated borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher/lower with all other variables held 
constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £21,250 (2013: £6,644) lower/higher, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest 
expense on floating rate borrowings.
(b) Credit risk
The Group monitor credit risk closely and consider that its current policies meet its objectives of managing exposure to risk. The 
Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. Management believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in 
excess of the provisions for doubtful receivables.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is managed on a day to day basis. Facilities are agreed at appropriate levels having regard to the Group’s forecast 
operating cash flows and future capital expenditures. 
(d) Capital risk management 
The aim of the Group is to maintain sufficient funds to enable it to make suitable investments and incremental acquisitions whilst 
minimising recourse to bankers and/or shareholders. The Group currently has overdraft facilities in place of £1.75m.
All material cash amounts are deposited with financial institutions with high credit ratings.
Leverage is monitored in accordance with the requirements of the Loan covenants, following the loan which was taken out in 2013.
27. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS 
On 1 July 2014 the trade and certain assets of Acescott Management Services Limited were purchased for a total cash consideration 
of £581,694. This acquisition has been accounted for in the consolidated financial statements by the acquisition method of accounting.
Acescott undertakes high level cleaning and enables us to extend our customer services offering and provided our new and existing 
client base to further utilise PTSG as their niche specialist services provider.
The turnover, operating loss and adjusted operating profit of Acescott for the period from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2014 
included in the consolidated financial statements was £1,833,748, (£81,383) and £415,422 respectively. PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Key management compensation is given in Note 5. 
Other related party transactions with the Company are as follows: 
Dividends of £660,000 (2013: £660,000) were paid to Hallco 1766 Limited and £130,000 (2013: £71,667) to J R Foley on the Ordinary 
Shares in the year ended 31 December 2014. P W Teasdale is a director of Hallco 1766 Limited.
Rent of £166,250 (2013: £75,000) was paid in the year to Ensco 835 Limited. P W Teasdale and J R Foley are directors of Ensco 835 
Limited.
No other transactions with related parties were undertaken such as are required to be disclosed.
29. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 11 February 2015 the Company was admitted to AIM and £5,000,000 was raised (before expenses) for the Company.
In connection with the Admission, the share capital of the Company was restructured as set out in Note 22.
By an instrument dated 5 February 2015, the Company created Warrants to subscribe at the Placing Price for up to 867,581 new 
Ordinary Shares, being one per cent. of the Enlarged Share Capital. The Warrants have been issued to N+1 Singer Pursuant to the 
Placing Agreement. The Warrants are exercisable at any time or times in the period of five years from Admission and thereafter shall 
lapse. The exercise price is equal to the Placing Price per share. If the Company capitalises its reserves (other than by way of shares 
paid up out of distributable reserves and used in lieu of a cash dividend) during the period of the Warrant or there is any sub-division, 
or consolidation of Ordinary Shares or a reduction of capital during such period the number and/or nominal value of Ordinary Shares 
the subject of the Warrant will be adjusted so as to maintain the same relative subscription rights. For so long as the Warrants are 
outstanding the Company has agreed, inter alia, not to vary or abrogate the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares or to create any 
class of share which ranks for any purpose ahead of the Ordinary Shares.

REPORT ON THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, Premier Technical Services Group plc’s company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Premier Technical Services Group plc’s financial statements comprise:
• the balance sheet as at 31 December 2014; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 21, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Independent Auditors’ Report 
to the members of Premier Technical Services Group plc PTSG Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Financial Statements
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Premier Technical Services Group plc for the year ended

The Directors consider that to list all subsidiary undertakings would lead to a statement of excessive length. A full list of subsidiary 
undertakings will be annexed to the company’s next annual return.
The Directors have assessed the deferred consideration likely to be paid and have adjusted the investment value accordingly.
The Directors believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by their underlying net assets.

Share based payments
As at 31 December 2014 there are options outstanding over up to 10,000 E shares. The E Shares have limited rights to a return of 
capital but a right to share in the proceeds of sale upon the sale of the entire issued share capital of PTSG or if a general offer is 
successfully made for the ordinary shares in the capital of PTSG within a 10 year period from 2 June 2014. In such an event the 
holders of the E Shares are entitled in aggregate to receive a sum equal to the profit on ordinary activities before taxation of PTSG 
Access and Safety Ltd as shown in the statutory accounts of PTSG Access and Safety Ltd for the financial period ending prior to the 
date of sale, subject to a limit of 10% of the proceeds of such a sale.
Under the terms of his service agreement, the Company shall issue to Roger Teasdale (for nil or nominal consideration) additional 
equity calculated by reference to the then issued share capital of the Company when the following milestone targets are met in any 
given financial year on the first occasion only:
EBITDA (Statutory accounts) £8m £10m £12m £14m
2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5%
The above have been considered in accordance with IFRS 2, however as the directors consider it unlikely that there will be a sale  
of the company within the relevant timeframe and the milestone targets are unlikely to be met in the foreseeable future, there is no 
material charge to be reflected in the financial statements for the current year and no further disclosures have been made.
In addition to the above, under the terms of Roger Teasdale’s service agreement with the Company he is entitled, provided that he is 
still employed by the Company on or after 16 November 2015, to require the transfer to him, for nil consideration, ownership of 5% in 
aggregate of the current issued share capital of the Company, being approximately 4.4% of the enlarged share capital. Paul Teasdale, 
John Foley and Hawk Investments have undertaken to deliver such shares to him in proportion to their existing shareholdings for nil 
consideration.
The directors have fair valued the equity instruments at the grant date, being 16 November 2014 (the date at which the parties have 
shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement). The fair value of the option has been calculated based on the 
fair value of the shares at the grant date given that there are no performance conditions, a service condition of one year and the 
exercise price of £nil.
The fair value of the award is being expensed to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight-line basis with the 
corresponding credit to equity. As at 31 December 2014, the charge to the income statement was £165,418. This has been borne  
by the subsidiary company, PTSG Access and Safety Limited.

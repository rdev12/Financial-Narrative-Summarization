Strategic report
“ The resilience of the 
Group’s business 
model has been a  
key feature of the  
past twelve months.”
 Philip Aiken
 Chairman
 19 May 2015
Introduction
Overview
I am pleased to report that AVEVA has 
made good progress in difficult market 
conditions, and that the resilience of the 
Group’s business model has been a key 
feature of the past twelve months.
The full year results reflect our particular 
focus on execution in the second half 
of the financial year. Total recurring 
revenue for the second half of the 
year was up 5%, demonstrating the 
resilience of our business. We were 
also able to deliver the £10.0 million of 
cost efficiencies we had targeted.
Group revenue of £208.7 million (2014 – 
£237.3 million), was in line with our revised 
expectations and adjusted* profit before 
tax was £62.1 million (2014 – £78.3 million), 
resulting in an adjusted profit margin of 
29.8% (2014 – 33.0%). The reported profit 
before tax was £54.9 million (2014 – £69.0 
million). Adjusted basic earnings per share 
declined 16% to 74.51 pence (2014 – 89.05 
pence). Basic earnings per share declined 
17% to 65.07 pence (2014 – 78.12 pence). 
We closed the year with net cash of 
£103.8 million (2014 – £117.5 million).
This result reflects a reduced market 
demand throughout the year due to the 
significantly lower oil price and subsequent 
reduction in customer activity, as well 
as the previously reported weakness in 
South America and North East Asia during 
the first half. The strength of sterling 
also had a pronounced negative effect 
on our reported results, trimming Group 
revenue by 6%, as our overseas revenue 
was translated at less favourable rates 
compared to the last financial year.
Strategic progress
Notwithstanding the tougher market 
backdrop, I am pleased to report that 
AVEVA has continued to make excellent 
strategic progress on a number of 
fronts. This is particularly evident in the 
newly realigned organisation within our 
sales, Research & Development and 
solution delivery activities. A year ago 
we introduced ‘One AVEVA’ to better 
support our Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (EPC) and Owner Operator 
(OO) customers through a single sales 
approach. This has proved to be very 
effective at helping us to grow the number 
of solution sales we make. In addition, we 
have recently unified our development 
teams across all of our solutions and 
technologies and streamlined our solution 
delivery capabilities.
We have continued to make very good 
progress with our Global Accounts. 
Many customers are responding to more 
uncertain markets by investing in new 
technologies from AVEVA to maximise 
competitiveness and efficiency. AVEVA 
E3D has been an outstanding example 
of this and has proved to be a powerful 
catalyst for us to deepen our relationships 
with these key customers. As a result we 
are pleased to be able to report significant 
new contracts with Aker Solutions,WS 
Atkins and KBR, among others.
AVEVA E3D is a clear example of AVEVA’s 
position as the leading innovator within 
its industry. We have also delivered a 
range of new products and functional 
enhancements to many of our other 
products over the last twelve months. Of 
particular note is the Activity Visualisation 
Platform and the new Cloud-enabled 
version of AVEVA E3D, both of which 
have generated much excitement from 
customers in recent months.
During the year we were pleased 
to acquire 8over8 Limited. Based in 
Northern Ireland, 8over8’s core product, 
ProCon™, is a software solution designed 
to minimise risk and increase control 
and capital discipline for some of the 
world’s most complex projects. This 
demonstrates AVEVA is well placed to use 
its balance sheet to deliver well-timed, 
strategically important acquisitions with 
a strong logical fit. We are confident that 
the addition of 8over8 will enable us to 
further broaden our relationships with 
the OO community, and serve to further 
differentiate AVEVA in its markets.
Market environment
The lower oil price has led to a reduction in 
global upstream E&P capital expenditure, 
and it is well documented that a number of 
projects have been postponed or moth-
balled, although the overall effect for 
AVEVA is mixed. This has had an impact 
on our EPC customers, their backlogs and 
general levels of activity.
We have market-leading, well-invested 
technology solutions that underpin our 
competitive advantage across our target 
sectors and geographies. Our mission to 
enable our customers to work globally 
with less risk, shorter lead-times and 
greater business efficiency throughout 
the asset lifecycle ensures we are aligned 
to robust long-term growth drivers, 
particularly given demand for energy, 
the increasing complexity of their assets, 
the focus on health and safety and 
environmental considerations. However, 
despite some stabilisation in the oil price, 
it is difficult to predict when the delayed 
capital projects will be restarted.
Operationally, we demonstrated our ability 
to react with agility to changing market 
conditions, and our early actions enabled 
us to deliver cost efficiencies ahead of our 
original plans. This protected profitability 
in the second half of the financial year.
The Board
I am pleased to report further progress in 
developing the Board’s role in supporting 
and reviewing the Group’s strategy for 
long-term growth. I believe that the 
scope and effectiveness of this process 
is now delivering results which can be 
clearly seen in the various strategic 
and organisational achievements 
noted above. As a Board, we continue 
to monitor closely the achievement 
of business objectives alongside the 
oversight of risks and the maintenance 
of strong governance processes.
Dividend
AVEVA has a progressive dividend policy, 
reflecting the Board’s confidence in the 
underlying strength of the business and 
its ability to deliver profitable long-term 
growth and strong cash generation. 
Consequently, the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 25 pence (2014 – 
22 pence), an increase of 14% over the 
prior year, payable on 3 August 2015 to 
shareholders on the register on 3 July 
2015. This gives a full year dividend of 
30.5 pence (2014 – 27 pence), an increase 
of 13% over last year.
Outlook
I believe that the quality and commitment 
of the AVEVA team worldwide has 
been central to our ability to show the 
resilience of our business in the face of 
more challenging and uncertain market 
conditions, and on behalf of the Board 
I would like to thank everyone in the 
organisation for the effort and dedication 
that has enabled us to achieve this.
The Board is convinced that there continues 
to be exciting growth opportunities for 
AVEVA in the coming years, and that the 
strength of the long-term fundamentals 
across our various end markets remains 
undiminished. We will continue to focus  
on managing our cost base to further 
improve efficiency. As a result, we 
are confident in our ability to make 
further progress in capitalising on these 
opportunities in the future.

AMERICAS
North America has remained a buoyant 
market supported by our Global Accounts. 
Latin America remains challenging with 
particular weakness in Brazil.
OIL & GAS
The lower oil price is currently 
impacting investment in 
offshore exploration and 
production, while refining 
has benefited from lower 
feedstock prices.
EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST 
AND AFRICA
We have seen a mixed market in Europe, 
with weakness from Oil & Gas in the UK 
and Norway. This was offset by growth 
from our global EPC accounts.
POWER
Solid long-term growth 
expected in all sectors, 
driven by increasing demand 
for electricity generation, 
particularly in Asia.
ASIA PACIFIC
Greater China offers good opportunities 
for long-term growth. We experienced a 
more mixed demand backdrop in North 
East Asia through reduction in offshore 
engineering spend.

Strategy review
Our objectives Our strategy
Strategic report
Customer demand for greater 
technology innovation 
combined with constantly 
changing global market 
conditions have shaped 
AVEVA’s strategy over the last 
four decades. Our success 
has been achieved by finding 
a balance between firm 
commitments to our core 
strengths and creating an 
agile organisation that can 
recognise and respond to 
new business opportunities. 
Building on our strengths
Helping our customers to create a Digital 
Asset that improves project predictability 
and operational reliability is core to our 
vision and mission, and central to our 
key business objectives: to build on our 
technology strengths and effectively align 
priorities that drive decisions and guide 
our planning. As we grow our business, 
our strategic goals are to expand our 
geographic presence in strong markets, 
target new customer profiles, expand the 
role we play with existing customers, and 
diversify our end market exposure. These 
ambitious objectives touch on virtually 
every aspect of our business and are a 
priority for all our employees around the 
world. To ensure the greatest possible 
success, these objectives are clearly 
understood throughout our organisation 
and they underpin all of our business 
planning processes.

Opportunity
AVEVA is investing in the tremendous 
opportunities in the downstream 
market in North America which is 
transformational to the industry. 
We also recognise the continued 
importance of high growth and 
emerging economies worldwide and 
will continue to invest in customer 
service and support infrastructure 
in these important regions.
 • Continue to shift investment balance 
to high growth markets including 
North America, Middle East, India 
and China
 • Focus building our reputation within 
key downstream regions such as 
Middle East, Asia and North America
 • Continue to expand our reach within 
key growth markets to continue  
to drive the highest levels of 
customer support
 • Strengthen our partner ecosystem  
to build new channels.
 • Continually strengthen our global 
brand and localised messaging
Opportunity
AVEVA’s technology and global  
sales network is extremely well 
positioned to help Owner Operators 
meet their safety, production and 
plant availability targets. With asset 
life cycles greater than 25 years and an 
addressable market longer than the

management solutions based  
upon our customers’ need for 
reliable, available and known 
maturity of information.
 • Continue to execute on the step-wise 
approach from Asset Visualisation 
through to Asset Lifecycle 
information management using 
strengths in information standards 
and master data management.
 • Firmly establish thought leadership 
around visual asset management 
taking gaming and touch screen 
technology to a new generation of 
asset owners and operators.
 • Strengthen our partner ecosystem  
to develop our “Enterprise scalability” 
and build new channels.
 • Support Plant operations, the 
integrity of project information and 
the contractual relationships with 
their engineering suppliers.
Opportunity
The launch of AVEVA E3D has helped 
AVEVA grow to a market-leading 
position in 3D design solutions. 
This position, combined with our 
investment in our world-class 
information management, schematics 
and structural solutions, means  
that AVEVA has an unrivalled  
product portfolio for the creation  
and management of the digital asset. 
Looking ahead we seek to strengthen 
our position here by:
 • Extending our 3D dominance with 
AVEVA E3D
 • Build upon our ‘lean’ positioning to 
expand our design install base with 
Integrated Engineering & Design
 • Reach new users with our 
collaborative design vision combining 
our core engineering and information 
management technologies, known 
as Design in Context
 • Continually appraise acquisition 
opportunities to build out our install 
base within AVEVA core verticals
Opportunity
We have an opportunity to continue to 
grow our presence in complimentary 
adjacent verticals such as Steel 
Fabrication and AEC infrastructure 
markets, who share a similar need to 
the energy markets for solutions that 
address the challenges of executing 
complex capital intensive projects.
 • Extend our successful Digital Asset 
solutions into the wider AEC market
 • Continue to grow our footprint in 
adjacent capital intensive industries 
using our Contract Risk Management 
and our Digital Asset solutions
 • Develop our visual thinking position 
for asset visualisation and project 
collaboration into the BIM (Building 
Information Management) market
 • Target steel fabrication market 
with steel detailing and fabrication 
management
 • Building on our strength to manage 
laser data and automate the 
production of intelligent 3D into all 
capital intensive industries
 • Continue to appraise acquisition 
opportunities to increase our 
exposure to wider capital  
intensive industries
 • Strengthen our partner ecosystem  
to reach new markets

Strategic report
“ The resilience of the 
Group’s business 
model has been a  
key feature of the  
past twelve months.”
 Philip Aiken
 Chairman
 19 May 2015
Introduction
Overview
I am pleased to report that AVEVA has 
made good progress in difficult market 
conditions, and that the resilience of the 
Group’s business model has been a key 
feature of the past twelve months.
The full year results reflect our particular 
focus on execution in the second half 
of the financial year. Total recurring 
revenue for the second half of the 
year was up 5%, demonstrating the 
resilience of our business. We were 
also able to deliver the £10.0 million of 
cost efficiencies we had targeted.
Group revenue of £208.7 million (2014 – 
£237.3 million), was in line with our revised 
expectations and adjusted* profit before 
tax was £62.1 million (2014 – £78.3 million), 
resulting in an adjusted profit margin of 
29.8% (2014 – 33.0%). The reported profit 
before tax was £54.9 million (2014 – £69.0 
million). Adjusted basic earnings per share 
declined 16% to 74.51 pence (2014 – 89.05 
pence). Basic earnings per share declined 
17% to 65.07 pence (2014 – 78.12 pence). 
We closed the year with net cash of 
£103.8 million (2014 – £117.5 million).
This result reflects a reduced market 
demand throughout the year due to the 
significantly lower oil price and subsequent 
reduction in customer activity, as well 
as the previously reported weakness in 
South America and North East Asia during 
the first half. The strength of sterling 
also had a pronounced negative effect 
on our reported results, trimming Group 
revenue by 6%, as our overseas revenue 
was translated at less favourable rates 
compared to the last financial year.
Strategic progress
Notwithstanding the tougher market 
backdrop, I am pleased to report that 
AVEVA has continued to make excellent 
strategic progress on a number of 
fronts. This is particularly evident in the 
newly realigned organisation within our 
sales, Research & Development and 
solution delivery activities. A year ago 
we introduced ‘One AVEVA’ to better 
support our Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (EPC) and Owner Operator 
(OO) customers through a single sales 
approach. This has proved to be very 
effective at helping us to grow the number 
of solution sales we make. In addition, we 
have recently unified our development 
teams across all of our solutions and 
technologies and streamlined our solution 
delivery capabilities.
We have continued to make very good 
progress with our Global Accounts. 
Many customers are responding to more 
uncertain markets by investing in new 
technologies from AVEVA to maximise 
competitiveness and efficiency. AVEVA 
E3D has been an outstanding example 
of this and has proved to be a powerful 
catalyst for us to deepen our relationships 
with these key customers. As a result we 
are pleased to be able to report significant 
new contracts with Aker Solutions,WS 
Atkins and KBR, among others.
AVEVA E3D is a clear example of AVEVA’s 
position as the leading innovator within 
its industry. We have also delivered a 
range of new products and functional 
enhancements to many of our other 
products over the last twelve months. Of 
particular note is the Activity Visualisation 
Platform and the new Cloud-enabled 
version of AVEVA E3D, both of which 
have generated much excitement from 
customers in recent months. Over 1,600

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Customers are investing in new  
technologies from AVEVA to maximise  
their competitiveness and efficiency.
During the year we were pleased 
to acquire 8over8 Limited. Based in 
Northern Ireland, 8over8’s core product, 
ProCon™, is a software solution designed 
to minimise risk and increase control 
and capital discipline for some of the 
world’s most complex projects. This 
demonstrates AVEVA is well placed to use 
its balance sheet to deliver well-timed, 
strategically important acquisitions with 
a strong logical fit. We are confident that 
the addition of 8over8 will enable us to 
further broaden our relationships with 
the OO community, and serve to further 
differentiate AVEVA in its markets.
Market environment
The lower oil price has led to a reduction in 
global upstream E&P capital expenditure, 
and it is well documented that a number of 
projects have been postponed or moth-
balled, although the overall effect for 
AVEVA is mixed. This has had an impact 
on our EPC customers, their backlogs and 
general levels of activity.
We have market-leading, well-invested 
technology solutions that underpin our 
competitive advantage across our target 
sectors and geographies. Our mission to 
enable our customers to work globally 
with less risk, shorter lead-times and 
greater business efficiency throughout 
the asset lifecycle ensures we are aligned 
to robust long-term growth drivers, 
particularly given demand for energy, 
the increasing complexity of their assets, 
the focus on health and safety and 
environmental considerations. However, 
despite some stabilisation in the oil price, 
it is difficult to predict when the delayed 
capital projects will be restarted.
Operationally, we demonstrated our ability 
to react with agility to changing market 
conditions, and our early actions enabled 
us to deliver cost efficiencies ahead of our 
original plans. This protected profitability 
in the second half of the financial year.
The Board
I am pleased to report further progress in 
developing the Board’s role in supporting 
and reviewing the Group’s strategy for 
long-term growth. I believe that the 
scope and effectiveness of this process 
is now delivering results which can be 
clearly seen in the various strategic 
and organisational achievements 
noted above. As a Board, we continue 
to monitor closely the achievement 
of business objectives alongside the 
oversight of risks and the maintenance 
of strong governance processes.
Dividend
AVEVA has a progressive dividend policy, 
reflecting the Board’s confidence in the 
underlying strength of the business and 
its ability to deliver profitable long-term 
growth and strong cash generation. 
Consequently, the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 25 pence (2014 – 
22 pence), an increase of 14% over the 
prior year, payable on 3 August 2015 to 
shareholders on the register on 3 July 
2015. This gives a full year dividend of 
30.5 pence (2014 – 27 pence), an increase 
of 13% over last year.
Outlook
I believe that the quality and commitment 
of the AVEVA team worldwide has 
been central to our ability to show the 
resilience of our business in the face of 
more challenging and uncertain market 
conditions, and on behalf of the Board 
I would like to thank everyone in the 
organisation for the effort and dedication 
that has enabled us to achieve this.
The Board is convinced that there continues 
to be exciting growth opportunities for 
AVEVA in the coming years, and that the 
strength of the long-term fundamentals 
across our various end markets remains 
undiminished. We will continue to focus  
on managing our cost base to further 
improve efficiency. As a result, we 
are confident in our ability to make 
further progress in capitalising on these 
opportunities in the future.

Digital Assets that shape  
our world
Managing continual change
Recent major fluctuations in the global energy market clearly 
demonstrate the difficulty of our customers’ business. They are 
building and operating highly complex assets costing billions of 
dollars that require an army of skilled professionals across a huge 
range of disciplines and specialities. Managing this environment in 
the best of times is difficult, but when changing market conditions 
demand business agility, the challenge grows even more difficult.
At AVEVA we are helping our customers take on these challenges 
with software solutions that give them the engineering, design 
and information management tools they need to create a more 
agile business. This is what our Digital Asset approach is all about. 
By partnering with AVEVA our customers can create a trusted 
source of information that is accessible throughout the entire life 
cycle of an asset; from front-end design until decommissioning. 
This strategy means that EPCs and Shipbuilders can achieve 
greater project predictability and OOs can improve productivity, 
safety and reliability. 
However, no organisation can achieve these results on their own. 
The complexities of the constantly evolving challenges demand 
that we work closely with our customers in a genuine partnership. 
To do this we must understand their organisation, the technical 
disciplines and the local culture and business climate. Operating 
in over 50 locations around the world staffed by a team of industry 
experts, we are uniquely positioned to understand the needs 
of our customers and respond with solutions that help them 
achieve their goals. This infrastructure is a major investment for 
AVEVA, but it also brings great benefits to our business and that 
of our customers. Over the decades we have formed long-term 
relationships with our customers and our shared vision of a  
Digital Asset is truly shaping the world around us.

CAPEX
While there is a great diversity in the types of 
major capital projects, one thing they all have 
in common is the need to find an effective 
balance between quality, time and cost. AVEVA’s 
project solutions are all focused on increasing 
predictability through a wide range of features 
and capabilities. They give project stakeholders 
the design, engineering and information 
standards they need to understand and 
control their project environment. 
OPEX
The operational demands of a complex asset 
are relentless. They are in a constant state of 
change, requiring continual maintenance and 
improvement. Operators must be in a position to 
thoroughly monitor and manage the life cycle of 
the asset to reduce risk, optimise efficiency and 
comply with regulatory authorities. To support 
this process, AVEVA’s solutions for operational 
activities are designed to increase asset reliability, 
by ensuring that OOs have the information they 
need to easily visualise the status of an asset to 
make rapid and informed decisions. 7 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

INTEGRATED PROJECT EXECUTION
The IPE strategy employs best practice standards 
to improve on-schedule completion and the 
quality of deliverables for major capital projects. 
The ability to access project data across all 
engineering disciplines allows efficient control, 
communication and response to change and 
inconsistencies, enabling business processes 
to collaborate in a highly efficient way and 
improved communication with the asset owner.
INTEGRATED SHIPBUILDING
AVEVA offers the most complete solution for 
integrating all aspects of the shipbuilding process, 
enabling effective information sharing and 
workflow management. By creating a trusted 
and open Digital Asset, AVEVA’s Integrated 
Shipbuilding strategy delivers maximum 
capability and effective collaboration within the 
shipyard and across globally distributed suppliers. 
OPERATIONS INTEGRITY 
MANAGEMENT
At the centre of an OIM strategy is the 
Digital Asset, connecting capabilities and 
processes to enhance operational reliability. 
Removing the barriers between information 
silos is crucial to a successful OIM strategy, 
improving information quality to provide reliable 
information for decision support, delivering 
safe, reliable and efficient operations. 
INTEGRATED ENGINEERING  
& DESIGN
The IE&D solution dramatically improves design 
and engineering process efficiency for major 
capital projects, as well as for asset modification 
and revamps. A unique ‘Compare & Update’ and 
‘Change Highlighting’ functionality allows project 
disciplines to easily and dynamically share design 
and engineering information in order to control 
the iterative design spiral.
ENTERPRISE RESOURCE 
MANAGEMENT
The ERM solution delivers measurable ROI 
throughout every step of the material management, 
planning and construction process. This easy-
to-use solution ensures efficient planning and 
execution of a marine or plant project and optimum 
management of multiple projects to create 
significant competitive advantage.
DIGITAL ASSET SOLUTIONS
The information management capabilities offer a 
range of solutions for EPCs, OOs and shipbuilders 
based on our unique AVEVA NET technology. 
They create an open environment that provides 
access to information regardless of the 
application source. The result is a single, trusted 
source of information that reduces risk through 
rapid and better-informed decision making. 8 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Creating a business that responds to the 
needs of our customers
At the core of AVEVA’s business is the 
intellectual property generated in our 
software products. The Group sells its 
proprietary software products by licensing 
rights to use the software directly to 
customers through our network of global 
sales offices. This strategy provides 
customers with local sales and support 
and helps AVEVA to work closely with 
leading companies principally in the Oil  
& Gas, Power and Marine markets.

We operate a ‘right-to-use’ licensing model 
for our software. Typically, customers 
licence our software for a specified 
number of users by paying an initial licence 
fee followed by an obligatory annual fee or 
by paying a rental fee over a fixed period 
of time. In both cases, the customer has 
to continue to pay a fee in order to use the 
software. This model continues to provide 
a strong recurring revenue base for AVEVA 
which allows us to invest in the future 
roadmap of our products.
The amount of service required to deploy 
our software varies depending on the 
type of solution. Typically our services 
consist of consulting, implementation

Driving innovation
Innovation across our business
Innovation
Innovation is one of our core values and 
underpins the culture and behaviours 
of our employees around the globe. 
Our history is marked with a series of 
impressive firsts, from the world’s first 3D 
plant design system, first internet-based 
engineering information management 
platform, first integrated plant and marine 
design solution through to the release of 
AVEVA E3D in 2013. It is what drives our 
success and has continued to differentiate 
us in the markets we serve.
Long-term relationships
AVEVA is particularly proud of the long-
term relationships we have established 
with our customers. Some companies 
have used our software for more than 
30 years and there are many with 
relationships that have lasted well 
beyond a decade. These connections 
are based on mutual trust and are rooted 
in the lasting value that our software 
and support provides. Our customer-
centric business approach is designed 
specifically to create and foster these 
critically important relationships.
Flexible ‘right-to-use’ revenue model
Our right-to-use software licensing model 
provides not only a secure and consistent 
revenue stream for AVEVA, but also gives 
our customers the flexibility to select 
products and licence configurations. 
This can be a major advantage for both 
projects and operations as companies 
can choose the required software 
resources for the different phases of 
their project and asset life cycle. Extra 
licensing agility helps to improve the 
competitiveness of our customers.
Committed team 
The AVEVA team is our greatest asset. 
To meet the changing and demanding 
needs of our customers, we have built 
a team of discipline experts from Sales 
and Marketing to Development and 
Services and all of the critical support 
functions that enable our success. While 
our people are geographically dispersed 
around the world, we remain informed 
and coordinated through our matrix 
organisational structure.
AVEVA’S DIGITAL 
ASSET APPROACH
AVEVA’s unique Digital Asset approach builds 
an integrated information framework that 
continuously represents the true current state  
of the physical asset. 
It provides deep application integration 
where real-time information sharing between 
disciplines is critical to success. It is open, 
enabling data and documents created in  
almost any software to be easily accessed  
and validated. www.aveva.com/digitalasset Americas Europe, Middle E ast & Africa Asia Paciﬁc

Summary of 
Performance
Resilience in difficult markets
The financial year 2014/15 proved the 
resilience of AVEVA’s business model, 
given the mixed trading environment we 
experienced. Our revenue mix, broad 
international reach and strong competitive 
positioning proved to be key strengths. 
Our emphasis was on execution in the 
second half of the year and I am pleased 
to say that we were able to deliver the 
£10.0 million of cost efficiencies we had 
targeted. Full year constant currency 
revenue of £220.4 million (2014 – 
£237.3 million) reflected a second half 
performance in line with the previous 
year, with an increase in annual fees and 
rental licences broadly flat despite the 
difficult market backdrop. Rental deals that 
had shifted into the second half closed 
successfully in line with expectations. 
We were also able to demonstrate that 
the significant investment we have made 
in Research & Development in recent 
years has been well-timed, enabling us 
to expand our penetration within Global 
Accounts despite the difficult economic 
backdrop facing many of our customers.
Overall, I am pleased with the strategic 
and operational progress we have made 
during the period. We have continued to 
expand our sales to OOs through a more 
coordinated approach, founded upon the 
‘One AVEVA’ sales strategy, implemented 
at the start of the year. 
This has had the effect of increasing 
solution sales to customers and positions 
us well for the future. We also continued 
our strategy of reinvesting cash in 
strategically important acquisitions, with 
the addition of 8over8 Limited in January 
2015, an industry-leading provider of 
contract risk management solutions.
Over the course of the year, we have seen 
substantially more challenging conditions 
in our Oil & Gas end market, which 
represents around 45% of Group revenue, 
with the material weakening in the oil price 
leading to sharp reductions in exploration 
and production capital expenditure. In 
addition to this, our business in Latin 
America was further impacted by Brazil’s 
ongoing political difficulties. In the Marine 
market, global shipbuilding activity 
remained subdued, driven by ongoing 
over-capacity, reduction in new orders for 
specialist off-shore vessels and relatively 
low global GDP growth. In the Power 
market, we continued to see steady single 
digit growth.
We have an international business with 
over 50 offices operating in more than 
30 countries worldwide. Sterling has 
strengthened materially during the course 
of our financial year, in particular against 
the Euro but also against many other 
currencies in which we do business, and 
we saw a 6% negative translation impact 
on our reported revenue. This is covered in 
more detail in the Finance Review. 17 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Our vision of the Digital Asset is enabling our 
customers to manage continued change as 
they deliver and operate some of the world’s 
most complex assets.
Why customers in our end markets buy 
our software
Our software is used by our customers 
as they design, build and operate large 
capital-intensive assets, in the Process, 
Power and Marine industries. We sell our 
solutions principally to the EPC companies, 
shipyards and OO customers worldwide. 
Our vision of the Digital Asset is enabling 
our customers to manage continual 
change as they deliver and operate some 
of the world’s most complex assets.
Increasingly, our customers are 
demanding a combination of our products 
and this, backed by our ‘One AVEVA’ sales 
strategy, is driving wider adoption of the 
entire AVEVA product portfolio delivering 
strong upsell opportunities. This has been 
particularly evident in the success we 
have achieved in expanding our footprint 
within our Global Accounts. Other notable 
customers opting for a broader portfolio of 
our products include Southern California 
Gas Company, a good example of an OO 
combining a range of AVEVA applications 
in order to improve capital efficiency, 
reliability and compliance.
Engineering & Design Systems (EDS) 
review and drivers
As a result of the difficult end markets our 
EDS business was subdued. Revenue for 
this line of business declined by 14% to 
£182.7 million, reflecting in particular the 
downturn in Brazil and South Korea where 
rental licence renewals were depressed in 
the first half of the year. Our initial licence 
business was influenced principally by 
the reduced levels of activity among our 
Asian shipyard customers compared to 
the previous year. Nevertheless, sales of 
AVEVA E3D continued to gain momentum 
throughout the year and we have achieved 
significant strategic progress with our 
Global Accounts. In general, rental 
renewals remained robust among our key 
accounts, and we concluded significant 
deals with Aker Solutions, Jacobs 
Engineering, Technip, WorleyParsons and 
AMEC Foster Wheeler, among others.
Enterprise Solutions (ES) review 
and drivers
The market backdrop for our information 
management products has been 
challenging, with lengthy sales cycles  
and pressures on discretionary spend 
amongst our customers. This was 
reflected in the financial performance  
for this line of business which did not 
deliver the level of growth that we 
expected, with revenue of £24.8 million 
(2014 – £25.9 million), excluding the 
impact of the acquired 8over8 business. 
However, the innovations delivered to our 
customers this year are driving increased 
demand for our solutions to create and 
manage our customers’ Digital Assets. 
Despite the tough market backdrop, there 
were a number of notable projects during 
the period including Husky, Davie, BASF 
and BAE. We also successfully completed 
important milestones at Chevron’s 
Wheatstone project and at ConocoPhillips.

Regional performance
Across our three main regions, we saw a 
mixed performance. Asia Pacific was down 
20% in the year on a constant currency 
basis, which reflected a reduction in initial 
licence fees compared to a very strong 
performance a year ago, as well as a 
particular weakness in South Korea where 
our shipyard customers have experienced 
lower activity levels due to a reduction in 
offshore Oil & Gas projects.
Revenue in EMEA and the Americas 
on a constant currency basis was 
broadly flat compared to the prior 
year, reflecting weakness in Brazil 
and parts of EMEA offset by growth 
from our Global Accounts.
Further details on our regional performance 
are contained in the Finance Review.
Our Focus
Long-term opportunity in global 
growth markets
Our business remains strongly 
positioned in its target markets, where 
the fundamentals support long-term 
growth. Despite the near-term effects 
of a weaker oil price, over the long term, 
with increased energy usage and a 
growing global population, significant 
infrastructure investment will be 
required in order to meet demand; the 
International Energy Authority (IEA) 
estimates that global energy demand 
will increase by 37% by 2040, with the 
majority of this increase occurring in 
China and India. Oil & Gas is increasingly 
difficult to extract, necessitating more 
hours to be spent in detailed design. 
This is set against a backdrop where the 
IEA forecast that liquids demand alone 
is set to rise from 87 million to 98 million 
barrels per day within just five years. Our 
software is critical to solving the biggest 
engineering challenges in the harshest 
environments. With similar fundamental 
drivers, Power offers attractive growth 
opportunities over the long term as the 
world’s emerging economies invest in 
their power generation requirements and 
the ageing infrastructure of the developed 
world is maintained and replaced. Our 
global presence and international reach 
positions us well to capitalise on these 
opportunities. Meanwhile, in times of 
Innovation leadership driving 
new opportunities
Our commitment to being the leading 
innovator in our industry remains 
undiminished and customer feedback on 
the products showcased at our AVEVA 
World Summit in October 2014 was 
hugely positive. With AVEVA E3D gaining 
momentum in the market, the next step 
will be the Cloud-enabled version. We 
demonstrated a full function version of 
AVEVA E3D on a Cloud platform proving 
no difference in performance to a locally 
installed solution. The addition of a Cloud-
based solution will offer customers rapid 
deployment as well as the flexibility to mix 
both cloud and on premise users in the 
same project. The Cloud technology is 
already being tested by several customers 
as part of our early adopter programme. 
Building on our position as the industry 
leader in visualisation technology, we 
demonstrated our new ability to ‘walk 
through’ laser scans in an environment 
indistinguishable from the actual facility. 
We also demonstrated combined AVEVA 
E3D and AVEVA NET™ technology on a 
large touchscreen that is now with early 
adopter clients, including Lundin and Shell, 
to demonstrate the next generation in 
navigating project and asset information 
in context.
We also announced major enhancements 
to AVEVA NET with improved 3D interaction 
and faster, more powerful search, 
visualisation and navigation capabilities.
Elsewhere, the launch of our new 
Information Standards Manager has been 
well received by customers. AVEVA ISM™ 
bridges the gap between OOs and EPCs, 
enabling greater control over critical 
engineering information standards across 
their projects and enterprises.
We have an exciting product pipeline 
over the medium term, particularly as our 
design tools and information management 
solutions continue to converge.
Our business remains strongly positioned in 
its target markets, where the fundamentals 
support long-term growth. 19 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
uncertainty we are focused on supporting 
our customers as they seek to become 
more efficient and adapt to the fast 
changing environment.
Our strong position in engineering design 
also offers us a unique opportunity to 
support the lifecycle of the assets our 
software tools are used to create. Our 
information management solutions, 
with the support of our growing partner 
network, are increasingly relevant to a 
wide range of asset-intensive industries 
beyond the core markets we have 
traditionally served.
Solution sales, our organisation and the 
convergence of technologies
We have been pursuing a strategy of 
increasing the number of solution sales 
we make, whereby customers opt for a 
number of our products and we increase 
our footprint within our customer base. 
With this in mind, we reported at the 
interim stage that we had realigned 
our sales organisation behind a ‘One 
AVEVA’ approach in order to better 
promote the entire AVEVA product 
range to all customers, supporting both 
design and operations. As previously 
indicated, we have also unified our 
technology organisation, following the 
convergence of our two key product 
areas, detailed engineering design and 
information management. Finally, the 
Digital Asset is now firmly reinforced 
as the vision that lies at the heart of 
our service organisation, to better 
focus on service delivery and grow our 
specialist service capabilities over time.
We expect that this streamlined solutions 
and product strategy will deliver major 
benefits to our business in coming years as 
our technologies are used increasingly in 
combination. Our future financial reporting 
will, from 2015/16, also be re-aligned 
behind this convergence and this year 
is the last in which we will disclose EDS 
and ES as our primary segments. From 
2015/16, we are monitoring the business 
on a regional basis and, therefore, this will 
become our primary method of segmental 
financial reporting.
Development of the partner channel
We continue to strengthen our 
partnerships with leading consulting, 
technology and outsourcing companies as 
we build our presence in the operational 
lifecycle of the asset. During the period 
we announced a global alliance with 
Capgemini to cover asset-intensive 
industries. Capgemini’s Digital Asset 
Lifecycle Management (DiALM) solution 
is based on AVEVA’s information 
management technology and enables 
OOs to control and manage project and 
operational performance of their assets. 
We are already supporting Capgemini on 
the Nuclear New Build programme in the 
UK and we expect this agreement to help 
extend our presence within our existing 
markets and into the other asset-intensive 
industries served by Capgemini, for 
example transport. We also announced a 
new collaboration with EMC to deliver an 
integrated software solution for capital 
projects and asset operations. Under 
the terms of this agreement, AVEVA 
and EMC have combined the two best-
in-class product suites, AVEVA NET and 
EMC® Documentum® Engineering, Plant 
and Facilities Management (EPFM), into a 
single solution. Elsewhere, we formalised 
our partnership agreement with ETAP 
for seamless data exchange on the most 
complex electrical installations in all types 
of process and power plants, ships and 
offshore facilities.
Strong growth from AVEVA E3D
As mentioned above, AVEVA E3D has 
proven to be a catalyst for more solution 
sales particularly within our Global 
Accounts business, but we are also making 
progress across the rest of our customer 
base. Notable deals in the period included 
WS Atkins, who have chosen AVEVA E3D 
and Laser Modeller™ to support lean 
construction processes. KBR selected 
AVEVA E3D for global projects as part of 
a complete integrated engineering and 
design environment. Tianchen, one of 
China’s largest engineering contractors 
in the chemical processing industry, 
standardised on AVEVA E3D. D3SCOM 
Engineering Sdn. Bhd., a specialist in 
intelligent modelling engineering services, 
also adopted AVEVA E3D and Laser 
Modeller for brownfield projects with 
Owner Operators in Malaysia.
Management of our cost base
Recognising the more difficult trading 
conditions in the first half of the financial 
year, we took early action to achieve cost-
efficiencies. This, combined with lower 
sales commissions and bonuses during 
the period, has enabled us to limit the 
impact on profitability caused by lower 
than planned revenue. In addition, we have 
taken further action to address the cost 
base by rationalising some of our regional 
offices and reducing headcount in some 
areas of the business. This will deliver 
annualised savings of approximately  
£3.0 million which will help offset the cost 
increases we face in 2015/16 as a result of 
inflation, increased bonus and commission 
costs and the annualised effect of new 
hires made in 2014/15.
Our Achievements
Strategic progress with Global Accounts
Our Global Accounts EPC program 
continued to bear fruit over the past 
year. The challenges seen in our end 
user markets are prompting our Global 
Accounts to take the opportunity to 
invest in the latest AVEVA technologies in 
order to maximise their competitiveness 
and business advantage. The integrated 
Bubbleview™ laser capability within AVEVA 
E3D is now making this solution the de 
facto standard for all future brownfield 
projects, eliminating or reducing re-
modelling activities by over 90%. Beyond 
AVEVA E3D, there is also increased uptake 
and deployment of AVEVA NET across our 
Global Accounts, as they continue their 
journey towards true data-centric working 
built around a trusted digital asset.
I am especially pleased to be able to 
report a new significant contract with Aker 
Solutions of Norway which builds on the 
fantastic relationship we have enjoyed 
with them over the last 20 years. Aker 
has invested in PDMS™ throughout this 
period and is now using this platform to 
develop and deploy AVEVA E3D across 
their business. This is a good example of 
how we are deepening the relationships 
with our customers whilst increasing the 
revenue opportunity. 20 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Chief Executive’s strategic review
continued
Strategic report
We now have more than 230 customers 
who have licensed AVEVA E3D, and 
the cumulative revenue to date since 
launch has exceeded £11.0 million. Thus, 
as we look at the current financial year 
AVEVA E3D is expected to be a material 
contributor to revenue for the first time 
and the long-term outlook is exciting.
Strategic development through M&A
The acquisition of 8over8 Limited in 
January 2015 was strategically important 
and is being integrated according to 
plan. 8over8’s core software platform, 
ProCon, is sold principally to organisations 
that design, build and operate high 
value assets, where it is used as a risk 
management tool for increased project 
control and capital discipline. Acquiring 
this business is an example of how we can 
use M&A as a strategic tool for growing 
our business into related technologies and 
market areas and shows our disciplined 
approach to acquisitions. There is a 
strong logical fit and we have several 
AVEVA NET customers who have ProCon 
implemented alongside our solution. 
AVEVA has always had the capabilities for 
managing changes in design and other 
data via our existing tools and solutions 
and now ProCon brings us the capability 
to manage the impact of those changes 
on a project’s cost and outcome. We are, 
therefore, optimistic that this acquisition 
opens up a range of new opportunities 
for growth both in our existing markets 
and other related industries.
It is a testament to the dedication of all of 
our people around the world that we were 
able to deliver significant cost efficiencies 
in the second half of the year and looking 
ahead we shall have an even greater 
focus on costs during the current financial 
year. Whilst we recognise the challenges 
in our markets, we are focused on the 
opportunities that lie before us both 
strategically and operationally. As a result, 
the Board is confident that we can achieve 
our growth targets over the medium term.

The Future
Adapting to shifting customer priorities
Efficiency is even more important than 
ever for our customers and it is AVEVA’s 
goal to provide the tools to deal with ever 
shorter time-frames and greater cost 
constraints. Via the creation of the Digital 
Asset we help our customers to focus on 
profitability and a lean organisation. This 
is a journey for our customers, many of 
whom are now placing the Digital Asset 
at the heart of their technology vision. 
Our solutions in the design world are 
increasingly being called upon to integrate 
information about the ‘as-built’ asset, via 
integrated laser modelling capabilities, as 
well as operational asset information, via 
AVEVA NET. As a result OOs can extend 
the life of their assets whilst our EPC 
customers can use our solutions to design 
more efficient assets, handling the data in 
the project phase far more efficiently and 
incorporating operational lessons learned 
ready to handover to the operator.
Summary and outlook
For much of the year under review AVEVA 
has faced more challenging market 
conditions. We have been particularly 
affected by the reduction in activity in the 
upstream Oil & Gas sector. Over time we 
expect capital investment in Oil & Gas 
infrastructure to return to growth, but 
the timing of this is uncertain. Despite 
the mixed trading environment, we have 
demonstrated our ability to capitalise on 
our strengths: a broad international reach 
and strong competitive positioning in all 
of our markets. We aim to continue to 
lead through innovation and, as has been 
demonstrated by the milestones achieved 
with AVEVA E3D, to drive growth through 
exciting new offerings.
Increasingly our customers are demanding a 
combination of our products and this, backed 
by our ‘one AVEVA’ sales strategy, is driving 
wider adoption of all our products. 21 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Principal risks and uncertainties
As with any organisation there are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which 
could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The principal risks 
and uncertainties faced by the Group are as follows:
Strategic and market risks
Strategic report
Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation
Dependency on key markets
AVEVA generates a substantial amount of its income 
from customers whose main business is derived from 
capital projects in the Oil & Gas, Power and Marine 
markets. World economic conditions or funding 
constraints for new capital projects may adversely  
affect our financial performance, as we have  
experienced during 2014/15.
AVEVA is expanding into new market segments 
such as mining, petrochemicals and AEC, albeit 
from a relatively small base. It is central to our 
strategy to diversify our customer offerings into 
Owner Operators and Plant operations. This will 
help secure a longer-term income stream that 
extends beyond the design/build phase of these 
capital projects. In addition, our ever-expanding 
global presence provides some mitigation from 
over-reliance on key geographic markets.
Likelihood Impact Change
Competition
AVEVA operates in highly competitive markets that serve 
the Oil & Gas, Power and Marine markets. We believe 
that there are a relatively small number of significant 
competitors serving our markets. However, some of 
these competitors could, in the future, pose a greater 
competitive threat, particularly if they consolidate or form 
strategic or commercial relationships among themselves 
or with larger, well capitalised companies. Further threats 
are posed by the entrance, into AVEVA’s markets, of a 
much larger technology competitor or transformational 
technology, such as Cloud-based solutions.
We carefully monitor customers and other suppliers 
operating within our chosen markets. We stay close 
to our customers and ensure we have a strong 
understanding of their needs and their expectations 
from the AVEVA product development roadmap.
Recently we have launched AVEVA E3D.  
This, together with a number of other new 
products, will help cement our relationships with 
our customers and reinforce our market position.
Likelihood Impact Change
Professional Services
The development of the Group’s Enterprise Solutions 
represents a significant opportunity for the Group but 
this is a market with different characteristics compared to 
our traditional Engineering & Design software products. 
It therefore brings different challenges and opportunities 
for the Group which we must manage effectively.
Most significantly, the deployment for our customers 
of an enterprise solution will involve some degree of 
consulting and/or implementation work. This requires 
specialist knowledge to be available and well managed 
potentially in many geographic locations. In some 
instances we may opt to partner with a third party for 
this work and this relationship also requires careful 
management and maintenance. 
We employ experienced industry professionals 
within our professional services team and continue 
to build commercial partnerships with third party 
systems integrators and other vendors.
We have rigorous processes and controls for the 
appraisal of potential commercial opportunities 
prior to any bid being submitted. Bids are appraised 
on grounds of technical complexity, as well as 
financial and commercial risk.
Likelihood Impact Change
Identification and successful integration of acquisitions
In recent years, the Group has completed a number 
of acquisitions and expects to continue to review 
acquisition targets as part of its strategy. The integration 
of acquisitions involves a number of unique risks, 
including diversion of management’s attention, failure 
to retain key personnel of the acquired business, failure 
to realise the benefits anticipated to result from the 
acquisition, and successful integration of the acquired 
intellectual property.
While each acquisition and integration is unique, 
AVEVA has an experienced team to appraise and 
complete acquisitions. The Group’s experience 
of previous ‘bolt-on’ acquisitions provides a good 
understanding of potential integration risks and as 
a result we feel well placed to successfully manage 
these risks. Were the Group to undertake a much 
larger acquisition, we would ensure that appropriate 
resources and experience were applied to manage 
the risks and that we had access to the best possible 
professional advice. 23 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Protection of intellectual property
The Group’s success has been built upon the 
development of its substantial intellectual property 
rights and the future growth of the business requires the 
continual protection of these tools. 
The protection of the Group’s proprietary software 
products is achieved by licensing rights to use 
the application, rather than selling or licensing 
the computer source code. The Group uses third 
party technology to encrypt, protect and restrict 
access to its products. Access limitations and rights 
are also defined within the terms of the software 
licence agreement. The Group seeks to ensure that 
its intellectual property rights are appropriately 
protected by law and seeks to vigorously assert its 
proprietary rights wherever possible.
Likelihood Impact Change
Research & Development
The Group makes substantial investments in Research 
& Development in enhancing existing products and 
introducing new products and must effectively appraise 
its investment decisions and ensure that we continue to 
provide class-leading solutions that meet the needs of 
our markets. 
Our software products are complex and new products or 
enhancements may contain undetected errors, failures, 
performance problems or defects which may impact our 
strong reputation with our customers.
AVEVA continually reviews the alignment of the 
activities of our Research & Development teams 
to ensure that they remain focused on areas that 
will meet the demands of our customers and 
deliver appropriate financial returns. This process 
is managed by developing a product roadmap that 
identifies the schedule for new products and the 
enhancements that will be made to successive 
versions of existing products. Products are 
extensively tested prior to commercial launch.
Likelihood Impact Change
International operations
The Group has offices in 30 countries and must 
determine how best to utilise its resources across these 
diverse markets. Where necessary, the business must 
adapt its market approach to best capitalise on local 
market opportunities, particularly in the strategically key 
growth economies.
In addition, the Group is required to comply with the 
local laws, regulations and tax legislation in each of 
these jurisdictions. Significant changes in these laws and 
regulations or failure to comply with them could lead 
to additional liabilities and penalties and damage to the 
Group’s reputation. 
The Group manages its overseas operations by 
employing locally qualified personnel who are able 
to provide expertise in the appropriate language 
and an understanding of local culture, custom 
and practice. Local management is supported by 
local professional advisers and further oversight is 
maintained from the Group’s corporate legal and 
finance functions.
Likelihood Impact Change
Recruitment and retention of employees
AVEVA’s success has been built on the quality and reputation 
of its products and services, which rely almost entirely on 
the quality of the people developing and delivering them. In 
addition, we have a number of senior employees who have 
strong domain knowledge of and expertise in the industries 
that we serve. Managing this pool of highly skilled and 
motivated individuals across all disciplines and geographies 
remains key to our ongoing success. 
The Group endeavours to ensure that employees are 
motivated in their work and there are regular appraisals, 
with staff encouraged to develop their skills. Annually 
there is a Group-wide salary review that rewards strong 
performance and ensures salaries remain competitive. 
Short term and long term incentive arrangements 
help to ensure the success of the Group and individual 
achievement is appropriately rewarded.
Risk Likelihood Impact Change Mitigation
Foreign exchange risk
Exposure to foreign currency gains and losses can be 
material to the Group, with more than 80% of the Group’s 
revenue denominated in a currency other than sterling, of 
which our two largest are US Dollar and Euro. 
The overseas subsidiaries predominantly trade in 
their own local currencies, which acts as a partial 
natural hedge against currency movements. In 
addition, the Group enters into forward foreign 
currency contracts to manage the risk where material 
and practical. The Group limits its hedging of revenue 
to US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen and its hedging of 
costs to Swedish Krona and Indian Rupee.

Total revenue for the year was £208.7 million which was down 12% compared to 2013/14 
(2014 – £237.3 million). Included in the results is £1.1 million from 8over8 Limited, the 
business we acquired in January 2015. Our organic revenue on a constant currency basis 
was £220.4 million, which was down 7% compared to 2013/14.
Following H1 revenue of £92.3 million (2014 – £108.5 million) on an organic, constant 
currency basis, the second half of the year delivered organic, constant currency revenue 
of £128.1 million. This was broadly flat compared to 2013/14 (2014 – £128.8 million) 
and was a good, resilient performance considering the market conditions we faced, 
particularly in Oil & Gas. 25 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our business is well positioned for future 
growth with a sound financial footing and 
solid business model.
Adjusted profit before tax was £62.1 million (2014 – £78.3 million) and on a reported 
basis, profit before tax was £54.9 million (2014 – £69.0 million). Within this, the acquired 
8over8 business contributed a loss of £0.6m in the short period since the acquisition on 
5 January 2015.

Asia Pacific 67.3 69.3 86.9 (20%)
Total revenue 207 .6 220.4 237 .3 (7%)
As highlighted within the interim results, revenue was impacted by foreign exchange on 
the retranslation of our overseas subsidiaries by £12.8 million or 6%. EMEA was impacted 
most significantly as a result of the weakness of the Euro and Russian rouble.
EMEA
In EMEA, reported revenue was down 8%. On a constant currency basis, revenue was 
broadly flat at £112.9 million (2014 – £112.0 million) and reflected a mixed performance 
across the countries we operate in. Annual fees grew by 8% which was principally from 
the larger Owner Operators. Rental fees increased by 3% mainly driven by growth from 
the Global EPC accounts, many of whom have signed multi-year contracts, and an 
acceleration in sales of AVEVA E3D. This was offset by reduced usage by some EPCs in the 
UK and Norway with offshore Oil & Gas exposure. Initial licence fees were down 7% due 
to tougher market conditions generally in Central Europe which was offset by a robust 
performance in Russia despite the political situation and the threat of sanctions for some 
of our customers. Services were down 16% due to lower levels of activity for Enterprise 
Solutions within some of the Owner Operators.
Americas
In the Americas, reported revenue was down 4%. On a constant currency basis, the 
performance was broadly flat with revenue of £38.2 million (2014 – £38.4 million). Within 
this we saw a good level of renewals within our Global EPC accounts based in the US 
which was offset by the performance in Latin America which was down 28% compared to 
last year. Our Brazilian customers continued to be impacted by the lower levels of activity 
in Oil & Gas and this resulted in Americas’ rental fee revenue declining by 6%. Initial 
licence fees grew by 34% and services by 8% illustrating our success in selling into Owner 
Operators in North America demonstrating that the increased focus is beginning to show 
benefits. Annual fees increased by 2% following the increase in initial licence fees.

Strategic report
We saw double digit growth in China 
driven by customers in the Power and 
Process industries.
Asia Pacific
Revenue in Asia Pacific was down 23%  
on a reported basis and down 20% on  
a constant currency basis which reflected  
a mixed picture across the geographies 
that we operate in. As indicated at the 
half year, we have seen lower levels 
of activity in the offshore Oil & Gas 
projects in South Korea and parts of 
South East Asia. In 2013/14, we benefited 
from some large initial licence fees in 
South Korea which have not repeated 
in 2014/15 resulting in a decline of 46%. 
On a positive note we saw double digit 
growth in China driven by customers 
in the Power and Process industries.
Annual fees increased by 22% due 
to the strong initial licence fees in 
2013/14, and we also benefitted by 
approximately £3.0 million from Chinese 
customers who had stopped paying 
annual fees and wanted to reactivate, 
for which we charge a catch-up fee.
As highlighted in the interim results, 
customers in Asia Pacific often use rental 
licences to flex their usage over and 
above their core entitlement under the 
initial/annual licences. Because of the 
lower levels of activity, some customers 
have not renewed their rental licences. 
We also had one large customer who, 
towards the end of 2013/14, changed 
the structure of their arrangement 
from a rental to an initial licence model. 
As a result, rental licence fees were 
down 26% compared to last year.
Revenue by category
The Group’s recurring revenue, which 
consists of annual fees, and rental licence 
fees was flat year on year on a constant 
currency basis at £166.6 million (2014 – 
£167.0 million) and represented 76% of 
revenue (2014 – 70%).
Annual fees grew by 13% to £64.4 
million on a constant currency basis 
which reflects the strong initial licence 
performance a year ago, particularly 
in South Korea and the catch-up fees 
in China. Annual fees have continued 
to grow reflecting the continued 
resilience of our business model.
Rental licence fee revenue fell by 7% to 
£102.2 million on a constant currency 
basis. Following a disappointing first half, 
we saw a good second half performance 
with growth of 8% delivering revenue of 
£67.8 million compared to £62.7 million in 
second half of 2013/14. This was mostly 
generated from Global Account customers 
through the benefits of the new multi-
year contracts and overall a good level 
of renewals, although we did see some 
reduced activity levels within those EPCs 
with a higher level of exposure to offshore 
Oil & Gas projects. Also included within 
rental licences are the two customers 
that renewed as planned in second half 
which we referenced in the interim results. 
Despite the robust performance in rental 
licences in the second half, we remain 
cautious as we enter 2015/16 because 
of the mixed outlook within our EPC 
customers who are exposed to Oil & Gas.
Initial licence fee revenue felt the largest 
impact of the Oil & Gas market, down 31% 
to £33.5 million. This was mostly felt in 
Asia Pacific, which is a market that prefers 
the initial licence fee model and we had 
a tough comparable following the very 
strong growth in South Korea in 2013/14. 
We did see good growth in initial licences 
in North America.
Training and services revenue was broadly 
flat at £20.3 million (2014 – £21.9 million).

a decrease of 8%.
On a constant currency basis, segment costs for EDS were £47.9 million, a reduction of 
1% compared to the previous year and delivered a segment contribution of £146.0 million 
(2014 – £163.0 million).
Enterprise Solutions (ES)
ES revenue for the year was £26.5 million on an organic constant currency basis compared 
to £25.9 million in 2013/14. The backlog at 31 March 2015 was £10.8 million (31 March 2014 
– £10.7 million).
ES costs fell by 8% to £26.9 million on an organic constant currency basis compared to 
£29.3 million last year. We maintained tight discipline over the ES cost base during the 
year which has delivered these savings.
ES incurred a segment loss of £0.4 million (2014 – £3.4 million), which reflects the tight 
control of costs during the year in light of the difficult market conditions we faced.
The consolidated results include the results from 8over8 with revenue of £1.1 million  
and segment costs of £1.1 million.
New segment reporting
As described in the Chief Executive’s review, from 1 April 2015, the ES and EDS lines of 
business will merge. As a result we will no longer be disclosing these as our primary 
segments in our financial statements. From 1 April 2015, the Executive management team 
will monitor and appraise the business based on geographic performance and therefore 
this will become the basis for our primary segments in our financial statements.

Administrative expenses 16.6 19.3 18.8 3%
Total costs 130.0 138.9 142.1 (2%)
Following the disappointing first half results driven by weaker revenue, we completed a 
review of our planned investment in staff and discretionary spend in the second half of 
the year with a view to reducing operating expenses by £10.0 million compared to the 
original plan. We successfully delivered against this target and as a result our overall cost 
base reduced by 2% or £3.3 million from £142.1 million to £138.9 million on a constant 
currency basis. Compared to 2013/14, the savings were made in the following areas:
 – Reduction in discretionary spend in areas of travel, contractors and consulting/
professional fees
 – Lower Research & Development costs from moving to in-house facility in Hyderabad 
from outsourcing.
We also saw a one-off effect from reduced levels of sales commissions and bonuses 
which reflected the business performance during the year.
Our Research & Development activities are carried out in the UK, Sweden, Norway, 
Denmark, USA and India and therefore costs are exposed to movements in exchange 
rates. Research & Development costs fell by 11% on a constant currency basis due to 
savings made by moving projects from third-party outsource providers in India to our  
in-house facility in Hyderabad as indicated above, as well as savings from lower 
discretionary costs such as travel within Research & Development.
Selling and distribution expenses were flat on a constant currency basis. This was 
principally due to lower sales commissions and bonuses because of the reduced level  
of revenue offset by the cost of additional sales and marketing staff to ensure that we 
take advantage of growth opportunities in key markets such as North America.
Administrative expenses increased by 3% on a constant currency basis because of  
some one-off costs and continued investment in our information systems offset by  
lower bonus costs.
The business faces a mixed outlook in its end markets together with an increased cost 
base from inflation and the annualised impact of the cost of hires made in H1 of 2014/15. 
Further, we do not expect all of the savings from reduced bonuses and commissions 
in 2014/15 to recur. As a result in March 2015, we initiated further action by executing 
on a number of cost saving initiatives including rationalisation of some of our regional 
offices and reduction in the number of employees in specific areas of the business. 
These initiatives took place in March, April and May and will result in annual savings of 
approximately £3.0 million. We have incurred an exceptional charge for redundancy and 
related costs and property lease costs of £0.8 million in the year to 31 March 2015 and 
we expect to incur further exceptional costs of approximately £2.5 million in 2015/16 in 
respect of these initiatives.
Acquisition of 8over8 Limited
The Group acquired 8over8 Limited on 5 
January 2015 for consideration of £26.9 
million. The acquired business held £1.3 
million of cash at that date. Prior to being 
acquired, the business had a calendar 
financial year and therefore the quarter to 
31 March has historically been seasonally 
the lowest quarter. Since becoming part of 
the AVEVA Group, 8over8 contributed £1.1 
million of revenue and incurred an adjusted 
loss before tax of £0.6 million. 8over8 has, 
so far, mainly sold to Owner Operators 
within Oil & Gas, but we believe that there 
are good opportunities to cross-sell the 
solution into Mining and other capital 
intensive industries.
Costs for 8over8 Limited include £0.3 
million in cost of sales, £0.8 million in 
Research & Development, £0.5 million 
in selling and distribution costs and £0.1 
million in administrative expenses.
Exceptional items
During the year the Group incurred 
exceptional costs of £1,990,000 (2014 
– £3,395,000), relating to acquisition 
costs for 8over8 of £371,000 (2014 – 
£102,000), exceptional restructuring 
costs of £851,000 (2014 – £1,762,000) and 
a provision for underpaid sales taxes in 
an overseas location of £768,000 (2014 – 
£1,531,000).
The acquisition and integration fees relate 
to fees paid to professional advisers for 
legal and due diligence advice related to 
the acquisition of 8over8 Limited.
The exceptional restructuring costs 
incurred during 2014/15 relate to 
the redundancy and related costs in 
connection to the rationalisation of offices 
and reduction in employees in specific 
areas of the business.
The Group has provided for a potential 
underpaid sales tax liability, in respect of 
prior periods, related to the local sales of 
one of the Group’s subsidiary companies. 
The provision includes an estimate of the 
underpaid tax as well as related interest for 
late payment. 29 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Profit before tax
Adjusted profit before tax for the year 
ended 31 March 2015 was £62.1 million 
(2014 – £78.3 million), a decrease of 21%. 
This resulted in an adjusted profit margin 
of 29.8% on a reported basis compared to 
33.0% for 2013/14.
Reported profit before tax was £54.9 
million (2014 – £69.0 million).
Taxation
The effective tax rate for the year was 
24.2% (31 March 2014 – 26.1%) as the 
Group benefited from the reduction of 2% 
in the underlying UK corporate tax rate to 
21%. Our effective rate was higher than 
the underlying UK rate because of profits 
earned in higher tax jurisdictions and non-
deductible expenses.
Dividends
The Board is declaring a final dividend of 
25 pence per share (2014 – 22 pence per 
share), an increase of 14%. The dividend 
will be payable on 3 August 2015, to 
shareholders on the register on 3 July 2015.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 65.07 pence 
(2014 – 78.12 pence) and diluted earnings 
per share were 64.92 pence (2014 – 77.99 
pence). Adjusted basic earnings per share 
were 74.51 pence (2014 – 89.05 pence).
Balance sheet and cash flows
AVEVA continues to maintain a strong 
balance sheet and has no debt. Net assets at 
31 March 2015 were £189.9 million compared 
to £185.0 million at 31 March 2014.
Non-current assets
Non-current assets increased from £74.0 
million to £90.9 million mainly due to the 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired as 
part of the acquisition of 8over8 Limited in 
January 2015.
Working capital
Gross trade receivables at 31 March were 
£94.2 million (2014 – £82.9 million). The 
increase was due to the strong finish to 
the year resulting in our billings in the final 
quarter being more weighted towards the 
end of the period. In addition the balance 
includes trade receivables of £1.3 million 
related to 8over8 Limited. The bad debt 
provision at 31 March 2015 was £5.6 million 
compared to £5.2 million at 31 March 2014.
Deferred income at 31 March 2015 was 
£48.2 million compared to £36.5 million at 
31 March 2014. This includes £4.5 million 
related to 8over8 Limited, the impact of 
rental contracts moving to the second half 
and £0.9 million related to the change of 
rate for deferring post contractual support 
used when accounting for rental licences.
Trade payables and other liabilities were 
lower than last year due to lower accruals 
for bonuses and commissions.
Cash generation
Net cash (including treasury deposits) at 31 
March 2015 was £103.8 million compared 
to £117.5 million at 31 March 2014. Cash 
generated from operating activities after 
tax was £30.9 million (2014 – £52.0 million). 
The Group showed strong cash generation 
in the first half of the year but the phasing 
of billings as noted above meant that 
overall our cash generation for the year 
was lower than previous years. There 
has been no change in the credit terms 
offered to customers and cash collection 
has generally been in line with previous 
periods. In addition, during the year the 
Group paid additional contributions to the 
UK defined benefit pension scheme of 
£5.9 million (31 March 2014 – £2.5 million). 
The cash conversion for the year was 83% 
(2014 – 102%). The cash balance at 30 April 
2015 was £117.6 million reflecting strong 
cash collections since the year end.
Pensions
On an accounting basis, the Group’s 
pension liabilities increased from  
£8.8 million last year to £14.2 million 
at the year-end. This was principally 
caused by the UK defined benefit scheme 
deficit increasing from £5.9 million to 
£11.3 million driven by a reduction in 
government gilt and corporate bond 
yields, leading to a corresponding 
reduction in the discount rate used to 
discount our long-term liabilities, and is 
despite a strong asset performance.
On 31 March 2015, the Group closed the 
UK defined benefit pension scheme to 
future accrual. This decision was taken 
to manage the current and future risk on 
the Group’s balance sheet, with a view to 
ultimately effecting an insurance buy-
out. Previously accrued pension benefits 
will continue to be revalued in line with 
RPI. The Group agreed a deficit recovery 
plan with the trustees following the 
triennial valuation in 2013 with the plan 
to contribute £12 million over the 5 year 
period to March 2019. As part of this plan 
the Group paid lump sum contributions 
of £3.9 million during the year (2013/14 – 
£2.5 million) as well as a further voluntary 
contribution of £2.0 million to further 
improve the funding level of the scheme.
Capital structure
At 31 March 2015, the Group had 
63,948,241 shares of 3 5/9p each in issue 
(31 March 2014 – 63,873,360 shares). 
During the year the AVEVA Group 
Employee Benefit Trust 2008 (“the Trust”) 
purchased 13,991 ordinary shares in 
the Company in the open market at an 
average price of £21.72 per share for total 
consideration of £305,000 in order to 
satisfy awards made under the AVEVA 
Group Management Bonus Deferred  
Share Scheme 2008. At 31 March 2015,  
the Trust owned 44,722 ordinary shares  
in the Company.
In the prior year the Company paid a 
special dividend of £100 million, which 
was also accompanied by a share 
consolidation of 15 new ordinary shares 
for every 16 ordinary shares held. This 
reduced the number of shares in issue by 
approximately 4.3 million.
Treasury policy
The Group treasury policy aims to ensure 
that the capital held is not put at risk and 
the treasury function is managed under 
policies and procedures approved by 
the Board. These policies are designed 
to reduce the financial risk arising from 
the Group’s normal trading activities, 
which primarily relate to credit, interest, 
liquidity and currency risk. The Group is, 
and expects to be, cash positive and at 31 
March 2015 held net cash of £103.8 million. 
The treasury policy includes strict counter 
party limits.

within our local communities and as 
an ethically responsible business.
Internal stakeholders
We believe it is important that everyone in 
AVEVA feels valued and supported, while 
appreciating the unique perspective and 
skills that each individual can bring to a 
business. AVEVA is a diverse organisation 
with offices in 30 countries and employees 
from many different cultures and it is 
important that we have representation 
from all regions in how we shape our 
business. The introduction of Regional 
Operations Managers (ROMs) helps to 
ensure that every area of AVEVA has a 
clear communication strategy to give local 
staff a voice. This year we launched a new 
Global Ambassador Network to support 
the ROMs in communicating, sharing 
success stories and providing feedback on 
our employee’s views of the organisation.
As of 31 March 2015, we increased our 
headcount globally by 9% to 1,623 and we 
operate from 55 locations in 30 countries.

External stakeholders
To embed and reinforce our corporate 
policy against accepting or payment of 
bribes we have enhanced and improved 
our eLearning tools. Every employee 
must complete the Global Corporate 
Governance and Group IT Compliance 
training each year to ensure that we 
maintain our high ethical standards.
To protect the interest of our customers, 
our Anti-Piracy and Compliance team 
monitor the illegal use of AVEVA software 
and enforce compliance within our 
terms and conditions. The illegal use 
of our software throughout the globe is 
an ongoing challenge, however, AVEVA 
is becoming much more successful 
in the detection of such cases.
Transparency and disclosure is 
fundamental to our relationships with 
customers and suppliers and we continue 
to maintain open, honest and fair 
discussions to maintain our reputation 
as a trusted and ethical organisation.
Guangzhou Pottery Workshop
Employee engagement
Work has continued on developing ways to 
improve in areas that were highlighted by 
our 2013 Employee Engagement Survey.
Improving the visibility of our Executive 
Team across our diverse workforce 
and locations was one area that our 
people told us they would like to see. In 
response to this, over the past year we 
have provided regular updates from each 
member of the executive team, through 
different channels of communication. 
This has been a mix of both face-to-face 
sessions and cascaded team briefings 
throughout the whole of AVEVA. These 
activities provide an opportunity for our 
Executive Team to update employees on 
priorities and areas of focus, as well as 
facilitating two-way dialogue between 
employees and the Executive Team.
Communications
Internal Communications remains 
an area of focus as our organisation 
expands. It is important that everyone 
understands the Vision and Mission 
of AVEVA and the role each individual 
plays in contributing to our success.
The Internal Communications Team 
have introduced a number of new 
communication channels to engage 
with employees more effectively and are 
now equipped to measure how effective 
these channels are operating across 
the organisation. Through a number of 
internal campaigns this year we have 
seen a significant increase in the use of 
our intranet and other channels. This 
has been particularly encouraging in our 
rapidly growing Indian team, which has 
demonstrated increased engagement 
with both local and corporate activities. 32 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

AVEVA CSR framework
AVEVA in the Community
We are proud to acknowledge and support 
the inspiring charitable work of the AVEVA 
team. Over the past year, our colleagues 
have been involved in fun runs, marathons, 
team events to support disadvantaged 
children, raffles, charity auctions and other 
activities to raise money for local, national 
and international charities. In many cases, 
AVEVA matches the funds raised by our 
employees and makes separate donations 
for specific charities throughout the year.
As well as matching employee fundraising 
we also support volunteering within our 
workforce. AVEVA colleagues have spent 
time supporting their local communities 
in many different ways. Here is just one 
example of where AVEVA’s talented and 
committed team have gone the extra mile 
to improve their community.
In December 2014, a team from our 
Hyderabad office decided to support the 
cleaning up of the Nanakramguda IT Zone. 
They cleaned the roads, footpaths and 
roadside garbage working alongside the 
local municipal corporation authorities.
Learning and development
During this year, we have expanded 
the AVEVA Springboard programme 
to support individual professional 
development. This programme is now 
available at main hubs in Kuala Lumpur, 
Houston and Rio de Janeiro. We have 
also strengthened our Learning and 
Development at these locations to

Carbon emissions
AVEVA is committed to minimising its 
carbon emissions, increasing the use of 
recycling opportunities and reducing the 
use of valuable natural resources. We are 
continually improving the way in which we 
capture and record our emissions data.
For the purpose of this report, the 
emissions have been calculated according 
to the ‘Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines: Including mandatory 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting 
guidance’ issued by the Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA), and by applying DEFRA’s 
Conversion Factors. We have aimed for 
the GHG emissions to be captured for all of 
our UK and overseas offices between April 
2014 and March 2015.
serving as the baseline for our targets. 
For our carbon intensity ratio we have 
measured our carbon usage as it relates to 
our business performance, citing tonnes of 
CO
2
e/£ million of revenue. In 2014/15 this 
intensity ratio increased to 10.36 tonnes 
CO
2
e/£ million (2014 – 8.74). This increase 
partly reflects the reduction in our revenue 
during the year as well as the increase in 
our headcount.

by the Board of Directors and is signed  
on its behalf by:

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Independence of Non-Executive Directors and segregation 
of duties
The Board has considered the independence of the Chairman 
and the Non-Executive Directors and believes that all are 
currently independent of management and free from any 
material business or other relationships that could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
Their biographies on pages 40 and 41 demonstrate a range 
of experience and sufficient calibre to bring independent 
judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources 
and standards of conduct which is vital to the Group.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are distinct 
and the division of responsibility between these roles has 
been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by 
the Board. The Chairman is responsible for the effectiveness 
of the Board and ensuring that it meets its obligations and 
responsibilities. The Chief Executive is responsible to the 
Board for the day-to-day management of the business, 
leadership of the executive team and execution of the Group’s 
strategic and operating plans. The Chairman and Chief 
Executive meet regularly to discuss any issues pertaining to 
the Company’s performance, reputation and organisation.
 
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group. There is a formal schedule of 
matters specifically reserved for the Board’s decision that 
covers key areas of the Group’s affairs, which include:
 – overall responsibility for the strategy of the Group; 
 – corporate governance;
 – review of trading performance and forecasts;
 – risk management;
 – Board membership; 
 – communications with shareholders;
 – approval of major transactions, including mergers and 
acquisitions; and 
 – approval of the financial statements and annual operating and 
capital expenditure budgets.

Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for monitoring its effectiveness. However, 
such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure and by its very nature can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The principal risks and uncertainties the Group faces are set out 
on pages 22 and 23.
The Board has established a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks the Group faces.  
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls, which have been in place from the start of the 
year to the date of approval of this report, and believes that it 
is in accordance with the Internal Control: Revised Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code.
The key elements of the system of internal controls  
currently include:
 – each member of the Executive Board has responsibility for 
specific aspects of the Group’s operations. They meet on a 
regular basis and are responsible for the operational strategy, 
reviewing operating results, identification and mitigation 
of risks and communication and application of the Group’s 
policies and procedures. Where appropriate, matters are 
reported to the Board;
 – regular reports to the Board from the Executive Board on key 
developments, financial performance and operational issues  
in the business;
 – operational and financial controls and procedures which 
include authorisation limits for expenditure, sales contracts 
and capital expenditure, signing authorities, IT application 
controls, organisation structure, Group policies, segregation  
of duties and reviews by management; 
 – an annual budget process which is reviewed, monitored and 
approved by the Board; 
 – regular meetings between the Executive Board, sales area 
managers and line of business managers to discuss actual 
performance against forecast, budget and prior years.  
The operating results are reported on a monthly basis to  
the Board and compared to the budget and the latest forecast 
as appropriate;
 – targeted internal audit reviews and extended external audits 
which focus on confirming the operation of controls in key 
process areas; and
 – maintenance of insurance cover to insure all major risk areas  
of the Group based on the scale of the risk and availability of 
the cover in the external market.
The Board’s monitoring covers all material controls, including 
financial, non-financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management. It is based principally on reviewing 
reports from management to consider whether significant 
risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and 
whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied 
and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The 
Board periodically carries out visits to the Group’s subsidiaries 
and receives presentations on their operations. 38 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Corporate governance continued
The Board has also performed a specific assessment for the 
purpose of this annual report. This involved reviewing the  
Group’s risk matrix that had been reviewed/updated during  
a risk assessment workshop involving the Executive Board  
and senior managers. This assessment considered all significant 
aspects of internal control necessary for the Company to 
successfully carry out the key business strategies of the Group 
together with more generic inherent risks of the Group’s 
operations. The Audit Committee assists the Board in  
discharging its review responsibilities.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous review of its 
performance and that of its Committees and Directors each 
financial year. In the prior year, an extensive review was externally 
facilitated by Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP, the independent 
board performance consultants. The most recent review was 
carried out in March 2015, was led by the Chairman and was 
conducted following one-on-one interviews with each Director.
Overall, the review concluded that the Board and its committees 
had demonstrated a high degree of effectiveness. There 
were some recommendations on how to further improve the 
development of strategy and monitoring of risks which the  
Board is addressing.
Indemnities to Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to the 
extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred as a result 
of the performance of their duties in their capacity as Directors 
to the Company. The indemnity would not provide any coverage 
to the extent the Director is proven to have acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly. The Company has maintained Directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance cover throughout the year.
Policy on appointment and reappointment
In accordance with the Articles of Association, all Directors 
are required to retire and submit themselves for re-election 
at least every three years by rotation and also following their 
appointment. In addition, as in the prior year and in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance code, all of the Board 
members are offering themselves for re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting.
On appointment, all Directors are asked to confirm that they 
have sufficient time to devote to the role, which is confirmed 
together with details of their duties in the letter of appointment. 
All Directors undergo an induction as soon as practical following 
their appointment. As part of the induction process, Directors 
are provided with background information on the Group and 
attend the Group’s headquarters in Cambridge for meetings 
and presentations from senior management. In addition, where 
appropriate, meetings are also arranged with the Group’s advisers. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a term of three years. 
The Chairman of the Nominations Committee and the remainder 
of the Board considered the independence of Philip Dayer and 
Jonathan Brooks now that both are in their third term of office. It 
was concluded that both remained independent and continued to 
contribute to the operation of the Board. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and will be available for 
inspection on the day of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given high priority by the 
Board. The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Head 
of Investor Relations have meetings with representatives of 
institutional shareholders and hold analyst briefings at least twice 
a year, following the announcement of the interim and full year 
results, but also at other times during the year as necessary. 
Senior managers from Product Development, Business Strategy 
and Finance also attended analyst and shareholder meetings 
during the year. In September 2014, the Company held a capital 
markets day in London, where analysts and shareholders 
were updated on the activities of the Group including its Sales 
operations and latest technological developments. All of these 
meetings seek to build a mutual understanding of objectives 
with major shareholders by discussing long-term strategy and 
obtaining feedback. The Board also receives formal feedback 
from analysts and institutional shareholders through the 
Company’s financial PR adviser and financial advisers. The 
Board is appraised of discussions with major shareholders to 
ensure that Executive and Non-Executive Directors consider 
any matter raised by shareholders and to enable all Directors to 
understand shareholder views. In addition, when necessary, the 
Group consults with shareholders in respect of proposals for the 
remuneration of Executive Directors. The Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, Philip Dayer, is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels 
of Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer has failed to 
resolve or if such contact would be inappropriate. The Chairman, 
Senior Independent and Non-Executive Directors are available for 
dialogue with shareholders at any time and attend (together with 
the other members of the Board) the Annual General Meeting, 
but are not routinely involved in investor relations or shareholder 
communications. Corporate information is also available on the 
Company’s website, www.aveva.com.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to 
communicate with investors and all shareholders are encouraged 
to participate. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and the 
Nominations Committees will be available at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions.
Share capital structure
Further information on the share capital structure of the Company 
is contained on pages 60 and 61.
Committees of the Board
The Board has three Committees: Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the duties of the Committees are set out in formal terms 
of reference. They are available on request from the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours and are available 
on the Company’s website at www.aveva.com.

Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight and 
governance of these critical areas.
Audit Committee terms of reference
The Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group and the Committee members (as part 
of the full Board) review all proposed announcements to be made 
by the Group and consideration is given to any significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them. 
The Committee considers the effectiveness of financial 
reporting and internal controls, compliance with legal 
requirements, accounting standards and the Listing, Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and also reviews any proposed change in accounting policies 
and any recommendations from the Group’s auditor regarding 
improvements to internal controls and the adequacy of resources 
within the Group’s finance function. The Committee also assesses 
the process that has been established to ensure that the Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable, reporting to the 
Board their findings.
A full copy of the Committee’s Terms of Reference, is available 
from the Company’s website at www.aveva.com.
Committee membership
The Committee is formed of three independent Non-Executive 
Directors. As Chairman of the Committee, I am deemed by the 
Board to have recent and relevant financial experience. I am a 
Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants 
and I have held a number of senior financial positions in my career, 
the most relevant of which being the Chief Financial Officer of 
ARM Holdings Plc between 1995 and 2002. ARM is a major global 
technology company as well as having a similar software licensing 
business model to AVEVA. Philip Dayer and Jennifer Allerton 
make up the other two members of the Audit Committee. Brief 
biographical details for all the members of the Committee are 
included on page 41.
Information flows to the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least four times per annum. The 
Company Chairman and CFO are invited to attend all meetings. 
The external auditor and the Group’s Head of Finance are also 
invited to attend. Members of senior management are invited 
from time to time to make presentations such as the Committee’s 
agenda necessitates. In September 2014, the Audit Committee 
met at the Group’s offices in Mumbai, and so were able to meet 
members of the finance team there.
The Committee meets quarterly with the auditor without any 
members of the executive management team being present. 
I also meet with the external auditor two or three times each 
year away from the Company’s offices.
The Board places a very high priority 
on the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements, the quality 
and transparency of its financial 
reporting and the effectiveness 
of AVEVA ’s risk management 
and internal control systems.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Overview of the year’s activities
The Audit Committee undertook several additional projects during the year in addition to its prescribed duties.
Responsibility Activity in the year
Revenue recognition The Committee received regular updates from management as to its consideration of implications of the new 
accounting standard for revenue recognition – IFRS 15.
Following the extensive review of the Group’s revenue recognition policies in 2014, a significant exercise was 
conducted during 2014/15 on the subject of post contractual support (PCS). Where not specifically indicated in a 
contract, a proportion of any licence fee is allocated to cover PCS. The exercise comprised analysing the actual 
percentage figure of PCS in contracts where similar PCS was separately identified and invoiced to refresh the  
basis of the accounting estimate used. 
External audit The Committee spent considerable time discussing the merits of tendering the audit in the summer of 2015, 
when the current audit partner is required to rotate off, or waiting until 2020. See conclusion below.
Risks and internal 
controls
The Committee received, reviewed and discussed the findings of the extended external audit procedures 
conducted in France and Japan (March and May 2015 respectively). Some minor opportunities for improvement, 
particularly in credit control, were identified.
Following the loss of a major contract within the Enterprise Solutions Division earlier in the year, the Committee 
commissioned an internal review of what lessons should be learned for future enterprise-wide implementation 
projects.
In May 2015, the Committee received a report covering management’s annual cyber security review.
In March 2015, management presented a Group taxation update and assessment of current risks for the Group.
During the latter half of 2014, the Committee’s attention was drawn to internal control issues in South East Asia, 
specifically with respect to the timing of revenue recognition and the payment of commissions to sales people. 
Following a thorough internal investigation, a special Audit Committee was held in December 2014 to review 
how practices could be improved. While the issue was not material to the Group and was contained, control 
improvements were identified, including better security over the use of digital signatures, better credit control 
processes and more rigour in getting contracts signed and sealed.
Annually the Committee undertakes a treasury review which was completed in March 2015. This year this also 
included a detailed review of risk and mitigations by an external party in the area of foreign exchange management.
Valuation of assets 
and liabilities
The difficult trading conditions faced by the Enterprise Solutions business led to several reviews of whether 
its goodwill and intangible assets of £9.9 million required impairment. A third party valuation was undertaken 
towards the end of the year to assess the recoverable value of these assets.
The Committee gave oversight of the acquisition of 8over8, reviewing and approving its completion balance 
sheet in March 2015.
The Committee discussed and challenged the accounting assumptions underlying the valuation of the Group’s  
UK defined benefit pension scheme and any potential consequences of the closure of the scheme to future 
accrual which, following a process of member consultation, was finalised in March 2015.
Financial reporting Review and approval of financial reporting, particularly the 6 month interim report, full year preliminary 
announcement and 2015 Annual Report.
Consideration of segmental disclosures for 2015/16 and beyond, following the planned reorganisation.
Risk and internal controls
The key elements of the Group’s internal control framework 
and procedures are set out on page 37. The principal risks the 
Group faces are set out on pages 22 and 23. Annually, the 
Audit Committee considers the Group risk register and related 
management controls. Throughout the process, the Board or the 
Audit Committee:
 – Gives consideration to whether areas should be looked at more 
closely through specific control reviews;
 – Identifies areas where enhancement of internal controls is 
required; and
 – Agrees action plans to deliver the necessary or recommended 
enhancements.
The Committee plans to consider any enhancement to its current 
processes that are encouraged by the FRC’s guidance on risk 
management and viability as part of its 2015/16 programme.
There is a formal whistle-blowing policy which has been 
communicated to employees. This policy provides information 
on the process to follow in the event that any employee feels it is 
appropriate to make a disclosure. The Audit Committee is satisfied 
that the policy provides an adequate basis for employees to make 
representations in confidence to the Group and for appropriate 
and proportionate investigations. 44 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Key estimates and judgements
The Audit Committee discusses with management and the auditor 
the approach that has been taken in assessing all key estimates. 
These include revenue recognition, provisions for impairment of 
receivables, the valuation of retirement benefit obligations and the 
uncertainty of tax treatments in certain jurisdictions.
Annually, the Committee considers the going concern principle  
on which the financial statements are prepared and also considers 
and approves the impairment review of goodwill prepared  
by management.
Internal audit
The Group does not maintain a separate internal audit function. 
This is principally due to the geographical spread of the Group’s 
operations which means that there is a clear advantage in any 
review of controls being undertaken by teams with specific local 
regulatory knowledge and without any local language barrier.  
The Committee believes that this favours the provision of 
assurance from external sources, which is considered to be both 
more efficient and effective than having its own central internal 
audit team. However, the Audit Committee does review the need 
to have its own separate internal audit function each year.
The Audit Committee has developed a framework to gain 
assurance over the system of internal financial and operational 
controls. This comprises: 
 – A risk assessment performed by operational management  
and the Board to identify key areas for assurance. 
 – Peer and head office reviews of key risk areas of financial 
internal control. During the year we conducted an internal 
review of an Enterprise Solutions project and an internal  
review of our sales processes in South East Asia.
 – The use of qualified third parties to undertake specialist 
reviews in more technical areas. During 2014/15 third party 
technical reviews were undertaken on tax risks in India, the 
management of foreign exchange risk as well as work on 
cyber security.
 – An extension of the external auditors’ work in certain areas 
and geographies to cover other key financial risks, such as 
operations in fast growth areas as well as new taxation risks 
arising from trading in emerging markets. During 2014/15 
extended external audit procedures were undertaken in  
France and Japan following similar exercises in Brazil,  
South Korea, China and Russia in prior years.
 – An annual assessment by the Audit Committee of the whole 
system of internal financial and operational controls. 
External audit
The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment 
of the external auditor and on its remuneration both for audit 
and non-audit work and discusses the nature, scope and results 
of the audit with the external auditor. The Committee keeps 
under review the cost effectiveness and the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. Controls in place to ensure  
this include: strict controls over the extent and nature of non-
audit work performed by the auditor; semi-annual review of audit 
independence by the Committee; and an annual assessment of 
the quality of the audit service. An analysis of audit and non-audit 
fees is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
The Audit Committee monitors fees paid to the auditor for non-
audit work and delegates the authority for approval of such work 
to the Chief Financial Officer where the level of fees involved are 
insignificant. During the year the auditor did perform permitted 
non-audit work which mainly consisted of tax compliance work 
for subsidiaries of the Group and some other statutory filing 
work. In light of expected regulation and developing practice, the 
Audit Committee considers that any permitted non-audit work 
should not exceed 70% of the audit fee, except with the possible 
exception of reporting accountants’ work, which would have to be 
approved by the Committee – as do any projects with fees greater 
than £50,000. The Group engages other independent firms of 
accountants to perform tax consulting work and other consulting 
engagements to ensure that the independence of the auditor is 
not compromised. 
Audit partners are rotated every five years and a formal statement 
of independence is received from the auditor each year. The Board 
and the Audit Committee are satisfied that the independence of 
the auditor has been maintained. The current audit partner, Bob 
Forsyth, has completed his fifth year with the Group this year. 
It is therefore a logical time for the Group to consider putting 
the Group’s audit out to tender prior to the half year reporting 
schedule. While the Committee has been very happy with the 
quality of the work undertaken by its auditor, EY, it has concluded 
that there are advantages to conducting an audit tender process 
in the summer of 2015. The tender process will consider the 
option of rotating in a new lead audit partner from EY versus 
appointment of a different audit firm. The Committee’s prime 
objective is to ensure the quality of the audit is maintained 
at a reasonable cost.
At the May 2015 meeting, the Committee assessed the 
effectiveness of the external auditor. This assessment was based 
upon feedback from key members of the Group’s finance team 
as well as from the Audit Committee members. The overall 
conclusion was that while the audit process was effective, some 
areas of potential improvement were identified. Every second 
year a more detailed exercise is conducted across key units of 
the Group.
Audit planning and main audit issues
At the November 2014 meeting of the Committee the auditor 
presented their audit plan for 2014/15. This included a summary 
of the proposed audit scopes for the year for each of the Group’s 
subsidiaries and a summary of what the auditor considered to 
be the most significant financial reporting risks facing the Group 
together with the auditor’s proposed audit approach to these 
significant risk areas. The main areas of audit focus for the year 
were the significant judgements surrounding revenue recognition 
and the valuation of intangible assets associated with the ES 
business. The Audit Committee’s response to these areas is 
addressed in the table on page 43.

Remuneration Committee report
Remuneration review
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration 
arrangements voted on and agreed in 2014 continue to align 
Executive Directors with the delivery of the long-term strategy 
and creation of shareholder value while rewarding Executives fairly 
if success is achieved. Overall, the Committee has decided this year 
not to make any changes to the principles or the Remuneration 
Policy approved at the 2014 AGM and the policy will continue to be 
operated as set out in the 2013/14 Remuneration Committee report. 
The Committee appreciates that the AVEVA business has been faced 
with challenges in 2014/15 in respect of a general slowdown in its 
end markets. The underlying business does, however, remain strong. 
It is the view of the Remuneration Committee that the Executive 
Management Team have continued to perform to high standards 
with commitment and leadership through a challenging period.
Against this backdrop the Committee has concluded the following:
 – As set out in my consultation letter last year, and as 
communicated in the 2014 Remuneration Committee report, 
the Committee decided to increase the base salary for the 
CEO and CFO as follows over two years. 
With effect from CEO CFO
1 April 2014 £445,000 
(c.9.7% increase)
£280,000 
(c.7.7% increase)
1 April 2015 £485,000 
(c.9.0% increase)
£300,000 
(c.7.1% increase)
The first stage of the change was implemented in 2014/15. Given 
the strong performance of each of the Executive Directors and 
the underlying operational performance of the Group over the 
course of the year in light of a very difficult external climate, the 
Committee has considered it appropriate to proceed with the 
second stage of this increase with effect from 1 April 2015.
 – The long-term incentive opportunity for the CEO and CFO for 
the coming year will remain unchanged.
 – In line with previous years, the Committee continues to 
believe that earnings per share remains the most appropriate 
performance measure for the long-term incentives and as such 
this will continue to be the sole measure for 2015 awards. The 
threshold and maximum performance targets for awards to be 
granted in 2015 will remain 12% and 20% per annum over three 
years respectively.
2014/15 Out-turns
As a result of mixed, but generally weaker, trading conditions 
in the markets in which the Company operates, particularly in 
Oil & Gas, together with a strong foreign currency headwind, 
performance in 2014/15 fell below expectations. Total revenue for 
the year was £208.7 million which was down 12% compared to 
2013/14. Adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 
2015 was £62.1 million (2014 – £78.3 million), a decrease of 21%. 
In this context, the Committee determined that none of the 
financial element of the annual incentive award will be paid 
as targets were not met. The Executive Directors were given 
individual performance objectives which were specific in nature 
and important for the long term growth and sustainability of the 
business. The Remuneration Committee are satisfied that these 
objectives were met in full and determined that for both the CEO 
and CFO, 10% of the core award will be paid. 
Further, none of the LTIP awards granted in 2012, under the 
previous Long-Term Incentive Plan, shall vest as growth in diluted 
EPS over the three year period to 31 March 2015 did not reach the 
9.5% p.a. growth needed for threshold levels of awards to vest.
Remuneration reporting
The 2013/14 financial year was the first year in which AVEVA was 
required to report under the new remuneration reporting regulations. 
 – The Directors’ remuneration policy which, approved by the 
shareholders with votes in favour of 97.31%, will apply for three 
years from the 2014 AGM until 2017 and is available to view on 
the Company website, www.aveva.com;
 – The annual report on remuneration, which sets out payments 
and awards made to the Directors and explains the linkage 
between the Group’s performance and remuneration in respect 
of the 2014/15 financial year, is set out below. 
The Committee is appreciative of the significant shareholder 
support that it received in respect of the Director Remuneration 
Policy and Annual Report and the Remuneration Committee 
circulated the principal shareholders with information in respect of 
the 2015 remuneration review ahead of this published report.
Agenda for 2015/16
The Committee will continue to keep the structure and details of 
our remuneration arrangements under review and will continue to 
communicate and consult with shareholders as appropriate.
I am pleased to present 
this year’s Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration.

The Remuneration Committee
The Board sets the remuneration policy for the Group. The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board within its 
agreed terms of reference, details of which are available at www.aveva.com. 
The Remuneration Committee’s principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration package of both the Company’s Executive 
Directors and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board. 
When reviewing and setting remuneration policy the Committee considered a range of factors including the Company’s strategy and 
circumstances, the prevailing economic environment and the evolving landscape in best practice guidelines to ensure that it remains 
appropriate. In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole and oversees and approves the Company’s  
share incentive plans for all participants. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors  
and the Chairman, rather than the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee were finalised in four formal meetings during the year,  
and these were preceded by several informal discussions, including some with advisers (none of whom had any other connection  
with the Company). 
The members of the Committee during 2014/15 were Philip Dayer (Chairman), Philip Aiken, Jonathan Brooks and Jennifer Allerton.
The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and to attend meetings 
when appropriate. He was not present when his own remuneration was discussed.
The Committee has access to external advisers as required. During the year the Committee received advice from Deloitte LLP. Deloitte 
also provided unrelated advisory services to the Group in respect of taxation during the year. Deloitte is one of the founding members of 
the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct and adheres to this Code in its dealings with the Committee. The Committee is satisfied 
that the advice provided by Deloitte is independent. The fees paid to Deloitte LLP were calculated based on time spent and expenses 
incurred for the majority of advice provided but on occasion for specific projects a fixed fee may be agreed. In 2014/15, Deloitte received 
fees of £8,750 in relation to advice provided to the Committee.

The Directors’ remuneration policy
Set out below is a copy of the policy table from the Directors’ remuneration policy (the Policy), which was approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM, held on 14 July 2014. To provide consistency with the remainder of the report, salaries shown have been updated for 2015 
salaries, the scenario charts have been updated for the operation of the policy in 2015/16 and Non-Executive Director fees have been 
updated for 2015 fees.
We highly value shareholders’ comments on and overwhelming support for our Remuneration Policy. This was demonstrated at the 
2014 AGM where the resolution to approve our Remuneration Policy received 97.31% of votes cast in favour. It is our belief that it is the 
preference of shareholders that we should not make frequent changes to the Remuneration Policy and we will propose changes only 
if we believe that they would lead to a better alignment between pay, strategy and long-term business performance. No changes have 
been proposed for 2015/16.
Full details of the Directors’ remuneration policy, as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, can be found on our website 
www.aveva.com.
AVEVA’s Executive remuneration philosophy 
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that: members of the Executive management team are provided with appropriate 
incentives to align them with the achievement of the Company’s strategy and the future creation of shareholder value; enhanced 
performance is encouraged; and, the Executive Management team is, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Group.
It also aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to 
deliver short and long-term goals. The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of remuneration of Executive Directors should 
be performance related and should be delivered in shares to create alignment with shareholders’ interests. Remuneration for Executive 
Directors is set in the context of the economic environment in which the Group operates, the outcome of the wider pay review for all 
Group employees as well as the financial performance of the Group. When determining remuneration arrangements, the Committee 
takes into consideration relevant external market data as well as the remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration commitments made which were consistent with the approved Remuneration policy in force at that time shall be 
honoured, even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.

Base salary
 – Helps recruit and 
retain employees.
 – Reflects experience 
and role.
 – Base salary is normally reviewed annually 
with changes effective from 1 April, 
although salaries may be reviewed more 
frequently or at different times of the 
year if the Committee determines this is 
appropriate.
 – The Committee determines base salary 
taking into account factors including, but 
not limited to:
 – The individual’s role, experience and 
performance in achieving financial  
and non-financial goals within his  
areas of responsibility.
 – Salaries at other companies of a similar 
size and complexity as well as global 
technology peers.
 – Remuneration of different groups of 
employees within the Company.
 – Total organisational salary budgets.
 – Paid in cash.
 – In determining salary increases the 
Committee generally considers the 
factors outlined in the ‘operation’ 
column. 
 – While there is no maximum salary level, 
salary increases will normally be in-line 
with the range of increases in the broader 
workforce salary. 
 – The Committee retains the discretion to 
make increases above this level in certain 
circumstances, for example, but not 
limited to:
 – an increase in the individual’s scope  
of responsibilities; 
 – in the case of new Executive Directors 
who are positioned on a lower initial 
salary while they gain experience in 
the role; or
 – where the Committee considers that 
salary is behind appropriate market 
positioning for a company of AVEVA’s 
size and complexity.
 – Salaries with effect from 1 April 2015 are:
 – CEO (Richard Longdon) £485,000
 – CFO (James Kidd) £300,000

Pensions
 – Provides a 
competitive 
retirement benefit 
in a way that is  
cost effective to 
the Company.
CEO
 – The CEO, Richard Longdon, participated 
in the CadCentre Pension Scheme, a 
defined benefit pension scheme, until 
2010 when he accrued the maximum 
benefits that he is entitled to under 
the scheme. The plan is a contributory, 
funded, occupational scheme registered 
with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) 
and, since 1 October 2004, Career 
Average Revalued Earning benefits apply.
 – Mr Longdon is now a deferred member of 
the scheme and is no longer accruing any 
further benefits.
CFO
 – The CFO is a member of the AVEVA 
Group Personal Pension Plan (a defined 
contribution scheme).
New appointment
 – The intention is that new appointments 
to the Board would participate in the 
AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan or 
receive an equivalent cash payment. 
However, if appropriate the Committee 
may determine that alternative 
arrangements for the provision of 
retirement benefit may apply. When 
determining pension arrangements for 
new appointments the Board will give 
regard to the cost of the arrangements, 
market practice and the pension 
arrangements received elsewhere in 
the Group. 
CEO
 – The current CEO is entitled to a pension 
on normal retirement, or on retirement 
due to ill heath, equivalent to two-thirds 
of his pensionable salary provided he has 
completed (or would have completed in 
the case of ill health) 25 years’ service. 
 – A lower pension is payable on earlier 
retirement after the age of 55 by 
agreement with the Company and 
subject to HMRC guidelines. 
 – Pensions are payable to dependants on 
the Director’s death in retirement and 
a lump sum is payable if death occurs 
in service.
CFO
 – The Company currently contributes 10% 
of base salary to the plan.
None
Benefits
 – Help recruit and 
retain employees
 – Provide a 
competitive range 
of valued benefits
 – Assist toward early 
return to work in 
the event of illness 
or injury
 – The benefit policy is to provide an 
appropriate level of benefit taking  
into account market practice at similar 
sized companies and the level of  
benefits provided for other employees  
in the Group.
 – In line with benefits provided for other 
senior employees in the Group, Executive 
Directors currently receive a mobility 
allowance or company car, a fuel 
allowance and a £500 annual allowance 
toward a range of benefits.
 – In the event that an Executive Director 
was required to re-locate to undertake 
their role, the Committee may provide 
additional benefits to reflect the  
relevant circumstances (on a one-off  
or ongoing basis).
 – Benefits are reviewed by the Committee 
in the context of market practice from 
time to time and the Committee may 
introduce or remove particular benefits  
if it is considered appropriate to do so. 
 – If the Company were to operate an 
all-employee share plan in the future, 
Executive Directors would be entitled to 
participate in the plan on the same terms 
as other employees.
 – The cost of benefit provision will depend 
on the cost to the Company of providing 
individual items and the individual’s 
circumstances and therefore there is no 
maximum value.

Annual Incentive Scheme & Deferred Share Scheme
 – Incentivises 
and rewards the 
achievement of 
annual financial and 
strategic business 
targets and 
delivery of personal 
objectives.
 – Deferred element 
encourages  
long-term 
shareholding, 
helps retention 
and discourages 
excessive risk 
taking.
 – The Committee determines an 
individual’s maximum incentive 
opportunity taking into account the 
responsibilities of the role and market 
practice at comparable companies. 
 – Performance targets are set by the 
Committee on an annual basis.
 – The Committee determines the level 
of bonus paid taking into account 
performance against targets, the 
underlying performance of the business 
and Executive Directors’ performance 
during the year.
 – The annual bonus is generally paid in a 
mix of cash and deferred shares.
 – For the core award, at 100% achievement 
of bonus performance targets, 60% of 
the bonus amount is payable in cash and 
the balance, 40%, is used to calculate the 
number of deferred shares. If the bonus 
amount is less than or equal to 70% of 
the potential maximum bonus, then 75% 
of the total bonus is paid in cash and 
25% is deferred into shares. If the bonus 
amount is between 70% and 100% of the 
potential maximum then the proportion 
paid in deferred shares is determined by 
linear interpolation between 25% and 
40%. The Committee may determine 
that a different balance of cash and 
deferred shares should apply.
 – The whole outperformance award would 
normally be delivered in deferred shares.
 – Further details of how the deferred share 
element operates are included as a 
footnote to this table.
 – The maximum bonus opportunity is 
125% of base salary (core award of 100% 
of salary, outperformance award of 25% 
of base salary).
Core Award
 – The core bonus award is 
based on a mix of financial 
and individual objectives. 
For 2015/16, 90% of the 
bonus is based on financial 
measures with 10% based 
on individual measures 
agreed by the Committee 
at the start of the year. 
The Committee reserves 
the right to vary these 
proportions for future 
years. However, in any 
year, financial performance 
will always account for at 
least 70% of the bonus.
 – For the financial 
performance element, up 
to 10% of the bonus can be 
earned based on interim 
financial performance. 
Other than for this element 
performance is assessed 
over a financial year.
 – The core award starts 
being earned for entry 
level performance from 
0% of salary and accrues 
linearly up to 100% for 
achievement of stretch 
target. Around 50% of 
the core award bonus 
is paid if target levels of 
performance are achieved. 
Outperformance award
 – The outperformance  
award is based on  
financial performance  
over the financial year 
and is only delivered for 
the over-achievement of 
stretch targets.
The AVEVA Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 (the 2014 LTIP) 
 – Establishes a 
motivational and 
performance-
orientated 
structure to 
incentivise 
Directors to  
focus on the 
creation of 
shareholder  
value aligned  
with the longer 
term strategy  
for the Group.
 – From 2014 onwards, the Committee will 
make awards under the 2014 LTIP (which 
replaces the previous 2004 LTIP), which 
was approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM. 
 – Awards normally vest based on 
performance over a period of three years 
and are subject to a subsequent two-year 
holding period. Awards may be subject 
to a different vesting period as may be 
determined by the Committee.
 – Awards under the 2014 LTIP may be 
granted in the form of conditional awards 
or nominal cost options or phantom 
options which will be settled in cash.
 – The Committee determines targets 
each year to ensure that targets are 
stretching and represent value creation 
for shareholders while remaining 
motivational for management. 
 – The Committee shall determine the 
extent to which the awards will vest 
based on performance against targets 
and taking into consideration the wider 
performance of the Group. 
 – Awards are subject to malus and 
clawback provisions.
 – The maximum limit under the plan rules 
is 250% of base salary. 
 – The current intention is that awards will 
be limited to:
 – 150% of base salary for the CEO
 – 120% of base salary for the CFO
 – The intention is the maximum award 
will only be awarded in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. recruitment).
 – The Committee retains the discretion to 
grant awards up to the maximum limit 
under the plan rules. The Committee’s 
intention would be to consult with 
shareholders in the event that awards 
were to be increased. 
 – Awards vest based 
on earnings per share 
performance.
 – The Committee retains 
the discretion to introduce 
alternative or additional 
performance measures 
if it considers that 
these would be better 
aligned with strategy 
and incentivise Executive 
Directors to deliver long-
term shareholder value. 
However, in any, year 
financial performance will 
always account for at least 
75% of an award.
 – For threshold levels of 
performance, 25% of the 
award vests, increasing 
to 100% of the award for 
maximum performance. 
There is straight-line 
vesting of awards between 
these points. 50 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Policy table footnotes
 – The deferred share element for both the core and outperformance annual incentive will be structured as a nil-cost option. 
 – Deferred awards will normally deliver the shares to participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the three years following the 
year in which an award is granted. The Committee has discretion to determine an alternative vesting profile.
 – Awards granted from 2012 onwards under the LTIP and the deferred share scheme are subject to malus and clawback provisions. 
Those provisions may apply at the discretion of the Committee if accounts are corrected or published that indicate the relevant 
performance was materially worse than in the accounts used to assess vesting.
 – Other elements of remuneration are not subject to malus or clawback.
 – The Committee may operate the 2014 LTIP and the deferred share scheme in accordance with its terms. This includes amending the 
scheme and the terms of awards (including adjustments to take account of any variation of capital, demerger or special dividend).
Legacy plans
Up to 2013, the Company’s long term incentive arrangement was the AVEVA Group Long Term Incentive Plan adopted with shareholder 
approval in 2004 (2004 LTIP). Awards under the plans were granted in the form of nominal priced options and vest based on the 
achievement of EPS performance over a three-year period. No holding periods apply. At the 2007 AGM, shareholders approved the 
Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 (2007 ESOS). No grants have been made under the scheme. The Committee may operate the 
2004 LTIP and 2007 ESOS in accordance with its terms. This includes amending the scheme and the terms of awards or performance 
conditions (including adjustments to take account of any variation of capital, demerger or special dividend).
Committee discretion
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including the exercise of any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above 
where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not 
a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming 
a director of the Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an 
award over shares is ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. 
Remuneration outcomes in different performance scenarios
The remuneration package at AVEVA is structured so that the majority of the package is related to the delivery of performance  
over the short and long-term to ensure that reward is aligned with shareholder value creation. 
The charts opposite show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed  
performance scenarios:
CEO CFO
Maximum award opportunities % of salary Annual Bonus 125% 125%
LTIP 150% 120%
Minimum – No annual incentive pay-out
– No vesting under the LTIP
Mid performance – 50% of salary pays out under the Annual Bonus (40% of maximum i.e. half of the core 
award and none of the outperformance award)
– 0–50% of maximum vesting under the LTIP 
Maximum performance – 100% of maximum annual incentive pay-out
– 100% of maximum LTIP vesting 
The Remuneration Committee believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business  
plan, the targets are commercially sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance. Where targets have been met and  
awards are payable, targets will be disclosed retrospectively.
No share price growth has been assumed. Potential benefits under all employee share schemes and dividend equivalents have  
not been included.

taking account of the individual’s 
responsibilities, the expected time 
commitment for the role and prevalent 
market rates. 
 – The Board is responsible for setting fees 
for the Non-Executive Directors with the 
Committee being responsible for setting 
fees for the Chairman. 
 – Fees are reviewed at appropriate intervals.
 – Basic fees are subject to the aggregate 
limit in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. Any changes in this 
limit would be subject to shareholder 
approval.
 – Non-Executive Directors are paid a  
basic fee for membership of the  
Board with additional fees being paid  
to Non-Executive Directors who hold 
the position of Committee Chairman 
to take into account the additional 
responsibilities and workload. Additional 
fees may also be paid for other board 
responsibilities or roles if this is 
considered appropriate.
 – The Non-Executive Chairman receives  
an all-inclusive fee for the role.
 – Fees are paid in cash.
 – Current fees are follows:

receive any benefits. Benefits may be 
provided in the future if, in the view of  
the Board (or, in the case of the 
Chairman, the Committee), this was 
considered appropriate.
 – Travel and other reasonable expenses 
(including fees incurred in obtaining 
professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties) incurred in the course of 
performing their duties are reimbursed  
to Non-Executive Directors. 52 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Remuneration Committee report continued
The Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Directors’ report  53 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Executive Directors 
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2014/15
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that: members of the Executive management team are provided with appropriate 
incentives to align them with the achievement of the Company’s strategy and the future creation of shareholder value; enhanced 
performance is encouraged; and the Executive management team is, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Group.
Base salary
As set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report last year, a detailed review of market positioning was undertaken during the course of 
2013/14 for the first time since 2011 given the increase in the size and complexity of the Group over the period, and it was determined 
that the positioning of the Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly base salary, had fallen significantly behind market practice.
In light of this, the Committee considered it appropriate to increase the base salary for the CEO and CFO as follows:
Base salary with effect from CEO CFO
1 April 2014 £445,000 (c.9.7% increase) £280,000 (c.7.7% increase)
1 April 2015 £485,000 (c.9.0% increase) £300,000 (c.7.1% increase)
The first stage of the change was implemented in 2014. Given the strong performance of each of the Executive Directors and the 
underlying operational performance of the Group over the course of the year in light of a very difficult external climate, the Committee 
has considered it appropriate to proceed with the second stage of this increase with effect from 1 April 2015.
Benefits
In line with benefits provided for other senior employees, in 2015/16 Executive Directors will be provided with a company car or a 
mobility allowance, a fuel allowance and a £500 annual allowance towards a range of flexible benefits. 
 
Pension 
As noted in the Policy Table on page 48, Richard Longdon participated in the AVEVA Solutions Limited defined benefit pension scheme 
until 2010 when he accrued the maximum benefits that he is entitled to under the scheme. He is now a deferred member of the scheme 
and is no longer accruing any further benefits.
James Kidd is a member of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan (a defined contribution scheme). For 2015/16, the Company 
contribution to the plan will be 10% of salary. James will continue to be provided with the flexibility to contribute to this plan via  
salary sacrifice.
 
Annual Incentive Scheme
For 2015/16, the maximum opportunity for Executive Directors under the annual bonus will be 125% of base salary (which will be  
made up of a core award of 100% of salary and an outperformance award of 25% of base salary).
It was agreed that for the core award 90% of bonus shall be based on achieving stretching Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) 
targets. 10% of the core award is contingent upon achievement of key individual performance objectives which were agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year.
Of the 90% of the core award based on financial performance, 10% is based on achievement for the six months to 30 September and  
the remaining 80% is based on the full year results for 2015/16.
The performance targets for the core and outperformance award are based on Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) targets and the 
outperformance award will only be delivered for the achievement of stretch targets over and above the targets for the core award.
The Remuneration Committee believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, 
the targets are commercially sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance. Where targets have been met and awards are 
payable, targets will be disclosed retrospectively.
Deferral
For the core award, at 100% achievement of bonus performance conditions, 60% of the bonus amount is payable in cash and the 
balance, 40%, is deferred into shares. If the bonus amount is less than or equal to 70% of the potential maximum core bonus, then 75% 
of the bonus is paid in cash and 25% paid in deferred shares. If the bonus amount is between 70% and 100% of the potential maximum 
core bonus then the proportion paid in deferred shares is determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 40%.
Any outperformance award will be paid in deferred shares. 
Deferred awards vest pro-rata over three years.

Long-Term Incentive Plan
In line with our Policy, the award opportunity for the CEO will be 150% of base salary and for the CFO will be 120% of base salary. 
As with previous years, the performance conditions for the award will be based on average adjusted diluted EPS growth over the three-
year period from 2015/16 to 2017/18. The performance ranges for the awards to be granted in 2015 are as follows:

Annual incentive 
This reflects the total annual incentive paid and payable in 2015 based on performance in the year ended 31 March 2015. This includes 
both the cash element of the bonus and the portion deferred into shares under the deferred share scheme. 
10% of the core award was dependent on achieving the half year Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT) performance target, and 
80% dependent on achieving the full year Group adjusted PBT performance target. Following a review of performance in the year, 
the Committee determined that none of the financial element award will be made as neither of the targets were met. The Executive 
Directors were given individual performance objectives which were specific in nature and important for the long term growth and 
sustainability of the business. The Remuneration Committee are satisfied that these objectives were met in full and determined that for 
both the CEO and CFO, this element of the core award (10%) will be paid. None of the outperformance award will be paid as targets were 
not met. Achievement for 2014/15 was 10% of the core award and 8% of the maximum payable for both Executive Directors (2013/14 – 
63% and 50%).

The Remuneration Committee believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, 
the targets are commercially sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance. Where targets have been met and awards are 
payable, targets will be disclosed retrospectively.
Long-term incentives 
This includes the LTIP awards, granted under the previous Long-Term Incentive Plan, vesting based on performance in the three-year 
period ending 31 March 2015.
These awards were subject to the delivery of EPS growth. 0% of awards vest for diluted adjusted EPS growth of less than 9.5% p.a., with 
100% of awards vesting for diluted adjusted EPS growth of 16.5% p.a. Average diluted EPS growth for the three year performance period 
did not reach the minimum 9.5% p.a. growth needed and therefore 0% of the LTIP awards will vest in the period relating to 2014/15.
For 2013/14, 94% of the maximum LTIP awards granted to the Executives in 2011/12 vested. The value included in the single total figure 
of remuneration in respect of 2013/14 has been restated to reflect the actual number of shares that vested and the market value of the 
shares on the date of vesting 22 July 2014. The figure included in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report was estimated based on 
the average share price for the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 March 2014 as the vesting date was post the publication of the 2013/14 
Annual Report and Accounts.

Outside appointments
The Board believes that accepting Non-Executive appointments with other companies enhances the experience of Executive Directors 
and therefore they are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that Board approval is sought prior to 
accepting the appointment. Whether or not the Director concerned is permitted to retain their fees is considered on a case by case 
basis. 
Richard Longdon is, since January 2015, Chairman of the Board of Process Systems Enterprise Limited. Prior to his appointment to this 
position, the Board considered the impact on his role as CEO and concluded that he could still devote sufficient time to his role and 
therefore approved his appointment. Richard Longdon receives fees for this role, which, as he performs this role independently of his 
duties to the Company, the Committee determined he was entitled to receive.
Total pension entitlements 
Richard Longdon is a deferred member of the CadCentre Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme for which AVEVA Solutions 
Ltd is the principal employer, and has accrued the maximum benefit he is entitled to. The Directors had accrued entitlements under the

Other statutory information
Results and dividends
The Group made a profit for the year after taxation of £41.6 million 
(2014 – £51.0 million). Revenue was £208.7 million (2014 – £237.3 
million) and comprised software licences, software maintenance 
and services.
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 
25 pence per ordinary share (2014 – 22.0 pence). If approved at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be 
paid on 3 August 2015 to shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 3 July 2015.
Business review and future developments
A review of the Group’s operations during the year and its plans 
for the future is given in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief 
Executive’s statement and the Finance review.
The Key Performance Indicators used by AVEVA to measure 
its own performance at the Group level include total revenue, 
recurring revenue, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings 
per share and headcount. The figures for the year ended 31 March 
2015 are set out on page 21, together with figures for the previous 
year and a discussion of the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group is included on pages 22 and 23.
Research & Development
The Group continues an active programme of Research & 
Development which covers the updating of and extension to  
the Group’s range of products.
Intellectual property
The Group owns intellectual property both in its software tools 
and the products derived from them. The Directors consider such 
properties to be of significant value to the business and have a 
comprehensive programme to protect it.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies are 
discussed in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The Group has significant financial resources, is profitable and 
has a strong position in the markets it serves. At 31 March 2015 
the Group had cash and treasury deposit balances of £103.8 
million (2014 – £117.5 million) and no debt. Therefore, after making 
enquiries and considering the cash flow forecasts for the Group, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

trading laws); and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority whereby Directors and certain employees

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Voting rights
Subject to any restrictions below, on a show of hands every 
member who is present in person or by proxy at a general meeting 
has one vote on each resolution and, on a poll, every member who 
is present in person or by proxy has one vote on each resolution 
for every share of which he/she is the registered member.  
A proxy will have one vote for and one vote against a resolution  
on a show of hands in certain circumstances specified in the 
Articles of Association. The Notice of Annual General Meeting 
specifies deadlines for exercising rights.
A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting is decided on a 
show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result 
of the show of hands, a poll is demanded by the Chairman of the 
meeting. The Articles of the Company also allow members, in 
certain circumstances, to demand that a resolution is decided  
by a poll.
A member may vote personally or by proxy at a general meeting. 
Any form of proxy must be delivered to the Company not 
less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the 
meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the 
appointment proposes to vote (for this purpose, the Directors 
may specify that no account shall be taken of any part of a day 
that is not a working day). A corporation which is a member of the 
Company may authorise such persons as it thinks fit to act as its 
representatives at any general meeting of the Company.
No member shall be entitled to attend or vote, either personally 
or by proxy, at a general meeting in respect of any share if any 
call or other sum presently payable to the Company in respect 
of such share remains unpaid or in certain other circumstances 
specified in the Articles of Association where there is default in 
supplying the Company with information concerning interests 
in the Company’s shares.
Dividends, distributions and liquidation
Members can declare final dividends by passing an ordinary 
resolution but the amount of the dividends cannot exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. The Board can pay interim 
dividends provided the distributable profits of the Company 
justify such payment. The Board may, if authorised by an ordinary 
resolution of the members, offer any member the right to elect to 
receive new shares, which will be credited as fully paid, instead of 
their cash dividend. Any dividend which has not been claimed for 
12 years after it became due for payment will be forfeited and will 
then revert to the Company. Members may share in surplus assets 
on a liquidation.
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator can, with the sanction 
of the members by special resolution and any other sanction 
required by law, divide among the members all or any part of 
the assets of the Company and he/she can value any assets and 
determine how the divisions shall be carried out as between the 
members or different classes of members. The liquidator can 
also transfer the whole or any part of the assets to trustees upon 
any trusts for the benefit of the members. No members can be 
compelled to accept any asset which would give them any liability.
There are no agreements between holders of securities that are 
known to the Company which may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights, save as described below 
in relation to the Employee Benefit Trust.
Change of control
All of the Company’s share-based plans contain provisions relating 
to change of control. Outstanding awards and options normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any relevant performance conditions at that time.
There are no other significant agreements to which the Company 
is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover bid.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Any amendments to the Articles of Association of the Company 
may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act by way of special resolution.
Powers of the Directors
The business of the Company is managed by the Directors, 
who may exercise all powers of the Company, subject to the 
Company’s Articles of Association, relevant statutory law and 
to any direction that may be given by the Company in general 
meeting by special resolution. Subject to the Companies Act, 
shares may be issued by Board resolution. At the Company’s last 
Annual General Meeting, powers were granted to the Directors 
(subject to limits set out in the resolutions) to issue and to buy 
back its own shares; similar powers are proposed to be granted at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The buy-back authority 
was limited to 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. No 
shares have been bought back under this authority. 62 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Appointment of Directors
The Articles of Association limit the number of Directors to not 
less than two and not more than ten save where members decide 
otherwise. Members may appoint Directors by ordinary resolution 
and may remove any Director (subject to the giving of special 
notice) and, if desired, replace such removed Director by ordinary 
resolution. New Directors may be appointed by the Board but 
are subject to election by members at the first Annual General 
Meeting after their appointment. A Director may be removed from 
office if requested by all other Directors.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that at each 
AGM there shall retire from office (and be subject to re-election 
by members) any Director who shall have been a Director at 
the preceding two Annual General Meetings and who was not 
appointed or re-appointed then or subsequently. However, 
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Company requires all Directors who held office at 31 March 2015 to 
stand for re-election.
Listing Rules disclosures
For the purpose of LR9.8.4C R, the only applicable information 
required to be disclosed in accordance with LR9.8.4 R can be 
found in the section below titled Employee benefit trust. The 
information concerned is in respect of shareholder waiver of 
dividends and future dividends.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 9 July 2015 at 
The Trinity Centre, 24 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, 
Cambridge CB4 0FN. The Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
is being sent to shareholders along with this annual report, which 
contains details of the resolutions proposed.
Employee benefit trust
The AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 was established 
in 2008 to facilitate satisfying the transfer of shares to employees 
within the Group on exercise of vested options under the various 
share option and deferred bonus share plans of the Company. The 
Trust holds a total of 44,722 ordinary shares in AVEVA Group plc 
representing 0.07% (2014 – 72,626 shares representing 0.11%) of 
the issued share capital at the date of this report. Under the terms 
of the Trust deed governing the Trust, the trustees are required 
(unless the Company directs otherwise) to waive all dividends and 
abstain from voting in respect of ordinary shares in AVEVA Group 
plc held by the Trust except where beneficial ownership of any 
such ordinary shares was passed to a beneficiary of the Trust. In 
the same way as other employees, the Executive Directors of the 
Company are potential beneficiaries under the Trust.
Disabled employees
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment 
from disabled persons where the candidate’s particular aptitudes 
and abilities are consistent with adequately meeting the 
requirements of the job. Opportunities are available to disabled 
employees for training, career development and promotion.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s 
policy to provide continuing employment wherever practicable 
in the same or an alternative position and to provide appropriate 
training to achieve this aim as well as reasonable adjustments to 
the workplace and other support mechanisms.
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of 
its employees and has continued to keep them informed of 
matters affecting them as employees and on the various factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved through 
formal and informal meetings, employee newsletters, the Group 
intranet and presentations from senior management. There is an 
employee representative committee which meets on a regular 
basis to discuss a wide range of matters affecting their current 
and future interests. All employees are entitled to receive an 
annual discretionary award related to the overall profitability of the 
Group subject to the performance of the individual and the Group. 
The Group conducts employee-wide surveys from time to time 
to gauge the success or otherwise of its policies and uses this 
information to improve matters as appropriate.
Directors’ indemnity 
The Company has granted an indemnity to its Directors against 
liability in respect of proceedings brought by third parties, subject 
to the conditions set out in the Companies Act. Such qualifying 
third party indemnity provision remains in force as at the date of 
approving the Directors’ report.
Greenhouse gas emissions reporting
The Company is required to state the annual quantity of emissions 
in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from activities for which 
the Group is responsible, including the combustion of fuel, the 
operation of any facility, and resulting from the purchase of 
electricity, heat, steam or cooling. Details of our emissions are set 
out within the Corporate Responsibility section of the Strategic 
Report and form part of the Directors’ Report disclosures.
Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor for  
the ensuing year will be put to the members at the Annual  
General Meeting.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
The Directors are required to prepare Consolidated financial 
statements for each financial year in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The Directors have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom General Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the undertakings included in the 
consolidation as a whole as at the end of the financial year and 
the profit or loss of the undertakings included in the consolidation 
as a whole, so far as concerns members of the Company, for 
the financial year. In preparing those Consolidated financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select and apply accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
 – make judgments and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have  
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records which are sufficient to disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Directors’ report are listed on page 60. Each of 
these Directors confirms that:
 – so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as 
defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 – he has taken all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself aware of any such relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
Fair and balanced reporting
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board 
considers the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.
Responsibility statement pursuant to FCA’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 4 (DTR 4)
Each Director of the Company (whose names and functions 
appear on pages 42 and 43) confirms that (solely for the purpose 
of DTR 4) to the best of their knowledge:
 – the financial statements in this document, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable UK law and applicable 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the  
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together  
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face.

Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 
2015 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 – the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc for 
the year ended 31 March 2015 which comprise the Consolidated 
income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income/(expense), the Consolidated balance sheet, the 
Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated statement of 
changes in shareholders’ equity and the parent company balance 
sheet, the Group related notes 1 to 29, the parent company 
related notes 1 to 9 and the Statement of Group accounting 
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable 
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Financial statements
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 63, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report. 66 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Independent auditor’s report continued
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement and our response to that risk
We identify below the risks of material misstatement which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk Response
The risk of inappropriate revenue recognition on software licence contracts
In particular:
 – inappropriate application of the 
group revenue recognition policy 
and IAS 18 (Revenue) for licence 
revenue recognition, which could 
result in, for example, revenue 
being recorded when performance 
conditions have not been satisfied, 
incorrect deferral of revenue for 
support and maintenance and other 
obligations; and
 – inappropriate licence revenue 
recognition in relation to cut off, 
as revenue may not have been 
recognised in the correct accounting 
period (AC, AP, SAE)*
 – We review and walkthrough the central process over the approval and recognition of revenue contracts 
across the group.
 – We performed licence revenue sample transaction testing at a local and group level to ensure that 
revenue had been recorded in accordance with the revenue recognition principles as detailed in note 2 
and had been appropriately recorded in the current year income statement or deferred on the balance 
sheet as appropriate. This was achieved by:
 – agreeing licence revenues through to signed contracts;
 – agreeing the revenue through to subsequent payment as evidence of collectability;
 – checking evidence to support delivery and therefore correct timing of revenue recognition; and
 – reviewing contract terms for any conditions that would impact the timing of the revenue recognition 
and ensuring appropriate allocation and recognition of revenue for other deliverables included  
within the contract.
 – Given the significant risk concentration and centralised oversight of revenue recognition, the group  
audit team performed additional substantive audit work on all contracts across the group where  
invoices over £0.4 million were issued in the year, to ensure consistency of application of the revenue 
recognition policy.
 – We performed cut-off testing for a sample of revenue items booked either side of year end to ensure 
that licence revenue was recognised for software where the contract was signed by both AVEVA and the 
customer prior to year end and the software had been delivered prior to the year end.
 – We performed journals testing by selecting a sample of revenue journals and assessed the 
appropriateness of the journal by checking to supporting evidence and ensuring compliance with the 
revenue recognition principles in note 2.
 – We tested the assertions made by management surrounding the fair value of the support and 
maintenance element of the revenue contracts by reviewing actual data from recent periods; and
 – To better understand the nature of the contractual relationships with customers, any contractual issues 
or any ongoing contractual obligations, we made enquiries of management within the business, including 
the sales team to ensure that appropriate obligations and commitments had been recorded in the 
financial statements.
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill in relation to the Enterprise Solutions business segment
In particular there is a risk that the 
carrying value of goodwill on the 
balance sheet is not recoverable based 
on reasonable assumptions applied 
to an appropriate methodology, in 
accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment 
of assets) and hence is impaired 
(AC, AP, SAE)*.
 – We examined group management’s “fair value less costs to sell” (FVLCS) valuation, based on the advice 
of a third party valuation specialist, of significant goodwill and indefinite lived assets in relation to the 
Enterprise Solutions business segment.
 – We critically assessed and challenged the methodology and assumptions used by the third party specialist 
to arrive at the FVLCS valuation by using our own valuation specialist to assist us with determining the 
appropriateness of the approach adopted, based on their own knowledge and experience.
 – We tested a sample of the input data, including transaction and third party company data, used for the 
valuation back to source documentation or third party evidence.
 – We challenged management’s conclusion over the likelihood of reasonable sensitivities.
 – We ensured that the financial statement disclosures met the requirements of the accounting standard.
* These risks are discussed in other areas of the Annual Report as noted by the following key.
 AC – See Audit Committee Report
 AP – See Statement of Group accounting policies
 SAE – See note 2(d) significant accounting estimates
Our assessment of revenue recognition as a risk of material misstatement is consistent with the prior year. However, due to the 
Enterprise Solutions segment not achieving its current year forecast result, this resulted in an increased risk of material misstatement of 
the carrying value of goodwill and therefore greater audit focus and effort was incurred in this area.

We determined materiality for the group to be £3.05 million (2014: 
£3.5 million), which is approximately 5% (2014: 5%) of pre-tax 
profit. We used pre-tax profits because, in our view, this is the 
most relevant measure of the underlying financial performance 
of the group. This provided the basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures, and identifying and 
assessing the risk of material misstatement.
On the basis of our assessments of risk and the group’s 
overall control environment, our judgement was that overall 
performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement 
in an individual account or balance) for the group should be 
50% (2014: 75%) of planning materiality, namely £1.5 million 
(2014: £2.6 million). We reduced the performance materiality 
factor from 75% to 50% given prior year Income Statement 
differences of £1.3 million (of which £0.6 million related to one 
revenue contract and £0.7 million related to corporate tax), all of 
which were corrected. Our objective in adopting this approach 
was to ensure that the total of any detected (but unadjusted) 
and undetected audit differences was unlikely to exceed our 
assessment of materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
Audit work at individual components is undertaken based on a 
percentage of our total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative size 
of the component and our view of the risk of misstatement at 
that component. In the current year the range of performance 
materiality allocated to components was £0.3 million to  
£0.7 million (2014: £0.4 million to £1 million).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to  
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.15 million 
(2014: £0.17 million), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
An overview of the scope of our audit
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group financial 
statements, our group audit scope focused on twelve locations:
 – the UK was subject to a full scope audit.
 – nine locations were subject to a specific scope audit, where  
the extent of the audit work was based on our assessment  
of the risk of material misstatement and the materiality of  
the operations at those locations. For these locations audit 
work was primarily focussed on revenue, debtors, cash, 
accruals and payroll.
 – two locations were subject to a limited scope audit, which 
involved analytical review procedures and audit work focussed 
on risks specific to the locations concerned. For the current 
year, in both instances this was around debtor recoverability.
Together with the group functions which were also subject  
to a full scope audit, these locations represent the principal 
business locations of the group and account for 81% (2014: 
79%) of the group’s revenue, 96% (2014: 84%) of the group’s 
profit before tax and 105% (2014: 81%) of the group’s net assets, 
reflective of two net liability companies which have not been 
subject to scoped procedures.

The Senior Statutory Auditor leads the audit at one full scope 
location, one specific scope location and the two limited scope 
locations as well as the group functions. The group audit team 
visits other key locations on a rotational basis and visited two 
specific locations during the year. In addition the group audit team 
held a group planning meeting with the audit teams of the twelve 
locations to ensure direction and input into the local audit teams’ 
audit approach, including their assessment of the risk of material 
fraud or error. The group audit team also participated in five of 
the local audit team closing meetings and reviewed key working 
papers where necessary. 68 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements; and
 – the information given in the Corporate Governance Report 
set out on page 37 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 – is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.
Independent auditor’s report continued
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or
 – a Corporate Governance Report has not been prepared by  
the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 – the directors’ statement, set out on page 60, in relation to 
going concern; and
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Report relating to the 
company’s compliance with the ten provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

Consolidated cash flow statement
for the year ended 31 March 2015 74 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
1 Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 
given on the inside back cover. AVEVA Group plc’s shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 
2 Key accounting policies
Explained below are the key accounting policies of the Group. The full Statement of Group Accounting Policies is included on pages 106 
to 112.
a) Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 
2015. The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(£000) except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement. The Directors believe that 
this alternative measure of profit provides a reliable and consistent measure of the Group’s underlying performance. The face of the 
Consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented 
under the applicable accounting standards. Adjusted earnings per share, as disclosed in note 12, is calculated having adjusted profit after 
tax for the same items and their tax effect. The term adjusted profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly 
titled profit measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures of profit. 
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 March 2015. The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) and are included on pages 100 to 104.
b) Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser 
extent indirectly through resellers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes. It comprises 
initial licence fees, annual licence fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until:
 – a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced;
 – delivery has been made in accordance with that contract;
 – if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met; and
 – the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable. Where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist, revenue recognition is 
deferred until payment is due.
Initial/annual licence agreements
Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is 
charged every year. Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core 
product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services. Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the 
right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met. Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the contract, which is typically twelve months. If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial 
licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements
As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental 
licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-cancellable 
and consist of two separate components; the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with customer support and 
maintenance. Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market 
value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer. This component is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the contract. The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront, 
provided all of the above criteria have been met. Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the 
customer support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 75 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
2 Key accounting policies continued
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model. Under this model, a ‘basket’ of tokens representing licences to use 
different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required. 
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised 
with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions 
being met. Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used.
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed under separate service arrangements. 
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the 
costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project. If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is 
recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred. Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided that 
services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject to 
acceptance criteria. In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed.
c) Exceptional items
The Group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better 
understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group. The Group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises, 
fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
d) Significant accounting estimates
Revenue recognition
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation 
services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer. This policy involves the assessment of which customer 
projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects. We 
generally only enter into this type of contract in Enterprise Solutions but the assessments and estimates used by the Group could have a 
significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised on a project.
We periodically review our estimate of the fair value of the element of a customer rental fee attributable to the continuing right to use 
and customer support and maintenance. On average, this element as a proportion of the initial software delivery element has increased 
from 15% to 17%. This revised estimate has been used for revenue recognition purposes from 1 April 2014. The impact of this change 
was that revenue recognised during 2014/15 was lower by £894,000, and deferred revenue at 31 March 2015 increased by £894,000.
Provision for impairment of receivables
The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis. The determination of the appropriate level 
of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Group’s customers and management consider a 
number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age 
of the receivable outstanding and the Group’s trading experience with that customer. The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 
March 2015 was £5,636,000 (2014 – £5,161,000).
Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such 
intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates. Future results are impacted 
by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including 
discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. Further details about the assumptions used are set out in 
note 14.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for tax. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain – particularly when doing business 
in emerging economies. The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of taxes that are likely to become due. Where the 
final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax and 
deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made. 76 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
2 Key accounting policies continued
Retirement benefit obligations
The determination of the Group’s obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of 
Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts. The assumptions applied, together with 
sensitivity analysis, are described in note 26 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries 
and mortality rates. While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or 
significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Group’s future pension obligations, actuarial gains 
and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs. The net carrying 
amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2015 was £14,187,000 (2014 – £8,848,000).
e) Impairment of Assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies and 
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are 
independent of other cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated 
is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. The carrying values 
of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes 
in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative 
expenses line item.

4 Segment information
During the year, the Group was organised into two lines of business, being Engineering & Design Systems and Enterprise Solutions, 
which are considered to be the two reportable segments for the Group. The products of each of the lines of business are taken to market

The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for 
the year of £41,559,000 (2014 – £51,011,000). Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to 
equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share 
amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all 
the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary shares. Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 27.

On 5 January 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of 8over8 Limited headquartered in Northern Ireland.  
The acquisition consideration was cash of £26.9 million.
Acquisition costs (including due diligence and professional fees) and integration costs have been included in the Consolidated  
income statement.
Details of the fair values of the net assets acquired and goodwill is set out below, which includes purchased intangibles consisting  
of developed technology and customer relationships. Fair value adjustments of £6.9 million have been made to align with the  
Group’s accounting policies, particularly in respect of revenue recognition.

From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2015, the business contributed £1,151,000 to revenue and a loss before tax of £586,000. It is not 
practical to disclose the revenue and profit/(loss) before tax of the business as if it had been acquired at the beginning of the reporting 
period due to the nature of the fair value adjustment to align accounting policies.
Goodwill represents the value of the assembled workforce and the future synergy benefits of integrating the business in the AVEVA 
Group. The assembled workforce brings product development skills and expertise, service delivery skills and domain knowledge of the 
end user markets to the Group.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination.
Engineering & Design Systems
During 2014/15 the contribution of the Engineering & Design Systems CGU was £137.0 million (2014 – £163.0 million). This is far in excess 
of the attributable goodwill value. Therefore, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would 
result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.
Enterprise Solutions
The goodwill acquired relating to 8over8 Limited has been allocated to the Enterprise Solutions (‘ES’) segment. However, the carrying 
values of the ES intangibles have for 2014/15 been assessed for impairment excluding both the very recently acquired 8over8 intangibles 
and the related acquired cash flows. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 83 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
14 Goodwill continued
The review for the Enterprise Solutions CGU was conducted prior to the year end and the recoverable amount, as per IAS 36, was 
determined to be the fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS), being greater than the value in use that had been employed in the prior  
year. The FVLCS assessment was prepared by a third-party valuation specialist who performed his work by reference to market data.  
The specialist employed two methods to inform his valuation: one based on companies; and the second based on transactions: 
 – Under the Guideline Company method companies in a similar market sector were observed and those that were identified as  
loss-making were used to derive an estimated average revenue multiple that could be applied to the ES CGU. A revenue multiple of  
1.1 times revenue was selected. As the multiple selected was based on observable quoted company multiples, the resulting valuation 
was then adjusted upward to reflect a 15% premium for any potential acquirer having acquired full control. Conversely, the valuation 
estimate multiple was discounted by 7% to reflect a potential lack of marketability, due to a lack of a ready market for the asset. Both 
the control premium and lack of marketability adjustments are standard in such a valuation technique. 
 – Under the Guideline Transaction method (GTM), actual corporate transactions in a similar industry or sector and of a similar scale 
were observed and valuation multiples assessed. Focus was given to the total invested capital to revenue multiples, due to the lack  
of profitability of the ES CGU. These were found to range from 1.0 times to 3.01 times revenue. On the basis that the Enterprise 
Solutions CGU is currently loss making, it was deemed appropriate to select a lower quartile multiple of revenue, 1.09 times.
From this process, the FVLCS valuation was assessed as between £28.8 million and £30.3 million, indicating headroom of between  
£18.9 million and £20.4 million against the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles of £9.9m.
As the valuation approach described above has used lower quartile assessments of valuation multiples, the Directors do not consider 
that any reasonably possible change in the valuation assumptions used by the valuation specialist would lead to impairment. Currently 
the carrying values of the goodwill and intangibles attributable to the ES CGU represent 0.38 times revenue reported in 2014/15.

The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, motor vehicles and items of equipment. These leases have a

24 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange 
contracts. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly 
from its operations.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall  
be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below:
a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income 
or the value of its holding of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk
The Group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits. The 
Group’s overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds, accessibility and 
competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analysis that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant 
risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity. The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash 
equivalents and treasury deposits. The Group does not have any borrowings. The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest 
rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% point decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately £765,000  
(2014 – £727,000) and profit after tax by £604,000 (2014 – £560,000).
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of 
operations. These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency of Sterling.  88 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
24 Financial risk management continued
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit. The main exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, 
South Korean Won, and Yen, reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Group’s revenue and cash receipts are denominated 
in these currencies, whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research & Development, are settled in Sterling, Indian Rupees and 
Swedish Krona.
The Group manages exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts. The Group enters into forward foreign 
exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euros to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base. In addition,  
it enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts, when the timing of forecast 
cash flows is reasonably certain. Other currency exposures are less easy to hedge cost effectively. At 31 March 2015, the Group had 
outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $22.8 million (2014 – $9.0 million), €9.7 million (2014 – €9.75 million) and YEN0 million 
(2014 – YEN100.0 million). It also had outstanding currency exchange contracts to buy, Swedish kr0 million (2014 – kr11.5 million),  
Danish kr4.5 million (2014 – kr0 million). Non-deliverable forward contracts were used to hedge the purchase of INR30 million  
(2014 – INR0 million)
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange 
contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk. Gains and losses arising 
from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign 
exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders’ equity. The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the 
monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional 
currency and being of a monetary nature; differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation 
currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling, and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity 
and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown. In management’s opinion, this is a reasonably possible 
change given current market conditions. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign 
currencies, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013/14.

b) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables.
Counter-parties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved  
by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.  
As set out in the Group’s treasury policy, the amount of exposure to each counter-party is subject to a specific limit, up to a maximum 
of 50% of the Group’s total counter-party risk. Within this overall limit, some counter-parties are subject to more restrictive caps on 
counter-party exposure.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. 
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment 
is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of 
the cash flows. The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis. Credit checks are performed 
before credit is granted to new customers. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large 
number of customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. The exposure 
to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
24 Financial risk management continued
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 18.
c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows 
and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities. The Group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is 
not considered a significant risk at this time.

e) Fair values
The book values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities consist of bank and cash balances of £58,519,000 (2014 – £77,309,000) 
and treasury deposits of £45,248,000 (2014 – £40,238,000). The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Group’s 
financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition, the Group’s financial assets include forward foreign exchange contracts. Financial instruments which are recognised at fair 
value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. The three 
levels are defined as follows:
 – Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 – Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 – Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 March 2015 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial 
recognition. The fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was £433,000 at 31 March 2015 (2014 – £547,000 asset).
The resulting loss of £980,000 (2014 – gain of £1,121,000) on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
f) Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity 
holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or 
issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2014 or 2015.
During 2013/14 a special dividend of 147 pence per share, totalling £100 million, was paid and this was accompanied by a share 
consolidation of 15 new ordinary shares for every 16 ordinary shares held. This reduced the number of shares in issue at the time of the 
share consolidation from 68,115,648 to 63,858,420 and also amended the nominal value of the shares to 3.56 pence each.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend. The Group is not exposed to any 
externally imposed capital requirements.

*  A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus 
accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for 
financial reporting purposes:
2015

2014 
£000
Deferred tax liabilities (1,480) (2,003)
Deferred tax assets 3,800 4,131
2,320 2,128
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £1,654,000 (2014 – £865,000) available for offset against future profits. 
Of the total deferred tax asset of £533,000 (2014 – £276,000), £40,000 (2014 – £68,000) has been recognised and is included in ‘other’ 
above. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately £37,003,000 (2014 – £37,693,000). No liability 
has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is likely that the majority of the 
overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. 92 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015

a) UK defined benefit scheme
The Group operated a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded. This scheme 
was closed to new employees on 30 September 2002, was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis on 30 September 
2004 and then closed to future accrual from 31 March 2015. No service cost or curtailment gain arose upon closure of the scheme, 
due to all previously accrued past service benefits retaining the same link to future inflation or future earnings. Pensions are payable 
to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service. There is an insurance policy in place which 
covers this liability. Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a trust deed, and the funds are held and managed by 
professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
The latest triennial valuation of the scheme’s liabilities was completed as at 31 March 2013, and showed a funding deficit of £13,231,000. 
To eliminate this funding shortfall the Trustees and the Company agreed that additional cash contributions will be paid to the scheme. 
£2.5 million was contributed in February 2014, £2.5 million was contributed in April 2014 and 60 additional monthly payments of £116,667 
to be made starting April 2014. The Company made an additional unscheduled contribution of £2 million in March 2015.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an external, professionally-qualified actuary, Broadstone 
Investment Management Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the 
projected unit credit method. The employees’ contributions are fixed as a percentage of salary; the balance being made up by the 
employer. Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows:
2015 
%
2014 
%
Main assumptions:
Rate of salary increases 5.30 5.60
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.10 3.30
Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.30 2.60
Discount rate 3.10 4.30
Inflation assumption 3.30 3.60
For the years ended 31 March 2015 and 2014, the following weighted average life expectancy at age 65 for mortality has been used:
2015 
Years
2014 
Years
Male pensioners 23.8 23.7
Female pensioners 25.0 24.9
Non-retired males 25.1 25.1
Non-retired females 26.5 26.4
Member contributions were 7.5% (2014 – 7.5%) of pensionable salary. From 1 September 2011 most members’ contributions were 
made by the Company through a salary sacrifice arrangement. Company contributions were £7,724,000 (2014 – £3,978,000). The total 
contributions in 2016 are expected to be approximately £1,580,000. The PPF levy will be payable in addition (2014 – £21,298).

b) German defined benefit schemes
There are two defined benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH. Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme 
that provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992. No current employees participate in the scheme and 
it is closed to new applicants. Benefit payments are made as they fall due. The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon 
Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged in 2005. 
Since the acquisition of Bocad in May 2012, AVEVA Software GmbH has been responsible for the pension obligations of six former  
Bocad employees. At the time of the acquisition, the pension obligations were only partly financed via external funding vehicles.  
In March 2013, AVEVA concluded an agreement with an external insurance provider which results in the insurance company being 
obliged to provide all benefits as detailed in the individual pension commitments, with AVEVA only having an obligation if the external 
insurance provider defaults.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee. This scheme is closed to new members. 
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below:
2015 2014
Rate of increase of pension in payment 1.25%–2.5% 1.34%–2.5%
Discount rate 1.25%–3.00% 3.00%
Mortality 14–18 years 15 years
Rate of salary increases N/A N/A
The retirement age for the Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH schemes was 60 and 63 years of age respectively (2014 – 60 and 63 
years of age).

c) South Korean severance pay
South Korean employees are entitled to a lump sum on severance of their employment equal to one month’s salary for each year of 
service. The IAS 19 valuation of the liability has been carried out using the following assumptions:
2015 
%
2014 
%
Rate of salary increases 4.00 5.00
Discount rate 2.81 3.99
The retirement age for AVEVA Korea Limited employees is 60 years of age (2014 – 60 years of age). 
d) Other retirement schemes
All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ITP, an industry scheme for salaried employees 
which provides benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements. The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance 
company. It is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component. AVEVA AB pays 
monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, service and salary of the employee. AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the 
underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable basis because this information is not provided by the scheme 
and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension scheme. At 31 March 2015, Alecta’s surplus in the 
form of collective funding level was 148% (2014 – 147%) which was calculated in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for 
Insurance Companies. The total cost charged to the income statement was £603,278 (2014 – £836,000).
e) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian employees. The 
assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. The total cost charged to income of £5,136,000 (2014 – £4,398,000) 
represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.
27 Share-based payment plans
The Group has three equity-settled share schemes: the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP); the AVEVA Group 
Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme; and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007. No grants have been made 
under the 2007 scheme which was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2007. Details of these plans are set out below.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options for both 
plans during the year:

The weighted average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding at 31 March 2015 is 4.77 years (2014 – 4.71 years).
The average fair value of options granted during the year was £19.07 (2014 – £22.80). In calculating the fair value, the expected life of the 
options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects 
the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was £nil to £0.0356 (2014 – £nil to £0.0356).
The Group recognised a credit of £441,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year ended 31 March 2015 
(2014 – expense of £2,317,000).
Details of the share option plans are as follows:
a) Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The following awards have been made under the LTIP. The exercise price is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 
3.56 pence. Options under the LTIP are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Performance conditions related to LTIP awards originally granted in 2011/12 and 2012/13 have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the 
special dividend of £100 million and share consolidation during 2013/14.
2014/15 awards
In 2014/15, a total of 189,740 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2014/15 to 2016/17. If average 
adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over the same period 
is less than 12% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 12% and 20% the number of shares that vest will be 
determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2013/14 awards
In 2013/14, a total of 136,886 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2013/14 to 2015/16. If average 
adjusted diluted EPS growth is more than 20% then all shares shall vest. If average adjusted diluted EPS growth over the same period 
is less than 14% then none of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 14% and 20% the number of shares that vest will be 
determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 100%.
2012/13 awards
In 2012/13, a total of 160,730 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2012/13 to 2014/15. If average diluted 
EPS growth is more than 15% then all shares shall vest. If average diluted EPS growth over the same period is less than 8% then none 
of the shares will vest. For growth rates between 8% and 15% the number of shares that vest will be determined by linear interpolation 
between 25% and 100%. Following the share consolidation in July 2013, target growth rates were increased by 1.5% to 9.5% and 16.5%.

27 Share-based payment plans continued
2011/12 awards
In 2011/12, a total of 140,820 share options were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The 
performance conditions attached to this award are based on EPS growth over the three years from 2011/12 to 2013/14. If average diluted 
EPS growth is more than 12% above RPI for the same period then all the shares under this option will vest. If average diluted EPS growth 
is less than 5% above RPI then none of the shares will vest. If average EPS growth is between 5% and 12% per annum above RPI then the 
number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation. Following the share consolidation in July 2013, target growth 
rates above RPI were increased by 1% to 6% and 13%.
The fair value of each of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for each of 
the LTIP awards:

b) Deferred annual bonus share plan
In 2008, the Company established the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 (the Deferred Share Scheme). 
Directors and senior management participate in this scheme. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single 
financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash and partly in ordinary shares in the 
Company to be delivered on a deferred basis.
In July 2014, the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 awarded 13,991 (2013 – 31,937) deferred shares to the Executive Directors and 
senior management in respect of the bonus earned in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013 – bonus earned in year ended 31 March 2013).
The awards of deferred shares take the form of nil-cost options exercisable by participants in three equal tranches, one in each of 
the three years following the year in which the award is made. The option may be exercised in the 42-day period beginning on the 
announcement of the financial results of the Group in each of the three calendar years after that in which the option was granted. The 
last date of the exercise is the end of the 42-day period following the announcement of the financial results of the Group in the third 
calendar year following that in which the option was granted or (if applicable) such later date as the Remuneration Committee may 
specify. These awards are made solely in respect of performance in the financial year immediately prior to their grant. Delivery of the 
deferred shares is not subject to further performance conditions but each participant is required to remain an employee or Director 
of the Group during the three-year vesting period in order to receive his deferred shares in full (except in the case of death or the 
occurrence of a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company).
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for each of the 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan awards:
2014/15

Company balance sheet
31 March 2015 101 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
1 Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc (the Company) is a limited Company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded. The principal 
activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
2 Accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have all been applied consistently throughout the current and the preceding year, 
is set out below:
a) Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and law.
As permitted by FRS 1 (Revised) Cash flow statements, the Company has not included a Cash flow statement as part of its financial 
statements because the Consolidated financial statements of the Group (of which the Company is a member) include a Cash flow 
statement and are publicly available.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures and not disclosed related party 
transactions with wholly owned subsidiary undertakings.
b) Taxation
Current tax including UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the 
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being 
charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the 
balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been 
entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
measured on a non-discounted basis.
c) Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at actual exchange rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end. Any gain 
or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the 
profit and loss account.
d) Share-based payments
The expense for share-based payments is recognised in accordance with the accounting policy for the Consolidated financial statements 
of the Group and is recognised in the subsidiary companies employing the relevant employees. The Company recognises the expense 
relating to the Executive Directors. The Company also records a corresponding increase in its investments in subsidiaries with a credit to 
equity which is equivalent to the FRS 20 cost in the subsidiary undertakings.
e) Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.

Five year record 106 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc is a public limited Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 
given on the inside back cover. AVEVA Group plc’s shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 
2015. The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(£000) except when otherwise indicated.
The Group presents a non-GAAP performance measure on the face of the Consolidated income statement. The Directors believe that 
this alternative measure of profit provides a reliable and consistent measure of the Group’s underlying performance. The face of the 
Consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented 
under the applicable accounting standards. Adjusted earnings per share, as disclosed in note 12, is calculated having adjusted profit after 
tax for the same items and their tax effect. The term adjusted profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly 
titled profit measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures of profit. 
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 March 2015. The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) and are included on pages 107 to 111.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each 
year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation. Adjustments are made to 
translate any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAP and IFRSs.
Inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost 
of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. New standards and interpretations which came 
into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet effective
The IASB have issued the following standards (although in some cases not yet adopted by the EU) which are expected to have 
implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures in future 
financial years:
Effective for periods 
commencing after
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (classification and measurement) 1 January 2015
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016
IAS 16 & IAS 38 Amendments – Clarification of Accounting Methods of Depreciation 
and Amortisation 1 January 2016
IFRS 11 Amendments – Accounting for Acquisition of Interests in Joint 
Operations 1 January 2016
IAS 27 Amendments – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts from Customers 1 January 2018
The Group intends to adopt these standards in the first accounting period after the effective date. Except for IFRS 15, the Directors do 
not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations listed will have a material effect on the Consolidated financial 
statements in the period of initial application.
Statement of Group accounting policies 107 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Significant accounting estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of judgement and estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below:
Retirement benefit obligations
The determination of the Group’s obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of 
Directors, of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts. The assumptions applied, together with 
sensitivity analysis, are described in note 26 and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries 
and mortality rates. While the Directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or 
significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the Group’s future pension obligations, actuarial gains 
and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs. The net carrying 
amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2015 was £14,187,000 (2014 – £8,848,000).
Provision for impairment of receivables
The Group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer-specific basis. The determination of the appropriate level 
of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or non-payment by the Group’s customers and management consider a 
number of factors, including the financial strength of the customers, the level of default that the Group has suffered in the past, the age 
of the receivable outstanding and the Group’s trading experience with that customer. The provision for impairment of receivables at 31 
March 2015 was £5,636,000 (2014 – £5,161,000).
Revenue recognition
Revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation 
services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer. This policy involves the assessment of which customer 
projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects. We 
generally only enter into this type of contract in Enterprise Solutions but the assessments and estimates used by the Group could have a 
significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised on a project.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for tax. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain – particularly when doing business 
in emerging economies. The Group recognises provisions for tax based on estimates of taxes that are likely to become due. Where the 
final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax and 
deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made.
Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such 
intangible assets require the use of estimates including forecast performance and customer attrition rates. Future results are impacted 
by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would result in different effects on the income statement.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash flows and assumptions (including 
discount rates, timing and growth prospects) which are inherently subjective. Further details about the assumptions used are set out in 
note 14. 108 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser 
extent indirectly through resellers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes. It comprises 
initial licence fees, annual fees and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until:
 – a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced;
 – delivery has been made in accordance with that contract;
 – if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met; and
 – the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable. Where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist, revenue recognition is 
deferred until payment is due.
Initial/annual licence agreements
Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is 
charged every year. Annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core 
product upgrades and enhancements and remote support services. Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the 
right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met. Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the contract, which is typically twelve months. If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial 
licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements
As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental 
licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, which is typically one year, are non-cancellable 
and consist of two separate components; the initial software delivery, and the continuing right to use with customer support and 
maintenance. Revenue in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market 
value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer. This component is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the contract. The residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront, 
provided all of the above criteria have been met. Where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the 
customer support and maintenance element, all revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model. Under this model, a ‘basket’ of tokens representing licences to use 
different software products over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required. 
Where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised 
with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions 
being met. Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used.
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed under separate service arrangements. 
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the 
costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project. If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is 
recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred. Provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
If an arrangement includes both licence and service elements, licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software  
provided that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences 
are not subject to acceptance criteria. In all other cases, revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services  
are performed.
Statement of Group accounting policies continued 109 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is Pounds Sterling (£). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the 
Consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the 
date of the initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies. As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas 
subsidiaries are translated into Pounds Sterling (£) at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, and their Income statements 
are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Exceptional items
The Group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better 
understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group. The Group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises, 
fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when 
a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the 
Consolidated income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of 
acquisition. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible asset as set out below. 
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Consolidated income statement in 
the year in which it is incurred. Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical 
feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Amortisation is 
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows:
Years
Developed technology 5–12
Customer relationships 10–20
Other software 3
Purchased software rights 5–10 110 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Research expenditure
Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
Government grants
Grants in respect of specific Research & Development projects are recognised as receivable when there is reasonable assurance that 
they will be received and the conditions to obtain them have been complied with. They are credited to the income statement in the 
same period as the related Research & Development costs for which the grant is compensating. The grant income is presented as a 
deduction from the related expense.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life 
of the asset as follows:
Years
Computer equipment 3
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment 6–8
Motor vehicles 4
Leasehold buildings and improvements are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease (3 to 49 years) or useful 
economic life, if shorter. 
Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies and 
represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are 
independent of other cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated 
is tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. The carrying values 
of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes 
in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative 
expenses line item.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for 
any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts 
are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the Consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with 
an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value. For the purpose of the 
Consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments
The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign 
exchange risk. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All forward foreign exchange 
contracts have been marked-to-market and are held at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Group has not applied hedge 
accounting during the year and therefore movements in fair value are being recorded in the Consolidated income statement. Fair value is 
estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
Statement of Group accounting policies continued 111 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the  
lease term.
Taxation
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
During the period, legislation was enacted to allow UK companies to elect for the Research & Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) on 
qualifying expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013, instead of the existing super-deduction rules. At the balance sheet date management 
has concluded that the election will be made and therefore the RDEC is recorded as income included in profit before tax, netted against 
research & development expenses as the RDEC is of the nature of a government grant. In previous periods there was a reduction in the 
income tax expense.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences:
 – except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and
 – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax 
losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-
forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:
 – except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The income tax effects of items recorded in either other comprehensive income or equity are recognised in the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity respectively. Otherwise, income tax is 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement. 
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except:
 – where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the 
sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
 – receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
Consolidated balance sheet.  112 AVEVA Group plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Post retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany. The Group also provides certain post 
employment benefits to its South Korean employees. 
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002 and closed to 
future accrual from 31 March 2015. UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The German unfunded defined benefit schemes are closed to new applicants and provide benefits to nine deferred members. These 
schemes were acquired as part of previous business combinations. No current employees participate in the schemes. Full provision 
has been made for the liability on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one 
German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industry-wide defined benefit scheme. It is not 
possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and 
reasonable basis. Therefore the Group has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined  
contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by qualified external actuaries  
using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service 
cost) and to the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation). The retirement benefit liability 
in the Consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate derived from a 
published index of AA rated corporate bonds) as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled 
directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price. The value of a 
net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan 
or reductions in the future contributions. The current service cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an employee 
benefit expense. The net interest element of the defined benefit cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined 
benefit liability or asset.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and non-UK employees. Contributions to defined 
contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, 
further details of which are given in note 27. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which  
the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award 
(vesting date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date  
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that  
will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, subject to 
an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.
Employee benefit trust
The Group has established an employee benefit trust (AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008), which is a separately administered 
trust and is funded by loans from Group companies. The assets of the trust comprise shares in AVEVA Group plc and cash balances. 
The Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the Consolidated financial statements and shares held by the trust are 
recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
Consideration received for the sale of shares held by the trust is recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from 
the sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.

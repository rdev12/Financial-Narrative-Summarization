 A WORLD-LEADING BUSINESS
Genus plc
Annual Report 2014 A World Leader in Agriculture
Global demand for pork, beef and  
milk continues to increase, driven by 
urbanisation, population growth and 
rising incomes. Our genetics enable 
farmers to meet this demand with 
quality and efficiency. We are world 
leaders in our markets, with pioneering 
technology and a deep understanding 
of our customers’ needs.
“ We achieved a good performance in PIC and 
ABS in 2014, whilst Asia and specifically China 
was impacted by poor market conditions and 
the planned investments in expanding our 
porcine capacity. The strategic progress we have 
made positions us well to take advantage of 
improving market conditions. Although we face 
some continuing headwinds, we expect to 
perform in line with expectations in 2015.”

Genus at a Glance
Pioneering Animal Genetic Improvement
Genus provides farmers with superior 
genetics, so they can efficiently 
produce high-quality meat and milk. 
Our success has given us market-
leading positions. We have 26% of the 
porcine market, excluding China, more 
than double our nearest competitor,  
as well as 24% in beef and 8% of  
global dairy sales. The majority of our 
competitors are co-operatives, making 
Genus unique as a listed company.
What We Do
Genus is a world leader in applying 
biotechnology to advance the 
science of animal breeding 
and genetic improvement. 
Our technology is applicable 
to all livestock species and 
we currently commercialise 
it in dairy, beef and pork.
We breed the world’s best pigs 
and bulls, scientifically selecting 
livestock whose offspring will 
increase value for farmers and 
food producers around the world. 
In the porcine market, we offer 
genetically superior boars and 
sows that produce offspring with 
higher carcass value and desirable 
characteristics, such as feed-
efficient growth or leaner meat.
In the dairy and beef markets, our 
primary product is bull semen, 
enabling our customers to use 
artificial insemination to improve 
their herds and their efficiency.
How We Operate
Genus sells under well-known 
trademarks: ‘PIC’ for pigs and 
‘ABS’ for dairy and beef cattle. 
Our three business units are:
• Genus PIC, which serves porcine 
customers in North America, Latin 
America and Europe
• Genus ABS, which serves dairy 
and beef customers in North 
America, Latin America 
and Europe
• Genus Asia, which covers both 
porcine and bovine species in the 
fast-growing Asian market
Genus employs over 2,300 people, 
including 79 PhD scientists. We 
have five bull studs worldwide, 
and two porcine genetic nucleus 
farms, in South Dakota, US, and 
Saskatchewan, Canada. We use 
the porcine farms to improve 
the genetics we supply to both 
customers and third-party 
producers. These producers, 
known as multipliers, carry out 
most of our pig breeding needs.
Where We Operate
Genus companies operate in over 
25 countries on six continents. 
We also sell to customers in 
another 50 countries, through 
distribution partners. 
North America accounts for 
about 41% of sales, with Europe 
33% and Latin America and 
Asia each representing 13%.
A shared research and development 
function supports our operating 
divisions, with laboratories 
in Madison, Wisconsin, US. 
Our corporate headquarters 
are in Basingstoke, UK.

Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
“ The Board is focused on the Group’s continued 
growth, its research and development capabilities, 
and its expansion into new markets. We will 
continue to support the implementation of our 
strategy, as Genus seeks to benefit from the large 
and growing opportunity for animal genetics.”
Lykele van der Broek joined the 
Board on 1 July 2014. Before 
his retirement from Bayer 
CropScience, a division of Bayer 
AG, he held a number of senior 
international roles, including 
heading its BioScience division.
After eight years on the Board, 
Professor Barry Furr has indicated 
that he feels it is time to step 
down and so will retire at the 
Annual General Meeting in 
November 2014. Barry has provided 
invaluable scientific advice, in 
his role as Scientific Adviser to 
our Research and Development 
Portfolio Management Team and 
the Science Committee he chaired 
before that. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank him for his 
enormous contribution and to wish 
him well for the future. Duncan 
Maskell will become our Scientific 
Adviser on Barry’s retirement.
During the year, we also 
welcomed Dan Hartley as our 
new Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary. Dan 
brings a wealth of legal and 
biotech experience to Genus.
2014 was a challenging year for 
Genus and the Board is well aware 
that it was not a rewarding year for 
shareholders. The Group’s results 
for the year were unchanged in 
constant currency but lower in 
actual currency, due to the strength 
of Sterling in the year. Despite 
the challenging environment 
resulting from unexpected disease 
outbreaks and Chinese market 
conditions, our team of 2,300 
employees in over 25 countries has 
enabled Genus to achieve much 
more significant progress than 
the headline numbers suggest. 
I thank them for their commitment 
and hard work during the year.
The most visible evidence of 
this strategic progress is the 
acquisition of Génétiporc, which 
is meeting its objectives and 
already making an important 
contribution to performance as 
well as strengthening the genetic 
pool within PIC. We also made 
important progress in areas such as 
accelerating genetic improvement 
and adjusting the way we address 
key markets such as China. You 
can read more about the Group’s 
performance and progress in 
Karim’s report on pages 6 and 7.
Tough conditions within our markets 
have challenged us to sharpen our 
knowledge of the dynamics and risks 
of our business, and how we can 
respond effectively. Such capabilities 
can only be deployed if the 
management team is of sufficient 
calibre. Since Karim became CEO, 
he has created an outstanding 
leadership team with a mix of 
existing people in revised roles and 
new recruits to fill the gaps. As a 
Board we are now witnessing the 
impact that this team is beginning to 
have and it reinforces our confidence 
in our ability to create sustainable 
value from the large strategic 
opportunity which Genus has.
Strengthening the Board
The appointments of two new 
Non-Executive Directors strengthen 
the Board, as we seek to grow 
the business. Both of them bring 
experience and knowledge that 
will have great value to Genus. 
Professor Duncan Maskell joined 
us on 1 April 2014. He is one of the 
most senior scientists at Cambridge 
University and has been instrumental 
in co-founding several biotech 
companies. He also has extensive 
experience in advising companies 
on science and innovation. 05

Additional 
Information
It is important that as a Board we 
are close to the markets in which 
Genus operates, so we can make 
the right strategic choices. This 
year the Board visited China, which 
was extremely valuable given the 
impact it had on the Group’s results. 
Our visit helped us to understand 
at first hand the customers and 
markets there, as we refined our 
strategy for the country. In 2013, 
the Board visited Italy and in 2015 
we plan to visit Brazil, enabling 
us to cover three key continents 
over a three-year period. 
You can read more about 
how the Board operated in 
2014 and the importance we 
attach to good governance 
in the Corporate Governance 
section on pages 48 to 86.
Dividend
The Board is always aware 
that it directs the Company 
on the shareholders’ behalf. 
Providing attractive returns to 
shareholders is an important 
part of our corporate goals.
The Board is therefore 
recommending a final dividend of 
12.2 pence per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 5.5 
pence per share, will result in a 
dividend for the year of 17.7 pence 
per share, an increase of 10% over 
last year’s dividend. This continues 
our progressive dividend policy and 
reflects the Board’s confidence in 
Genus’s future. It is proposed that 
the final dividend will be paid on 
5 December 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 21 November 2014.
Summary
In summary, the Board is focused 
on the Group’s continued growth, 
its research and development 
capabilities, and its expansion into 
new markets. We will continue to 
support the implementation of 
our strategy, as Genus seeks to 
benefit from the large and growing 
opportunity for animal genetics.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s  
Review
We experienced a challenging year in 2014. While 
our overall results fell short of our growth objectives, 
our performance across most of the world outside 
China was strong. This was encouraging given 
challenges previously announced such as porcine 
epidemic diarrhoea virus (‘PEDv’). Despite our 
results in China, we continue to believe the 
opportunity there is large, that we are laying the 
right foundations for long-term success and have 
adapted our strategy to ensure this.
We continued to make good 
progress across our key strategic 
initiatives, with the acquisition 
and successful integration of 
Génétiporc in October 2013 
being a highlight. We accelerated 
genetic improvement across our 
species, which will help extend our 
product leadership and as market 
conditions improve, we are well 
positioned to accelerate growth. 
Group Performance
Overall performance across 
Genus was mixed. Genus ABS 
and PIC grew in double digits, in 
constant currency, but profits in 
Asia, and specifically China, were 
sharply lower. Sterling’s strength 
also substantially affected our 
reported results, as we earn much 
of our profit in US Dollars or related 
currencies. Adjusted profit before 
tax including joint ventures was 
£39.3m, 8% lower than in 2013 but 
unchanged in constant currency.
Volumes grew 8% in porcine and 
5% in dairy and beef, contributing 
to 8% revenue growth (12% in 
constant currency). Génétiporc 
and Asia led porcine volume 
growth. In bovine, Latin America 
rebounded strongly and our 
Indian business performed well.
Genus ABS increased profits by 
12% in constant currency, with 
all regions contributing, and a 
strong performance from our beef 
business. Genus PIC profits rose 
10% in constant currency, with 
contributions from the Génétiporc 
acquisition, continued good 
growth in Latin America and solid 
trading in North America, despite 
disease affecting the industry.
In Asia, the reduction in Chinese 
porcine profit was principally 
caused by our planned investments 
in capacity combined with very 
adverse market conditions for pig 
producers in the first half of this 
calendar year, but there is evidence 
these conditions are improving.
Strategy
The market opportunity for 
animal genetics is large and 
growing, driven by increasing 
animal protein consumption by 
a rising and increasingly urban 
global population. To meet this 
demand, farmers are increasingly 
employing technology, larger-scale 
production and the best genetics. 
Genus’s clear global leadership in 
porcine, dairy and beef is a firm 
foundation for growth. We have 
continued to execute vigorously 
the strategy we announced 
in 2012 and made substantial 
progress during the year.
In October 2013, we acquired 
Génétiporc, the Americas’ second-
largest porcine genetics company, 
for £22m. In February 2014, our 
Brazilian joint venture acquired 
Génétiporc do Brasil. This has 
enhanced our leadership in the 
Americas and brought valuable 
additional genetic traits into our 
porcine pure lines. We have rapidly 
integrated their operations and are 
on track to deliver the expected 
US$11m (£6.7m) of annual synergies 
by the end of the second year.
In China, our joint venture with 
Besun and our wholly-owned 
porcine nucleus farm, Chun Hua, 
became fully operational. These 
have enabled us to introduce 
new products and the latest 
genetics into China, and more 
than doubled our capacity there. 
We are already seeing the benefit, 
with customers such as New Hope, 
China’s largest feed producer 
and a top ten integrated pork 
producer, selecting PIC genetics. 
Our additional Chinese capacity 
brought expected start-up costs 
and greater exposure to commodity 
prices at a challenging time in 
the porcine market there. We are 
adjusting our strategy to deliver, 
where possible, future capacity 
increments through commercial 
multiplication agreements. We 
recently announced an agreement 
with Riverstone, a US-led group 
investing in China, to become a 
commercial multiplier and a royalty-
based customer there. This approach 
will reduce the number of porcine 
joint ventures we execute and reduce 
investment and commodity risk. 07

Additional 
Information
During the year, we signed our 
first bovine royalty agreement 
with ABP Food Group, the UK’s 
largest integrated beef processor, to 
develop proprietary indices for beef 
bulls and deliver superior genetics 
into their supply chain. We are also 
creating a beef nucleus herd, to 
accelerate genetic gain and increase 
our control of the resulting genetics.
Our Research and Development 
(‘R&D’) programmes used advanced 
selection techniques to accelerate 
genetic gain in the porcine nucleus 
herds. We also reduced further 
the lag between the genetics in 
the porcine nucleus and those on 
customers’ farms so they see the 
benefits of improved genetics more 
quickly. In dairy, the initial bull calves 
born from our recently established 
elite female herd included two 
with genomic test scores among 
the highest ABS has ever seen. 
These should start producing in 
late 2015. The project to develop 
a novel proprietary method of 
producing sexed bovine semen 
achieved an important milestone in 
successfully completing large-scale 
field trials. In July 2014, we initiated 
US legal proceedings against 
Sexing Technologies, the current 
provider of sexed semen, alleging 
abuse of its monopoly position.
Our People
In November 2013, Dr Denny Funk 
retired as Chief Scientific Officer 
and head of R&D after 19 years of 
service. We wish him well and are 
grateful for his many contributions. 
Dr Jonathan Lightner has joined 
us from DuPont Pioneer, where 
he was head of agricultural 
biotechnology, to replace Dr Funk. 
His broad experience in genetics 
and focus on intellectual property 
is already proving very valuable. 
Saskia Korink Romani became 
Chief Operating Officer of ABS and 
has moved to Madison, Wisconsin 
to lead that business. Tom Kilroy, 
our Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, left to pursue a 
commercial career and Dan Hartley 
replaced him, joining from Shire plc 
where he was Senior Vice President 
and International Counsel. Overall, 
our Genus Executive Leadership 
Team (‘GELT’) is highly talented 
and working well together.
Our employees’ energy, ability 
and passion are fundamental to 
our success. During the year, we 
further strengthened our people 
management practices, training 
and talent development. We also 
conducted our first employee survey, 
with 80% participating. The results 
showed significant commitment to 
our vision, values and strategy. 
Outlook
We are cautiously optimistic that 
2014’s challenges are starting to 
abate. While PEDv is still affecting 
our royalty revenues, there are signs 
that producers are learning to cope 
with it. The severe downturn in 
Chinese pig prices in 2014 has led to 
a reduction in the sow herd, which 
should better balance supply and 
demand in 2015. Additionally, the 
outlook for harvests in the Northern 
Hemisphere appears favourable 
which should lead to lower input 
costs for our customers. Although 
some headwinds remain, our 
business is positioned to accelerate 
growth and we expect to perform 
in line with expectations in 2015.

Market Opportunities
The Animal Genetics Market – Large and Growing
Global demand for animal protein is significant and 
growing. Meeting this demand is becoming more 
difficult as urbanisation increases, competing needs 
for land and water intensify and consumers require 
affordable, safe and high-quality animal protein. 
Genetics is critical to solving this global challenge, 
presenting a £3–4 billion gross profit opportunity. 
Three key drivers impact the use of high-quality 
animal genetics.
Growth in Protein 
Consumption
Animal protein consumption 
affects demand for animal genetics 
globally. Demand for animal protein 
continues to grow by 1–3% per 
year, and is rising particularly in 
emerging markets such as Brazil, 
Russia, India and China, where 
urbanisation is increasing rapidly. 
The chart below shows that this 
powerful trend – coupled with a 
continually rising global population 
– will continue for decades to come.

Additional 
Information
Farmers increasingly use high-quality 
genetics to meet demand. In dairy, artificial 
insemination (‘AI’) use has reached 
70% in the US, with large enterprise 
and commercial herds providing half 
of US milk production. In Mexico and 
India, AI is now used in around 50% of 
the herds, while in Brazil it is 13%.
In porcine, scale and integration drive the 
use of high-quality genetics. Large-scale 
integrated pork production continues 
to grow and now accounts for 60% of 
production in the US and 85% in Brazil. 
Large-scaled farming production in China 
grew from 11% in 2008 to 20% in 2014. 
Short-term, farmer profitability also 
affects the use of high-quality animal 
genetics. Low feed costs and high output 
prices give farmers cash flow to invest in 
genetics that can significantly boost their 
efficiency and long-term profitability. 
Milk, pork and beef profitability varies 
around the world, with markets at different 
stages of the cycle. For example, in the 
US, pork producers are considering 
expansion due to record pig prices, while 
Chinese pig producers await a market 
rebound before upgrading their genetics.
Farmers’ Use of Technology Farmer Profitability
“Demand for animal protein continues 
to grow by 1–3% per year particularly 
in emerging markets.”
Summary
In summary, the animal genetics market is large and 
continues to grow, as more technology is used to 
address the productivity challenge and meet the 
growing demand for milk, pork and beef. 10

Our Business Model
Genus’s Competitive Advantages
Genus’s business model is built on a number of 
competitive advantages, which help us to create 
value. Our strategy (see pages 16 and 17) helps us 
to reinforce and build on these advantages.
Our competitive edge comes from:
• continuously improving our 
proprietary lines of breeding animals, 
using the best science available;
• our global distribution capability, 
through our supply chain, technical 
service and sales network;
• long-lasting customer relationships, 
enhanced by our services to 
help farmers get the best from 
our products; and
• a business model and multi-species 
approach that allow us to continually 
strengthen and leverage our 
technology platform.
Robust Genetic 
Improvement
Genus accelerates 
genetic improvement 
by exploiting the rapid 
advances in molecular 
and genetic biology. Our 
proprietary techniques 
help us determine the 
best animals to mate, so 
our customers see faster 
genetic gains. We use 
proprietary indices of 
desirable animal traits 
to determine breeding 
goals. We have our own 
elite animals, which we 
supplement with genetics 
from outside our herds.
Our research division 
supports these 
programmes, through 
its work in areas such 
as gender skew and 
disease resistance (see 
pages 34 to 37). We 
employ more than 100 
scientists and technicians, 
and collaborate with 
universities, consortia 
and others. 
Realised Product 
Differentiation
Understanding customers’ 
needs helps us to 
develop outstanding and 
differentiated products 
and services. Consumers 
around the world have 
different preferences 
and we tailor our genetic 
programmes to deliver a 
wide range of products 
to help our customers 
meet these needs. 
Global Supply Chain
Supplying a biological 
product globally requires 
complex supply chain 
operations. In our porcine 
business, third-party 
multipliers and customers 
provide more than 95% 
of our pig-breeding 
requirements. This 
network of multiplication 
partners is a significant 
strength, allowing us to 
meet demand for our 
genetics while reducing 
our exposure to farming 
and commodity risk. 
In dairy and beef, Genus 
ABS uses a mix of 
employees, independent 
representatives and 
distributors, to efficiently 
reach customers 
and build loyalty. 
Technical Support 
Services
Ensuring our products 
meet expectations is 
critical to customer 
loyalty. Experienced 
technical service teams 
therefore help our 
customers to achieve the 
best results in areas such 
as nutrition, reproduction, 
health management 
and genetics.
For example, our global 
Genetic Management 
System helps dairy 
customers select the 
right bulls to meet their 
genetic goals. In porcine, 
we provide performance 
comparisons across 
our customers, so they 
can benchmark the 
benefit they get from 
our genetics against 
industry peers.
Key Account 
Management
Genus has long-lasting 
customer relationships. 
In porcine, our customers 
are increasingly under 
multi-year royalty 
contracts, through 
which customers pay 
us for the performance 
and value we deliver. In 
2014, 70% of our global 
porcine volumes were 
under royalty contracts.
In bovine, we sell 
most of our semen by 
the dose and use our 
services to build strong 
relationships. Our 
customer segmentation 
and account management 
allow us to focus on 
customers who value 
these relationships most.

Genomic Based Pedigree Selection 
(‘GBPS’)
PIC leads the way in using genomics to make 
breeding more accurate. Over the last two years, 
our R&D team has increased selection accuracy  
by 35%, with a marked effect on the rate of  
genetic progress. The team has developed 
proprietary genomic chips for sampling pigs’ DNA 
more intensively and uses sophisticated statistical 
techniques of imputation to enhance this genetic 
information at lower cost. 
Faster genetic improvement strengthens customer 
loyalty and increases our competitive lead. PIC has 
implemented GBPS throughout its global supply 
chain and, during 2015, customers should start to 
see the benefits, worth an estimated 60 cents per 
pig per annum to them. We are now exploring the 
same techniques to increase product differentiation 
in Genus ABS, by applying genomic prediction of 
proprietary traits developed through our Real 
World Data programme. 12

Embryo Transfer into India
India is the world’s largest dairy market but a 
typical Indian cow produces only 2,000 litres of 
milk, compared with 10,000 litres in the US, per 
annum. Indian farmers therefore want access to 
high-quality genes, to improve milk yield, quality 
and sustainability. However, local conditions have 
prevented genetic improvement, including a ban 
on importing live bulls and restrictions on 
importing semen. 
To address this, ABS imported embryos from elite 
North American genetics and implanted them  
in carefully selected heifers. The first resulting 
embryo transfer (‘ET’) bull, Pioneer, was born in 
2012 and began producing semen within a year. 
Genus now has five ET bulls and two ET heifer 
calves, with more pregnancies in progress. 
Compared with local bulls, farmers have been 
willing to pay significant premiums for access  
to these differentiated genetics.  13

3. Global Supply 
Chain
Reducing Genetic Lag
PIC’s genetic nucleus herds contain 6,000 sows. 
Along with the 170,000 sows in our global supply 
chain, they support our customers in producing 
110m pigs annually. Two years ago, PIC 
implemented a unique global genetic 
dissemination programme, so customers would 
benefit more quickly from accelerated genetic 
improvements in the nucleus herds. A single 
global team using consistent tools and methods 
ensures optimum gene dissemination, by 
controlling and monitoring matings throughout 
the supply chain. We also rationalised capacity 
and invested to provide a critical mass of animals 
by region. Now, elite animals anywhere in the 
supply chain can provide quick dissemination up 
or down the chain. Over a two-year period, this 
programme has reduced global genetic lag – the 
difference in genetic merit from the nucleus herd 
to the commercial pig – by 0.9 years to 3.5 years, 
delivering an extra US$2.21 of genetic value per 
slaughter animal to customers. 14

Valiant Foam-Active Wipes
Disinfecting cows’ teats is essential for preventing 
environmental mastitis, which affects the cow’s 
health and milk quality. Existing cleaning methods 
add time and labour to the milking process, while 
the quick and easy wipes used on many farms are 
less effective. To solve this problem, Genus ABS 
invented Valiant Foam-Active Wipes, the only 
foaming chlorine dioxide pre-wipe on the market, 
which is 100 times more effective than other teat 
wipe products. The wipes particularly help 
customers with larger herds to protect their 
animals, without adding time to milking routines. 
Since its UK launch in 2013, sales have been double 
our expectations, as farmers see real productivity 
and health improvements in their herds. We are 
now rolling out the wipes internationally, so our 
other customers can benefit too. 15

Groundbreaking Partnership  
in the Philippines
Commercial pig production involves high up-front 
investment and a long production cycle. This can 
be a barrier for existing or aspiring producers, 
particularly in developing countries like the 
Philippines. But through our innovative partnership 
with the Bank of the Philippine Islands, producers 
can now access funding on favourable terms 
– together with technical insight and support from 
Genus PIC – if they set up, expand or improve their 
herds with our genetics. Producers receive a 
package of valuable financial and technical 
support while our team builds a relationship with 
them, demonstrating our expertise and the value 
of our products and services. The partnership has 
already helped three customers to secure loans 
totalling £4.6m, with a range of other projects in 
development or under discussion.  16

Principal Risks and  
Uncertainties
Genus supplies biological products to agricultural customers 
and is exposed to a wide range of risks and uncertainties. 
Disease outbreaks in the porcine industry and volatility in 
emerging markets, such as China, are examples of challenges 
we faced in 2014. The table below outlines the principal risks 
and uncertainties affecting Genus and how we manage them. 
Strategic Risks
Risk Description How We Manage Risk Risk Change in FY14
Product Development 
and Competitive Edge
• Development programme fails  
to produce best genetics  
for customers
• Increased competition in 
developed and emerging markets 
reduces market share and margins
We have dedicated teams who 
align our product development to 
customer requirements, while our 
technical services help customers to 
make best use of our products. We 
frequently measure our performance 
against competitors in customers’ 
systems to ensure the value added 
by our genetics remains competitive.
Commercialisation 
of Research
• Failure to focus research initiatives 
on commercially important areas
• Failure to lead on ‘game-changing’ 
technology or to make new 
initiatives commercially viable
• Failure to commercialise new 
technology due to third-party 
intellectual property (‘IP’)
Our R&D Portfolio Management 
Team oversees our research, ensures 
we are correctly prioritising our 
R&D investments and assesses 
the adequacy of resources and 
its IP freedom to operate. The 
Board is updated regularly on 
key development projects.
Key initiatives are at an advanced 
stage of the R&D lifecycle.
Capturing Value  
Through Acquisitions
• Failure to identify appropriate 
investment opportunities or to 
perform sound due diligence
• Failure to successfully integrate 
an acquired business
We have a rigorous acquisition 
analysis and due diligence 
process, with the Board reviewing 
and signing-off all projects. 
We also have a structured post-
acquisition integration planning 
and execution process.
In 2014, we successfully acquired 
and integrated Génétiporc, showing 
that our processes are robust.
Emerging Markets
• Failure to appropriately 
develop business in China 
and emerging markets
We have a robust organisation, 
blending local and expatriate 
executives supported by the global 
species teams, to ensure we comply 
with our global standards. The 
Board provides regular oversight 
and visited China in April 2014.
Volatility in China increased our 
exposure in 2014. In response, 
we adjusted our plans and 
approach to the Chinese market.

Case Study
Strengthening Our Position in Major Markets
In October 2013, we 
acquired Génétiporc 
from Aliments Breton 
Foods Group, North 
America’s largest 
producer and processor 
of organic and natural 
pork. Génétiporc is a 
porcine genetics business with 
operations in the US, Canada, 
Mexico and a joint venture in 
Brazil. The business is an excellent 
fit for PIC, with similar values and 
an emphasis on meat quality, product 
development, biosecurity and health. 
The rapid integration of Génétiporc with PIC’s 
operations has further strengthened our position 
in the Americas, increasing our market share by 
six percentage points. Its complementary product 
portfolio expands PIC’s genetic diversity and 
supports future product development worldwide. 
The broader supply chain and multiplier base mean 
we can better serve our customers, and we can 
also offer our market-leading technical and health 
services to Génétiporc’s customers, more than 
95% of which have stayed with us since the acquisition. 
Acquiring Génétiporc is an important step in Genus’s 
strategic development, as we focus on providing the very 
best genetics particularly to integrated pork producers.

accounts in Europe; and
• introduce an innovative relationship management 
system, to better align our global Key Account 
Management and Technical Service teams with 
customer needs.
Tailoring the 
Business Model
We aimed to: 
• capitalise on growth opportunities for terminal sires 
by developing consistent product offerings, aligning 
supply chain capacity and applying value-based 
business models; continue to expand the royalty 
model; and
• develop targeted combinations of products and services.
During the year, we: 
• introduced value-based pricing for terminal sire 
offerings in Europe;
• expanded the availability of our leading Camborough 
female product in Europe; and

Operating Review
“ Genus PIC performed well in FY14 and is strongly 
positioned to benefit from a resumption of  
growth in the industry.”
Case Study
Adding Value with Our Technical Services
Vall Companys in Spain is PIC’s 
largest European customer. 
Through its fully integrated 
production, 190,000 sows 
produce more than 245,000 
tonnes of pork each year. In 
February, a dozen members of 
PIC’s Global Technical Services 
team travelled from around the 
world to work in collaboration 
with Vall’s production leadership. 
This was the culmination of 
months of preparation. Through 
presentations, site visits and 
roundtable discussions, we 
covered topics ranging from 
boar stud optimisation to gilt 
development principles. As the 
customer’s Production Director, 
Albert Vidal, said: “It was an 
excellent experience and a great 
opportunity to have so many 
experts helping our company.”
Market
Market conditions were challenging 
for PIC in 2014 particularly in the 
US, due to PEDv. This has affected 
well over half the US and Mexican 
pig herds, as well as herds in 
Canada, South Korea and Japan. 
PEDv results in severe mortality 
in young piglets and has led to 
an approximately 5–10% decline 
in weekly US pig slaughter since 
March 2014. Whilst some of this 
reduction has been offset by higher 
weights, the decline in slaughter 
is expected to accelerate in the 
second half of the calendar year.
This has led to record high US 
pork prices and futures, making 
pork production very profitable 
for farmers despite the disease 
challenges. In addition, farmers 
have benefited from lower input 
costs following good harvests in 
2013. However, the industry has not 
yet expanded to take advantage of 
these conditions, as it deals with the 
operational issues caused by PEDv.
Health concerns led to a number 
of border closures, to try and halt 
the spread of PEDv. In addition, 
Russia closed its border to the EU, 
due to African Swine Fever. This 
reduced exports from the EU and 
held back EU pork prices, while in 
Russia pork prices rose sharply. 
Performance
Volume growth of 5% was driven 
by the Génétiporc acquisition, with 
underlying royalty volumes in North 
America and Mexico affected by 
PEDv losses and limited sow herd 
expansion. Revenue increased by 
19%, but margins were lower due 
to higher animal sales as a result of 
Génétiporc, whose business model 
is currently based more on up-front 
sales than PIC’s. Adjusted operating 
profit increased by 10%, benefiting 
from the expected initial contribution 
of Génétiporc and another year of 
robust growth in Latin America. 
In North America, profits were up 
6%. Royalty income was 7% higher 
than the previous year and animal 
sales were up by more than 100%, 
driven primarily by Génétiporc.  25

“Volume growth of  
5% was driven by the 
Génétiporc acquisition.”
The business performed well in 
difficult circumstances, through 
focusing on meeting customer needs 
and maintaining supply availability.
In Latin America, volumes grew by 
3%, with another 2% shift to royalty 
contracts. Profits were up 20%, 
with around half of this growth 
coming from Génétiporc. Our 
joint venture in Brazil had a very 
successful year, increasing adjusted 
profits by 35% and making progress 
across all its strategic initiatives.
In line with our strategy, the 
European business is shifting its 
business model to target the larger 
integrated pork producers and 
reduce its exposure to directly 
owned operations. It increased 
revenue by 4% and profit by 1% in 
FY14, on lower volumes. Strategic 
progress included closing an 
owned farm in Poland; further 
streamlining the UK boar stud 
operations, along with bringing 
the studs into line with global 
standards; establishing European 
focused support in Technical 
Services, Genetic Services, Health 
Assurance and Supply Chain; and 
developing a strong supply of high 
indexing animals at multiplication 
partners, to supply our best 
products to European customers. 
During the year, we successfully 
acquired and integrated Génétiporc 
into our operations. The acquisition 
has expanded our supply chain for 
boars and gilts, which has played 
a significant role in enabling us to 
maintain supply availability in the 
face of industry disease challenges. 
We remain on track to deliver 
the expected synergies from the 
acquisition in the planned timeframe. 
PIC also continued to invest in 
technology (particularly genomics), 
distribution networks, technical 
service capabilities and key account 
management, to help us add even 
greater value for customers.
Summary
Favourable margin expectations 
for producers, combined with 
greater experience in managing 
PEDv, should encourage industry 
expansion as FY15 progresses. 
PIC performed well in FY14 with 
a 10% increase in profits and is 
strongly positioned to benefit from a 
resumption of growth in the industry. 26

Case Study
Improving Our Customers’ Efficiency
Genus ABS’s dairy technicians 
analysed data from hundreds  
of farms who use ABS Monitor, 
our new online service that 
simplifies real-time measurement 
of reproductive efficiency. This 
highlighted ways to improve  
our customers’ reproductive  
and financial efficiency. For this 
targeted segment, the Genus  
ABS team in Brazil is tailoring  
its dairy business model through  
a new programme called DEL160, 
which uses intensified technical 
service support and a unique 
genetic selection index based  
on Brazilian economics, to help 
customers improve production.  
A novel payment system shares 
the programme’s economic 
impact, reducing our selected 
customers’ production costs  
by 15–20%, while improving  
profit for Genus ABS.

Case Study
Creating a Closed-Loop Supply Chain in UK Beef
In 2014, Genus and ABP signed 
an agreement to deliver the 
first proprietary beef genetics 
index for use on the UK dairy 
herd, which supplies nearly 52% 
of UK-processed beef. Using 
ABP’s assessments and data, 
we are developing a custom 
index to identify bulls from 
our beef nucleus herd. The 
resulting progeny will be more 
feed-efficient, higher value and 
consistent quality. Only dairy 
producers supplying calves 
to ABP will have access to the 
bulls. They will benefit from 
ABP’s expertise, while Genus will 
receive a payment for the genetic 
value. This closed-loop supply 
chain will be a significant step 
towards delivering differentiation 
and upstream royalties. 
Market 
Dairy market conditions were 
favourable during the financial year, 
with milk prices strong in all regions 
and feed costs significantly lower as 
well. Weather conditions during the 
year were also generally favourable 
for producers in most countries, 
although the US was affected by 
a severe winter and parts of the 
south and west of the country 
continued to experience drought. 
High Chinese demand for imported 
milk supported milk prices globally 
and encouraged key exporters 
such as New Zealand and the EU 
to increase production yield from 
their herds, eventually leading to a 
moderation of milk prices towards 
the end of the period. With increased 
supply now meeting demand, 
prices are expected to stabilise. 
During the year, we saw a gradual 
return of customer confidence 
as their finances improved. 
The beef cattle price saw substantial 
gains, of around 15%, in the main 
US and Brazilian markets, with all-
time record prices being set during 
the year. Low US cattle inventories 
from previous years, combined with 
female retention by growers wanting 
to increase calf production to rebuild 
herd sizes, led to tight supply in 
the US. In South America, cattle 
availability and slaughter have been 
rising following two years of herd 
rebuilding. Demand for exports from 
key countries was also strong. These 
factors generated good market 
conditions for our beef business, 
which are currently expected to 
continue into the next year.

“Good overall trading with

management resulted in  
a 12% increase in profits  
for Genus ABS.”
Performance
Genus ABS had a strong year, 
benefiting from the positive market 
and weather conditions in most of 
the world. Profits grew in all regions, 
as Genus ABS regained momentum 
in our core markets. Overall, volumes 
for Genus ABS were up 5%, led 
by Latin America. Effective sales 
management enabled us to achieve 
a 2% improvement in average 
selling prices (‘blend’) across the 
business which, along with strong 
ancillary product sales, contributed 
to an increase in profit of 12%.
In North America, profits grew by 
9% on flat volumes, due to increased 
blend, strong cost management 
and significant contributions 
from adjacent products. Beef 
performance was very strong, 
with volumes up 21% over the prior 
year, including an increasing use 
of beef semen in dairy cows. 
In Europe, profits were 5% up last 
year with 3% growth in volumes 
driven by France, the UK and Italy 
as well as a 3% blend increase. In 
May 2014, we signed an innovative 
five-year partnership with ABP 
Food Group, the largest beef 
processor in the UK. Genus will 
develop a customised index for beef 
bulls tailored to economic traits 
important to ABP. Dairy farmers 
producing calves using Genus 
beef semen will deliver superior 
genetics into the ABP supply chain. 
This arrangement marks the first 
time that Genus ABS has agreed 
a royalty-based fee structure.
Across Latin America, profits were 
up 19% on a 13% increase in volumes, 
combined with a flat blend. This 
performance was driven by an 
exceptional recovery in Brazil, after 
the previous year’s difficult weather 
conditions, and a strong year-on-
year performance in Mexico. Beef 
volumes were exceptionally strong 
in the region, reflecting both the 
favourable market conditions and 
the strength of our product portfolio.
Summary
Good overall trading with 
disciplined price and cost 
management resulted in a 12% 
increase in profits for Genus ABS.  30

Case Study
Growing Our Partnership with GreenFeed
Our partner in Vietnam is 
GreenFeed, the country’s fourth 
largest animal feed supplier. 
During the year, we stocked their 
new nucleus farm at Cujut with 
1,400 gilts and grew semen sales 
by 275%, as stud capacity came 
online and PIC-sired progeny 
on customer farms excelled in 
growth rate, feed conversion, 
carcass yield and pork quality. 
The first sales of parent gilts 
from the multiplication units 
stocked in FY13 began ahead 
of schedule and productivity 
exceeded expectations, resulting 
in significantly higher selection 
rates. These achievements 
grew royalty income by more 
than 300%. We now plan to 
double the nucleus farm’s 
capacity in the next 12 months.

SKX, so we can sell directly; and
• grew our business in the Philippines by 41% and continued 
our partnership with the Bank of the Philippine Islands 
(‘BPI’).
We will: 
• continue to implement PIC’s key account strategy, 
to grow presence with leading integrated pork 
producers in China;
• drive growth and support partners in Japan, Korea 
and Vietnam; and
• further expand our sales channels in India.
Tailoring the 
Business Model
We aimed to: 
• pursue further joint ventures in China; expand our semen 
production capacity in India; implement our new strategy 
in the Philippines; and simplify our operations and grow 
through our key account strategy.
During the year, we: 
• signed an agreement with BG Chitale in India for a new 
bull stud, and increased genomic semen sales by adding 
distributors and retail outlets;
• strengthened our porcine joint venture in China with 
Besun, but did not proceed with a joint venture with 
Shennong; and
• grew our royalty revenue in the Philippines in key 
accounts such as San Miguel Food Corporation, and 
increased Vietnamese royalty revenue by more than 
300% through our GreenFeed partnership.
We will:
• complete and populate the Chitale stud, while 
improving genomic semen sales and prices in India;
• pursue opportunities for third-party production 
arrangements and increase our royalty business in 
China porcine; and
• grow in the Philippines, through the new breeding 
pyramid, our BPI partnership and key accounts.
Strengthening Core 
Competencies 
We aimed to: 
• build on the sound platform established in our key 
markets, strengthening our teams through training and 
developing the necessary key account and technical 
service skills.
During the year, we: 
• developed our Chinese team through training and 
expatriate appointments;
• relocated the global Director of Genetic Services 
from the US to Shanghai, to work with the local  
team and key accounts; and
• harnessed the PIC and ABS technical teams, 
to strengthen our skills and expertise.
We will:
• develop employees’ knowledge and expertise, 
through expatriate assignments and training; and
• continue cross-fertilisation of skills from other parts 
of the Group. 32

Operating Review
“ 2014 was a challenging year operationally in China, 
but saw strong results in other growth markets.”
Case Study
Supporting a Major New Customer in China
New Hope Group is China’s 
largest private company and its 
biggest animal feed producer,  
as well as one of the country’s 
leading dairy and meat 
producers. Its Xiajin project is 
one of the most advanced farms 
in China and aims to provide 
around 340,000 slaughter pigs 
annually. In 2013, New Hope 
decided to use only PIC genetics 
at Xiajin and signed a stocking 
supply agreement with us. In 
June 2014, we successfully 
delivered 4,200 gilts, including 
new lines we imported to the 
Chun Hua nucleus farm last year. 
The second 5,400 gilts stocking 
is due this autumn, to complete 
Xiajin’s capacity.
In Russia, low pig prices and 
high feed costs in the first half 
resulted in losses for producers 
and limited investments. However, 
the pig price rebounded strongly 
in the second half, following 
the Russian border’s closure to 
pigs from the EU, due to African 
Swine Fever, and the temporary 
restriction of North American 
imports due to PEDv. The Ukraine 
political crisis has raised interest 
rates and devalued the Rouble, 
adding to uncertainty in Russia. 
Pig prices in the Philippines were 
consistently high, reaching a record 
at year end. Prices are expected 
to remain firm, due to PEDv. 
Producers are profitable and the 
industry is attracting investment. 
Bovine
Australian milk prices improved 
during the year. However, the 
price may come under pressure, 
due to higher global production.
Milk prices in Russia started lower 
than FY13 but increased steadily 
from October and were about 
30% up by year end. Processors 
were short of milk, especially after 
import restrictions from some 
countries were implemented. 
Dairy cow numbers have further 
reduced and the drive for beef 
production has moderated.
The milk price in China remained 
high and import demand was 
strong. Consolidation of farms 
and dairy processors continued. 
Indian milk prices have increased 
strongly, as processors compete 
for supply. Tight import 
restrictions on semen and 
embryos validate our strategy 
to establish local production.
Performance
Revenue reduced by 8% and 
adjusted operating profit was 
49% lower than the strong FY13, 
caused by results in China being 
more than £6m lower year-on-
year in constant currency. Outside 
China, good performances in 
Russia and the Philippines were 
counter-balanced by more difficult 
trading in Australia and our bovine 
distributor markets. Russia and India 
respectively led volume growth of 
22% in porcine and 7% in bovine.
Market
Porcine
Chinese pork producers were 
profitable in the first half but pork 
prices fell by more than 25% in the 
first few months of 2014, causing 
producers to lose up to £50 per pig 
in the second half. This significantly 
reduced the larger producers’ 
planned expansion projects and the 
demand for breeding stock. The 
losses meant many less-efficient 
farmers left the industry. As a result, 
figures from the Chinese Ministry 
of Agriculture suggest the sow 
herd has reduced by around 4m 
heads (8%) since the start of the 
year, making stronger prices likely 
in 2015. Widespread PEDv also 
made animal movements difficult.

Porcine
China porcine operating profit fell 
more than £5m, as a result of the 
prior year profit from stocking the 
Besun joint venture farm; expected 
investment in start-up losses from 
capacity increases at Besun and 
the Chun Hua nucleus farm; and 
very poor market conditions. 
Volume growth of 9% was below 
expectations, as many producers 
halted new stockings. Our supply 
chain also incurred production 
losses due to low pig prices. 
Despite these difficulties, we made 
significant strategic progress in 
China. We launched an updated 
product range from Chun Hua and 
Besun is now fully operational. These 
units have more than doubled our 
Chinese capacity. We continued to 
expand our business with leading 
integrators, including delivering 
4,200 animals to New Hope, China’s 
leading animal feed producer and 
a top-ten pig producer. In addition, 
since the year end, we signed a 
commercial multiplication agreement 
with Riverstone, a pig production joint 
venture in China between Cargill’s 
Black River and Pipestone, and a 
royalty agreement for their future 
pig production using PIC genetics. 
As our Chinese business matures, 
we will seek to lower farming risk 
and investment cost by adding 
capacity through multiplication 
contracts where possible, creating 
fewer new joint ventures and 
increasing the proportion of 
royalty-based arrangements.

We imported over 1,200 animals 
into the Philippines, to stock a

Elsewhere in the region, we stocked 
a nucleus unit in Vietnam, as 
we expanded our business with 
our local partner, GreenFeed.
Bovine
In China, we restructured our 
relationship with SKX to a non-
exclusive basis and now sell 
directly to key dairies and other 
distribution channels. This transition 
reduced first half results but 
led to a stronger second half.
Indian dairy volumes grew 
strongly, as our business gained 
momentum. We incorporated a 
joint venture with BG Chitale, to 
construct and operate a bull stud 
to expand production capacity. 
We grew domestic volumes by 
50% to 2.2m doses and launched a 
range of genomic bulls, improving 
overall domestic blend by 17% and 
demonstrating solid demand for 
differentiated genetics in India. 
The Australian business had 
a challenging year but was 
restructured to cost-effectively 
service the Australian industry. 
Distributor markets were 
lower due to the timing of 
shipments year to year.
Summary
2014 was a challenging year 
operationally in China, but saw 
strong results in other growth 
markets. We remain confident that 
our investment in the important 
Chinese market and strengthening 
strategic position will yield 
benefits as the market recovers.  34

Case Study
Exploring the Limits of Resolution of Genetic Information
In 2014, in collaboration with 
Edinburgh Genomics and The 
Roslin Institute at the University 
of Edinburgh, we completed the 
first full exome sequencing in pigs. 
This examines the most important 
parts of an animal’s DNA, the 
expressed genome (‘exome’). Our 
team sequenced the exomes of 
96 pigs, representing the known 
variation in one of PIC’s leading 
global proprietary populations, to 
capture as many genetic variants 
as possible. Combining these 
results with our unique phenotype 
data on the same animals shows 
associations between sequence 
variation and commercially 
beneficial traits. PIC will use this 
information to improve genomic 
selection accuracy, including 
better reproductive outcomes.
Meeting Customer Needs Today, 
Anticipating their Needs for 
Tomorrow
Delivering the genetic improvements 
our customers want requires a team 
effort, involving our technologists, 
business people and our customers. 
Our decades long customer 
relationships give us critical 
insights that guide our research. 
Because genetic improvement is 
a long-term process, the ability 
to anticipate customer needs 
over several years is often what 
separates failure from success. 
We use a portfolio process with 
business input to select, target and 
manage our R&D efforts across 
three core platforms: disease 
resilience and resistance; gender 
skew; and genomic selection. 
Disease Resilience and Resistance
Our open innovation model for 
collaborative R&D made great 
progress in 2014. To solve complex 
problems, we bring together our 
own capabilities with the best of 
the public sector. Our work with 
The Roslin Institute has progressed 
projects addressing resistance and 
resilience to key porcine diseases, 
such as porcine respiratory and 
reproductive syndrome (‘PRRS’) 
and African Swine Fever. In seeking 
to solve complex challenges 
like PRRS, we use numerous 
technical approaches, to increase 
the probability of success. 35

Gender Skew
Livestock producers often benefit 
from having offspring of one sex 
result from a mating. For example, 
dairy producers prefer to have 
female calves result from matings, 
so they have ample, high-quality 
replacement heifers to choose from. 
Our gender skew initiative aims to 
create technology to realise this 
benefit at greater efficiency and 
reduced cost, compared to current 
technologies. We have continued 
to make progress pursuing 
multiple technical approaches 
to sexed semen technology. 
We are advancing a biomechanical 
technology that will offer a more 
efficient gender skewed product 
for our customers globally. 
This technology is in late stage 
development and completed 
successful field trials in 2014. It is on 
track for commercial deployment 
in the second half of the decade. 
We believe gender skew has 
applications beyond dairy and 
that it can benefit from delivery 
approaches that do not depend 
on manipulation after collection. 
Subsequent generations of the 
technology will be based on 
multiple approaches that we are 
pursuing in the research phase. 
Our aim with these successor 
technologies is to use genetic 
controls to produce ejaculate that 
is already optimised for the desired 
gender, opening up the benefit of 
gender skewing to markets and 
animals that current technologies 
cannot practically serve.
Genomic Selection
The foundation of our business 
is genetic improvement through 
natural mating and selection. 
Genomic selection improves the 
speed and quality of outcomes from 
this process, by using contemporary 
molecular genetic information 
and tools. Today, we lead the 
animal genetic industry in applying 
single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(‘SNPs’), imputation and single step 
genomic prediction to improving 
livestock. We genotype tens of 
thousands of animals annually, 
generating hundreds of millions 
of data points. We then combine 
this information with proprietary 
animal performance information, 
imputation and predictive modelling. 
This allows us to identify the most 
elite animals, select the optimum 
matings and advance the most 
economically advantaged progeny 
for sale to our customers. 
Genomics advances rapidly. 
In addition to our day-to-day 
application of genomics in our 
breeding processes, our research 
team is exploring the limits of 
genome information content, 
through projects such as porcine 
exome sequencing. This saw us 
sequence the expressed genes 
of 96 elite proprietary animals 
from the PIC product line. The 
highest possible resolution of 
genomic information is the 
physical DNA sequence itself, 
and our research team is probing 
the extremes of both capabilities 
and the practical applications 
of this type of information. 36

Case Study
Increasing Genetic Control and Product Differentiation
In 2013, our dairy product 
development team started 
a key project to develop a 
proprietary genetic nucleus of 
elite Holstein females. By owning 
elite females, we can control 
both sides of the matings that 
produce elite sires. This controls 
the cost of acquiring those sires 
and allows us to emphasise 
the genetics that will drive our 
customers’ profitability and our 
differentiation. Within 18 months, 
we are already producing unique 
elite young sires, including one 
in the ABS top 10 of all time for 
the US TPI and NM$ indices 
and another best ever young 
sire for ABS within international 
rankings (top 35 US, top 15 
Canada, top 3 UK, top 10 Italy). 
This gives us confidence that we 
will create improved products 
at lower costs than buying on 
the open breeding market.
Bovine product development 
investment grew 17% year over 
year, reflecting our continued 
investments to deliver genetic 
control, differentiated products 
and customer focused genetic 
improvement. We continued to grow 
our investment in our Real World 
Data (‘RWD’) infrastructure, enabling 
us to develop new genetic traits and 
customer profit-focused indices, to 
further our genetic differentiation. 
Our RWD system grew considerably 
in 2014. The number of farms it 
covers has increased 50% year over 
year and now includes operations 
in the US, UK, Mexico and Chile. 
Animal numbers have similarly 
increased and we now have more 
than 18m cow records in our RWD 
set. Using this information in 2014, 
we developed and implemented 
two custom dairy indices focused 
on specific operational types, 
for the unique needs of global 
customers. We are implementing 
these dairy indices with select 
customer pilots in Brazil and the US. 
Our RWD data set also gives us 
unique information on economic 
events that are critical to profitable 
dairy farming, such as disease 
occurrence. In 2014, we used this 
information to identify unique 
genetic traits which reduce the 
occurrence of negative events. 
To increase our differentiation 
and control in the Holstein breed, 
we have created a genetic nucleus 
of elite females. By controlling both 
sides of the matings used to create 
new sires, we enhance our genetic 
control and enable our breeding 
programme to pursue unique 
targets, such as these proprietary 
traits and indices. We also 
increased our investment in beef 
product development, naming 
a global product development 
director for beef, Dr Matthew 
Cleveland, and beginning to 
establish a beef genetic nucleus.
Performance
Investment in R&D for the year 
increased by 5%. This reflected 
a further increase in research 
expenditure and growth in 
both dairy and beef product 
development. In porcine product 
development, growth investments 
in product validation and genomic 
testing were offset by moderating 
feed costs and improved slaughter 
prices in the genetic nucleus farms. 
Spending on the Génétiporc nucleus 
herds was also partially offset 
by the receipt of back-payments 
under a Canadian government 
agricultural support programme.
We focused our research 
expenditure in the areas of 
genomic evaluation, gender skew 
and animal health. In genomic 
evaluation, we completed the first 
ever porcine exome sequencing 
project, producing a comprehensive 
examination of the expressed genes 
in nearly 96 animals from an elite 
PIC sire line. In gender skew, we 
successfully tested our sexed semen 
technology in field trials and in 
disease we progressed our efforts 
to produce gene edited animals. 37

Porcine product development 
investment declined 6% year over

improved slaughter prices and the 
Canadian government support

the Génétiporc acquisition into the 
PIC breeding programme, creating 
new products and further product 
improvement opportunities. We 
completed global implementation 
of single step genomic prediction 
and relationship based selection 
with imputation for all traits and 
animals around the world in the

Financial Review
Our financial results in 2014 were mixed, with strength 
in PIC and ABS offset by challenging conditions in Asia, 
and specifically China. In the rest of the world outside 
China, we achieved double digit constant currency 
profit growth but including China, overall adjusted 
profit before tax was flat in constant currency. 
The effect of the stronger pound 
during the year on the translation 
of our overseas profits reduced 
the Group’s adjusted profit before 
tax by £3.2m or 8% compared 
with FY13. Constant currency 
growth rates better reflect the 
Group’s underlying performance 
and are quoted in the financial 
review unless stated otherwise.
On a statutory basis, profit 
before tax was 14% higher in 
actual currency primarily due 
to an increase in the value of 
biological assets. However, we 
continue to use adjusted results 
as our prime measures of financial 
performance as they better 
reflect our underlying progress. 
Revenue
Revenue grew 8% in actual currency 
(12% in constant currency) to 
£372.2m (2013: £345.3m) with Genus 
PIC growing at 19% with the benefit 
of the Génétiporc acquisition and 
Genus ABS also growing in double 
digits at 10%. This growth was 
partially offset by an 8% revenue 
decline in Asia, primarily in China.
Adjusted Operating Profit 
Adjusted operating profit  
including joint ventures of £44.8m 
(2013: £48.2m) was unchanged in 
constant currency and 7% lower 
in actual currency. Genus’s share 
of joint venture profits was lower 
at £1.9m (2013: £3.2m), as strong 
growth at Agroceres PIC in Brazil 
was not enough to offset the start-
up losses incurred by Besun in China.

Profit growth was strongest in 
Genus ABS, up 12%, benefiting 
from positive market and weather 
conditions. Profits grew in all regions 
and we had good momentum in our 
core markets. Overall, volumes for 
Genus ABS were up 5%, principally 
driven by Latin America. 
Genus PIC also had a strong year, with 
profits including joint ventures up 
10%. Volume growth of 5% was driven 
by the Génétiporc acquisition and 
another good year in Latin America. 
This result was achieved despite 
underlying royalty volumes in North 
America and Mexico being affected by 
PEDv and limited sow herd expansion. 
Profits in Genus Asia excluding joint 
ventures decreased by 38%, against 
a strong prior year which included 
stocking Besun. This was mainly due 
to our performance in China, where 
we invested in capacity and porcine 
market conditions were poor. Genus 
Asia’s bovine results were also lower 
but the porcine businesses in Russia 
and the Philippines performed well. 
In research and development, 
costs were 5% higher than in 2013, 
reflecting an increase in research 
and growth in both dairy and 
beef product development. In 
porcine product development, our 
additional investments in product 
validation and genomic testing 
were offset by moderating feed 
costs and improved slaughter prices 
in the genetic nucleus farms. 40

Financial Review
continued
The effective rate remains higher 
than the UK corporate tax rate. 
This is due to the mix of overseas 
profits, particularly the proportion 
of profits generated in the United 
States, where the statutory tax 
rate is approximately 39%, and the 
impact of withholding taxes on the 
repatriation of funds to the UK.
The tax rate on statutory profits was 
24.3% (2013: 30.0%). In addition to 
the factors mentioned above, there 
was a favourable impact due to the 
revaluation at lower tax rates of 
deferred tax liabilities associated 
with biological and intangible assets.
Earnings Per Share
Adjusted basic earnings per share 
declined by 5% to 46.5 pence 
(2013: 49.1 pence), reflecting the 
impact of exchange rates, but rose 
3% in constant currency. Basic 
earnings per share on a statutory 
basis were 47.7 pence (2013: 38.8 
pence), benefiting from an increase 
in the value of biological assets 
and the lower statutory tax rate.
Biological Assets 
A feature of the Group’s net assets 
is its substantial investment in 
biological assets, which IAS 41 
requires us to state at fair value. 
At 30 June 2014, the carrying 
value of biological assets was 
£275.5m (2013: £289.0m), as set

strongest in Brazil and India, where 
we benefited from increased sales 
of lower-priced locally produced 
semen. Sales of semen from our 
global studs, which represent 76% 
of semen sales by volume, increased 
by 2%. Profits decreased by 6% on 
last year, primarily due to lower 
sales in Asian markets and higher 
product development costs.
Porcine revenues grew by 14%, 
with royalty income up 13% to 
£67.1m. Volumes were up 8%, 
mainly due to growth from our 
Génétiporc acquisition, Asia and 
Latin America. Royalty volumes 
were adversely affected by PEDv 
during the year. Profits were up 
4% on 2013, with Latin America’s 
continued robust growth and the 
initial contribution from Génétiporc 
partially offset by results in China.
Finance Costs
Net finance costs reduced by 
£0.2m to £5.5m (2013: £5.7m) and 
include IAS 19 pension interest of 
£2.9m (2013: £3.1m). Higher net 
borrowings following the acquisition 
of Génétiporc were offset by lower 
average interest rates, following 
our refinancing in August 2013.
Exceptional Items
There was a £2.0m net exceptional 
expense in 2014 (2013: £4.2m credit), 
mainly related to the acquisition 
and integration of Génétiporc, 
£1.8m. Also included were £0.8m 
of net income, which relates to 
a cash settlement received in 
the period from a long-standing 
legal claim, £0.6m of legal fees 
incurred in an action brought 
by Genus ABS against Sexing 
Technologies (see note 38) and 
£0.4m of restructuring costs. 
Statutory Profit Before Tax 
Operating profit on a statutory 
basis was £41.8m, (2013: £36.3m) 
while our statutory profit before tax 
was £38.2m (2013: £33.4m). The 
statutory results benefit from an 
increase in the net IAS 41 valuation 
movement on biological assets and 
a reduction in share-based payment 
expense. Amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets and exceptional 
items increased following the 
Génétiporc acquisition. The Board 
believes the volatile nature of these 
items, most of which are non-
cash, is less representative of the 
Group’s underlying performance 
than adjusted measures.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the year, 
based on adjusted profit before 
tax, was 28.2% (2013: 30.4%), with 
the decrease primarily due to a 
lower impact from unprovided 
losses and taking advantage 
of the recently introduced UK 
finance company tax regime.  41

Additional 
Information
The movement in the overall 
carrying value of biological assets, 
excluding the effect of exchange 
rate translation changes, includes:
• a £13.7m increase in the carrying 
value of porcine biological assets, 
due principally to higher value 
animals, particularly boars, in the 
pure line herds; and
• a £6.2m decrease in dairy and 
beef biological assets, arising 
from a combination of the change 
in the assessment of bovine 
volumes and the mix of genomic 
semen expected to be sold, 
partially offset by an increase in 
expected realisable prices 
achieved from those units.
The historical cost of these 
assets, less depreciation, 
was £36.2m at 30 June 2014 
(2013: £34.4m), which is the basis 
used for the adjusted results. 
Retirement Benefit Obligations
The Group’s retirement benefit 
obligations at 30 June 2014, 
calculated in accordance with IAS 19, 
were £58.2m (2013: £65.0m) before 
tax and £46.1m (2013: £49.9m) net 
of related deferred tax. The largest 
element of the liability relates to the 
multi-employer Milk Pension Fund 
where we continue to account on 
the basis of Genus being responsible 
for 75% of the plan’s funding.
During the year, contributions 
payable in respect of the Group’s 
defined benefit schemes amounted 
to £5.6m (2013: £2.9m). Cash 
contributions were higher during 
the year, following the conclusion 
of the Milk Pension Fund valuation 
towards the end of FY13. 
Cash Flow
Cash generated by operations was  
strong at £44.3m (2013: £34.9m). 
Cash conversion of adjusted 
operating profit was 103% 
(2013: 77%) before capital 
expenditure, investments, 
interest, tax and dividends.
This improvement was generated 
by better working capital cash flow 
of £12.6m year to year, reflecting a 
solid performance in receivables, 
as well as the reduction of prior 
year balances related to stocking 
the Besun farm in China and our 
investment in stocking the Chun 
Hua porcine nucleus farm.
The cash outflow from investments 
and capital expenditures of £39.5m 
(2013: £6.9m) increased significantly 
due to the acquisition of Génétiporc 
and the investment in the Besun 
joint venture. The total cash outflow 
for the year after these investments, 
interest, tax and dividends was 
£18.0m (2013: inflow £8.1m).
Net Debt
Net debt increased from £52.9m 
to £63.9m at 30 June 2014, due to 
the cash outflow of £18.0m partially 
offset by a favourable exchange 
movement, as our borrowings are 
denominated primarily in US Dollars.
The Group’s financial position 
remains strong and there is 
substantial headroom of £55.4m 
under our borrowing facilities of 
£138.1m, which we renegotiated 
in August 2013 and extended to 
September 2017 on improved terms.
Our borrowing ratios are strong. 
Interest cover was at 20.6 times 
(2013: 21.6 times). The ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA, as calculated 
under our financing facilities was 
1.2 times, up from 1.0 times.
Return on Invested Capital
We measure our return on invested 
capital on the basis of adjusted 
operating profit including joint 
ventures after tax divided by the 
operating net assets of the business 
stated on the basis of historical cost, 
excluding net debt and pension 
liability. This removes the impact 
of IAS 41 fair value accounting, the 
related deferred tax and goodwill. 
The return on invested capital 
was a healthy 19.2% after tax 
(2013: 19.9%), despite the investment 
in Génétiporc contributing for 
only part of the year and Besun 
experiencing start up losses.
Dividend
The Board is recommending to 
shareholders a final dividend of 
12.2 pence per ordinary share, 
resulting in a total dividend for the 
year of 17.7 pence per ordinary share, 
an increase of 10% for the year. 
Dividend cover remains strong, with 
the dividend covered 2.6 times by 
adjusted earnings (2013: 3.0 times).

Unlocking Our Potential
During 2013/14, we continued to extend our people 
management initiatives in order to engage, equip and 
develop our people to deliver our business strategy.
Service Academies, and developing 
training with global relevance.
In a major initiative, we piloted 
a bespoke programme called 
‘High Performing Teams’. This 
helps line managers unlock their 
people’s potential and drive 
growth. It includes performance 
management, values-led leadership, 
coaching and using data to 
improve business performance.
We enhanced the cross-fertilisation 
of skills and experience across the 
Group. Our teams in the US share 
best practice and current thinking 
with people who are new to their 
roles or to Genus. We also network 
our expertise, by relocating senior 
managers to lead operations in other 
regions or parts of the business. 
All vacancies are offered internally, 
through our in-Company job posting. 
We continued to recruit high-quality 
individuals into the business, and 
extended our talent management 
and succession planning to cover 
more than 1,400 employees. Our 
senior leaders represent a truly 
international cadre of managers. 
We work to develop our leaders 
through international experience 
and exposure, with an active 
programme of international 
assignments to develop global 
experience. European, Latin and 
North American countries are very 
strongly represented, and as we 
expand in Asia, we are working to 
identify talented local staff who 
we can develop into our senior 
managers of the future. In the last 
two years, we have appointed 
two women onto GELT, Saskia 
Korink as COO for Genus ABS and 
Catherine Glickman as Group HR 
Director. Women now represent 
25% of the GELT membership. 
We have appointed women into 
senior positions in finance, global 
marketing and operations, and 
women are increasingly represented 
at all levels in our technical and 
research teams. The increase in 
female role models will encourage 
other women to develop through 
to senior roles in Genus. 
We extended online performance 
management to almost half our 
staff, and trained managers and 
colleagues in setting objectives and 
holding valuable reviews. Those 
on the new approach have two 
reviews per year, with 65% saying 
it helps them perform better.
We invested in development at all 
levels, from operational training for 
those who work with our animals, 
to management development. 
Initiatives included establishing Key 
Account Manager and Technical 
Case Study
Supporting Our People’s Learning and Development
With the need to adapt more 
quickly, manage more information 
and capture and apply our 
people’s expertise, we convened 
41 PIC leaders and key account 
managers. This allowed us to 
share knowledge and best 
practices, and unveil PIC’s Global 
Key Account Management 
Academy (‘KAMA’). KAMA offers 
instructor-led training, online 
learning through Genus University 
and on-the-job training. Product 
Differentiation and PIC Genetics 
101 are the first of many modules 
that will standardise and expand 
our capabilities, ensuring PIC 
communicates effectively and 
delivers the value customers need. 
We delivered these first modules 
in classrooms to our Chinese 
and American staff, allowing us 
to network the knowledge of 
our US-based experts. Working 
with the operational teams, 
we have identified and will roll 
out seven priorities for FY15. 
Currently we are training all PIC 
staff on our ‘Targeted Customer 
Interface’, which will enhance 
our customer account planning 
and facilitate business planning 
across customers and regions.

Additional 
Information
We continued to recruit high-
calibre professionals to our senior 
team, as well as strengthening our 
Marketing and Technical Service 
teams in ABS and PIC, and the Key 
Account Management team in China.
Our first employee survey, Genus 
Pulse, saw 80% of our workforce 
give us their views. Among the many 
strong results, 91% understood our 
vision, 83% understood what they 
need to do to deliver our strategy 
and 89% are committed to our 
values. Local teams have developed 
action plans to maintain strengths 
and address areas for improvement. 
Gearing Up for Growth
We have a comprehensive plan 
to help our people drive growth. 
This includes having lean and 
simple structures, investing in 
targeted new roles and tightly 
managing headcount. 
Our employees said they want us 
to invest in personal and career 
development. By the end of 
2014/15, almost everyone in Genus 
will be covered by performance 
management. This will give them 
clear objectives, performance criteria 
and individual development plans.
In 2014/15, we will run our first 
development programme for our 
top 70 leaders. This will include 
exploring how to work profitably 
with our customers, accelerate our 
strategy and nurturing a culture of 
innovation. It will also strengthen 
networks, so we can rapidly 
disseminate our knowledge.
We will extend High Performing 
Teams to managers around the 
world and complement this with 
communication skills training, 
coaching and mentoring. We 
will also expand our operational 
training for Key Account 
Managers in ABS and PIC. 
The most consistent feedback 
in Genus Pulse was for more 
communication. In response, 
we are enhancing our internal 
communications to help align 
everyone with our business priorities. 
This will include new ways of sharing 
information and building dialogue. 
Together, these steps will help our 
people to fulfil their potential and 
enable Genus to make the most 
of the opportunities ahead. 
Case Study
Networking Our Global Expertise
To develop our teams and 
businesses, we draw on the 
expertise of our global product 
development, genetic services, 
production and animal health 
assurance teams, and our North 
American sales and distribution 
teams. Through a tailored 
programme, new appointees 
shadow team members, 
observing our operations 
and gaining knowledge. This 
builds relationships across 
regions and networks our 
thinking and best practice. 
It also ensures we understand 
different customer needs, so our 
offerings appeal worldwide.
International placements for 
key PIC personnel also support 
the business and their personal 
development. David Casey has 
relocated to Shanghai to help 
develop PIC China, while leading 
global Genetic Services. He 
is focused on maximising our 
customers’ and supply chain 
partners’ use and understanding 
of PIC genetics. Our Director of 
Technical Services, PJ Corns, 
is on assignment in Europe. He 
is accelerating the knowledge 
of best management practices 
and US product success stories 
among PIC Europe and its 
customer and prospect base.

Strategic Report
Corporate Social 
Responsibility
To achieve our vision, we need to enhance food affordability, 
safety and quality; improve animal welfare; and reduce the 
environmental impact of protein production. We see 
ourselves as a responsible and valued neighbour, a good 
employer and a standard setter wherever we operate.
Employees
Our employees are fundamental 
to our business success and 
we work hard to attract, retain 
and develop the best people. 
Our objectives for 2013/14 were 
to give every employee the 
opportunity to develop their career, 
with an annual discussion and a 
commitment to look internally 
to fill a role; to develop all staff 
through equal access to training; 
to ask staff how they feel about 
working for Genus and act on 
their feedback; and to provide 
interesting, valuable and secure 
work within local communities.
During the year, we extended 
performance management to more 
than half our staff and now offer 
all vacancies internally through 
our in-company job posting. We 
undertook our first employee survey, 
and within our local communities 
we provide training in all our 
roles and ensure we are offering 
long-term, secure employment. 
More about our approach to 
people management can be 
found on pages 42 and 43.
Diversity
Genus takes diversity seriously. 
We appoint the best people to 
do the job, with a focus on talent 
right across the leadership team.
On gender, we have actively 
recruited more women into senior 
roles. In the last two years, we have 
appointed two women to GELT, 
including one as a divisional Chief 
Operating Officer, providing role 
models at the highest level of our 
business. We have also appointed 
our first women to the Finance 
Directorate and the PIC Leadership 
team. We continue, through our 
talent planning process, to identify 
those with potential to develop, 
and ensure they are given the 
right opportunities to move into 
senior roles. We recognise that we 
need to continue to work on this 
area, as we grow the business.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility 
(‘CSR’) framework covers five key 
areas: health and safety, employees, 
animal welfare, community and the 
environment. In last year’s report, 
we noted our intention to establish a 
Committee to lead our CSR efforts. 
As discussed on page 55, formation 
of the committee was delayed. 
However, we still made substantial 
progress towards our CSR objectives 
for the year, as described below.
Health and Safety
Health and safety is critical in our 
business and a priority for the Board. 
We have a global team of specialists, 
who operate alongside our line 
managers and HR teams. During 
2013/14, we strengthened the team 
and raised its profile by appointing 
Lori Hellenbrand as our first Health 
and Safety Director, reporting 
directly to the Group HR Director. 
Our objectives for 2013/14 were 
to roll-out our health and safety 
framework and principles, improve 
internal communication and engage 
employees, and to visit all our 
facilities, to ensure compliance 
with standards and regulations.
During the year, we set out our 
framework and principles by 
implementing our global policies 
in eight languages, including 
cryogenics, safe lone working, 
incident reporting and safe animal 
handling. Karim Bitar signed 
these policies, demonstrating our 
commitment to health and safety.
We improved communication by 
providing leaders with monthly 
reports of incident data and 
trends, facility audit schedules 
and findings, and corrective 
action assignments. These reports 
are discussed at management 
meetings, ensuring health and 
safety is seen as a priority, with 
strong and active leadership from 
the top. We developed a library 
of best practice risk-reduction 
strategies, relating to farms and 
animal handling, laboratories 
and maintenance, allowing us to 
network best practices globally.
We used risk assessments to identify 
our highest priority locations and 
audited almost half of them. Most 
were laboratories, distribution 
hubs, and production and animal 
housing facilities. We reviewed 
health and safety design and work 
practices, and defined improvement 
strategies and corrective actions 
where needed. Using our Safety 
Management System (‘SMS’) we 
tracked more than 100 corrective 
actions. At the year end, 14 remained 
open and will be resolved within four 
months in the new financial year. 
Rate of Minor Incidents
The annual rate of minor incidents 
rose from 1.28 in 2013 to 1.87 per 
100 employees. During the year, 
we increased staff awareness of 
our SMS and the importance of 
reporting work-related injuries and 
illnesses. Around 40% of incidents 
are caused by animals’ unpredictable 
behaviour. We continue to develop 
best practice animal handling 
techniques, to ensure we protect our 
people and animals. We have clear 
targets to continue to improve our 
health and safety practices in 2015.

Case Study
Protecting Our Animals and Ensuring Biosecurity
In June 2014, we began 
construction of a new admittance 
facility at our bull stud in Dekorra, 
Wisconsin. The facility will have 
a biosecure entrance building 
and four bull barns, allowing 
us to keep animals of differing 
ages and health statuses apart. 
It will include the latest design 
for bull comfort and welfare, 
as well as providing a 
safe and efficient working 
environment for our staff and 
veterinarians. With wildlife-
proof fencing completely 
enclosing the site and a new 
wash bay for disinfecting 
vehicles, the facility gives us 
a significant improvement 
in protection for our bulls. 
Our leadership team is genuinely 
global, with 13 nationalities 
represented at GELT and those 
reporting into them, from the UK, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, 
Denmark, the United States, Chile, 
Mexico, Colombia, China, India, New 
Zealand and Australia. We believe 
that this international mix ensures 
that people of all nationalities 
know we take the best people 
for the job, and that they can 
progress regardless of the country 
or continent they come from.
Human Rights
We do not believe that human rights 
are a significant issue for Genus but 
we are committed to protecting 
the human rights of our employees 
and the people who come into 
contact with our business. During 
the year, we continued to comply 
with our human rights policy.
Animal Welfare
We are responsible for thousands 
of animals across our porcine and 
bovine businesses. The welfare of 
those animals is our highest priority: 
it is important to all of us personally 
and it is important to our business. 
This means we see caring for our 
animals as a moral duty, not just a 
commercial imperative. The Genus 
Animal Welfare Code of Conduct 
ensures we provide the highest 
standards of animal husbandry. All 
employees who handle our animals 
are trained and qualified, and we 
design and maintain our facilities to 
ensure best practice. Our veterinary 
advisers and health assurance 
team are fully integrated with the 
operational teams and regularly 
assess the animals’ health. We have 
a policy of zero tolerance towards 
animal abuse: staff must report any 
animal mishandling and we require 
regular written statements that they 
have not observed any incidents.
Our objectives for 2013/14 
were to roll-out Pork Quality 
Assurance (‘PQA’) style training 
to all production staff in Genus 
PIC’s owned facilities, and begin 
construction of a biosecure bull 
admittance facility and vehicle 
disinfection station at Genus ABS.
During the year, we focused on 
rolling out PQA training to our 
larger farms and those that would 
be operated by PIC or our joint 
ventures in the medium to long-
term. 83% of our sow farms are 
now under the PQA programme.
Construction of the new bull 
admittance facility began in 
June 2014 (see case study), 
while the vehicle disinfection 
station is nearing completion.
In addition, we carried out 
biosecurity audits at our main 
ABS production facilities in Brazil, 
Canada, the UK and the US. These 
audits ensured we are meeting our 
global standards, and improved our 
information sharing around ABS.
Community
We encourage community 
engagement and pursue programmes 
that will improve education and life 
chances, with a view to boosting 
our pool of potential employees.
Our objectives for 2013/14 
were to develop the pool of 
potential employees, by helping 
local populations to improve 
their education and skills, and 
to work with communities to 
support social initiatives. 
One significant example of our 
work during the year was our 
fundraising to help our people 
and the wider community who 
were affected by the devastation 
from Typhoon Haiyan in the 
Philippines (see case study). 
We have continued to recruit 
from the local talent pools around 
our farms and offices, as well as 
bringing in post-graduates from the 
best agricultural schools around 
the world. Our policy is to grow 
our business sustainably, ensuring 
we create long-term, secure jobs 
in the communities in which we 
operate, providing entry level roles 
on farm and into our departments 
to develop staff through. 46

The Environment
We respect our communities’ 
environmental needs. Environmental 
management and reporting is 
integral to the way we run the 
business and manage risk. We 
assess the environmental risks 
of existing and new facilities, 
and establish controls to keep 
these risks at acceptable 
levels. We train employees in 
environmental compliance and 
have comprehensive protocols, 
which are independently checked.
Our objectives for 2013/14 were to 
increase the proportion of Genus 
PIC farms that have their waste 
management systems independently 
checked; to obtain baseline soil 
test data for Genus PIC’s locations 
outside North America; and to 
consider processes for using or 
recycling manure from Genus ABS.
During the year, we increased 
the proportion of PIC farms that 
have their systems independently 
checked from 42% (based on the 
number of animals) to 73%, covering 
farms in North America, Brazil and 
China. We chose to delay soil testing 
while we identified appropriate 
laboratories and took actions that 
were required ahead of testing, such 
as verifying our storage capacity 
and correcting deficiencies, and 
implementing weekly and monthly 
inspections of our storage facilities.
We continued to look at ways 
to use manure. To date, we have 
investigated more than ten systems, 
although ongoing evolution of 
the technology means we have 
not yet finalised our choice.
Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) Reporting
Our GHG emissions primarily result 
from housing livestock and our 
production facilities. Managing 
approximately 192,000 pigs and 
1,800 bulls results in significant 
emissions from enteric fermentation 
(methane production) and slurry/
manure. We also have emissions 
from consuming fuel and other 
materials, as well as transport 
associated with housing livestock. 
We have selected our primary 
intensity ratio based on animal 
weight, as we believe this is a key 
driver of our GHG emissions, as well 
as reporting a more general intensity 
ratio based on turnover. Emissions 
increased during the year due to 
the acquisition of Génétiporc.

Our Reporting Approach
We have adopted operational 
control as our reporting approach. 
We have determined and reported 
the emissions we are responsible 
for within this boundary and do 
not believe there are any material 
omissions. GHG data is therefore 
reported for assets, which are mainly 
rented or leased, that are otherwise 
not referred to across the rest of the 
financial statements. We omitted 
other assets on the grounds of our 
limited authority to introduce and 
implement operating policies. These 
are mainly our joint ventures, where 
we have up to 50% share, and some 
livestock held at third parties.

3 Animal Welfare
• Continue with PQA training in 
all Genus PIC’s owned farms.
• Develop a questionnaire for 
use in ABS Genus’s animal 
welfare audits, based on the 
five freedoms: Freedom from 
Hunger and Thirst, Freedom from 
Discomfort, Freedom from Pain, 
Injury or Disease, Freedom to 
Express Normal Behaviour and 
Freedom from Fear and Distress.
• Complete animal welfare audits of 
ABS Genus’s main export centres in 
the UK, Canada, Brazil and the US.
• Expand the tree planting 
programme at Genus ABS’s 
Uberaba stud in Brazil, to provide 
essential shade for our bulls.
4 Community
• Continue to support those who 
work for and with us, who are 
affected by natural or other 
disasters, by providing practical 
help and resources.
• Support investment in agricultural 
education and science, to build 
animal agricultural capacity within 
our industry – in 2014/15, we will 
develop the approach in our US  
and European businesses.
• Support charities that sponsor 
agricultural initiatives globally, to 
build knowledge and understanding 
on animal husbandry, self 
sufficiency through livestock and 
good farming practice.
• Continue to recruit into our farms 
from our local communities, 
providing valuable jobs, training 
and income for those that work 
with us.
5 Environment
• Continue annual independent 
audits of Genus PIC’s waste 
management systems, covering at 
least 80% of our owned animals.
• Produce more home-grown feed 
for Genus ABS’s bulls, to reduce 
reliance on purchased feed, reduce 
emissions from transporting feed 
and improve biosecurity.
• Explore opportunities to recycle the 
manure produced by Genus ABS’s 
bulls, both on crop land producing 
our feed and by converting it to 
heat or electricity, for example by 
using a furnace-type recycler.
Case Study
Responding to Help People in Urgent Need
When Typhoon Haiyan hit the 
Philippines, it left over 6,200 
people dead, 4.0m displaced. To 
help our people and the wider 
community, PIC Philippines 
immediately created a fund 
for donations. Within hours, 
money began pouring in from 
Genus employees around the 
world. Along with a matching 
donation from the business, 
we raised a total of US$31,000, 
which went towards providing 
vital supplies and shelter, 
including contributions towards 
rebuilding homes of affected 
families. We have also extended 
support in recent weeks to 
those affected by Typhoon 
Yolanda, providing supplies and 
financial support to help those 
we work with to rebuild homes. 48

Letter from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
The Critical Role of Good Governance
The profile of corporate governance has risen 
sharply in recent years. This reflects its critical role 
in promoting long-term success and protecting the 
interests of investors and other stakeholders. The 
Board’s grasp of the business and its markets, its 
understanding and control of risk, its approval of 
management’s strategic choices and the interactions 
between individual members and the Board as a 
whole, have a profound effect on the Group’s future. 
In turn, this determines our ability to serve our 
customers, create rewarding jobs for employees, 
support our suppliers and communities, and ultimately 
deliver growth and returns to shareholders.
Recognising the importance of this subject, 
we continue to improve the way we disclose our 
governance arrangements and the Board’s work 
during the year. I am pleased that the standard 
of governance in Genus is high and we aim to 
show this through the information we provide.
Complying with the Code
We remain supportive of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and its principles-
based approach. We believe this is the right way to 
encourage high standards, while recognising that 
companies need to adopt and apply governance 
structures that best suit their business needs.
Genus continued to comply with all of the provisions 
in the 2012 edition of the Code, which was the 
applicable standard for this financial year. We remain 
aware of proposed changes to the Code, so we can 
continue to adopt best practice in the future.
Evaluating the Board’s Effectiveness
Knowing where the Board performs well and where 
it can improve is a key part of ensuring ongoing 
improvement and effectiveness. Genus has a three-
year Board evaluation cycle. The previous year was the 
first in that cycle, which saw us undergo a full external 
evaluation by independent consultants. This year 
our consultants, Boardroom Review, ran a workshop 
with the Board. This involved detailed questionnaires, 
review of case studies, and Board performance 
analysis and discussions, as described on page 57.
The evaluation found that the Board’s strengths 
include its cohesiveness, engagement, 
transparency and communication. Challenges 
include the Group’s international development, 
the complex science in the sector and diversity.
Considering Diversity
Genus takes diversity seriously. In particular, we are fully 
aware of Lord Davies’s recommendations on gender 
diversity and always consider this when recruiting. 
However, our primary aim is to appoint the best person 
to do the job. The appointments of Duncan Maskell 
and Lykele van der Broek have increased the diversity 
of skills and experience on the Board, by adding to our 
scientific and international breadth and understanding. 
This will be vital as Genus continues to develop its 
research and development pipeline and grow the 
reach of its product portfolio into new markets.
Summary
The Board is determined to maintain and further 
enhance Genus’s high standards of corporate 
governance, with the objective of ensuring that Genus 
captures the large and growing opportunity for 
animal genetics to the benefit of our shareholders.

Genus Executive 
Leadership Team
Over the last year, we have 
continued to build the Genus 
Executive Leadership Team (‘GELT’). 
Our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr 
Denny Funk, retired after 19 years of 
distinguished service, giving us the 
opportunity to add new skills and 
expertise to an already strong team. 
GELT’s Responsibilities
GELT leads our strategic delivery 
and demonstrates the values at the 
heart of our business. Our vision 
and values are fully embedded 
in the business, giving the entire 
Genus team a clear and compelling 
culture, purpose and direction. 
GELT also ensures organisational 
alignment, engagement and 
efficient execution throughout 
the Group. This involves crucial 
commercial, scientific, operational 
and people decisions. Equally 
important is GELT’s stewardship 
of Genus’s reputation, ethical 
working and compliance.
To achieve its objectives, GELT 
focuses on the following areas:
• corporate strategy – 
implementing the Board’s 
strategy to achieve sustained 
growth, and strengthening key 
capabilities such as our world-
class product development;
• performance management 
– driving operational results; 
ensuring core processes are 
reliable and efficient; regularly 
reviewing R&D plans; managing 
risk, including risk mitigation; and 
managing the Genus balanced 
scorecard, including customer 
equity metrics;
• people – developing high-
performing teams by rigorous 
selection, development and 
setting stretching goals, together 
with nurturing talent to bring 
through the next generation of 
leaders; and
• resources – judicious investment 
in the business, including capital 
expenditure and human 
resources.

Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
Corporate Governance
Adding value through  
strong governance
Strong corporate governance and 
business success go hand in hand. 
The Board’s decisions are critical to 
the Group’s future, from approving 
and monitoring our strategy to 
the way we identify, monitor and 
manage risks. We therefore look to 
ensure that the Board has the right 
mix of skills and experience, that it 
has a deep understanding of the 
Group and that its members work 
well together, in a spirit of openness 
and constructive challenge.
This section explains our approach 
to corporate governance, 
including how we structure the 
Board and its committees, its 
oversight of the Group, and 
its performance and principal 
activities during the financial year.
Who is on the Board?
At the date of this report, the Board 
had a large majority of independent 
Non-Executive Directors.

In recent months, we have added to 
what was already a strong, well-
functioning Board by appointing 
two new Non-Executive Directors. 
Professor Duncan Maskell and 
Lykele van der Broek joined us on 
1 April and 1 July 2014 respectively, 
bringing impressive scientific 
expertise and experience of 
international agricultural markets.
As the chart above shows, these 
appointments mean that our Board 
has a good mix of well-established 
and new Non-Executive Directors. 
The blend of our Non-Executive 
Directors’ general experience 
and areas of expertise, together 
with a depth of knowledge about 
the Group’s operations, result in 
an even-handed oversight of the 
business and its growth strategy. 
This balance allows the Board 
to operate in a constructive and 
focused manner, with the new 
Non-Executive Directors adding 
fresh insights and perspectives.

Number of Non-Executive Directors
(including the Chairman)
As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all the Directors, 
except Barry Furr who is retiring, 
will offer themselves for election 
or re-election at the next AGM, 
details of which can be found 
in the Notice of AGM at the end 
of this report. Following the 
performance evaluation described 
on page 57, the Board confirms 
that all the Directors continue 
to be effective and demonstrate 
their commitment to their roles.
What are the Board’s 
responsibilities?
To ensure we have clear 
responsibilities at the top of the 
Company, the Board has set out the 
Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s 
roles. Our Chairman, Bob Lawson, is 
responsible for running the Board. 
Karim Bitar, our Chief Executive, 
runs the Group, making sure we 
implement our strategy and achieve 
our operational and financial targets.
Nigel Turner is our Senior Non-
Executive Director and Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee. 
He is available to help shareholders 
with concerns that they cannot 
resolve through our Chairman, Chief 
Executive or Group Finance Director.
Some issues and decisions are so 
important that only the Board as 
a whole can consider them. The 
Board is therefore responsible for:
• approving and monitoring 
our strategy;
• approving our corporate goals;
• reviewing our operational 
performance against these goals;
• approving the corporate budget 
and ensuring we have the 
right funding;
• approving material contracts; 
• approving material acquisitions 
and investments; and
• reporting to shareholders.
However, the Board cannot – and 
should not – get involved in the 
day-to-day running of the business. 
The Board therefore delegates 
operating decisions to the Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director 
and other members of the Genus 
Executive Leadership Team 
(‘GELT’). In turn, GELT’s members 
recommend strategy and plans 
to the Board, make day-to-day 
decisions about the resources we 
need and how we use them, and

GELT’s role and membership is

In last year’s report, we explained 
our intention to establish a 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
(‘CSR’) Committee, to set our CSR 
strategy and objectives, ensure we 
implement them and to monitor our 
performance. The Committee was to 
be chaired by Tom Kilroy, our Group 
General Counsel and Company 
Secretary at the time, who left Genus 
in January 2014. His departure 
delayed the Committee’s formation 
and meant that it did not meet  
during the year. The Committee is 
scheduled to have its first meeting 
by the end of 2014 chaired by 
Catherine Glickman, Group HR 
Director, to build on our CSR strategy 
and implementation. The delay 
in setting up the Committee did 
not detract from our CSR efforts 
and we continued to make good 
progress against our objectives, 
as described on page 47.
The R&D Portfolio Management 
Team meets twice a year. It gives 
us a comprehensive view of our 
R&D programme and involves our 
business units in prioritising our 
R&D initiatives. Its key discussions 
in the year are summarised below.
R&D PMT Key Discussions
• Continued operation of the 
ideation management process
• Ongoing review and 
prioritisation of new ideas and 
ongoing research projects
• Approving patent strategies for 
new technologies, based on 
business and technical 
opportunity
Does the Board have the right 
balance of skills and experience?
Genus operates in a complex 
and evolving global business 
environment. To lead us effectively, 
the Board must have the skills 
and experience to manage 
the associated challenges.
Almost all our Directors have held 
leadership positions in international 
companies, with several having 
run businesses overseas. Half our 
Directors have strong backgrounds 
in scientific research or in leading 
science-based businesses, 
while more than a third have 
significant financial experience.

Number of Directors
As Genus grows, the Board must 
evolve to keep pace. Our recent 
Non-Executive appointments 
have enhanced our expertise 
in biotechnology, agricultural 
science and international markets. 
While we consider diversity in its 
broadest sense when recruiting, 
our aim is to ensure that the Board 
has the right skills to manage the 
evolving nature of the business.
A good induction is a key part of 
ensuring new Board members can 
fully contribute, so we get the most 
benefit from their experience. Our 
induction programme has three 
main elements:
• helping our Board members to 
conduct themselves effectively, 
through a course run by Spencer 
Stuart, one of the world’s leading 
global executive search and 
leadership consulting firms;
• ensuring our Directors understand 
the legal and regulatory aspects 
of being a Board member, and 
how to maintain their 
independence; and
• an introduction to our business, 
through site visits and meetings 
with our management teams 
(see case study).
Non-Executive Inductions
Site visits and meetings with 
management are a key part 
of getting new Non-Executive 
Directors up to speed with our 
business. Following Lykele van der 
Broek’s joining on 1 July 2014, he 
and Duncan Maskell visited one 
of our European operations, ABS 
Italia, where they met the general 
manager, staff and a customer. 
We are also planning for them 
to visit our US operations, 
covering Genus ABS and our 
R&D operations in Madison, and 
Genus PIC in Hendersonville. Here 
they will meet a cross section of 
senior management and some 
of our customers. These visits 
include presentations about 
each business and a tour of the 
operations. Duncan Maskell’s 
earlier appointment meant he 
also went on the Board visit to 
China, as discussed below.
We also want to ensure that the 
Board as a whole has first-hand 
experience of key areas of our 
business and markets, so we 
include an annual site visit in the 
Board calendar. This year, the 
Board visited China (see case study 
below). As well as benefiting our 
Directors, these visits allow our 
local management teams to meet 
the Board and to discuss their 
operations directly with them.
Case Study – Board Visit to China
In April 2014, the Board visited our 
operations in China. Over three 
days, the Directors visited a bull 
stud and met customers, partners 
and officials from the Ministry of 
Agriculture. The Board also met 
with Jerry Thompson, the Chief 
Operating Officer of Genus Asia, 
and the senior management team 
and staff in our Shanghai office.
The visit gave the Board greater 
clarity of the Chinese bovine 
and porcine markets, as well as 
insights into the country’s key 
trends and risks, including disease. 
The Directors also gained a better 
understanding of the political, 
economic and social landscape 
in China. This is an exciting 
market with great opportunities 
for the Group, where we hope 
to expand our footprint and 
develop operations that underpin 
our continued growth. 56

How does the Board review and 
approve the Company’s strategy?
One of the Board’s key 
responsibilities is to review, approve 
and monitor our strategy. To 
understand how well our strategy 
is working and to ensure it remains 
appropriate, the Board holds an 
annual strategy review each January, 
lasting a day and a half. This includes 
presentations from GELT members 
and external perspectives.
At this year’s review, the Board 
was taken through a market 
overview and competitive 
landscape, which included:
• dairy, beef and pork genetic 
market projections, including 
growth drivers and potential new 
markets; and
• current and emerging industry 
trends, such as consolidation and 
integration of customers, market 
volatility, supply chains, and the 
necessary people and skills to 
achieve the strategy.
The Board then considered our 
strategy in light of this, including 
opportunities and challenges, focus 
areas and business recommendations 
for moving forwards. 
What did the Board do during the year?

How well is the Board functioning?
We assess the Board’s effectiveness over a three-year cycle, using a mixture 
of internal and external evaluations:
Year 1
External Board 
effectiveness review 
produces an action plan 
for areas of focus
Year 2
Follow up 
questionnaires by same 
external evaluation 
consultant, to monitor 
progress with the focus 
areas
Year 3
Internal questionnaires 
and interviews with the 
Chairman and Group 
General Counsel and 
Company Secretary
The Review’s Conclusion
The strengths identified included:
• the Board’s cohesiveness;
• its transparent and respectful 
communications;
• the Chairman’s experience and 
governance; and
• the Board’s engaged and 
supportive nature.
The challenges identified included:
• the Group’s international 
development;
• the Board’s limited diversity; and
• the complex science in the sector.
This year was the second in the 
review cycle, following last year’s 
external evaluation. Boardroom 
Review held a workshop with 
the Board, involving:
• effectiveness questionnaires 
conducted by Boardroom Review 
with each Board member, 
following which the Board 
discussed the strengths 
and challenges identified by 
the process;
• examination and discussion of a 
case study, based on strengths 
and challenges similar to Genus’s, 
which was facilitated by the 
external consultant; and
• discussion of how the Board 
could optimise its contribution 
to the Company.
Progress Against the 2013/14 Evaluation
Last year’s external review identified a number of areas for the Board to consider this year. The Board also set itself a 
number of other priorities. The table below shows our progress against these objectives.
Focus Areas from the Board Evaluation Progress
The evolution of the Board’s composition We appointed two Non-Executive Directors, as discussed above
The quality of discussion and information regarding 
the competitive landscape
Senior management provided more written and verbal updates at Board meetings 
and the strategic session was focused on the competitive landscape
A deeper review of executive succession planning In December 2013, the Board was updated on the succession plan for GELT members
Improving reporting cycles, communication and use 
of Board time
Board meetings have been better scheduled across the year, with shorter meetings 
and improved Board papers. To focus discussion, Board members are given clear 
direction on the outcome required. Financial reporting is also quicker, to give the 
Board the latest data
Board Priorities for the Year Progress
Continuing global site visits The Board visited China during the year and is scheduled to hold a Board meeting in 
Brazil in 2015
Developing the Board in the area of CSR, aligning 
CSR with the Group’s strategic objectives and 
establishing the new CSR Committee
Progress against CSR objectives has been included in the Board and GELT meeting 
agendas. Meetings of the CSR Committee have been scheduled for the remainder of 
2014 and 2015
Continuing to ensure the Board’s development 
in governance
The Board received updates and briefings on recent governance developments
Increasing focus on the talent review A talent review of GELT was carried out in December 2013 
Areas of Focus for 2014/15
This year’s evaluation identified 
the following areas for the 
Board to consider in 2014/15:
• sharper focus on technology 
across the Board, both in R&D 
and the use of technology in 
commercial sales;
• continued focus on competitors;
• consideration of how risk is 
disclosed and considered through 
the Audit Committee and through 
the Board;
• consideration of communications 
with shareholders and other 
external stakeholders; and
• consideration of other skill sets 
required by the Board, such as 
diversity, agri-business and 
international markets. 58

Corporate Governance Statement 
continued
The assessment also took into 
account any risk or control issues 
we identified through our divisional 
business reviews, Board and GELT 
meetings, and insurers’ reviews.
These assessments routinely identify 
areas for improvement. However, 
the Board has not identified 
or been told of any significant 
weaknesses in our internal controls.
Our Internal Control System
An internal control system cannot 
completely eliminate the risks we 
face or ensure we do not have a 
material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of our internal 
control systems are as follows:
Management Structure
The Board sets formal authorisation 
levels and other controls that allow 
it to delegate authority to run our 
businesses to the Chief Executive, 
GELT and their management teams. 
Our management supplement these 
controls by setting the operating 
standards that each subsidiary 
needs for its business and location.
GELT regularly reviews our 
performance against strategy, 
budget, and a defined set of 
operational key performance 
indicators. The Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director, Group 
General Counsel and Company 
Secretary and the Group Financial 
Controller also hold monthly 
reviews with each business unit.
Quality and Integrity of Our People
Everything we do has the highest 
integrity at its core. Our control 
environment depends on high-
quality people who maintain our 
ethical standards. We ensure 
our people’s ability and integrity 
through our high recruitment 
standards, training and consistent 
performance management. The 
Board approves appointments to our 
most senior management positions.
How does the Board ensure it 
understands and manages risk?
The diagram below shows our 
risk management framework. The 
Board has ultimate responsibility 
for risk management and our 
internal controls, and is supported 
by GELT, the Audit Committee 
and our risk management and 
internal audit function.
 
Risk Management
Our risk management system 
identifies, evaluates and prioritises 
the risks and uncertainties we face, 
and reviews our controls and how 
we mitigate those risks. The system 
applies to the Board, the Audit 
Committee, GELT, our businesses 
and our divisional business 
reviews. The main risks we face 
and our mitigations for them are 
summarised on pages 20 and 21.
The Board undertook a 
number of activities to address 
specific risks during the year, 
including its work on:
• talent management and 
succession planning; 
• reviewing biosecurity, particularly 
in light of the disease outbreaks 
discussed in the Strategic Report;
• reviewing our strategy and 
understanding of the competitive 
landscape; and
• enhancing the Board’s cultural 
understanding through visits to 
the local operations and political, 
economic and social risk updates 
from the relevant business groups.
The Board will also receive updates 
on health and safety. More generally, 
the Group continues its relentless 
focus on operational execution.
Internal Control
The Board, with the help of the 
Audit Committee, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of our internal control 
system, as well as our financial, 
operational and compliance controls 
and our risk management.
The review covered our internal 
audit programme and the reports 
our management prepared when 
the Board approved our interim 
and final reports and financial 
statements. It also assessed:
• whether we had identified, 
evaluated, managed and 
controlled significant risks; and
• whether any significant 
weaknesses had arisen, and if so, 
whether we had addressed them.

Information
Information and Financial  
Reporting Systems
We create detailed operational 
budgets for the year ahead, along 
with five year strategic plans, which 
the Board reviews and approves.  
We then monitor our performance 
throughout the year, so we can 
address any issues. The information 
we consider includes our monthly 
financial results, key performance 
indicators and variances, updated full-
year forecasts and key business risks. 
The main internal control and risk 
management processes relating 
to our preparation of consolidated 
accounts are our Group-wide 
accounting policies and procedures, 
segregation of duties, a robust 
consolidation and reporting system, 
various levels of management review 
and centrally defined process control 
points and reconciliation processes.
Investment Appraisal
We control our capital expenditure 
through our budget process and 
by having clear authorisation levels, 
above which our businesses must 
submit detailed written proposals 
to the Board for approval.
We carry out due diligence for 
business acquisitions and review 
major projects and all acquisitions 
after we complete them, so we 
can identify and correct any 
underperformance or overspend.
Internal Audit
Our internal audit activities are 
provided by both in-house and 
external resources, under the 
leadership of our Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk Management. During 
the year, Internal Audit completed a 
risk-based audit programme agreed 
by the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee reviews the results of 
these audits and the subsequent 
actions we take, which we also 
communicate to the external auditor.
The regions and businesses 
complete risk and control self 
assessments twice a year. Internal 
Audit reviews these to identify 
any deficiencies in our controls 
and how we should address them. 
The results are communicated 
to senior management and 
the Audit Committee.
How does the Board ensure it 
understands shareholders’ views?
Our Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director regularly meet 
institutional investors and private 
client brokers, to discuss our 
strategy and progress, and to 
understand how investors view 
our business. The Chairman also 
attends certain meetings. During 
the year, our investor relations 
programme included meetings 
in London, Edinburgh, New 
York, Chicago and Geneva.
The Board sets time aside during the 
Board meetings to discuss feedback 
from these meetings, including 
feedback obtained by independent 
brokers and our advisers. This 
allows all Directors to understand 
major shareholders’ views. 
The Chairman and Senior Non-
Executive Director also maintain 
contact with major shareholders, 
having met with two earlier in the 
year and another meeting planned 
for later this year as part of our 
remuneration consultation. 
The AGM gives the Board an 
opportunity to communicate 
with both private and institutional 
investors, and we welcome their 
involvement. All our Board members 
will be available to answer questions 
at the AGM on 14 November 2014.
Our Risk Management Priorities
The table below shows our risk management priorities for the last year and 
our progress against them.
Risk Management Priority Progress
Further embedding risk management into 
our day-to-day decision-making process
We held regular executive management 
reviews of our significant risks and 
implemented a continuous improvement 
process for our mitigating activities 
Test many of our risk mitigation activities  
as we deliver our FY14 internal audit  
plan, to provide assurance that they 
operate effectively
We delivered a risk-based audit plan which 
tested key areas of our mitigation efforts
Our Priorities for 2015
For the coming year, we have set the following priorities:
• to expand our operational KPIs to include performance metrics relevant 
to key risk mitigation activities; and
• to continue to improve our ability to identify emerging risks and 
potential changes in risk evaluation throughout the year. 60

Audit Committee Report
“The Committee  
ensures the integrity  
of the Company’s 
financial reporting.”
Chairman’s Overview
The Audit Committee acts on behalf 
of the Board and shareholders, 
to ensure the integrity of the 
Company’s financial reporting, 
evaluate its system of risk 
management and internal control, 
and oversee the performance of the 
internal and external auditors. Our 
annual work programme is designed 
to deliver this commitment.
During the year, the Committee 
met three times and invited the 
Company’s Chairman, Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance 
Director, the Group Financial 
Controller, the Head of Risk 
Management and Internal Audit, and 
senior representatives of the external 
auditor to attend its meetings. 
The Committee also held separate 
private sessions during the year 
with external audit, internal audit 
and the Group Finance Director. 
The Committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of the half-year 
and annual financial statements. 
Among other matters, we focused 
on critical accounting policies, 
key assumptions and judgements, 
the quality of disclosures and 
compliance with financial reporting 
standards, and all material issues 
affecting the financial statements. 
The Committee reviewed the 
Group’s tax and treasury strategy 
and its pension arrangements. 
The Committee also reviewed the 
Annual Report and Accounts taken 
as a whole, to ensure they are fair, 
balanced and understandable, 
and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s strategy, 
business model and performance.
In meeting its commitment to 
oversee the performance of our 
internal and external auditor, the 
Committee reviewed and agreed 
internal audit’s terms of reference 
and work plans, as well as the scope, 
fees and work undertaken by the 
external auditor. The Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of 
internal and external audit, discussed 
the outcomes of these assessments 
and agreed any actions that were 
needed. The Committee was 
satisfied with the performance of 
the internal audit function and the 
external auditor during the year. 
The Committee discussed the 
current partner’s tenure, which 
is due to end after the 2015 audit 
and agreed to start a process 
in the coming year to retender 
the audit for fiscal year 2016.

Corporate Governance
The Committee’s Main Activities During the Year
At its three meetings during the year, the Committee focused on:
Financial Reporting
The main areas of focus and matters where the Committee specifically considered management’s judgements are set 
out below: 
Financial Reporting Area Judgement and Assumptions Considered
Biological assets valuation In compliance with IAS 41, Genus records its biological assets at fair value in the Group 
balance sheet (£275m), with the net valuation movement shown in the income statement.  
At each reporting period, the Committee was updated on the methodology and outcomes 
of the biological assets valuation. Having noted that the methodology was unchanged during 
the year, the Committee debated and considered management’s assumptions and estimates, 
and discussed and reviewed the external auditor’s report on this area. The Committee was 
satisfied with management’s accounting treatment.
Intangible assets – capitalisation and 
impairment of development costs
Genus’s policy is to capitalise certain development costs and to perform periodic impairment 
reviews, to ensure that the cumulative carrying value is justified. At the balance sheet date, 
the Group had £8m of capitalised development. During the year, the Committee received 
reports from management detailing the cost incurred and the outcome of the impairment 
reviews. The Committee also reviewed progress against plans and the projects’ timelines to 
full operation. The Committee discussed management’s reports in detail, including whether 
any known issues might block the projects’ completion. The Committee reviewed the 
external auditor’s work, including their assessment of management’s models supporting the 
estimates and judgements. After due challenge and debate, the Committee was satisfied with 
management’s assumptions and judgements.
Acquisitions – Génétiporc During the financial year, Genus acquired Génétiporc, the porcine genetics business of 
Aliments Breton Foods Group, for £22m. The acquisition included the share capital of certain 
legal entities, as well as biological and intangible assets. This transaction is described in 
note 37 to the accounts. The Committee received an update on the transaction’s structure 
and reviewed management’s proposed accounting treatment. The external auditor’s views 
supported these proposals. After discussing the accounting options available, the Committee 
agreed with management’s recommendations.
Pensions During the year, Genus adopted the revised IAS 19 for its pension accounting. The accounting 
changes to the calculation of the net interest cost and the treatment of fund administration 
expenses are detailed in note 28 to the accounts. The Committee received and reviewed 
management reports on the treatment of pension costs, including the restatement of 
prior years for comparative purposes. The Committee also received and considered the 
external auditor’s pensions accounting input. The Committee considered management’s 
recommendations were appropriate. The Committee continued to review the status of 
the other parties who are jointly and severally liable for the Milk Pension Fund deficit and 
concurred with management’s assumptions for reporting Genus’s share of the fund.

Monitoring Business Risks
The Committee reviewed the 
Group-wide risk management 
process designed to identify, 
evaluate and mitigate risks. In the 
external auditor’s presence, the 
Committee discussed the risks 
identified with the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director, 
along with management’s plans 
to mitigate them. In view of their 
importance during the year, the 
Committee ensured that the Board 
received and discussed detailed 
input from management on the 
following key risks and mitigations:
• China and emerging markets: this 
risk is the threat to our growth if 
we are unable to appropriately 
develop business in China and 
emerging markets. With a focus 
on China, the Board discussed 
with management the current 
farming environment in China and 
the actions taken by both regional 
and global management teams to 
minimise the impact on our 
strategy execution.
• Biosecurity and continuity of 
supply: this is the risk of negative 
outcome for Genus if we lose key 
livestock or lose our ability to 
move animals and/or semen  
freely (including across borders), 
due to disease outbreak, an 
environmental incident or 
international trade sanctions.  
The Board discussed the outbreak 
of PEDv in North America and  
its impact on the entire porcine 
industry. PIC’s management 
presented to the Board on the 
additional measures being taken 
to strengthen health management 
and supply chain resilience.
Internal Control System
The Committee conducted its 
annual review of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal controls 
and disclosures, and reviewed 
the findings of internal audit at 
each scheduled meeting. This 
included reviewing the Group’s 
whistleblowing policy and bribery 
prevention procedures.
Oversight of External Audit and 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit
The Committee reviewed and 
agreed the internal audit function’s 
scope, terms of reference, resources 
and activities. The Committee 
received regular reports from 
the Head of Risk Management 
and Internal Audit on the work 
undertaken and management’s 
responses to proposals made in the 
internal audit reports issued during 
the year. The practice of meeting 
the Head of Risk Management and 
Internal Audit without management 
being present continued during 
the year. The Committee reviewed 
and was satisfied with the internal 
audit function’s performance.
External Audit
The Committee reviewed and 
agreed the scope and fees of the 
audit work to be undertaken by the 
external auditor and held detailed 
discussions of the results of their 
audits. The Committee continued 
its practice of meeting the external 
auditor without management being 
present. The Committee reviewed 
the external auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and the Company’s 
policy on engaging the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services. 
The Committee assessed the 
external auditor’s performance, 
based on questionnaires completed 
by key finance staff and Committee 
members, covering the external 
auditor’s fulfilment of the audit 
plan, the auditor’s robustness and 
perceptiveness in their handling 
of key accounting and audit 
judgements, the content of the 
external auditor’s reports, and cost 
effectiveness. The Committee also 
considered any regulatory reviews 
performed on the external auditor. 
The Committee concluded that the 
external auditor was effective.
External Auditor’s Appointment
The external auditor, Deloitte 
LLP, was first appointed as the 
Company’s external auditor for 
the period ended 30 June 2006, 
following a formal tender process. 
The current audit partner’s first 
audit period was the financial 
year ended 30 June 2011.
The Committee reviewed the 
nature and monetary levels of 
the external auditor’s non-audit 
services and compliance with the 
Company’s Non-Audit Services by 
Auditor Policy. The Committee is 
satisfied that the use of Deloitte 
for such services does not impair 
their independence as the Group’s 
external auditor. As a consequence 
of its satisfaction with Deloitte’s 
independence and effectiveness, the 
Committee has recommended to 
the Board that the external auditor 
be reappointed for a further year. 
However, after the 2015 audit, the 
audit partner is due to rotate and 
the Committee intends to retender 
the audit for the subsequent year. 64

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Statement
Letter from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
2013/14. This report covers the remuneration 
of Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) 
believes that the purpose of its remuneration policy 
is to support the Company’s strategy for growth 
and deliver value to stakeholders by focusing on 
delivering sustainable profit growth, measured 
through EPS. The remuneration policy therefore has 
a strong focus on strategic alignment of corporate 
performance and individual remuneration, with 
a significant proportion delivered in shares and 
vesting over the longer-term. It also recognises 
that we compete internationally, targeting growth 
in key markets, such as China and India.
This is our first report since the introduction of the 
new regulations and guidelines. In our 2013 report, 
we adopted a number of the guidelines laid out in the 
new reporting regulations. This year, in line with the 
best practice encompassed in the new regulations and 
guidelines, we have split the report into two sections:
• a Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report (‘Policy 
Report’), which sets out the Group’s remuneration 
policy for Executive and Non-Executive Directors; and
• an Annual Report on Remuneration (‘ARR’), which 
discloses how we applied our remuneration policy  
in the year ended 30 June 2014.
We will be seeking your support for both parts of the 
report, through a binding vote on the Policy Report 
and an advisory vote on the ARR at the AGM on 
14 November 2014.
Performance and Reward for 2013/14
As highlighted in the Strategic Report, 2013/14 was 
a challenging year, with mixed performance across 
the business. Our ABS and PIC businesses had strong 
performances and grew profits in double digits in 
constant currency. However, our Asian business saw 
challenging conditions, specifically in China which 
has been impacted by poor market conditions and 
the costs of our investments in the country. During 
the year, we executed a number of strategic business 
developments, such as our successful acquisition 
and integration of Génétiporc, and established a joint 
venture in India with B G Chitale. This continues our 
strategy to be the leading animal genetic provider 
in both mature and developing markets, with 
increased capacity in both porcine and bovine, and 
to take advantage of future growth opportunities.
From a financial perspective, our operating results 
were affected by the performance in China, the 
strengthening of Sterling and the impact of disease, 
specifically PEDv. Overall, profit in constant currency 
for the year was unchanged and with the impact of 
strong Sterling, profit before tax in actual currency 
was down 8% at £39.3m. Performance on cash 
generation was strong with cash conversion of 
adjusted operating profit at 103%. Despite strong 
performance against strategic objectives and 
exceptional management effort, the profit objective 
was not achieved and this element of bonuses 
was not awarded. Cash performance exceeded 
the target maximum. The financial results, coupled 
with the Executive Directors’ achievements against 
personal targets, delivered bonuses for the Executive 
Directors in the region of 32–35% of maximum.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards granted in 2011 
lapsed in September 2014 as three year EPS targets 
were not met.
Remuneration Policy for 2014/15
Our 2004 PSP expired this year. The Committee 
took the opportunity of the PSP renewal and the 
vote on the Policy Report to review thoroughly 
executive remuneration at Genus. The key conclusion 
was that our remuneration policy generally remains 
fit for purpose, given the substantial weighting 
placed on long-term performance, which supports 
our focus on delivering above-market long-term 
returns to our shareholders. However, we do need 
to make a number of modifications for 2014/15.
The main changes relate to renewing the PSP 
and recent developments in investors’ best 
practice expectations. The changes include:
• Simplifying the performance targets and moving  
to straight-line vesting for the long-term incentive 
awards we will grant in 2014/15, while fine tuning the 
range of performance targets, which we continue  
to believe are very demanding. For example, Genus 
must deliver a minimum of 20% average annual 
growth in EPS over three years, for full vesting to 
take place.
• Requiring management to retain the number of 
vested shares they receive, after tax, for two years. 
This will operate alongside clawback provisions.
• Reducing the aggregate (all share plan) dilution 
limit, so it is consistent with current institutional 
investors’ best practice expectations.
These revisions will better align our remuneration 
policy with delivery of our strategic plan, and 
only reward at maximum levels for the delivery of 
market-leading returns for our shareholders.
In addition, we have amended the annual bonus plan 
to ensure it continues to support the delivery of the 
Company’s growth agenda. The change for 2014/15 
will require a minimum of 15% growth in profits in 
constant currency from the 2013/14 result, for the part 
of the bonus relating to profit growth to pay out in full.
Full details of our revised remuneration policy 
are set out in the Policy Report. We are seeking 
shareholder approval at the AGM for a replacement 
PSP, with the Notice of Meeting including a 
full summary of the plan’s principal terms. 
Summary details are also set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that follows, specifically in 
relation to its anticipated operation in 2014/15. 65

Additional 
Information
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration 
policy for 2014/15 will not encourage undue risk 
taking, as the performance metrics are fully aligned 
with targeted improvements in the Group’s key 
performance indicators, incentive pay (in the 
form of both the annual bonus and replacement 
PSP) is subject to clawback provisions, and part 
of the annual bonus must be deferred into the 
Company’s shares. These features, allied to our 
share ownership guidelines, align our remuneration 
policy with long-term shareholders’ interests.
Shareholders’ Views
The Committee takes an active interest in shareholders’ 
views and developments in best practice. The 
Committee held a constructive consultation with 
major shareholders about our remuneration policy for 
2014/15. This included considering feedback about 
simplifying the replacement PSP’s performance targets 
and the metrics to apply to the 2014 awards. As a result 
of this dialogue, the holding period was extended to 
two years from the one year originally proposed.
We will continue to take shareholders’ views into 
account in this and subsequent reviews.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support. The 
Committee hopes that the new form of report 
is clear and would welcome feedback from 
shareholders. If you wish to contact me, please 
email me at remunerationchair@genusplc.com.
The Committee looks forward to your support 
for our remuneration policy at the 2014 AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report (Unaudited Information)
The key objectives of Genus’s Executive remuneration policy are that:
• pay should be competitive,  
so we can recruit and retain  
the best people;
• fixed pay (base salary, pension 
and benefits) should take 
account of comparable external 
benchmarks and pay for our 
other employees;
• incentive pay (short- and 
long-term incentives) should 
provide the opportunity to  
earn upper quartile total 
remuneration, subject to 
delivering our above-market 
long-term growth aspirations;
• incentive pay should be directly 
linked to the Group’s strategy, 
with targets relating to our key 
performance indicators (using 
non-financial ‘input’ measures 
and/or ‘output’ measures such  
as earnings per share) and should 
be stretching, in light of our 
strategic plan;
• incentive structures should  
be simple, easy to understand  
and reward long-term  
sustained growth, rather than  
volatile performance;
• remuneration policy should be 
clearly aligned with shareholders’ 
interests, take due account of 
current best practice guidance 
and not encourage undue risk 
taking; and
• policy principles for Executive 
Directors should apply to the 
members of the Genus Executive 
Leadership Team (‘GELT’), with 
appropriate tiering through the 
wider workforce.

To provide competitive benefits 
and to attract and retain 
high calibre employees.
Benefits generally include a 
car allowance and insured 
benefits (e.g. life assurance and 
private medical insurance).
Where Executive Directors are recruited 
from overseas, or required to relocate 
on an international assignment, benefits 
more tailored to their geographical 
location may be provided and may 
include relocation costs and/or tax 
equalisation arrangements as necessary.
Where revised benefits are offered 
in a geographic location or across 
the Group, Executive Directors 
are likely to be eligible to receive 
those benefits on similar terms.
If the Company introduces an all-
employee share plan, Executive 
Directors will be eligible to participate 
on the same terms as other employees.
Benefits 
To provide competitive fixed 
remuneration that will attract and 
retain key employees and reflect their

Normally reviewed annually, with 
increases normally effective from 1 July.
Periodically benchmarked against

The PSP incentivises executives 
to achieve superior returns to 
shareholders over a three-year period, 
to retain key individuals and align 
their interests with shareholders.
Eligibility to receive awards is at the 
discretion of the Committee each year.
Awards vest three years from grant, 
subject to continued employment 
and satisfaction of challenging 
three-year performance targets.
For awards granted from 2014, the after 
tax number of vested shares must be 
held for at least a two-year period.
A dividend equivalent provision 
enables dividends to be paid (in cash 
or shares) on shares that vest.
Clawback provisions may apply 
for a period of three years, in the 
event of a material misstatement 
of the Group’s financial results.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
Incentivises achievement of annual 
objectives which support the Group’s 
short-term performance goals.
Payments under the annual 
bonus plan are subject to:
• compulsory deferral of 25%  
of any bonus earned into the 
Company’s shares; and
• clawback provisions for a period  
of three years, which may apply in  
the event of a material misstatement 
of the Group’s financial results.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’) 
awards will vest after three years 
subject to continued service.
A dividend equivalent provision 
operates, enabling dividends to 
be paid (in cash or shares) on 
deferred shares that vest.

Maximum annual award of 200% of 
salary (300% of salary in exceptional 
circumstances such as recruitment).
Awards vest based on three-
year performance against a 
challenging range of targets, 
aligned with the delivery of the 
Company’s long-term strategy.
Financial targets (including 
adjusted EPS growth) will determine 
the vesting of a majority of 
awards granted in any year.
Targets are typically structured as 
a challenging sliding scale, with no 
more than 20% of the maximum 
award vesting for achieving the 
threshold performance level through 
to full vesting for substantial out-
performance of the threshold.
The awards will also be subject to an 
underpin that enables the Committee 
to scale back (but not scale up) 
vesting, if the Group’s performance 
over the period is not considered to 
reflect the progress made against 
its strategic business targets. 
A summary of the performance targets 
for 2014/15 is included on page 76.
The Committee will review performance 
conditions annually, in terms of the 
range of EPS targets and the metrics 
and weightings applied to each 
element of the PSP. Any revisions to 
the metrics and/or weightings will only 
take place if it is necessary because 
of developments in the Company’s 
strategy and, where these are material, 
following dialogue with the Company’s 
major shareholders. Should the 
Committee believe that a major change 
of the current approach is appropriate 
(for example, replacing a primary 
performance metric with an alternative), 
this would only take place following 
a revised Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy being tabled to shareholders.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
125% of salary. Bonus awards are subject to 
achievement against a sliding scale 
of challenging financial targets 
and personal objectives, which the 
Committee sets each year to reflect 
the priorities for the year ahead.
Financial targets govern the 
majority of bonus payments and are 
typically linked to the Group’s key 
performance indicators (e.g. profit 
and cash generation), with a minority 
earned based on performance 
against personal objectives.
For financial performance targets, 
bonus is earned on a graduated 
scale, with 0% payable up to a 
predetermined threshold, through 
to a maximum payment for 
substantial out-performance of 
the threshold (100% payable).
A summary of the performance 
targets for 2014/15 is included

Choice of Performance Conditions
As set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 47, the Company 
targets profitable growth through 
a combination of organic growth, 
expansion into key markets 
and segments, and product 
differentiation. The annual bonus 
plan uses adjusted profit growth, as 
defined on page 75, cash generation 
and personal targets. It encourages 
our short-term success in delivering 
profitable growth at the same time 
as converting profit to cash to use 
for investment and dividends. The 
2014/15 bonus structure (as detailed 
on page 75) is aligned fully therefore 
with the Company’s strategy.
Our use of adjusted EPS growth to 
measure long-term performance, in 
tandem with a strategic underpin, 
assesses how successful we are 
at delivering profitable growth 
from our existing business and the 
businesses we acquire or establish 
with joint venture partners.
The Committee reviews the 
performance metrics each year to 
ensure they remain appropriate. 
Likewise, the Committee will review 
the appropriateness of performance 
conditions for the PSP each year, 
to ensure they remain aligned with 
our long-term corporate strategy.
When setting financial targets, the 
Committee will consider internal 
budgets and external forecasts. 
For financial targets, a sliding 
scale is applied, with a minority 
of the bonus being payable for 
threshold levels of performance.
Operation of the Annual Bonus Plan 
and PSP Policy
The Committee will operate the annual 
bonus plan and PSP in accordance 
with their rules and, where relevant, 
the Listing Rules. As part of the rules, 
the Committee has discretions which 
are required to efficiently operate 
and administer these plans, and are 
consistent with standard market 
practice. These include, for example:
• the participants in the plans;
• the timing of grant of awards  
and payments;
• the size of awards and payments, 
although with quantum and 
performance targets restricted  
to those detailed in the policy 
table above;
• the determination of vesting;
• dealing with a change of control 
(for example, the timing of testing 
performance targets) or 
restructuring of the Group;
• determining a good or bad leaver 
for incentive plan purposes, based 
on the rules of each plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen;
• adjustments required in certain 
circumstances such as rights 
issues, corporate restructuring, 
events and special dividends; and
• the annual review of performance 
conditions for the annual bonus 
plan and PSP.
If some events occur, such as a 
material divestment or acquisition 
of a Group business, which mean 
the original performance conditions 
are no longer appropriate, the 
Committee can adjust the targets, 
set different measures and alter 
weightings as necessary, to ensure 
the conditions achieve their original 
purpose and are not materially 
more or less difficult to satisfy.
The outstanding share incentive 
awards detailed on pages 79 and 80 
of the ARR will remain eligible to 
vest, based on their original award 
terms. In addition, all arrangements 
disclosed in previous Directors’ 
Remuneration Reports (such 
as bonuses earned in relation 
to 2013/14 performance) will 
remain eligible to vest or become 
payable on their original terms.

will retain the entire after tax 
number of Restricted Stock that

How Employees’ Pay is Taken 
into Account
While the Company does not 
consult employees on matters of 
Executive Director remuneration, 
the Committee does take account 
of the policy for employees 
across the workforce when 
determining the remuneration 
policy for Executive Directors, 
with specific regard to each 
Executive’s geographical location.
The Group HR Director facilitates 
this process, presenting to the 
Committee on pay structures 
across the organisation and how 
they fit the Group’s Remuneration 
Policy. The process includes 
consulting employees informally 
on their views of the current overall 
remuneration policy, which forms 
part of the feedback provided 
to the Committee and is used 
by the HR Director to assess the 
policy’s ongoing effectiveness.
When setting the Executive 
Directors’ base salaries, the 
Committee compares the 
salary increases proposed for 
each Executive Director within 
those proposed for employees 
in their geographical location, 
as well as considering the 
typical increase proposed 
across the Group as a whole.
None. None.
Fees for 2014/15 are as follows:
• Non-Executive Chairman: £140,000.
• Non-Executive Directors: £50,000.
Fees include chairing a Committee or 
any additional time commitments or 
responsibilities.
Any increase in Non-Executive Director 
fees may be above the level awarded 
to other employees, given that they 
may only be reviewed periodically and 
may need to reflect any changes to 
time commitments or responsibilities.
Non-Executive Directors also receive 
reimbursement of reasonable 
travel related expenses incurred 
undertaking Company business.
None.

How Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy Relates to the Wider Group
The remuneration policy summarised above and described in detail below operates for the Executive Directors. 
The same broad structure also operates for the other members of GELT.
Below GELT, these remuneration principles continue to apply. However, the structure and amount of remuneration 
vary by work level, reflecting the specialist nature of many employees’ roles, as well as local market practice and 
employee feedback. Generally, at less senior levels of the Group, total remuneration is less weighted towards 
performance-related pay.
How Shareholders’ Views are Taken into Account
As part of the Company’s ongoing review of remuneration policy, the Committee considers shareholder feedback 
received each year in relation to the AGM, as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies and any 
additional feedback received during shareholder meetings. The Committee will consult shareholders if any significant 
policy changes are proposed in the future.
Recruitment and Promotion Policy
For Executive Director recruitment or promotions, the Committee follows the guidelines outlined below:
Remuneration Element Policy
Base Salary Salary for a new hire or promotion to Executive Director is set at a level sufficient to attract 
the best candidate available to fill the role, taking into account the Group’s position, strategy 
and the country in which the Executive Director will live and work.
In the event that the salary is initially set at a discount to those offered in companies of a 
similar size, geographical reach and complexity (for example, in the event of an internal 
promotion), a series of planned increases above those of the wider workforce may be 
made over subsequent years, to bring the salary to the desired level, subject to individual 
performance.
Benefits Benefits are set in accordance with the Company’s remuneration policy. In addition, where 
necessary, the Committee may approve the payment of relocation expenses to facilitate 
recruitment, and flexibility is retained to pay for legal fees and other costs incurred by the 
individual in relation to their appointment. Consideration may need to be given to offer 
different or additional elements of the benefit package if a new Director is recruited outside 
the UK, to meet local market norms or legislation.
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement of up to 25% of salary.
Annual Bonus The annual bonus will operate as outlined for current Executive Directors, with  
the respective maximum opportunity, albeit usually pro-rated for the period of employment. 
Depending on the timing and responsibilities of the appointment,  
it may be necessary to set different initial performance measures and targets.
The maximum ongoing incentive opportunity under the Company’s policy is 125%  
of salary.
Long-Term Incentives PSP awards are granted in line with the policy outlined for the current Executive Directors. 
An award may (and usually will) be made upon appointment, subject to the Company not 
being prohibited from doing so. For an internal hire, existing awards will continue over their 
original vesting period and remain subject to their terms at the date of grant, and further 
awards may also be considered.
The normal maximum ongoing annual award level is 200% of salary (with a limit of 300% of 
salary in exceptional circumstances).
Buy-out Awards In the case of an external hire, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-
based elements to facilitate the buy-out of value forfeited on joining the Company, when it 
considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and therefore of shareholders. 
The Committee will seek to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the replacement awards 
which are not attributable to long-term incentives foregone will be delivered in Genus 
deferred shares, released at a later date and subject to continued employment. This includes 
using awards made under Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. Such payments would take account 
of remuneration relinquished when leaving a former employer and would reflect (as far as 
possible) the nature and time horizons attached to that remuneration and the impact of any 
performance conditions. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of 
appointment.

Executive Directors
Under the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts, the Company is 
required to give 12 months’ notice 
of termination of employment while 
the Executive Directors are required 
to give six months’ notice. If either 
party serves notice, the executives 
can continue to receive basic salary, 
benefits and pension for the duration 
of their notice period, during which 
time the Company may require the 
individual to fulfil their duties or 
assign a period of garden leave.
Under the Chief Executive’s 
contract, the Company may elect 
to make a payment in lieu of 
notice of up to 12 months’ base 
salary and benefits, in the event 
of it terminating his employment. 
These payments may be made 
on a monthly basis, in which case 
the principles of mitigation apply 
and he would be obliged to seek 
alternative employment, with the 
payments reducing to the extent 
that he receives alternative income.
Under the Group Finance Director’s 
contract, the Company may elect 
to make a payment in lieu of notice 
of up to 12 months’ base salary, 
in the event of it terminating his 
employment. These payments may 
be made on a monthly basis, in 
which case he would be required 
to take all reasonable steps to 
find alternative employment. The 
principles of mitigation may apply, 
which means the Company may 
reduce the monthly payments 
based on his actual earnings 
during the period for which the 
monthly payments are made, 
or the Company’s assessment 
of the earnings that he could 
have received if he had sought 
alternative employment.
In certain circumstances, such as 
gross misconduct, the Company may 
terminate employment immediately 
without notice or payment. The 
Committee may make any statutory 
entitlements or payments to settle 
or compromise claims in connection 
with a termination of any existing 
or future Executive Director as 
necessary. The Committee also 
retains the discretion to meet 
any outplacement and/or legal 
costs if deemed necessary.
There are no enhanced provisions 
in the event of a change of 
control. Executive Directors’ 
service contracts, which include 
details of remuneration, will be 
available for inspection at the 
AGM on 14 November 2014 or at 
the Company’s registered office.
The policy for a new hire would be 
based on terms that are consistent 
with these provisions and, in 
respect of the ability to make a 
payment in lieu of notice, terms 
that are consistent with those of 
the Group Finance Director.
Paying the cash element of annual 
bonuses is normally contingent 
on the executive being in 
employment and not under notice 
at the payment date, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, 
for example in the event of a good 
leaver circumstance such as death, 
retirement, injury or disability, 
redundancy or employment being 
transferred outside the Group. The 
payment of any bonus will be pro-
rated for the period of service and 
subject to the relevant performance 
conditions being achieved.
The vesting of any deferred bonus 
awards is determined by the plan’s 
rules. In general, awards lapse when 
employment ceases. However, the 
deferred bonus award will vest in 
certain good leaver circumstances, 
such as death, retirement, 
injury or disability, redundancy, 
employment being transferred 
outside the Group or any other 
reason the Committee decides.
The vesting of any awards granted 
under the 2004 PSP is determined 
by the plan’s rules. In general, 
awards lapse when employment 
ceases. However, awards may 
vest in certain good leaver 
circumstances, such as death or 
any other reason the Committee 
decides. This vesting is based on the 
extent to which the performance 
target has been satisfied. The 
Committee may decide to reduce 
the award pro rata, reflecting the 
proportion of the performance 
period that has elapsed.
The rules of the 2014 PSP, for which 
shareholder approval is being sought 
at the 2014 AGM, include a similar 
definition of a good leaver to the 
2004 PSP and also the provision 
that awards will generally lapse 
when employment ceases (see the 
Company’s Explanatory Notes to 
AGM on pages 156 to 165. In the 
case of the 2014 PSP, however, 
good leavers’ awards will ordinarily 
vest on the date when they would 
have vested had they not ceased 
employment, subject to the extent 
to which the performance target 
has been satisfied as determined 
by the Committee and as measured 
over the normal measurement 
period. Such good leaver awards 
will normally be pro-rated based 
on the time that the individual was 
employed during the normal vesting 
period, although the Committee can 
decide not to pro-rate an award if 
it thinks it is appropriate to do so. 
Alternatively, the Committee can 
decide that a good leaver’s award 
will vest when he leaves, subject 
to the performance conditions 
measured at that time and pro-
rating, although, as described 
above, the Committee can decide 
not to pro-rate an award if it 
thinks it is appropriate to do so. 
Such early vesting treatment will 
also apply in the case of death.
In the event of a change of control, 
the treatment detailed above for 
good leavers under the 2004 PSP 
and 2014 PSP would apply, albeit 
with performance tested over the 
shortened performance period.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have 
specific terms of engagement. Their 
appointment is for a fixed term of 
three years and is subject to one 
month’s notice of termination by 
either the Company or the Non-
Executive Director, and to annual 
re-election at the Company’s 
AGM, in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 74

and that this can broaden the Director’s skills and experience. When Stephen Wilson was appointed in January 2013,  
he was permitted to retain his Non-Executive Directorship of Xchanging plc and the associated remuneration.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION  
During the year to 30 June 2014, the Committee 
met six times and considered the following matters:
• the continuing appropriateness of the Company’s 
remuneration policy and the remuneration 
arrangements for the Executive Directors 
and GELT;
• salary levels for the Executive Directors and 
GELT members;
• the terms of the 2013/14 and 2014/15 Executive 
Annual Bonus Plan, and the individual bonuses 
payable for 2012/13, in light of the Group’s and 
individual’s performances;
• the individual long-term share incentive awards 
under the Company’s 2004 PSP and 2004 
Executive Share Option Plan, and the associated 
performance measures and targets;
• testing of the performance conditions and 
approval of the vesting levels of long-term share 
incentive awards granted in 2010/2011;
• the establishment of a 2014 PSP and a DSBP;
• the approval of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for 2012/13;
• the implications of revised reporting requirements 
for the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
2013/14; and
• current institutional investors’ guidelines on 
executive remuneration.
(UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Committee complies with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board, within 
agreed terms of reference, on remuneration for the 
Executive Directors and other members of GELT. The 
Committee’s full terms of reference are available on 
the Company’s website at www.genusplc.com.
The Committee comprises independent Non-Executive 
Directors Nigel Turner (Chairman), Mike Buzzacott, 
Barry Furr, Duncan Maskell, Lykele van der Broek and 
also the Company’s Non-Executive Chairman, Bob 
Lawson, whom the Board considered to be independent 
at the time of his appointment to the Board.
None of the Committee members has any personal 
financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts 
of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-
to-day involvement in running the business. Karim 
Bitar, Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Wilson, 
the Group Finance Director, attend meetings at the 
invitation of the Committee. They are not present 
when their own remuneration is being discussed. 
The Committee is supported by the Group HR 
Director, Finance and Company Secretariat functions.

Additional 
Information
In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration for 
the year, the Committee consulted the Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director and the Group HR Director 
about its proposals, although none of these individuals 
are involved in determining their own remuneration.
The Committee also appointed New Bridge Street 
(part of Aon plc) to provide benchmarking advice 
on the remuneration packages for the Executive 
Directors, members of GELT and the Non-Executive 
Directors. New Bridge Street is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with 
its Code of Conduct. Aon plc acts as insurance broker 
to the Group. New Bridge Street’s fees for services to 
the Committee during the year were £90,643, which 
included £14,296 of implementation advice in relation to 
the operation of the Company’s share incentive plans.
The Committee considered New Bridge Street’s 
performance during the year, in terms of the quality and 
independence of its advice, the potential for conflicts 
of interest (which are actively managed within Aon 
plc) and its knowledge and understanding of market 
practice. Having reviewed these factors, the Committee 
decided to retain New Bridge Street as its advisers.

Base Salary
The Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ 
base salaries prior to each financial year, taking into 
account individual and corporate performance, 
an assessment of comparator companies, wider 
economic conditions and levels of increases 
applicable to the Group’s other employees.
The Executive Directors’ current salary levels 
(with effect from 1 July 2014) are as follows:
• Karim Bitar: £526,830 (2% increase from 2013/14); and
• Stephen Wilson: £357,000 (2% increase from 2013/14).
The Committee determined that salaries would be 
increased by 2%, reflecting the average increase 
awarded across the UK employee population.
When setting pay, the Committee periodically considers 
external benchmark data for comparable roles in 
companies of broadly similar size, international scope 
of operations, and complexity. Given there are few 
direct comparator listed companies, the Committee 
considers general market data. The Committee is 
careful in its use of benchmark pay data (for example, 
it does not target median market positioning for each 
Executive Director each year) and takes into account 
a broad range of factors when setting pay, such 
as the experience, calibre and performance of the 
individual, and salary increases across the Group.
Pension and Other Benefits
The Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, 
principally a car or car allowance, life assurance and 
private medical insurance. In lieu of company pension 
contributions, the Company has agreed to pay Karim 
Bitar and Stephen Wilson a taxable pension allowance 
of 25% and 15% of basic salary per annum respectively.
Performance-Related Annual Bonus
The Company bonus scheme for the 2014/15 financial 
year for its Directors and senior executives will incentivise 
and reward the delivery of challenging adjusted profit 
growth targets (60% of the bonus opportunity), 
cash generation (15% of the bonus opportunity) and 
personal targets (25% of the bonus opportunity). The 
maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive 
and Group Finance Director is 125% of salary.
The metrics for 2014/15 capture performance against 
a range of key performance indicators. Profit is an 
‘output’ metric that captures our success against a 
range of other KPIs, which we assess on an ongoing 
basis, such as growing volumes and revenue while 
maintaining appropriate profit per transaction and 
royalty rates. Cash targets measure our success in 
generating funds to invest in growing the business 
or paying dividends. Progress with implementing 
our strategy forms a central part of the personal 
performance targets for each position.
The above structure includes a slight adjustment to 
that for 2013/14, in that the weightings have been 
adjusted (25% based on personal targets as opposed 
to 20%, and 15% on cash generation as opposed to 
20%). This better reflects the increased focus on 
delivery against personal (largely strategic) objectives, 
which will unlock the Group’s growth potential.
For the adjusted profit target, no bonus is payable 
unless the prior year’s result is exceeded, at which 
point 0% of this part of the bonus is payable. Bonus 
thereafter is earned on a graduated scale, with 50% 
of this part of the bonus earned for growing adjusted 
profit by 10% and a maximum bonus is earned for 
growing adjusted profit by 15%. The Committee 
considers this year’s financial targets are appropriately 
demanding, requiring growth in profits in line with the 
strategic plan and significant double digit growth to 
achieve the maximum award. A graduated scale also 
operates for cash generation for the year. Bonuses 
are earned based on financial performance measured 
in constant currency, which replicates the approach 
to target setting across the Group as a whole.
Personal targets are linked to successful 
implementation of the Company’s strategy, with 
the targets being both quantifiable and stretching. 
Achievement of these targets is central to unlocking 
the growth potential we want to target through the 
revisions to our PSP as described in this report. 76
Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
Corporate Governance
Full disclosure is not provided in relation to the 
targets set for 2014/15, since the Committee 
considers the targets are commercially sensitive. 
The ARR for 2014/15 will include retrospective 
disclosure of the targets, subject to the information 
not being considered prejudicial to the Group.
Of the bonus earned against the targets described 
above, 25% will be deferred by way of shares for three 
years and will vest subject to continued employment, 
other than in certain good leaver circumstances. 
Deferral ensures there is a continued link between 
achieving our short-term financial targets and the 
longer-term delivery of our growth strategy. Clawback 
provisions apply to the annual bonus, which will enable 
the Committee to claw back any element of bonuses 
that should not have been paid, in the event of a 
material misstatement of the Group’s annual results.
Long-Term Incentives
Long-term share awards were previously granted 
under the Genus plc 2004 PSP, which was amended 
following shareholder approval at the 2012 AGM. As 
the plan has now expired, the Committee is proposing 
a new PSP scheme for shareholder approval at the 
2014 AGM. This follows an extensive consultation 
exercise with the Company’s major shareholders 
and the leading shareholder protection bodies. 
Details of the plan are included in the Notice of AGM. 
Subject to this approval, the Committee intends to 
grant awards in 2014 of 200% of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 175% of salary for the Group Finance 
Director. These awards are in line with those in 2013.
The intended performance targets for the awards to be 
granted in 2014 will primarily relate to average annual 
growth in adjusted EPS, measured over three years. 
The range of targets for the 2014 awards is as follows:
Average Annual Growth in Adjusted Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’)*
Vesting  
(% Award)
Less than 6% p.a. 0%
6% p.a. 20%
20% p.a. 100%
Straight-line vesting between performance points
* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period 
was calculated on a simple average annual growth rate.
This range is simpler than for awards granted in 2013 
(detailed on page 79), which had two distinct ranges 
of EPS targets with overlapping scales. The previous 
targets were also set as growth in excess of UK RPI. The 
Committee believes this is no longer appropriate, as the 
Group is subject to different inflationary pressures in the 
many countries it operates in. As a result, the potential 
impact of inflation has been incorporated in the above 
range of targets. The Committee remains comfortable 
with using adjusted EPS as the primary performance 
metric for long-term incentives, since EPS is an all-
encompassing figure which is highly visible and well 
understood by both participants and shareholders.
Overall, the Committee believes the above targets are 
appropriately challenging. They incentivise executives 
to deliver the Company’s growth strategy and are 
therefore aligned with shareholders’ interests. They also 
adhere to the principles of transparency and simplicity, 
to maximise the PSP’s incentivisation for participants.
As with awards currently granted under the PSP, 
the Committee will retain the ability to scale back 
vesting based on EPS performance if it does not 
consider the vesting result to be consistent with 
the progress achieved against the Company’s 
strategy during the performance period. This is 
considered appropriate, to broaden the executive 
team’s focus beyond financial performance.
Other key features of the awards to be granted under 
the 2014 PSP include a requirement to retain the after 
tax number of shares vesting in 2017 for two years, 
and clawback provisions which may be applied at the 
Committee’s discretion if the Company’s results are 
found to have been misstated within three years of 
vesting and the vesting result was artificially high.
Non-Executive Director Fees
The current total fees payable to the Non-Executive 
Directors per annum are as follows:
Position Fees
Chairman £140,000
Other Non-Executive Directors £50,000
There were no increases from the fees paid in 2013/14.
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors include 
any fees for chairing our Board Committees, which 
are described in the Corporate Governance Report.

5. In line with the new regulations, the Restricted Stock award granted to Karim Bitar that vested in the year ended 30 June 2013 has been 
excluded from the Single Figure of Remuneration. As previously disclosed, this award was granted in connection with his recruitment, 
replacing value forfeited on leaving his former employer. The value of the shares vesting in the year ended 30 June 2013 was £584,000

1. The financial elements of the bonus are payable on a straight-line basis between each target level.
2. Adjusted profit before tax (on an actual currency basis: £39.3m, constant currency basis: £42.5m) was below threshold level and so no 
bonus was payable in relation to this element.
3. Cash flow (excluding dividends and investments in joint ventures and acquisitions: £26.2m) exceeded the maximum level and so a 
maximum bonus was payable in relation to this element.
4. The Committee considers that the actual financial targets remain commercially sensitive and therefore are not disclosed. In the future,  
the Committee will disclose financial targets when they consider these concerns have been removed. 
5. Performance against non-financial strategic objectives related to targets set in a number of areas that included customer, people and 
product and process improvement. Specific targets relating to performance objectives were set at the beginning of the year and 
measured at the year end. In undertaking a broad assessment of performance, the Committee considered both qualitative  
and quantitative information when determining the extent to which the targets were achieved. Commercial targets are sensitive and 
therefore it is not appropriate to disclose them in this transition year. The bonus earned by the Chief Executive included (but was not 
limited to) progress achieved in accelerating genetic improvement and dissemination, progress in beef and dairy proprietary indices and 
products, developing the senior leadership capability and succession planning. The bonus earned by the Group Finance Director included 
(but was not limited to) the successful acquisition and the integration of Génétiporc and delivering Group-wide improvements in finance 
process and practices.
As noted in the Strategic Report, there has been significant progress on key strategic areas. These include the 
acquisition and integration of Génétiporc, improvements in genetic dissemination, PIC product differentiation, 
delivery of volume growth in both ABS and PIC, and improved succession and management capability.
Total bonuses earned against the targets set at the start of the year were equivalent to 40% of salary or 32% of 
maximum potential for Karim Bitar, and 43.8% of salary or 35% of maximum potential for Stephen Wilson. The 
Committee feels comfortable that these represent appropriate out-turns for the year for the two executives for the 
performance achieved.
In line with our policy, 25% of the bonuses earned were deferred into the Company’s shares for three years.
Performance Share Awards Vesting in Relation to 2013/14 (Audited)

* The closing average share price over the three days prior to the award being granted has been used to determine the maximum face  
value of the awards. This was £14.13 for Karim Bitar and Stephen Wilson (award granted on 26 September 2013).
** The different vesting percentages at the threshold performance level relate to the fact that part of the award is granted subject to the 
Tier 1 targets detailed below, with the balance subject to the Tier 2 targets also detailed below.
The awards will vest subject to achieving a challenging sliding scale of EPS growth targets and a strategic underpin. 
The targets were set out in full in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, along with the rationale for the range of 
targets and the choice of performance metric.
The performance targets are as follows in relation to the above awards:
Tier 1 Awards
The range of targets applicable to awards with a value of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary  
to the previous and current Group Finance Director were as follows:

In relation to the share awards granted in 2013, the closing average share price over the three days prior to  
26 September 2013 (the grant date for the PSP awards) was used (£14.13) to determine the number of shares 
comprising individual awards.
The performance targets applying to (1) are as described above for Performance Share Awards vesting in relation  
to 2013/14. In respect of (2), (3) and (4), the targets were as per Tiers 1 and 2, Performance Share Awards granted in 
2013/14 set out on page 79 (the same targets applied for awards granted in 2012, albeit based on the three-year 
performance period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2015). No further performance conditions apply to the DSBP awards.
Material Contracts
There have been no other contracts or arrangements during the financial year in which a Director of the Company

Payments for Loss of Office and Payments to Former Directors (Audited)
John Worby ceased to be a Director on 31 March 2013. Consistent with the terms of the relevant incentive plans,  
and as set out in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report he was treated as a ‘good leaver’ on his retirement.  
His outstanding long-term incentive awards granted on 10 September 2010, which were subject to performance 
ended 30 June 2013 vested in full. As a result, 37,680 shares were transferred to John Worby with a value of 
£502,274, based on the share price on the date of transfer (£13.33).
There were no payments for loss of office in the year.
Dilution
The 2014 PSP includes an aggregate dilution limit of 10% in ten years, which is lower than the 15% in ten years dilution 
limit for the 2004 PSP.
As an international business, the Company has offered discretionary equity incentives on a broad basis to facilitate 
the recruitment and retention of key employees in the wide range of locations in which it operates, where equity 
based incentive awards are commonly granted below levels often operated in the UK.
The current dilution under all share plans is 7.7% in ten years, which falls within the Association of British Insurers’ all 
plans limit of 10% in ten years. Dilution within the 10% in ten years limit will be kept under periodic review.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust to be the custodian of any shares purchased in respect of 
the 2004 PSP on behalf of the Executive Directors and certain senior management. As at 30 June 2014, the trust held 
146,625 ordinary shares in the Company.

Corporate Governance
Chairman’s Overview
The Committee proposes candidates 
for appointment to the Board. Our 
duties include regularly reviewing 
the Board’s structure, size and 
composition, including the skills, 
knowledge and experience the 
Board needs. We then make 
recommendations to the Board, 
taking into account succession 
planning for Directors and other 
senior executives, and the Group’s 
challenges and opportunities.
Membership and Governance
Bob Lawson chairs the Committee. 
Its other members are currently 
Nigel Turner, Mike Buzzacott, 
Barry Furr, Duncan Maskell, Lykele 
van der Broek and Karim Bitar.
The Committee has written terms 
of reference, which set out the 
authority delegated to it by the 
Board. These are available from 
our website: www.genusplc.com.
Activities During the Year
The Committee met once during the 
year, to consider the appointment 
of new Non-Executive Directors. We 
determined that two additional Non-
Executive Directors were required, 
one with a scientific background and 
one with experience in agriculture. 
For the scientific specialist, we 
looked for candidates with the 
following characteristics:
• a pre-eminent scientist with  
an advanced degree in life or 
molecular sciences and strong 
appreciation of biochemistry  
and genetics;
• a board-level serving or retired 
executive with an international 
and successful track record in 
R&D management at a leading 
agriculture company, a related 
business or in academia; and
• experience in successfully setting 
and implementing R&D strategy 
for an organisation of a similar 
scale and complexity.
For the agricultural specialist, 
we looked for candidates with 
the following characteristics:
• a board-level serving or retired 
executive and business leader, with 
an international and successful 
track record in commercial 
operations, general management 
and, particularly, innovation at  
a leading agriculture company;
• experience in successfully  
setting and implementing  
market and business strategy  
for an agriculture organisation  
of substantial scale and 
complexity; and
• experience of both developed  
and emerging markets.
For both roles, we wanted 
candidates with good all round 
business acumen and the proven 
experience, skills and knowledge to 
serve as a successful Non-Executive 
Director. A background in agriculture 
and farming was also positive.
Appointments were based on 
an objective assessment of the 
Group’s needs, its strategy and 
the Board’s current skills and 
experience. This requires us to 
make appointments on merit, so we 
have the right Board composition 
to direct the Group effectively.
After conducting a thorough search 
with the help of one of the world’s 
leading global executive search 
firms, we concluded that Professor 
Duncan Maskell and Lykele van 
der Broek were the outstanding 
candidates for the scientific and 
agricultural roles respectively. Their 
biographies, along with information 
on Genus’s other Board members, 
can be found on pages 50 and 51.

Dividend
The Board is recommending to 
shareholders a final dividend of  
12.2 pence per ordinary share, 
resulting in a total dividend for  
the year of 17.7 pence per ordinary 
share, an increase of 10% for 
the year. It is proposed that the 
final dividend will be paid on 
5 December 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 21 November 2014. 
Capital Structure
Note 30 gives details of the 
Company’s authorised and 
issued share capital and any 
movements in the issued share 
capital during the year. 
The Company has one class of 
ordinary share. All issued shares are 
fully paid and each share has the 
right to one vote at the Company’s 
general meetings. There are no 
specific restrictions either on the 
size of a holding or on the transfer 
of shares, which are both governed 
by our Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. No person 
has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital.
Details of the Company’s employee 
share schemes are set out in note 29. 
In connection with these schemes, 
the Genus plc Employee Benefit 
Trust holds shares in the Company 
from time to time and abstains from 
voting in respect of any such shares.
No other person has notified 
an interest in the Company’s 
ordinary shares, which is 
required to be disclosed to us.
Authority to Acquire the Company’s 
Own Shares
No shares were bought back by 
the Company, under the authority 
of the shareholders’ resolutions 
of 15 November 2013, in the 
period since 16 November 2013 
to and the date of this report.
Going Concern
As described more fully in the  
Basis of Preparation note on  
pages 96 to 98, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, 
the Board continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing 
the Financial Statements.
Provision of Information to the 
Company’s Auditor
Each of the Directors at the 
date of approval of this Annual 
Report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, 
there is no relevant audit 
information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the 
steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make 
himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and 
should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 
418 Companies Act 2006.
Appointment of Auditor
Deloitte LLP have expressed their 
willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution to 
reappoint them will be proposed 
at the forthcoming AGM.

Corporate Governance
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Financial Statements 
for each financial year. Under that 
law, the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In Preparing the Parent Company 
Financial Statements, the Directors 
are Required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial 
Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements 
on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Company  
will continue in business.
In Preparing the Group Financial 
Statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 Requires  
That Directors:
• properly select and apply 
accounting policies;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are 
insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the 
Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
Financial Statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial 
information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
Financial Statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement 
We confirm that to the 
best of our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, 
prepared in accordance with  
the relevant financial reporting 
framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or  
loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a 
fair review of the development 
and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included  
in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model 
and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Genus plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 30 June 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Group Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Statement of Cash 
Flows, and the related notes 1 to 51. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements is applicable law and IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the Other Statutory 
Disclosures section that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Fair value of biological assets under  
IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’
The Group calculates the fair value of 
biological assets through the use of 
discounted cash flow models.
The valuation models and related data 
inputs and assumptions require a number 
of management estimates as explained in 
note 15 to the financial statements.
For bovine asset valuations the key 
assumptions include: the future demand 
for semen; estimated production value; 
expected marketable life of each bull; the 
discount rate applied to the future cash 
flows; and the percentage of bulls which 
are expected to be actively marketed.
For porcine asset valuations the key 
assumptions include: the percentage of 
production animals expected to be sold; 
the expected sales price; expected useful 
life; the discount rate applied to the future 
cash flows; and for the pureline pigs the 
number of future generations from which 
output is attributable to the current herd.
Our response to the risk in this area considers the separate elements of 
the fair value calculations: the basis for management’s estimates and 
judgements applied in the key assumptions; the validity of transactional 
data used for other inputs; and the mechanical integrity of the models 
themselves.
For the bovine asset valuations, our audit work included obtaining an 
understanding of management’s processes surrounding the compilation 
of the future demand forecast. We considered the appropriateness of the 
projected volume growth rate against historical trends and current 
performance, and analysed management’s historical forecasting 
accuracy.
For the porcine asset valuations our audit work included the procedures 
above for the sales projections and testing of the expected percentage 
of animals to be sold by reference to historical transactional data. For all 
other assumptions in each model we challenged the significant estimates 
with reference to third party or historical transactional data as 
appropriate.
For both species valuation models, we used our valuation experts to 
provide additional challenge to the discount rates applied to the cash 
flows.
We also tested the mechanical integrity of the spreadsheets used to 
calculate the fair values using analytical tools.

Valuation of pension schemes and 
post-retirement benefits
The Group operates several defined 
benefit pension schemes, for which there 
is judgement in determining the IAS 19 
valuation as recorded at the balance sheet 
date. The valuation is based on a number 
of assumptions as disclosed in note 28.
Genus is party to a multi-employer 
pension scheme and is exposed to the risk 
of additional liabilities from the default of 
other scheme members.
In conjunction with our actuarial specialists we have evaluated the 
appropriateness of management’s assumptions and methodology used 
to value the defined benefit pension schemes by benchmarking 
management’s assumptions to those used in the external market.
In addition we circularised the independent actuary and investment 
managers responsible for managing the pension funds to confirm the 
source inputs into the pension valuation.
In response to the risk of additional liabilities for the multi-employer 
scheme arising from other employers, we have considered the financial 
strength and stability of remaining employers in the scheme and their 
ability to contribute to the deficit through a review of the most recent 
publicly available financial information.
Accounting for the acquisition of 
Génétiporc
The acquisition of Génétiporc resulted in 
£5.0m of the purchase price being 
allocated to customer relationships and 
£8.9m to biological assets.
The determination of the fair value of 
these assets is a matter of management 
judgement. The significant assumptions 
include the growth rates inherent in the 
forecast sales generated from the 
acquired customer relationships; and the 
discount rate applied to the future cash 
flows.
The assumptions applied to the valuation 
of biological assets are consistent with 
those detailed above for other Genus 
animals.
We audited the fair value adjustments to the opening balance sheet. In 
respect of the intangible assets identified, we involved our valuation 
specialists in our testing of the third party intangible assets valuation 
model, including the valuation methodology employed and the discount 
rates applied.
We reviewed the biological asset valuation models and performed 
procedures consistent with those noted above for all biological assets.
Impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets
There is a risk regarding potential 
impairment over the valuation of goodwill 
and intangible assets arising on historical 
acquisitions.
In management’s impairment assessment 
there are a number of key judgements 
used to determine the recoverable 
amount, including the identification of 
cash-generating units, growth rates in 
future cash flow forecasts and discount 
rates applied to these forecasts.
There is also a risk regarding potential 
impairment of development costs 
capitalised in relation to specific projects.
We challenged the assumptions used by management in their annual 
impairment assessment by comparing the projected growth rates and 
forecast cash flows against historical trends achieved in the business. We 
analysed historical budgeting accuracy to assess the reliability of 
management’s forecasts. We also reviewed third party market data 
sources used by management in their forecast models.
We used valuation specialists within the audit team to challenge the 
discount rates applied to these cash flows by reference to market data, 
including the risk premium applied to each cash-generating unit. This 
involved benchmarking the rates against other companies operating in 
similar regions.
We have tested the development costs capitalised to ensure they relate 
to viable ongoing projects and meet the criteria for capitalisation as set 
out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. We have reviewed management’s 
assessment of the carrying value of costs capitalised and challenged the 
assumptions applied to their total project valuation model including: the 
projected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates applied.
We have liaised with project managers to understand the progress and 
future prospects of ongoing development projects.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out in the Audit Committee Report. 89

Additional 
Information
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial 
statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on 
these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both 
in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.5m (2013: £2.2m), which is 7.5% of pre-tax profit before exceptional 
items and changes in fair value of biological assets, and below 1% of equity. We have used this measure to eliminate 
volatility.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.1m, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also 
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused 
our Group audit scope on 20 components.
Ten of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining ten were subject to specified audit procedures where 
the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of 
the Group’s operations at those locations.
The ten entities subject to a full audit represent the principal business units and account for 69% of the Group’s 
revenue, 62% of the Group’s operating profit and 75% of the Group’s net assets. They were also selected to provide an 
appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit 
work at the ten entities was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower 
than Group materiality.
The ten entities subject to specified audit procedures account for 21% of the Group’s revenue, 29% of the Group’s 
operating profit and 19% of the Group’s net assets.
At the Parent entity level we tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures on the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account 
balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor visits the most significant components each year. In years when we do not visit a significant 
component we will include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and review 
documentation of the findings from their work.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 90
Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
Financial Statements
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our 
quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner 
reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.

Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity
Genus plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. Its 
registered office is Belvedere House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4HG. The Group Financial 
Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
‘Group’). We have used the equity method to account for the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates. Genus 
at a Glance on pages 2 and 3 explains the Group’s operations and principal activities.
2. Basis of preparation
We have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Unless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the significant accounting policies set out below to all periods 
presented in these Group Financial Statements.
We reclassified certain comparative amounts in 2013, to conform to the current year’s presentation, as described in 
the relevant notes.
Adoption of the amendments to IAS 19
We have adopted the amendments to IAS 19 for the year ended 30 June 2014, requiring us to restate some amounts 
for the prior year. The effect on key financial information is described below:
Consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income:
Year ended 30 June 2013
As reported
£m
Adjustments
£m
New basis
£m
Revenue 345.3 – 345.3
Operating profit 37.2 (0.9) 36.3
Net finance costs (1.9) (3.8) (5.7)
Profit before tax 38.1 (4.7) 33.4
Profit for the financial period 27.0 (3.6) 23.4
Other comprehensive income 1.5 3.6 5.1
Total comprehensive income for the period 28.5 – 28.5
Adjusted basic earnings per share 55.0p (5.9p) 49.1p
Basic earnings per share 44.7p (5.9p) 38.8p
Under the revised standard the expected return on plan assets in excess of the discount rate has been moved to the 
Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, increasing net finance costs. Administration expenses in respect of 
pension schemes are now included within operating profit, rather than offset against the return on plan assets. This 
restatement has resulted in no net effect on the Group Balance Sheet or the Group Statement of Cash Flows.
Functional and presentation currency
We present the Group Financial Statements in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational 
currency. All financial information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest £0.1 million.
Basis of measurement
We prepare the Group Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets and 
derivative financial instruments. In accordance with IFRS, we measure:
• biological assets at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of distribution and selling 
expenses; and
• derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Use of estimates
Preparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our 
application of accounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Our actual results may 
differ from these estimates. We review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise 
revisions to accounting estimates in the period in which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.
Note 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in 
applying accounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts we recognised in the financial statements.

Going concern
After reviewing the available information including the Group’s business plans and after making enquiries, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
At 30 June 2014 the Group had net debt of £63.9m (2013: £52.9m) and undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 
£55.4m. The Group’s credit facilities at the balance sheet date comprised a £65m multi-currency revolving credit 
facility, a US$100m revolving credit facility and an amortising US$35m term loan, repayable in instalments by  
15 September 2017. We do not expect the financial covenants on these facilities to prevent the Group making further 
use of the facilities if required. This, together with the maturity profile of debt, gives the Directors confidence that the 
Group has sufficient financial resources for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Company is well placed to manage its business despite current uncertainties in the economic environment.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities the Group controls. We have control when we have the power to govern the entity’s financial 
and operating policies, so we benefit from its activities. In assessing control, we take into account potential voting 
rights that we can currently exercise or convert. We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the 
date that control transfers to the Group. We cease consolidating the results of subsidiaries we sell from the date that 
control passes.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating 
policies. The Group Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of 
associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date it ceases. 
When our share of losses exceeds our interest in an associate, we reduce the carrying amount to nil and stop 
recognising further losses, except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on an associate’s behalf.
Joint ventures are entities over whose activities we have joint control, under a contractual agreement. The Group 
Financial Statements include the Group’s share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and 
expenses arising from intra-Group transactions. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted 
investees are eliminated against the investment, to the extent of our interest in the investee. We eliminate unrealised 
losses in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Non-GAAP measures – adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit before tax from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per 
share exclude the net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
share-based payment expense, exceptional items and other gains and losses.
We believe these non-GAAP measures provide shareholders with useful information about the Group’s trading 
performance. The reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit 
from continuing operations is shown on the face of the Group Income Statement.
Foreign currency
We record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entity’s functional currency, at the exchange rate on 
the transaction date. At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. We recognise the foreign exchange differences 
arising on retranslation in the Group Income Statement.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at 
the exchange rate at the transaction date. When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a 
foreign currency, we translate them at the prevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling 
at the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date. We translate these operations’ revenues and expenses 
using an average rate for the period.
When exchange differences arise from translating foreign operations into Sterling, or from the fair value movement of 
related effective hedges, we take them to the foreign currency translation reserve. When we dispose of the foreign 
operation, we release these differences to the income statement. 98

3. Significant accounting policies
Business combinations
We use the purchase method to account for all business combinations. The cost of acquisition is the aggregate of the 
fair value at the date of exchange of assets we give, liabilities we incur or assume, and equity instruments we issue in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. We recognise acquisition related costs in the profit and loss as we incur them.
We recognise the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, which meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3, at their fair values at the acquisition date. The exceptions are non-current assets (or 
disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’, which we recognise and measure at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill
When we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost, 
excluding transaction costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities. Identifiable assets include intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from 
legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are separable.
We state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. We allocate goodwill to cash-generating units, 
which are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows from other assets or groups of assets. We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment. 
For associates, we include the carrying amount of goodwill in the carrying amount of our investment in the associate.
IAS 21 requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity rather than of the acquiring 
entity:
• goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation; and
• any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquiree’s assets and liabilities.
We therefore express them in the foreign operation’s functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet 
date.
Research and development
We undertake research with the aim of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, and recognise this expenditure 
in the income statement as we incur it.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities. When research projects achieve technical feasibility and are 
commercially viable, our policy is to capitalise further development costs in accordance with IAS 38.
Our development activities include developing and maintaining our porcine genetic nucleus herd and our bovine 
pre-stud herds. We do not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is 
included in the fair value of the Group’s biological assets, in accordance with IAS 41.
We capitalise other development costs within intangible assets when the criteria of IAS 38 are met.
We disclose the costs of research and herd development activities, as required by IAS 38.
Exceptional items
The Group presents items as exceptional when the Directors believe them to be exceptional because of their size or 
incidence.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets that we have acquired in a business combination since 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised 
separately from goodwill, where they meet the definition of an intangible asset and we can reliably measure their fair 
values. Their cost is their fair value at the acquisition date.
After their initial recognition, we report these intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses. This is the same basis as for intangible assets acquired separately.
The estimated useful lives for intangible assets are as follows:
Software 2 to 10 years
Porcine genetics technology 20 years
Multiplier contracts 15 years
Customer relationships 15 to 17 years
Intangible assets acquired separately
We carry intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment loss. We charge amortisation on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and review 
the useful life and amortisation method at the end of each financial year, accounting for the effect of any changes in 
estimate on a prospective basis.
Impairment
We review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any indication exists, we estimate the asset’s recoverable amount.
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable 
amount at each balance sheet date. The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, we discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount 
rate of 11.1% (2013: 11.4%), which is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For some countries we add a 
premium to this rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that country. If the asset does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, we determine the recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) that the asset belongs to.
We recognise an impairment loss in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount.
When we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to CGUs, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the unit’s other 
assets on a pro rata basis.
Reversals of impairment
We reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist 
and we have changed the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.
We only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount it would have had, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss.
Biological assets and inventories
The Group’s principal activity during the period was the global application of quantitative genetics and biotechnology 
to animal breeding. We use these techniques to identify and select animals with the genes responsible for superior 
milk and meat, high health and performance traits. We sell breeding animals and semen to customers, who use them 
to produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality, for the global dairy and meat 
supply chain.
In bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the 
Holstein dairy breed. Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic 
evaluations and progeny testing of its daughters’ performance. We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to 
satisfy our customers’ demand. Farmers use semen from dairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock. They use 
the semen we sell from beef breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds, for multiplying breeding bulls for use in 
natural service, or on dairy cows to produce animals to be reared for meat.
We hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets. We transfer 
bull semen to inventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2. We state 
our inventories at the lower of this deemed cost and net realisable value. 100

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2014
Sorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process. As a result, we transfer semen inventory into 
sexed semen production at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of 
the production process. We carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost.
In porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock (the ‘nucleus herd’), to provide genetically superior 
animals. These genetics help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of 
consistently high-quality products, which yield higher value. So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we 
outsource the vast majority of our pig production to our global multiplier network. We sell the offspring or semen we 
obtain from animals in the nucleus herd to customers for use in commercial farming. Porcine semen is sold fresh and 
has a short life when frozen.
Pig sales generally occur in one of two ways: ‘upfront’ and ‘royalty’. Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value 
of the animal at point we transfer it to the customer. Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two 
separately identifiable components: its carcass and its genetic potential. We receive the initial consideration, which is 
approximately the animal’s carcass value, at the point we transfer the pig to the customer. We retain our interest in 
the pig’s genetic potential and receive royalties for the customer’s use of this genetic potential.
The breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under 
royalty contracts, are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. We recognise changes in fair 
value in the income statement, within operating profit for the period.
We classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals as non-current assets and carry them at 
fair value. The porcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are 
carried at fair value and classified as current assets. We split our retained interest in the genetics from royalty sales 
between current and non-current assets, based on the remaining expected life of the animals.
Determination of fair values – biological assets
IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’ requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet. We 
determine this carrying value according to IAS 41’s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the income 
statement. There are important differences in how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.
Bovine – we base the fair value of proven bulls, bulls with a genomic evaluation and bulls on test, on the net cash 
flows we expect to receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate. Proven 
bulls are those we have evaluated and whose semen we actively market. Genomic bulls are those we market on their 
estimated genetic value. We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory we manage where a third 
party has a share in semen sales from a particular bull. The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the 
expected future demand for semen, estimated production value, each bull’s expected marketable life and, for bulls on 
test, the percentage whose production we expect to actively market. In assessing the sales price, we use independent 
statistical data for the bulls. This data is produced three times a year in all our major markets. In addition, we estimate 
which markets we will sell the semen in, as well as domestic and export prices. Bulls that have not yet entered our 
testing programme have a fair value equivalent to their acquisition and rearing costs.
Porcine – the fair values of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in 
the genetics of animals we have sold under royalty arrangements. The fair value of animals we own is calculated using 
the animals’ average live weights, plus a premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable. We base 
the live weight value and the genetic premium on recent transaction prices we have achieved. The significant 
assumptions in determining fair values are the breeding animals’ expected life, the percentage of production animals 
that are saleable as breeding animals, and the expected sales prices. For our retained interest in the genetics of 
animals sold under royalty contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we achieved in recent direct sales 
of similar animals, less the amount we received upfront for the carcass element. We then remeasure the fair value of 
our retained interest at each reporting date. The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained 
interest is the animals’ expected life.
We value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of 
account. We do this using a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds’ future outputs at current prices. The 
significant assumptions we make are the number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value 
prices we achieve on sales, the animals’ expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate.
Non-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group
To manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers 
(‘multipliers’) who produce piglets on farms we neither manage nor control. We have the option, but not the 
obligation, to buy the offspring at slaughter market value plus a premium. Because the offspring have superior 
genetics, we can then sell them to other farmers at a premium.

Additional 
Information
We do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the balance sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue 
to hold them for the purpose of receiving non-financial items (the offspring), in accordance with our expected 
purchase requirements. This means the option is outside the scope of IAS 39. We do not recognise the offspring as 
biological assets under IAS 41, as we do not own or control them.
Property, plant and equipment
We state property, plant and equipment at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at 
their latest valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses. Where parts of an item of property, plant and 
equipment have different useful lives, we account for them separately.
We charge depreciation to the income statement on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each part 
of an asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 10 to 15 years
Leasehold buildings over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
We do not depreciate land and assets not available for use.
Trade and other receivables
We state trade and other receivables at their nominal amount less any impairment losses. If there is a material 
difference between the nominal amount and the present value, we state the trade or other receivable at its present 
value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of our cash management. We only include them 
in cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
We initially recognise interest-bearing loans and borrowings at their fair value, less attributable transaction costs. 
After this initial recognition, we state them at amortised cost and recognise any difference between the cost and 
redemption value in the income statement over the borrowings’ expected life, on an effective interest rate basis.
Provisions
We recognise a provision in the balance sheet when an event results in the Group having a current legal or 
constructive obligation, and it is probable that we will have to settle the obligation through an outflow of economic 
benefits. If the effect is material, we discount provisions to their present value.
Revenue
Revenue is the invoiced value of sales and royalties receivable from customers, net of trade discounts and value 
added tax.
The principal components of the Group’s revenue and their respective accounting treatments are:
• Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals and ancillary products, which we 
recognise when risks and rewards transfer to the customer. This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, 
depending on the terms of sale.
• Royalties, which we recognise when receivable. We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers 
based on key performance variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow 
and the average slaughter weight of the animals born.
• Revenue from consulting and other services, which represent the amounts we charged for services we provided 
during the year, including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax. We recognise services provided 
but not yet billed as revenue, based on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual 
right to receive payment. Where unbilled revenue is contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue 
until the event occurs.
Leases
We classify leases as finance leases whenever the lease terms transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to us. All other leases are operating leases.
We recognise the assets we hold under finance leases at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each of which we determine at the start of the lease. We include our corresponding liability 
in the balance sheet, as a finance lease obligation. 102
Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
Financial Statements
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2014
We apportion lease payments between finance charges and a reduction in our lease obligation, so we achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining liability. We recognise finance charges directly in the income statement, 
unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case we capitalise them in accordance with our 
general policy on borrowing costs (see below).
For operating leases, we charge the rentals payable, and any incentives we receive to enter into an operating lease, 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance costs
We recognise interest income and interest payable in the income statement as they accrue. We recognise dividend 
income in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
Qualifying assets are those that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or 
sale. Finance costs that are directly attributable to constructing a qualifying asset are added to the asset’s cost, 
until the asset is substantially ready for its intended use or sale.
We recognise other borrowing costs in the income statement in the period in which we incur them.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. We recognise tax in the income statement, unless:
• it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity; or
• it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination.
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay (or 
recover), using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with 
any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets 
and liabilities in our financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit. 
We account for deferred tax using the balance sheet liability method.
We generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the 
extent that we will probably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against. We do not 
recognise these assets and liabilities if the temporary difference arises from:
• our initial recognition of goodwill; or
• our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than a business combination) that affects 
neither our taxable profit nor our accounting profit.
We recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference, and 
it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
We calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the 
asset. We charge or credit deferred tax in the income statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, we recognise the fair value of share awards and options granted as an employee expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity. We measure the fair value at the grant date and spread it over the vesting 
period of each option. We use a binomial valuation model to measure the fair value of options, and a Black-Scholes 
valuation model to measure the fair value of share awards. We adjust the amount we recognise as an expense, to 
reflect the estimated performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share awards and 
options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
Treasury shares
We include the transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored Qualifying Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (‘QUEST’) in the Group Financial Statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of the Company’s shares are 
deducted from shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution pension schemes
A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to the 
income statement as they become payable under the scheme rules. We show differences between the contributions 
payable and the amount we have paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The schemes’ assets 
are held separately from those of the Group.

Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees. These schemes are closed to new 
members. We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned, in return for their service to date. We discount that benefit to determine its present 
value, and deduct the fair value of the plan’s assets (at bid price). The liability discount rate we use is the market yield 
at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension 
liabilities. Qualified actuaries perform the calculations, using the projected unit market method.
We recognise actuarial gains and losses directly into equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group 
Statement of Changes in Equity. Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual 
return on scheme assets and experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities.
We recognise pension costs evenly over the service lives of the employees concerned. We allocate any difference 
between the actuarial value of assets and the actuarial value of liabilities over the average remaining service lives of 
current employees.
The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 28 include those relating to the Milk Pension defined benefit 
scheme. Genus and the other participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the scheme’s obligations. We 
account for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts 
we believe we will have to pay under our joint and several liability. The joint and several liability also means we have a 
contingent liability for the scheme’s obligations that we have not accounted for.
Under the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in 
the income statement. After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses in the orphan assets and liabilities 
are recognised directly into equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they 
occur.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk, forward exchange contracts to manage foreign 
exchange risk and forward commodity contracts to manage commodity price risk.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at 
the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap 
counterparties.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the 
balance sheet date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the 
instrument in equity, in the hedging reserve. We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the 
Group Income Statement.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, we recycle 
the associated gains and losses that we had recognised in equity in the Group Income Statement. We do this in the 
same period or periods that the asset or liability affects the Group Income Statement, which are the periods when we 
recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or 
exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point 
remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If we no 
longer expect the hedged transaction to take place, we immediately recognise in the Group Income Statement the 
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
Net investment hedges
Where we have designated a derivative financial instrument as hedging the variability of the net assets of an overseas 
subsidiary, which arises from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the subsidiary’s 
functional currency, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging 
reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge 
relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group Financial Statements. 104

New standards and interpretations
The following new standards and interpretation have been adopted in the current period:
• Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, IFRS 1 ‘Government Loans’, and IFRS 7 ‘Disclosures – Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’;
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other 
Entities’, IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; and
• IAS 27 (2011) ‘Separate Financial Statements’ and IAS 28 (2011) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’, 
‘Improvements to IFRS 2009–2011 Cycle’, ‘Consolidated Financial Statement, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of 
Interest in Other Entities: Transition Guidance’ and IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface 
Mine’.
Except for the amendments to IAS 19, there has been no significant impact on the results or disclosures for the 
current period from the adoption of these new standards and interpretations.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these Group Financial Statements, the following standards and interpretations which 
have not been applied in preparing these Group Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some 
cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’;
• IAS 32 ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ and
• IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no 
material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except as follows:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial 
instruments.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards 
until a detailed review has been completed.
4. Significant areas of judgement and determination of fair values
Management considers the following to be critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement:
Determination of the fair value of biological assets
Determining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires significant judgement and 
assumptions.
Bovine: The key judgements are in respect of the forecast sales volumes, the expected unit prices, the animals’ useful 
lifespan and the discount rate we apply.
Porcine: The key judgements and assumptions are in respect of the animals’ useful lifespan, the proportion that go to 
slaughter, the mix of boars and gilts and, in the case of the animals in the pure line herds, the number of future 
generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices achieved on sales, the animals’ expected useful 
lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate we apply. See note 15.
Fair value of assets and liabilities on business combinations
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to determine the net fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired with the fair value of any consideration in excess of this amount 
representing goodwill. In determining the fair values of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the use of 
significant judgement and assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows and unprovided liabilities and 
commitments, particularly to tax, are often involved.
The determination of the useful life of intangible assets, particularly on those arising on acquisition, involves the 
exercise of management judgement.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets
Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires us to consider any specific 
impairment indicators and to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating units to which we have allocated goodwill, 
intangible and tangible assets. The value in use calculation requires us to estimate the future cash flows arising from the 
cash-generating unit and the appropriate discount rate, in order to calculate present value. See note 14.

Recognition of deferred tax assets
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities, we estimate the likely decisions by tax authorities on transactions and 
events whose tax treatment is uncertain. In recognising deferred tax assets and liabilities, we also make judgements 
about our likely future taxable profits. When the final outcome of such matters, including the recognition of deferred 
tax assets or tax losses, is different or expected to be different from our previous assessments, we record a change to 
the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which we make the determination. See note 19.
Defined benefit pension scheme
Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on 
significant estimates and judgement. Details of the estimates and judgements we made in calculating these 
transactions are contained in note 28. These include estimates and judgements about the extent to which we should 
provide for any amounts that might become payable under our joint and several liability in respect of the Milk Pension 
Fund.
Share-based payments
Amounts recorded in the financial statements in respect of share-based payments are also based on significant 
estimates and judgement. Details of the estimates and judgements we made in calculating these transactions are 
contained in note 29.
5. Segmental information
The Group presents its segmental information on the basis that the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews

Sexing Technologies.
During the prior year, the multi-employer Milk Pension Fund triennial valuation as at 31 March 2012 was completed and 
a new funding agreement between the employers was agreed. In addition, two participating employers exited the 
scheme and made cash payments of £31m. These changes gave rise to an exceptional credit of £7.0m. Also in the 
prior year, we incurred a restructuring charge of £2.8m that related principally to a refocusing of the European 
porcine business as it continued to reduce direct farm operations, whilst widening its restructuring programme in line 
with the Group’s global strategy. 108

Impairment testing for cash-generating units (‘CGU’) containing goodwill
To test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our operating segments. These are the lowest level within the Group at 
which we monitor goodwill for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows:
2014 
£m
2013 
£m
Genus PIC 47.1 44.5
Genus ABS 15.8 16.1
Genus Asia 7.0 7.2
69.9 67.8
We test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
We determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these 
calculations relate to discount rates, growth rates, expected changes to selling prices and direct costs. We have 
estimated the discount rate using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’). Our estimates of changes in 
selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and our expectations of future changes in the market.
We prepare cash flows for the next five years derived from our most recent financial and strategic plans approved by 
management, and extrapolate cash flows beyond this period using estimated growth rates.
We have applied annual growth rates ranging from 0% to 40% to cash flows in the five year financial and strategic 
planning period.
A growth rate of 2.5% (2013: 2.5%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period.
The post-tax WACC of 8.0% (2013: 8.0%) we applied to our cash flow projections equates to a pre-tax rate of 
approximately 11.1% (2013: 11.4%). We risk adjusted the discount rate on a country basis adding between 0% and 16% to 
the WACC as appropriate.
Genus PIC and Genus ABS CGUs are deemed to be significant. The individual country assumptions used to determine 
value in use for these CGUs are:
Adjusted discount rate
Short-term growth rates 
(CAGR) Long-term growth rates
2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013
Genus PIC 11%–14% 11%–13% 3%–15% 0%–15% 2.5% 2.5%
Genus ABS 11%–26% 11%–13% 3%–33% 2%–13% 2.5% 2.5%
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
We believe that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value 
of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

Bovine biological assets include £3.6m (2013: £3.2m) representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but 
managed by the Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties and are therefore treated as assets 
held under finance leases.
There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes 
during the year.
The current market determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull 
semen is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This has been assessed as 8.0% (2013: 8.0%).
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets. Inventories of such semen are 
shown as biological asset harvest in note 20.
Porcine biological assets include £46.2m (2013: £36.9m) relating to the fair value of the retained interest in the 
genetics in respect of animals transferred to customers under royalty contracts. Total revenue in the period includes 
£80.7m (2013: £73.0m) in respect of these contracts comprising £13.6m (2013: £10.6m) on initial transfer of animals to 
customers and £67.1m (2013: £62.4m) in respect of royalties received. Decreases attributable to sales during the 
period of £153.2m (2013: £131.2m) include £32.8m (2013: £28.9m) in respect of the reduction in fair value of the 
retained interest in the genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts. 116

For pure line porcine herds, the net cash flows from the expected output of the herds are discounted at the Group’s 
required rate of return adjusted for the greater risk implicit in including output from future generations. This adjusted 
rate has been assessed as 11.0% (2013: 11.0%). The number of future generations which have been taken into account 
is seven (2013: seven) and their estimated useful lifespan is 1.4 years (2013: 1.4 years).
Included in increases due to purchases is the aggregate gain arising during the period on initial recognition of 
biological assets in respect of multiplier purchases £34.1m (2013: £28.9m).

Bovine
Long-term growth rate in volumes 3% 4% 1% decrease in the growth rate would result in 
approximately a £3.5m reduction in value
Weighted average cost of capital 8% 8% 1% increase in the discount rate would result in 
approximately a £4.0m reduction in value
Porcine
Weighted average cost of capital 8%–11% 8%–11% 1% increase in the discount rate would result in 
approximately a £1.6m reduction in value
Significant increases/(decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower/(higher) fair 
value measurement. These assumptions vary significantly across different countries and species.

19. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses which are available for offset against future profits, with a 
potential tax benefit of £12.4m (2013: £13.3m). We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £1.0m (2013: 
£0.5m) of these benefits. We have not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of the remaining £11.4m (2013: 
£12.8m), due to uncertainty about the availability of future taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.
We have not recognised deferred tax liabilities totalling £4.2m (2013: £4.3m) for the withholding tax and other taxes 
that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries. This is because we can control the 
timing and reversal of these differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
We have offset deferred tax assets and liabilities above, to the extent that they arise in the same tax jurisdiction.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances:

At 30 June 2014 £44.9m (2013: £45.3m) of trade receivables were not yet due for payment.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £18.7m (2013: £18.7m) which 
are past due at the reporting date but which we have not provided for, as there has been no significant change in 
credit quality and we consider the amounts are recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these 
balances. The average age of these receivables is 60 days (2013: 65 days).

base is large and unrelated.
The impairment recognised is the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present 
value of expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Receivables denominated in currencies other than Sterling comprise £21.3m of receivables denominated in US Dollars 
(2013: £18.3m), £14.0m of receivables denominated in Euros (2013: £10.4m) and £23.9m of receivables denominated in

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that Group entities can continue as a going concern, while maximising the 
return to stakeholders by optimising our debt and equity balance. The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 26, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity 
holders of the Parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 30.

Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 26.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Parent.
Externally imposed capital requirement
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.
We have categorised financial instruments held at valuation into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the 
priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable 
inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we base the 
category level on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in 
its entirety. We have estimated the fair values of the Group’s outstanding interest rate swaps by calculating the 
present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value 
measurements as defined by IFRS 7. We have not categorised any financial instruments as Level 1 or Level 3.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates our access to domestic and 
international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Group’s operations, 
through internal risk reports that analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk 
(including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate 
risk.
We seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments. Our use of 
financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial 
instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. The Board of Directors regularly reviews our compliance with 
policies and exposure limits. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an 
annual Board review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk
The principal financial risks our activities expose us to are risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest 
rates and commodity prices. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign 
currency risk and commodity price risk, including:
• forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of 
supplies in foreign currencies;
• interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
• forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.
Foreign currency risk management
We undertake transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We manage any exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations within approved policy parameters, by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to movement in the US Dollar, Euro, Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso exchange rates.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against these currencies. 
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents our assessment of a significant change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only 
outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% 
change in foreign currency rates. It includes external loans, as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group 
where the loan is denominated in a currency other than the lender or borrower’s currency. A positive number below 
indicates an increase in profit when Sterling weakens against the relevant currency. A strengthening of Sterling 
against the relevant currency would produce an equal but opposite impact on profit, and the balances below would 
be negative. The impact on other equity is minimal, due to the net investment hedging in place.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as Group entities borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. We 
manage this risk centrally, by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using 
interest rate swaps. We regularly review our hedging activities, to align with our interest rate views and defined risk 
appetite, thereby ensuring we apply optimal hedging strategies to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in 
interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk 
management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
We have determined the sensitivity analyses below based on the Group’s exposure to interest rates for both 
derivatives and non-derivative instruments, at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the 
analysis assuming the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% 
increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and is our 
assessment of a significant change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the 
year ended 30 June 2014 would decrease or increase by £0.5m (2013: decrease/increase by £0.3m). This impact is 
smaller than would otherwise be the case due to the effects of fixed rate hedging.
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate 
interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of 
changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the variable rate debt we hold. We determine the fair value of 
interest rate swaps at the reporting date by discounting the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting 
date and the credit risk inherent in the contract. This fair value is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based 
on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts 
outstanding as at the reporting date:

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 
3 month LIBOR. We settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts that exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are 
designated as cash flow hedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on 
borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise 
the amount deferred in equity in profit or loss, over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact 
profit or loss. 128

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. We have a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. We regularly monitor our exposure and the 
credit ratings of our counterparties, and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved 
counterparties. Credit exposure on financial instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and 
approved by the Board annually.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. 
We carry out ongoing credit evaluation on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk rests with the Board of Directors. We manage this risk by 
maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and 
by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, 
excluding trade payables and other creditors. We have drawn up these tables based on the undiscounted cash flows 
of financial liabilities, using the earliest date on which we can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and 
principal cash flows.

The Group has financing facilities with a total unused amount of £55.4m (2013: £63.7m) at the balance sheet date. We 
expect to meet our other obligations from operating cash flows and the proceeds of maturing financial assets. We 
expect to reduce the debt to equity ratio as borrowings decrease through repayment from operating cash flows.
The following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. We have drawn up the 
table based on the undiscounted net cash outflows on derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the 
undiscounted gross outflows on derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is 
not fixed, we have determined the amount disclosed by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates, 
as illustrated by the yield curves at the reporting date.

are defined benefit schemes. The assets of these funds are held separately from the assets of the Group and 
administered by trustees and managed professionally. These schemes are closed to new members.
The financial position of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 are aggregated for 
disclosure purposes. The liability split by principal scheme is set out below.

The Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’)
The MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd 
(the principal employer now known as Community Foods Group Limited), National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, 
hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd (which went into receivership in June 2009) and Milk 
Link Ltd.
We have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together 
represent approximately 75% of the MPF (2013: 75%). Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a 
“last man standing scheme”, which means that all participating employers are joint and severally liable for all of the 
fund’s liabilities.
During the prior year, the MPF’s triennial valuation as at 31 March 2012 was completed and the employers agreed a 
new funding agreement. In addition, two participating employers exited the scheme and made cash payments of 
£31m. These changes gave rise to an exceptional credit of £7m. This credit reflected Genus’s share of deficit repair 
contributions agreed in the valuation and the effect of the two employers’ exits.
The valuation used the projected unit method (for future service, a control period of three years was used) and was 
carried out by qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2012 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets 
would be 6.4% per annum before retirement and 4.0% per annum after retirement, and that pensions in payment 
would increase by 3.4% per annum.
At 31 March 2012 the market value of the fund’s assets was £312m. This represented approximately 69% of the value 
of the uninsured liabilities which were £453m at 31 March 2012, after allowing for expected future increases in 
earnings.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2012 valuation, was £141m (of which Genus’s notional 
share was £106m). This shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers and 
the exit payment of £31m made in September 2012 by two employers. Under the new funding agreement, Genus has 
agreed to make deficit repair contributions of between £4.5m and £6.4m per annum between 31 March 2013 and 
31 March 2016, and rising thereafter by 3.4% per annum for a further nine years until 31 March 2026.
With effect from 30 June 2013, Genus’s active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred 
pensioners.
Dalgety Pension Fund (‘DPF’)
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2012. The valuation of the scheme used the projected 
unit method and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2012 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets 
would be 5.2% per annum before retirement and 3.3% per annum after retirement and that the annual increase in 
pensions in payment would be 3.5% per annum.
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2012 was £21.3m. The value of those assets represents 
approximately 99% of the value of the uninsured liabilities which were £21.6m at 31 March 2012. Under the funding 
agreement, the Company will not have to make deficit repair contributions.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate 
calculations carried out as at 31 March 2012 updated to 30 June 2013.
There is an £11.3m reserve held by the Trustees of DPF against future unknown liabilities materialising (‘Restricted 
Fund’). As the economic benefit to Genus of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
Other defined benefit scheme in deficit
The Group operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig 
Development Company Limited. The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2014 under the 
provisions of IAS 19 were £4.5m (2013: £4.3m) and £5.9m (2013: £5.6m), respectively. 132

Other unfunded schemes
When the Group acquired Sygen International plc, it also acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an 
unfunded retirement health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous group’s senior 
employees and executives.
The scheme liabilities for the three unfunded defined benefit schemes amount to £6.1m (2013: £6.6m) based on IAS 
19’s methods and assumptions. This amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group’s balance sheet. Interest 
on pension scheme liabilities amounted to £0.3m (2013: £0.3m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 4.2% (2013: 
4.6%) and that inflation and pension payment increases would be 3.2% per annum (2013: 3.4%).
The scheme liabilities for the unfunded retirement health benefit plan amount to £1.2m (2013: £1.3m), based on IAS 
19’s methods and assumptions. This amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group’s balance 
sheet. Interest on plan liabilities amounted to £0.1m (2013: £0.1m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 4.2% (2013: 4.6%) 
and that the long-term rate of medical expense inflation would be 7.2% (2013: 7.4%).

Actuarial assumptions and sensitivity analysis
Principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date (expressed as weighted averages):
2014 2013
Discount rate 4.2% 4.6%
Expected return on plan assets 6.6% 7.1%
Medical cost trend rate 7.2% 7.4%
Future pension increases and inflation 3.2% 3.4%
The mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the schemes’ actuaries and reflect the 
latest available tables, adjusted for the experience of the scheme where appropriate. For 2014 and 2013, the mortality 
tables used are 90% of the SN1A tables, with birth year and 2011 CMI projections, with mortality rates increased by 
25% at all ages. 134
Genus plc  Annual Report 2014

The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the life expectancy of an average 
member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years’ time.

Female 25.8 25.7
Retiring at age 65 in 20 years’ time:
Male 25.1 25.0
Female 27.7 27.6
The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.6% (2013: 7.1%). The expected long-term rate of return is 
based on the portfolio as a whole and not on the sum of the returns on individual asset categories. The return is 
based exclusively on historical returns, without adjustments.
Duration of benefit obligations
The weighted average duration of the defined benefits obligations at 30 June 2014 is 17.5 years.
Sensitivity analysis
Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The 
sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in 
isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefits obligation as at 30 June 2014.

The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefits obligation as it is 
unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
The sensitivities assume the Fund’s assets remain unchanged, however in practice changes in interest rates and 
inflation will also affect the value of the Fund’s assets. The Fund’s investment strategy aims to hold matching assets 
which should move broadly in line with the liabilities of the Funds so as to protect partially against changes in interest 
rates and inflation.
In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the information has been prepared using the same method as adopted when 
adjusting results of the latest funding valuation to the balance sheet date. This is the same approach as has been 
adopted in previous periods.

Share options
On 12 August 2004 the Group established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and 
other senior employees to purchase shares in the Company. Further grants on similar terms were offered to these 
employee groups as set out below. The terms and conditions of the grants are as set out below. All options are to be 
settled by physical delivery of shares and meet the criteria for being treated as equity settled.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was  
1,309 pence. In the year to 30 June 2014, options were granted on 26 September 2013. The aggregate of the fair 
values of the options granted was £743,700.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is based on the fair value of share options 
granted. We measure this using a binomial model, with the following inputs:
Assumptions applied in valuation models at grant date
2014 2013
Exercise price of options granted in the year (nil for awards) 1,413p 1,344p
Expected volatility (weighted average volatility) 32% 31%
Option life (expected weighted average life) 6.5 years 6.5 years
Expected dividends 1.10% 1.34%
Risk-free interest rate (based on Government bonds) 1.80% 0.95%
We determined expected volatility by calculating the historical volatility of the estimated fair value of the Company’s 
share price over the previous three years. We have adjusted the option life used in the model, based on our best 
estimate of the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 136

of shares or nil cost option awards which will normally vest after three years, with the proportion of the award vesting 
depending on growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share. Further details of the plan’s performance conditions 
are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In the year to 30 June 2014, awards were granted on 26 September 2013 and 14 March 2014, with an aggregate fair 
value of £4,288,000. The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is based on the fair value 
of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

37. Acquisition of subsidiary and related assets
On 18 October 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Génétiporc International Minnesota Inc. [US] and 
Génétiporc Servicios Técnicos, S.A. de C.V. [Mexico], along with specific related assets from Génétiporc Inc. [Canada], 
(collectively “Génétiporc”).
Genus identified that Génétiporc would be a good strategic fit, providing a complementary product portfolio which 
will support our global product development. As a result of the acquisition, we also have a broadened customer base, 
supply chain and multiplier base, to further support growth in our North and Latin American businesses.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.
£m
Intangible assets identified 5.0
Property, plant and equipment 0.2
Biological assets 8.9
Financial assets 3.4
Financial liabilities (2.5)
Total identifiable assets 15.0
Goodwill 7.3
Total consideration 22.3

Deferred consideration 0.1
Cash 22.2
Net cash outflow arising on acquisition of subsidiary
Cash consideration 20.2
Add: overdraft acquired 0.2
20.4
Net cash outflow arising on acquisition of trade and assets 2.0
The goodwill of £7.3m arising from the acquisition consists largely of synergies expected from combining the 
acquired operations with our existing operations. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for 
income tax purposes.
The fair value of the financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £3.4m and a gross contractual 
value of £3.7m. Our best estimate at the acquisition date of the cash flows unlikely to be collected is £0.3m.
Acquisition and integration related costs included within exceptional items amount to £1.7m.
Between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date, Génétiporc contributed £21m of revenue and £1m 
operating profit before tax to the Group. Our Brazilian joint venture, Agroceres also acquired Génétiporc do Brasil in a 
subsequent acquisition, which when combined with our Génétiporc acquisition contributed £1.3m operating profit 
before tax, since acquisition and the balance sheet date.
Due to the transaction’s nature, it is impracticable to obtain the information required to disclose what the Group’s 
revenues and profit would have been, if the acquisition of Génétiporc had been completed on the first day of the 
financial period.
On 30 June 2014, the Group acquired a 50% controlling interest in PIC Italia S.r.l. for a consideration of £0.5m. 142

38. Post balance sheet events
On 14 July 2014, ABS Global, Inc. (‘ABS’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, launched a legal action against 
Inguran LLC (aka Sexing Technologies (‘ST’)), in US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin alleging, 
among other matters, that ST (i) have a monopoly in the processing of sexed bovine semen in the US and (ii) 
unlawfully maintain this monopoly through anticompetitive contractual provisions and the repeated acquisition of 
exclusive patent rights related to semen processing. The legal action aims to remove these barriers and allow free and 
fair competition in the sexed bovine semen processing market (‘ABS Action’). ABS intends to pursue vigorously the 
litigation, in order to seek to enter and compete in this market through its own technology. On the same date, ABS 
also filed an Inter-Partes Review application challenging the validity of one of the ST’s group patents (US Patent No. 
7,195,920) before the US Patent Office. On 29 August 2014 ST filed (i) a Motion to Dismiss the ABS Action and (ii) a 
separate complaint related to the ABS Action in the Southern District of Texas. The matter is ongoing.
On 1 September 2014, Genus completed the acquisition for £6m of Birchwood Genetics Inc., a privately owned boar 
stud operation providing PIC boar semen to mid- and small-sized customers in the US.

39. Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
We have prepared these Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. We have applied the accounting policies consistently 
throughout the current and prior year.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
The Company’s financial statements are included in the Genus plc consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 30 June 2014. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its 
own profit and loss account. The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow 
statement under the terms of FRS 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also exempt under the 
terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other members of the Genus Group.
Fixed assets and depreciation
We state fixed assets at cost, together with any incidental acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. We calculate depreciation on a straight-line basis, to write the assets 
down to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The rates of annual depreciation on tangible 
fixed assets are as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings period of lease
Equipment 3 to 20 years
We review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
We state fixed assets investments at cost less provision for impairment.
Pensions
A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to profit 
and loss as they become payable under the schemes’ rules. We show differences between the contributions payable 
and the amounts actually paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The schemes’ assets are held 
separately from those of the Company.
Certain current and former employees of the Company are members of one of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes, further details of which are given in note 28 of the Group Financial Statements. The schemes are all multi-
employer defined benefit schemes, whose assets and liabilities are held independently from the Group. The Company 
is unable to identify its share of the scheme’s underlying assets and liabilities and therefore accounts for the scheme 
as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Taxation
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, 
using the tax rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
We recognise deferred taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay 
less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
We only recognise deferred taxation assets if we consider it more likely than not that we will have suitable profits 
from which we can deduct the future reversal of the underlying timing differences. Timing differences are differences 
arising between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements, and which are 
capable of reversing in one or more subsequent periods.
We only recognise deferred taxation in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries 
and associates to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
We measure deferred taxation on a non-discounted basis, at the tax rates we expect to apply in the periods in which 
we expect the timing differences to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.

Additional 
Information
Foreign currencies
We record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate ruling at the transaction date or at the contracted rate, if the 
transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. We retranslate monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the prevailing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at 
the forward contract rate. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Treasury shares
The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 38, ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’, which requires us to recognise the assets 
and liabilities associated with the Company’s investment in its own shares in the Company’s financial statements, 
where there is de facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Company’s own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘QUEST’) remain deducted from 
shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Employee share schemes
The Company’s Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers receive part of their remuneration in the form of 
share awards, which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three year period.
We measure the cost of these awards by reference to the shares’ fair value at the award date. At the end of each 
financial reporting period, we estimate the extent to which the performance criteria will be met at the end of three 
years, and record an appropriate charge in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding credit to profit 
and loss reserves. Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit 
and loss account in subsequent periods.
Share-based payments
We have implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with 
subsidiary undertakings under UITF 44, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its 
subsidiary undertakings under an equity-settled arrangement, and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company 
for these rights. Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiary’s 
accounts as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an equal amount.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
We use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. We also use forward foreign currency contracts, implemented 
through a medium-term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap, to hedge exposure to 
translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiary entities. Forward foreign currency contracts do not 
qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not in its balance sheet.
Our use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Group’s policies, which are approved by the Board of 
Directors. The notes to the Group Financial Statements include information about the Group’s financial risks and their 
management, and its use of financial instruments and their impact on the Group’s risk profile, performance and 
financial condition.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to 
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of 
the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the 
present value of the quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or 
liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the 
instrument directly in the hedging reserve. We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the 
profit and loss account.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, then we 
reclassify the associated gains and losses that we had recognised directly in equity into profit or loss. We do this in 
the same period or periods that the asset or liability affects profit or loss, which are the periods when we recognise 
the interest income or expense. 146
Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
Financial Statements
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 30 June 2014
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or 
exercised, or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point 
remains in equity and we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If we no 
longer expect the hedged transaction to occur, we immediately recognise in the profit and loss account the 
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge 
relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We treat derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts as separate derivatives, when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried 
at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses reported in the profit and loss account.
Debt
We initially state debt at the amount of the net proceeds, after deducting issue costs. The carrying amount is 
increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Finance costs
We charge the finance costs of debt to the profit and loss account over the debt term, at a constant rate on the 
carrying value of the debt to which they relate.

Explanatory Notes 
This section contains an explanation of each of the resolutions to be put to the Annual General Meeting. Resolutions 1 to 
15 are ordinary resolutions requiring the approval of a simple majority of shareholders present and voting at the Annual 
General Meeting. Resolutions 16 to 18 are special resolutions requiring the approval of 75% of shareholders present and 
voting at the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 – To receive the Annual Report and Accounts 
Shareholders are invited to approve the Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolutions 2 and 3 – Approval of (i) the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Committee and the Annual Report 
on Remuneration and (ii) the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report 
Under new legislation that came into force in the UK on 1 October 2013, the Company is required to offer an advisory 
vote on the implementation of the Company’s existing remuneration policy in terms of the payments and share awards 
made to Directors during the year (the Annual Statement by the Chairman and the Annual Report on Remuneration) and a 
separate binding vote on the Company’s forward looking remuneration policy (the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report).
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and 
the Annual Report on Remuneration as set out on pages 64 to 65 and 74 to 83 respectively of the Company’s Annual 
Report 2014.
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, which is set out in the first part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report, on pages 66 to 74 of the Company’s Annual Report 2014.

reappointment of the Company’s existing auditor, Deloitte LLP, and follows good practice in giving authority to the Audit

Resolution 13 – Authority to Allot Shares
Resolution 13 is proposed as an ordinary resolution and seeks the approval of shareholders, in accordance with section 
551 of the Act, to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares for a period as stated in resolution 13. The Directors 
have no current intention to exercise this authority and intend to comply with the guidance issued by the Investment 
Management Association. However, if the Directors do exercise this authority, the Directors intend to follow emerging best 
practice as regards to its use. As at the date of this notice, no shares are held by the Company in treasury.
Resolutions 14 and 15 – Incentive Arrangements
The Company’s existing long-term incentive arrangement for the Company’s Executive Directors and other selected 
senior management is the Genus plc 2004 Performance Share Plan (the ‘2004 PSP’). Separately, the Company operates 
the Genus plc 2004 Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘2004 ESOP’) for selected employees, not being Executive 
Directors.
Since their approval by shareholders in August 2004, the 2004 PSP and 2004 ESOP have provided for annual share-
based awards ordinarily vesting (or becoming capable of exercise as relevant) three years from grant, subject to continued 
service and, in respect of the 2004 PSP, to the extent to which objective performance criteria are met over a three-year 
measurement period. Both the 2004 PSP and the 2004 ESOP reached the end of their ten year life on 12 August 2014.
The Committee of the Board of Directors has recently undertaken a review of the Company’s incentive arrangements and 
concluded that shareholder authority be sought for the following: 
• Resolution 14 – the introduction of a new plan to replace the 2004 PSP, the Genus plc 2014 Performance Share Plan 
(the ‘2014 PSP’); and 
• Resolution 15 – the renewal of the 2004 ESOP, to become the Genus plc 2014 Executive Share Option Plan  
(the ‘2014 ESOP’). 
The terms of the 2014 PSP and 2014 ESOP have been designed to materially continue with the existing policy under the 
2004 PSP and the 2004 ESOP but with changes to take account of current best practice expectations and legislative 
changes. 
The features of the proposed 2014 PSP include no increase as to the normal maximum award levels operated under the 
2004 PSP, a 10% in 10 years dilution limit as to the use of new issue shares and an updated sliding scale performance 
condition policy. 
Furthermore, in connection with the implementation of the 2014 PSP, the Committee proposes to introduce a requirement 
that the Company’s Executive Directors will be required to retain their net of tax number of vested shares (if any) delivered 
under the 2014 PSP (or maintain unexercised the full number of the vested shares whilst held under an unexercised nil (or 
nominal) cost option under the 2014 PSP where relevant) for at least two years from point of vesting.
In respect of the 2014 ESOP, amendments have been made from the 2004 ESOP in order to take account of the recent 
changes made to the legislation governing tax-advantaged plans.
A summary of the principal terms of the 2014 PSP and the 2014 ESOP, together with details of the performance condition 
policy proposed for the first awards under the 2014 PSP, is set out in this report. Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
158
Principal Terms of the 2014 PSP
Operation
The Committee of the Board of Directors will supervise the operation of the 2014 PSP.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company and its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the 
2014 PSP at the discretion of the Committee.
It is currently anticipated that participation in the 2014 PSP will be limited to the Company’s Executive Directors and 
selected senior employees.
Grant of Awards 
The Committee may grant awards to acquire Ordinary Shares within six weeks following the Company’s announcement 
of its results for any period. The Committee may also grant awards within six weeks of shareholder approval of the 2014 
PSP or at any other time when the Committee considers there are sufficiently exceptional circumstances which justify the 
granting of awards. 
The Committee may grant awards as conditional share awards or nil (or nominal) cost options. The Committee may also 
decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in 
cash, although it does not currently intend to do so. 
An award may not be granted more than 10 years after shareholder approval of the 2014 PSP.
No payment is required for the grant of an award. Awards are not transferable, except on death. Awards are not 
pensionable.
Individual Limit 
An employee may not receive awards in any financial year over Ordinary Shares having a market value in excess of 200% 
of their annual base salary in that financial year. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, this limit is increased 
to 300% of an employee’s annual base salary.
Performance Conditions
The vesting of awards granted will be subject to performance conditions set by the Committee.
It is proposed that the performance conditions for the first awards under the 2014 PSP to the Company’s Executive 
Directors and senior management will be based on the Company’s earnings per share (‘EPS’) performance over a 
three-year measurement period (three consecutive financial years of the Company, starting with the financial year in  
which the awards are granted – the ‘Performance Period’).
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
159
The following vesting schedule will apply to such first awards:
Growth in EPS over the Performance Period Percentage of Award that shall Vest
Less than 6% per annum (‘p.a.’) 0%
6% p.a. 20%
20% p.a. or better 100%
Between 6% p.a. and 20% p.a. Pro-rata between 20% and 100%
For such purposes, EPS will be calculated on such adjusted basis as the Committee determines appropriate and the per 
annum growth calculations determined by reference to end to end growth over the Performance Period converted into a 
simple per annum average. 
In addition to the above target, the Committee will retain the ability to scale back vesting based on adjusted EPS 
performance if it does not consider the vesting result to be consistent with the progress achieved against the Company’s 
strategy during the Performance Period. 
Within the scope of such approved shareholder remuneration policy from time to time, the Committee can set different 
performance conditions from those described above for future awards to the Company’s Executive Directors provided 
that, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, the new targets are not materially less challenging in the circumstances 
than the conditions described above. 
In addition, the Committee can set different performance conditions from those described above in the case of awards to 
other employees. 
The Committee may also amend the performance conditions applying to existing awards if an event has occurred which 
causes the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the 
Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original 
conditions would have been but for the event in question. 
Vesting of Awards
Awards normally vest three years after grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied 
and provided the participant is still employed in the Company’s Group. Options granted to individuals who are tax resident 
in the UK are then exercisable up until the day before the tenth anniversary of grant (or such other shorter period as 
specified at grant), unless they lapse earlier. Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
160
Dividend Equivalents
The Committee may decide that participants will receive a payment (in cash and/or Ordinary Shares) on or shortly 
following the vesting of their awards, of an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been payable on the 
Ordinary Shares vesting under the award if they had been owned between the date of grant and the vesting of an award. 
This amount may assume the reinvestment of dividends.
Leaving Employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment or be a Director within the 
Company’s Group. However, if a participant ceases to be an employee or a Director because of ill-health, injury or 
disability, retirement, redundancy, their employing company or the business for which they work being sold out of the 
Company’s Group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then their award will normally vest on the 
date when it would have vested if they had not ceased such employment or office. The extent to which an award will vest 
in these situations will depend upon two factors: (i) the extent to which the relevant performance conditions have, in the 
opinion of the Committee, been satisfied over the Performance Period, and (ii) pro-rating of the award to reflect the 
reduced period of time between its grant and vesting, although the Committee can decide not to pro-rate an award if it 
regards it as appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
Alternatively, if a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the Company’s Group for one of the ‘good leaver’ 
reasons specified above, the Committee can decide that their award will vest when they leave, subject to: (i) the relevant 
performance conditions measured at that time; and (ii) pro-rating by reference to the time of cessation as described 
above. Such treatment will also apply in the case of death.
Corporate Events
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation), all awards will 
vest early subject to: (i) the extent that the relevant performance conditions have been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the 
pro-rating of the awards to reflect the reduced period of time between their grant and vesting, although the Committee 
can decide not to pro-rate an award if it regards it as appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a 
new holding company unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on the basis which would apply in the case 
of a takeover.
If a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the 
market price of Ordinary Shares to a material extent, then the Committee may decide that awards will vest on such basis 
as it decides. 
Participants’ Rights 
Awards settled in Ordinary Shares will not confer any shareholder rights until the awards have vested or the options have 
been exercised as relevant and the participants have received their Ordinary Shares. 
Rights Attaching to Shares
Any Ordinary Shares allotted when an award vests or is exercised will rank equally with Ordinary Shares then in issue 
(except for rights arising by reference to a record date prior to their allotment). 
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
161
Variation of Capital
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or in the event of a demerger, payment of a special dividend 
or similar event which materially affects the market price of the Ordinary Shares, the Committee may make such 
adjustment as it considers appropriate to the number of Ordinary Shares subject to an award and/or the exercise price 
payable (if any). 
Overall Limits
The 2014 PSP may operate over new issue Ordinary Shares, treasury shares or Ordinary Shares purchased in the market. 
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than 10% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company under the 2014 PSP and any other employee share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury shares will count as new issue Ordinary Shares for the purposes of these limits unless institutional investors 
decide that they need not count. 
Clawback
The Committee may decide prior to the later of (i) three years following the vesting of an award or (ii) the publication of the 
Company’s third set of audited accounts following the vesting of an award, that the award will be subject to clawback 
where there has been a material misstatement in the Company’s Financial Results, an error in assessing any applicable 
performance condition resulting in a greater level of vesting of an award than was deserved or in the event of cessation of 
service resulting from gross misconduct.
The clawback may be satisfied by way of a reduction in the amount of any future bonus or share award, the vesting of any 
subsisting share awards and/or a requirement to make a cash payment.
Alterations
The Committee may, at any time, amend the 2014 PSP in any respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is 
obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing eligibility, limits on 
participation, the overall limits on the issue of Ordinary Shares or the transfer of treasury shares, the basis for determining 
a participant’s entitlement to, and the terms of, the Ordinary Shares or cash to be acquired and the adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to 
benefit the administration of the 2014 PSP, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable 
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company in the Company’s Group. 
Shareholder approval will also not be required for any amendments to any performance condition applying to an award 
provided that the amendments are made within the scope of the powers of amendment in relation to performance 
conditions referred to earlier in this summary. 
Overseas Plans
The shareholder resolution to approve the 2014 PSP will allow the Board to establish further plans for overseas territories, 
any such plan to be similar to the 2014 PSP, but modified to take account of local tax, exchange control or securities laws, 
provided that any Ordinary Shares made available under such further plans are treated as counting against the limits on 
individual and overall participation in the 2014 PSP.  Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
162
Principal terms of the 2014 ESOP
Operation
The Committee will supervise the operation of the 2014 ESOP. The 2014 ESOP has the facility to grant both UK tax-
advantaged options and options which are not tax-advantaged.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company and its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the
2014 ESOP at the discretion of the Committee. It is currently intended that options will only be granted under the 2014
ESOP to employees who are not Executive Directors. It is not anticipated that Executive Directors will participate in the 
2014 ESOP as part of ongoing remuneration policy and should this intention change it would require an amendment to 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report being proposed for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting. The 
intended purpose of the 2014 ESOP is to provide the Company with flexibility to compete on a global basis for the best 
executive talent. It remains market practice in certain geographies where the Company operates (e.g. North America) and 
at certain employee levels in the Company’s businesses to offer market value options as part of remuneration packages 
and so flexibility is to be retained to do so through the use of the 2014 ESOP subject to shareholder approval. 
Grant of Options
The Committee may grant options to acquire Ordinary Shares within six weeks following the Company’s announcement 
of its results for any period. The Committee may also grant options within six weeks of shareholder approval of the 2014 
ESOP or at any other time if the Committee considers there are exceptional circumstances which justify the granting of 
options.
An option may not be granted more than 10 years after shareholder approval of the 2014 ESOP. 
No payment is required for the grant of an option. Options are not transferable, except on death. Options are not 
pensionable.
Individual Participation
An employee may not receive options in any financial year over Ordinary Shares with a market value exceeding 100% of 
their annual base salary in that financial year. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, this limit is increased to 
150% of an employee’s annual base salary.
If an option is granted under the tax-advantaged addendum to the 2014 ESOP the market value of the Ordinary Shares 
subject to the option cannot exceed £30,000 (or such other limit as specified in the legislation from time to time), together 
with any other option granted by the Company under a plan which is intended to comply with Schedule 4 to the Income 
Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. 
Option Price
The price per Ordinary Share payable upon exercise of an option will not be less than:
(a) the middle market price of an Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the dealing day immediately before 
the date of grant (or such other dealing day(s) as the Committee may decide); and
(b) if the option relates only to new issue Ordinary Shares, the nominal value of an Ordinary Share.
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
163
Performance Conditions
The Committee can grant options under the 2014 ESOP with or without performance conditions. Any grant of options to 
the Executive Directors would be subject to suitably challenging performance conditions within the scope of such 
approved shareholder remuneration policy from time to time.
The Committee may vary any performance conditions applying to existing options if an event occurs which causes the 
Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend such performance conditions, provided the Committee 
considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions 
would have been but for the event in question.
Exercise of Options
Options will normally become capable of exercise three years after grant, to the extent any performance conditions have 
been satisfied, provided the participant remains employed in the Company’s Group. Options will lapse on the day before 
the tenth anniversary of the date of grant or after such shorter period as determined by the Committee at the time of 
grant. 
Ordinary Shares will be allotted or transferred to participants within 30 days of exercise. The Committee can decide to 
satisfy options which are not tax-advantaged by the payment of a cash amount or Ordinary Shares equal in value to the 
gain made on the exercise of the option. It is not, however, the Company’s current intention to use this facility.
Leaving Employment
As a general rule, an option will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment or be a Director within the 
Company’s Group. However, if a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the Company’s Group by reason of 
their death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, their employing company or the business for which they work being 
sold out of the Company’s Group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then their option will 
become exercisable on the date of their cessation and remain exercisable for a limited period thereafter. The extent to 
which an award will vest in these situations will depend upon two factors: (i) unless the Committee determines otherwise, 
the extent to which the performance conditions (if any) have, in the opinion of the Committee, been satisfied at that time, 
and (ii) pro-rating of the option to reflect the reduced period of time between its grant and vesting, although the 
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an option if it regards it as appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
Performance conditions would always continue to apply in the case of any grants to Executive Directors.
Corporate Events
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation) all options will 
become exercisable early subject to: (i) unless the Committee determines otherwise, the extent that the performance 
conditions (if any) have been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the pro-rating of the options to reflect the reduced period of time 
between their grant and vesting, although the Committee can decide not to pro-rate an option if it regards it as 
appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. Performance conditions would always continue to apply in the case 
of any grants to Executive Directors.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, options will be replaced by equivalent new options over Ordinary 
Shares in a new holding company unless the Committee decides that options should become exercisable on the basis 
which would apply in the case of a takeover as described above. 
If a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the 
market price of Ordinary Shares to a material extent, then the Committee may decide that awards will vest on the basis 
which would apply in the case of a takeover as described above. Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
164
Variation of Capital
In the event of any variation in the Company’s share capital, the Committee may make such adjustment as it considers 
appropriate to the number of Ordinary Shares under option and the price payable on the exercise of an option.
Rights Attaching to Shares
Any Ordinary Shares allotted when an option is exercised will rank equally with Ordinary Shares then in issue (except for 
rights arising by reference to a record date prior to their allotment).
Overall Limits
The 2014 ESOP may operate over new issue Ordinary Shares, treasury shares or Ordinary Shares purchased in the 
market.
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than 10% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company under the 2014 ESOP and any other employee share plan adopted by the 
Company. 
Treasury shares will count as new issue Ordinary Shares for the purposes of these limits unless the institutional investors 
decide that they need not count. 
Alterations 
The Committee may, at any time, amend the provisions of the 2014 ESOP in any respect, provided that the prior approval 
of shareholders is obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing 
eligibility, limits on participation, the overall limits on the issue of Ordinary Shares or the transfer of treasury shares, the 
basis for determining a participant’s entitlement to, and the terms of, the Ordinary Shares or cash to be acquired and the 
adjustment of options.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to 
benefit the administration of the 2014 ESOP, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable 
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company in the Company’s Group. Prior 
shareholder approval will also not be required for any amendment to performance conditions applying to an option under 
the 2014 ESOP provided that the amendments are made within the scope of the powers of amendment in relation to 
performance conditions referred to earlier in this summary.
Overseas Plans
The shareholder resolution to approve the 2014 ESOP will allow the Board, without further shareholder approval, to 
establish further plans for overseas territories, any such plan to be similar to the 2014 ESOP, but modified to take account 
of local tax, exchange control or securities laws, provided that any Ordinary Shares made available under such further 
plans are treated as counting against the limits on individual and overall participation in the 2014 ESOP.

Resolution 16 – Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights 
Resolution 16, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks the approval of shareholders, pursuant to the 
provisions of section 570 of the Act, to waive the statutory pre-emption rights applicable to the allotment of equity 
securities for cash. The Directors’ existing authority expires at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Directors 
have no current intention to exercise this authority and the Directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the issued 
share capital of the Company for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis in any rolling three-year period without prior 
consultation with shareholders and the Investment Committees of the Investment Management Association and the 
National Association of Pension Funds. Resolution 16 is conditional on resolution 13 being passed.
Resolution 17 – Authority to Purchase Own Shares 
Resolution 17, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks authority for the Company to purchase up to 10% of 
its Ordinary Shares at, or between, the minimum and maximum prices specified in this resolution. This power would be 
used only after careful consideration by the Directors, having taken into account market conditions prevailing at that time, 
the investment needs of the Company, its opportunities for expansion and its overall financial position. The Directors 
would exercise the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares only if they considered it to be in the best interests of 
shareholders as a whole and if the purchase could be reasonably expected to result in an increase in earnings per share.
Under the Act, the Company is allowed to hold its own shares in treasury following buyback, instead of cancelling them 
as previously required. Such shares may be resold for cash or used to satisfy share options and share awards under the 
Company’s share incentive schemes but all rights attaching to them, including voting rights and any right to receive 
dividends, are suspended whilst they are held in treasury. If the Directors exercise the authority conferred by resolution 17, 
the Company will have the option of holding repurchased shares in treasury. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are 
held by the Company in treasury. 
At 3 October 2014, options were outstanding to subscribe for 1,519,480 Ordinary Shares, representing 2.5% of the issued 
share capital at that date. If the full authority to purchase such shares (existing and sought) was exercised, they would 
represent 2.8% of the Company’s issued share capital as at that date (assuming there have been no other changes to 
issued share capital in the meantime). The authority sought at the Annual General Meeting will expire at the conclusion of 
the next Annual General Meeting, or 18 months from the date of this resolution (whichever is earlier).
Resolution 18 – Notice Period for General Meetings 
Resolution 18, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks the approval of shareholders to reduce to 14 clear 
days the notice period required for a general meeting. Changes made to the Act by the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) 
Regulations 2009 increase the notice period required for general meetings (other than annual general meetings) to 21 
days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days. Annual 
General Meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice. It is intended that the shorter notice period 
would not be used as a matter of routine for general meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of 
the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of the shareholders as a whole. If given, the approval will be effective until 
the Company’s next Annual General Meeting. Genus plc  Annual Report 2014

General Notes
This notice is being sent to all members and to any person nominated by a member of the Company under section 146 of 
the Act 2006 to enjoy information rights. Information regarding the Annual General Meeting, including the information 
required by section 311A of the Act, is available from www.genusplc.com.
A copy of the draft rules of the 2014 PSP and the 2014 ESOP will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
offices and at the offices of New Bridge Street (an Aon Hewitt Ltd company) at 10 Devonshire Square, EC2M 4YP during 
normal business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and English public holidays excepted) until the close of the Annual 
General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the Annual 
General Meeting.
Members will find an attendance card and a form of proxy enclosed with this notice. If you are attending the Annual  
General Meeting, you should bring the attendance card with you. Only holders of Ordinary Shares, or their duly appointed 
representatives, are entitled to attend, vote and speak at the Annual General Meeting. Any member so entitled may 
appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and to vote instead of him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company 
but must attend the Annual General Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint one or more proxies are set out 
in the notes to the proxy form. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise 
rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one 
share. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or 
against the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. 
Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the 
Annual General Meeting.
To be valid, a duly executed form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting together, if appropriate, with the power 
of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a duly certified copy of such power or authority must be 
deposited at the offices of Equiniti Registrars, Freepost RTHJ-CLLL -KBKU, Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road, 
LANCING, BN99 8LU at least 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the Annual General Meeting or any 
adjournment thereof. Alternatively, proxies may be appointed by having an appropriate CREST message transmitted, if 
you are a user of the CREST system (further details are below). In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy 
form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the 
company.
Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending the Annual General Meeting and 
voting in person if they wish to do so.
The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who 
have been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Act 
(‘nominated persons’). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered member who hold 
shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons 
do not have such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions 
to the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.

Notes
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered 
on the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is 
6.00pm on 12 November 2014 (or if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, members on the register of members not 
later than 6.00pm on the day that is two working days prior to the reconvened Annual General Meeting). Changes to 
entries on the register of members after the relevant time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend or vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Copies of contracts of service and letters of appointment between the Directors and the Company will be available for 
inspection at the Registered Office of the Company during normal business hours until the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting, and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the Annual General 
Meeting until its conclusion.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may 
do so for this Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 November 2014 at 11.00am and any adjournment(s) thereof by 
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual found on the Euroclear website www.euroclear.com. CREST 
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting 
service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be 
valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with 
Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as 
described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be 
received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of 
Annual General Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK 
and Ireland Limited do not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system 
timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the 
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has 
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action 
as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In 
this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, as amended.
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all 
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares. Genus plc  Annual Report 2014

Notes
As at 3 October 2014 (being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice), the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 60,920,895 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are held by the 
Company in treasury. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to one vote at a General Meeting of the Company and, 
therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 3 October 2014 is 60,920,895. The Company’s website, 
referred to above, will include information on the number of shares and voting rights.
Under section 319A of the Act, the Company must answer any question a member asks relating to the business being 
dealt with at the Annual General Meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for 
the Annual General Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; the answer has already been given on a 
website in the form of an answer to a question; or it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of 
the Annual General Meeting that the question be answered.
Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to 
require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s 
Accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General 
Meeting; or (ii) any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous 
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company may 
not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 
528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must 
forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the 
website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the Company 
has been required under section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
In order for the voting preferences of all shareholders including those who cannot attend the meeting but who validly 
appoint a proxy, to be taken into account, a poll will be conducted on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting this 
year. Each shareholder and proxy present at the Meeting will be invited to complete a poll card indicating how they wish 
to cast their votes in respect of each resolution. The results of the voting will be posted on the Company’s website after 
the meeting. Except as provided above, members who have general queries about the Annual General Meeting should

In recent years the Group has begun a 
significant transformation in the scope 
of our business, applying our core 
skills in new markets where we believe 
we can both grow and deliver high 
value.
In the UK our Support Services 
business, as well as taking steps to 
improve customer value, efficiency and 
margins in our existing markets, has 
invested in extending our management 
skills into new areas of outsourcing 
activity. During this last year, for 
example, we started up our innovative 
partnership serving the Department 
for Work and Pensions in its Work 
Programme, and are now shortlisted  
 
in bidding to support the Ministry of 
Justice in its framework programme for 
management of offenders.
Overseas we have invested in 
developing the scope of business 
activities in our existing high growth 
markets as well as extending into major 
new territories – such as Saudi Arabia, 
India and the USA.
We believe the ongoing opportunities 
for continuing this transformation of 
our business - both in the UK and 
overseas - provide significant upside 
potential in the medium and long term, 
notwithstanding the ongoing economic 
uncertainties. This is the primary 
engine for achieving our growth 
ambitions.
Managing long-term client 
relationships is a major strength 
and one of the key ingredients in the 
excellent forward visibility of our future 
workload. The actions we have been 
taking in Support Services should 
continue to improve margins. There 
are also indications that the recovery 
in Equipment Services’ international 
markets, begun in the second half of 
2011, will now be maintained. Together 
we anticipate these developments 
can more than offset the short-term 
impact on Construction’s performance 
resulting from the current margin and 
volume pressures.
“ I am pleased to report a year of significant 
achievement and progress for Interserve. 
 In continued difficult markets we have  
delivered growing earnings, strong cash flows 
and an improved order book. At the same 
time we have undertaken significant new 
developments towards our strategic objectives 
to grow shareholder value.”

Chairman’s statement
Doing the important things well 
This year I am reporting separately on 
the role and effectiveness of the Board 
in our Corporate Governance review. 
However, on behalf of the Board I 
would like to thank all of our people 
for their continued commitment and 
for their willingness to go the extra 
mile in delivering outstanding service 
to our customers. The success of 
our business is founded on having 
the right people and supporting 
them in their development. One of 
our key programmes identifies and 
develops the people who will form 
the core of our senior leadership 
in the years to come. We offer all 
our people a wealth of training and 
development opportunities including 
apprenticeships and a ‘Skills for Life’ 
numeracy and literacy programme. We 
also run return-to-work schemes for 
the long-term unemployed. 
Reflecting our confidence in the 
medium-term prospects and in our 
strategy for developing the Group, 
we are recommending an increased 
final dividend of 13.0p (2010: 12.4p), 
bringing the total dividend for the year 
to 19.0p (2010: 18.0p), an increase of 
5.6 per cent. The final dividend will be 
paid on 24 May 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 10 April 2012.

DuCAB-Hv 
To satisfy the UAE’s continued  
development and demand for power, the  
region had become dependent on imported  
cables.  How did we help to address this  
issue, using entirely local resources?   
DUCAB-HV is a joint venture comprising three key national 
stakeholders. It was established to develop a high-voltage cable 
manufacturing plant in Jebel Ali, 35km south-west of Dubai.   
The £40 million construction project has been delivered entirely 
through our associate company in the UAE, Khansaheb Civil 
Engineering. Located on a 22,000m² waterfront area the 
development consists of factory buildings, offices, an extra-high-
voltage test laboratory, utility buildings, two large substations 
housing 19 transformers and associated infrastructure. At 
the heart of the facility are two cable-manufacturing towers 
approximately 45m and 150m (44 storeys) high respectively, 
making this what is believed to be the tallest industrial 
structure in the region. Unlike other high-rises, the buildings 
are each effectively just one large ‘core’, with slabs inside the 
structure rather than around it. Building them involved a unique 
construction process, enabled by the design expertise of our 
Equipment Services division and the use of its “Tru-Lift” self-
lifting core-forming system for the first time in the Middle East.
The completed Ducab High Voltage Cable Systems plant can 
now manufacture enough high-voltage cables to meet the 
demands of the whole UAE and the wider Gulf region in times 
to come. Its main customers include the utilities providers, big 
industrial users of cables, and oil and gas companies. 
This substantial project has provided an essential facility for the 
region and demonstrates our ability to deliver local projects with 
local expertise and our continued commitment to commercial 
growth in the Gulf.

Albert Bridge is one of only 12 bridges  
across the Thames in central London,  
used by 16,000 vehicles a day.  How did  
we keep the bridge open when corrosion  
threatened its permanent closure?
Located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, 
Albert Bridge has been a vital transport link - and London 
landmark - since 1870. The 220m-long structure was beautiful 
but not strong, and had been subject to traffic load restrictions 
for much of its life. To stay open, new regulations demanded an 
upgrade from its 2-tonne limit to 7.5 tonnes. Interserve took on 
this challenge. 
A 3-D analysis of the structure revealed the corrosion to be 
even more severe than previous assessments suggested. We 
needed a strengthening and repair solution that would both 
save the bridge and overcome a number of constraints. These 
included limitations on materials and strengthening details imposed 
by the Grade II* listed status and handling of contaminated 
waste including existing lead paint. We also had to ensure that 
Londoners could go about their business around us, including 
working over and adjacent to other works and keeping the 
bridge open to pedestrians throughout the repairs.
The repair programme involved several key stakeholders 
including Transport for London, the Port of London Authority 
and English Heritage. We made 750 separate steelwork repairs 
and replaced the entire running surface with new steelwork. We 
then repainted the bridge (three coats of paint in seven different 
colours) and replaced the old electrical fittings with over 4,000 
lights and more than 6km of cabling.
The work was completed with minimum disruption and we 
are proud to have restored this historic bridge to its original 
splendour, fit for modern-day use and for generations to come. BUsINEss REvIEw

“we can be proud of the level of workmanship in the restoration of 
Albert Bridge. It proved even more challenging than we originally 
thought as… we discovered much worse corrosion to the iron and steel.
t he amount of work… has been truly monumental with over 10,000 
bolts, 40,000 litres of paint and 1,000 tonnes of grit used.
I hope that residents and all bridge-users now appreciate the need 
for the work we carried out – for surely, when lit up, the Albert Bridge 
is one of the most beautiful night-time sights in l ondon.”

Mining iron ore requires significant upfront  
investment in infrastructure and the speed  
of return on the capital outlay is critical.  
so how do you help get a new mine ready  
for operations in the shortest time possible  
– especially when it’s 1,500km away from  
your nearest branch?
With an estimated value of $5.2 billion, CITIC Pacific’s SINO Iron 
project is the largest magnetite mining and processing facility in 
Australia. Time is money and CITIC has deadlines to meet whilst 
building the mine. At peak construction there were around 4,000 
people on site. 
We were awarded the contract based on the excellent 
productivity levels of our Alshor Plus falsework system in 
conjunction with our formwork designs. These were used to 
speed up construction of the ‘Area 20 Concentrator Stockpile 
Tunnel’. The main core of this tunnel is approximately 325m long, 
with six 55m feeder tunnels running perpendicular to the core 
and two approach tunnels each 40m long.
Our greatest challenge, however, was the logistics involved in 
getting materials and equipment to the mine. The project is 
located at Cape Preston, 100km from the nearest town and 
1,500km from our Perth depot. Perth sourced equipment from 
throughout Australia and our worldwide network of depots, and 
delivered it in time to meet the client’s strict time frames on the 
build.
When construction on the mine is completed it will produce in 
the region of 140 million tonnes of magnetite each year. We are 
delighted with the role we have played in getting the site ready 
for operation on time.

British military bases are located all over  
the world, defending our overseas  
territories and playing a major role in  
global security.  But who takes care of  
the essential services the military needs  
to carry out its role protecting us?
Interserve has been trusted for a number of years to support 
British military bases on Ascension Island, Cyprus and the 
Falklands on behalf of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation 
(DIO) - part of the MoD responsible for managing and maintaining 
the military estate. Our record in delivering mechanical, electrical 
and building-related support services gives more than 50,000 
personnel the reassurance that they’ll always receive the specialist 
support they need, sometimes in very challenging circumstances. 
Our ability to respond to emergencies and unexpected changes is 
fundamental to the peace of mind we provide.  
Our strong track record and in-depth understanding of both the 
requirements of the serving soldier and the MoD were key factors 
when we won a new set of contracts in 2011 to continue our work 
in these locations and to take on similar activities in Gibraltar as 
well. The contracts are worth some £300 million over five years 
with the possibility of extensions for two more. 
In addition to our core support services, in Gibraltar we will also 
deliver additional specialist marine work and nuclear services. 
On Ascension Island our extended role includes provision of 
facilities management services including logistics, catering, aircraft 
handling, flight planning and site security. 
Equally important for the MoD, we are providing value for money 
and delivering ‘More for Less’. By delivering a single, strategic, UK-
based management structure and a bundled package of services 
for all the territories, we have created efficiencies and significant 
cost savings to the DIO. BUsINEss REvIEw

c hief executive Adrian r ingrose discusses some of the topics 
most frequently raised by shareholders. 
Adrian Ringrose Chief Executive
Q. How has Interserve performed  
in 2011?
A. I think we can feel proud of what 
Interserve has achieved for shareholders 
in 2011.
We continued to make excellent progress 
in increasing the margins in Support 
Services and are on track to reach our 
target for the division of 5 per cent by the 
end of 2013. Construction has done well 
both in the UK and internationally in a 
tough market where margin pressure and 
increased competition have had an effect. 
Equipment Services is emerging from 
the bottom of the cycle in good shape, 
maintaining healthy margins and a good 
return on capital employed.
We’ve also had a successful year for new 
business – we won more work than we 
consumed in revenue, with the result that 
our future workload rose from £5.3 billion 
to £5.6 billion.
Where we’ve needed to, we have 
reduced costs. But we have also 
continued investing for future 
development where we can see new 
opportunities – for instance in the justice 
sector, in welfare and in local government. 
It has been pleasing to see our 
performance reflected in a 39 per cent 
increase in our share price at a time when 
the FTSE 250 index fell by 13 per cent.

c hief executive’s
Q&A 
Q. How do you see the u K 
construction market developing?
A. We expect to see a further decline 
in the short term before an upturn in 
volume, probably from 2014. Our ability 
to maintain a fundamentally healthy 
business through this period is due in 
large part to our focus on sectors and 
clients with long-term construction needs 
and to the strong reputation we have built 
for quality and value for money.
Q. w here do you see the 
opportunities in the middle East?
A. Qatar is our largest overseas market, 
where we focus on civil engineering, 
building and engineering services. 
We’ve been there since 1996 and have 
a workforce of over 10,000 people. 
Qatar offers strong growth prospects: its 
investment in natural gas gives it a very 
secure financial base and the resources 
to back development for many years 
to come. In addition, hosting the World 
Cup in 2022 provides a renewed focus 
on infrastructure, generating new road, 
rail and port schemes and investment in 
power, water and drainage. Interserve is 
a key provider in many of these areas and 
we anticipate that we’ll see the impact 
of these requirements from 2013 and 
onward.
In Saudi Arabia our start-up Equipment 
Services business has had a good 
first couple of years and this provides a 
strong platform from which to explore 
further opportunities. The Kingdom is 
the largest projects market across the 
Gulf Co-operation Council, accounting for 
45 per cent of the total, and has ambitious 
construction and infrastructure plans.
Q. t here has been talk of the u K 
government’s need to outsource 
more in order to cut costs without 
having too great an impact on front-
line services. Are you seeing this 
translate into reality?
A. The pace of change is variable. We are 
seeing exciting developments in welfare 
and justice; health could be another 
growth opportunity, while the picture in 
local government is more fragmented. 
Overall, we continue to see UK public 
services as a good area for growth.
As part of our strategy we have identified 
several areas where we can apply our 
management capabilities in new sectors 
to generate additional business. In 2011 
we won two regions in the Department 
for Work and Pensions’ (DWP’s) Work 
Programme, and in January 2012 we 
were selected by the Ministry of Justice 
(MoJ) in its new framework for the 
provision of custodial services. The 
MoJ has indicated that it has broader 
outsourcing plans, and our involvement 
has the potential to lead to activity in 
further areas such as the delivery of 
probation services. We are seeing further 
opportunities emerge as the health, 
local government and defence markets 
develop.
Q. Has the business reached the  
end of cost cutting?
A. We always have to look for ways to 
improve efficiency and deliver better 
value to our customers – that’s part of 
why they choose us to work with them. 
In addition we did, correctly as it turns 
out, anticipate the pressures on some 
of our businesses from the recession 
and take the necessary action to reduce 
our fixed costs in good time. However, 
that has not stopped us investing in 
new opportunities. Our markets offer 
the potential for sustained medium-
term growth at attractive margins and 
it is important that, while making any 
necessary cost savings, we hold our 
shape to enable us to capitalise on  
these opportunities as they emerge. 
 
Q. You said last year that you 
believed Interserve had the 
capability to double earnings per 
share over a five-year period.  
Does that still stand?
A. Yes. We have come through the  
last two years well, our existing  
markets have good potential, we are 
exploiting new markets and we have  
a strong balance sheet to support  
our growth. Our medium-term  
prospects remain strong.
“o ur markets offer the potential for sustained 
medium-term growth at attractive margins.”

Our support service activities in the 
Middle East have previously been 
reported within our Construction 
segment. In view of the increasing scale 
of these operations we have moved them 
into our Support Services results (the 
2010 figures have been adjusted to the 
same basis – see note 3 to the financial 
statements).
Operational efficiencies in Support 
Services delivered a further significant 
improvement in contribution to t otal 
Operating Profit, despite flat revenue. 
as usual in this business the profit 
was somewhat second-half weighted, 
although we anticipate that there will 
be less difference between the first and 
second-half margins – which were 3.1 per 
cent and 4.1 per cent respectively – once 
the gains from our margin-improvement 
programme are fully achieved. business review

t here were three main contributors to our 
margin-improvement programme: first, 
the integration of our Security operation 
into our Commercial business, which has 
had an important impact on the indirect 
cost base; second, we have continued 
to make significant improvements to 
procurement; and third, we have further 
developed systems and procedures to 
increase productivity across our major 
contracts.
t he u K market for outsourced services is 
not yet exhibiting the full growth potential 
that was expected to result from the 
government’s austerity programme and 
from continued private sector efficiency 
drives. While there is still a reasonable 
flow of opportunities, we have not yet 
seen the anticipated shift in thinking, 
particularly among local authorities, that 
will lead to a more structural approach to 
outsourcing as a way to maintain services 
while addressing costs. Meanwhile clients 
seek to restrain discretionary spend, 
resulting in some volume pressure.
However, we believe that the rise in 
demand for services from a growing and 
ageing population will accelerate the 
long-term trend towards public services 
outsourcing, and we continue to see 
good potential in this market given the 
limited number of service providers with 
our ability to deliver full-scope, integrated 
services contracts. Opportunities 
such as the MoJ’s custodial services 
framework show that there is an appetite 
for innovation in the public sector and we 
are actively pursuing such new business 
streams. Equally, in the private sector 
we continue to see growing evidence of 
clients seeing the benefit of outsourcing, 
albeit the operating models through 
which opportunities arise are more varied.
t he Work Programme is another example 
of government seeking to gain the 
benefits of competition and payment 
by results, and one in which we were 
successful in 2011. t he DWP took the 
decision to replace all existing welfare-
to-work programmes with a regionally-
based series of contracts in which the 
successful bidders would be responsible 
for delivering vocational training, skills 
development and employment-focused 
support to the long-term unemployed. 
We were successful, in our joint venture 
with r ehab Group, an Irish charity, in 
winning both the Wales and south-west 
England contracts, which last for five 
years and are worth approximately 
£130 million in aggregate.
Other significant uK contract wins 
include: contracts with the Defence 
Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) 
supporting the military bases in Cyprus, 
the Falkland Islands, ascension Island 
and Gibraltar, worth £300 million over five 
years with possible two-year extensions; 
a £108 million, two-year extension to  
our South East r egional Prime contract, 
also with the DIO; a three-year extension 
to our t otal Facilities Management 
contract with the London Borough  
of Croydon, worth £30 million; and a 
three-year contract to clean William Hill’s 
retail estate.
Internationally, our success was led by 
industrial services work in Qatar. Dolphin 
Energy awarded us a five-year contract 
for maintenance services at its r as Laffan 
plant and for supplying management, 
manpower and equipment both there and 
at its offshore platforms and pipelines. 
We added infrastructure maintenance 
services to our existing five-year contract 
with Qatar Shell Gt L and, since the year 
end, have won a place on its three-year 
Plant Change Construction Services 
framework agreement (with a two-year 
extension option).
t he award of these and other contracts 
means that the division’s future workload 
grew from £4.0 billion to £4.2 billion 
during the course of the year, and our 
confidence is further underpinned 
by additional identified opportunities 
of around £7 billion. We are further 
developing our activities in the Middle 
East, where the economic progress of

generating requirements for outsourced

into other regions where we can combine 
the expertise gained from our outsourcing 
experience with our knowledge of the 
local markets gained through our other 
operational divisions.

t he majority of the division’s uK work 
comes from low-risk projects with long-
standing clients, and over three-quarters 
of this activity is in the public and utilities 
sectors. In the Middle East, where we 
have been active for over 30 years, our 
client base is more oriented towards the 
private sector. However, with the support 
of our local joint-venture partners, our 
associate businesses are characterised 
by the same focus on developing long-

t he uK business performed creditably 
in a very competitive environment, 
particularly given that the comparative 
year of 2010 was, by some way, a record. 
t he drop in contribution to u K t otal 
Operating Profit reflects the reduced 
profitability of projects contracted since 
the downturn, when competitive pressure 
had increased. With stable volumes, 
the margin, at 2.5 per cent, is returning 
towards the levels we would expect over 
the longer term.
2011 was a year of success and 
innovation by our education team. We 
handed over both the £77 million flagship 
Sandwell College (see inset) in West 
Bromwich for up to 10,000 students, and 
the £32 million Leeds West academy, 
which incorporates many sustainability 
features and has achieved a provisional 
Br EEaM ‘Excellent’ rating. Leeds is 
also the location for two groundbreaking 
projects won during the year: at Leeds 
East academy we shall use our innovative 
modular “PodSolve” construction 
technique, which saves a quarter of the 
construction cost and can be applied to 
both new and retrofit buildings; and we 
shall be building r ichmond Hill Primary 
School to Passivhaus standards – one of 
the first such schools in the u K. During 
2011 we completed the first certified, 
carbon-neutral, Passivhaus, commercial 
office to be built in the u K: our own 
regional office in Leicester.
We have a long and successful 
association with the health sector. 
By the end of 2011 we had been 
awarded 13 contracts, worth an 
aggregate £180 million, under the 
new ProCure21+ framework. Projects 
awarded during the year included a 
£19 million r esearch, Innovation, 
Learning and Development Centre in 
Exeter and appointment by n ottingham 
university Hospitals n HS t rust as 
preferred Principal Supply Chain 
Partner until 2016. We have been 
similarly successful in the Welsh health 
framework, and, in January 2012, were 
named as a partner in all three regions in 
its successor, Designed for Life: Building 
for Wales 2, which lasts for four years 
with a possible two-year extension.
among our infrastructure projects we 
completed the challenging refurbishment 
of the historic albert Bridge (see case 
study, page 10) in London and reopened 
it to vehicles in December following 
nearly two years of intensive work. Both 
our technical expertise and our project 
management skills were vital in restoring 
the Grade II* listed bridge to its former 
glory while maintaining passage for the 
busy river traffic.

Looking forward, we expect that the 
u K construction market will continue to 
recede during 2012 and into 2013, before 
beginning to grow again from 2014. It is 
likely that the emphasis of government 
spending will shift towards infrastructure 
in the shorter term and that the private 
sector, particularly in south-east England,  
will begin to recover before the public 
sector. We are well-positioned in key 
sectors and are managing our resources 
flexibly so that we shall be able to 
respond swiftly as and when the market 
returns to growth. Significantly, our u K 
Construction future workload stands 
at £1.2 billion, slightly higher than the 
£1.1 billion at the end of 2010.
International 
t he majority of our international earnings 
are generated from our associate 
businesses in the Middle East. Both 
volumes and profits were affected by 
increased caution on the part of our 
clients as the global economy adjusts to 
new patterns of demand. n evertheless 
we made good progress with our 
development plans. We acquired an 
interiors business, n oorco, in Qatar to 
augment our capabilities in interior fit-out 
and we continue to explore other potential 
growth avenues across the region.
We won a number of sizeable contracts 
in Qatar, our largest market, with a 
mixture of new and long-standing clients. 
t hese included two major construction 
contracts at r as Laffan Industrial 
City, worth £70 million together, for 
infrastructure in the processing and gas 
supply markets, a project with n akilat 
for the construction of support facilities 
at a shipyard also at r as Laffan, and 
a contract for the design, construction 
and maintenance of a new fitness centre 
at the world-leading sports tourism 
destination, aspire Zone, Doha.
t he ua E is a regional hub for transport 
and a range of business services.  
Despite the current surplus of 
residential property, demand for hotel 
accommodation remains high with hotels 
operating at greater than 80 per cent 
occupancy (source: Ernst & Young). 
t he hospitality and leisure sector was 
an important contributor in 2011, with 
works carried out on the r itz Carlton and 
fit-out projects on Saadiyat Island’s St 
r egis Hotel and the Sofitel r esort Palm 
Jumeirah Hotel. We saw a modest upturn 
in infrastructure work, with contracts 
such as the Dubai r oads and t ransport 
authority’s maintenance works, surfacing 
works on the Dubai-Fujairah Freeway 
and roads in u mm al Quwain, one of the 
smaller emirates. In the retail sector we 
secured a £40 million contract to build 
the Fujairah Mall and car park for Majid al 
Futtaim.
Oman experienced a degree of civil 
unrest as part of the arab Spring, which 
is having an impact on the return of 
tourism and leisure projects. We are 
therefore increasing our focus on roads 
and infrastructure projects, which we see 
as more attractive in the short-to-medium 
term. after the year end we won a 
significant contract with Daewoo to build 
the infrastructure for a new 2,000MW 
power station in Sur for the Oman Power 
and Water Procurement Company.
t he IMF is forecasting GDP growth 
of 4.0 per cent for 2012 for the Gulf 
Co-operation Council (GCC) countries, 
slightly reduced on previous forecasts 
due to the resumption of more normal 
levels of oil production in Qatar and Saudi 
arabia which had ramped up in 2011 to 
compensate for lower output from Libya. 
n evertheless, growth rates in the region 
are still attractive even if the immediate 
outlook is somewhat subdued, and Qatar 
in particular, with construction output 
forecast to grow at a compound rate 
of 7.9 per cent per annum up to 2016 
(source: Business Monitor international), 
remains a market with very substantial 
future prospects from which we are well 
placed to benefit.

We have a strong position as one of the 
leading global suppliers in our specialist 
markets. We operate across a wide range 
of geographies and sectors, with a fleet 
of equipment which we can move around 
the world to meet the changing demands 
in our global markets. 
With the exception of strong 
performances from australia and the 
Far East, we experienced weakness 
in infrastructure spending in 2011, with 
pricing pressure continuing to impact 
margins. t his was exacerbated by the 
impact of the arab Spring, particularly on 
exports to n orth africa and to an extent 
in Bahrain and Oman. t o address these 
pressures, we maintained a strong focus 
on the cost base and cash generation of 
our operations, with a number of business 
units being restructured during the year. 
although there is still some uncertainty in 
global construction markets we believe 
that the first half of the year was the low 
point in our cycle and trading is showing 
early signs of recovery: not only did profits 
in the second half exceed those in the first 
half, they were also 15 per cent stronger 
than those in the second half of 2010.
r egionally:
Middle east and Africa
t rading in the Middle East was affected 
both by the position of the construction 
market generally and by the impact of the 
civil disturbances in Bahrain, Oman and 
n orth africa, in particular Libya. With the 
reduction in these contributions, Saudi 
arabia, which we entered for the first time 
in 2009, became our most successful and 
largest Middle Eastern market in 2011. 
t he Kingdom has extensive construction 
and infrastructure plans from which we 
are benefiting. an example is the Jubail 
Highway upgrade connecting Dammam 
to Jubail, the busiest road in the Eastern 
Province, where we have been involved in 
the construction of some major highway 
intersections involving a number of 
bridges for our customer Sinopec.
among the projects we undertook was 
the r itz Carlton Hotel in Dubai Marina, for 
which Khansaheb, our ua E Construction 
associate, was the client. a particularly 
challenging project was the design and 
supply of the supporting equipment 
for the construction of a 6.5km tunnel 
forming part of the Lusail Light r ail t ransit 
system in Qatar. Our engineers designed, 
fabricated and supplied six complete sets 
of travelling formwork and shoring, each 
14m long, which enabled the contractor 
to achieve four-day cycles, reducing the 
construction programme significantly. 
We were subsequently commissioned 
to design and supply all the support 
and formwork equipment for the 
tunnel pumping stations and ventilation 
shafts and are negotiating over further 
associated work.
One aspect of our growth strategy is 
to develop exports to other parts of the 
region. In 2011 this included the Basra 
Sports City Stadium project in Iraq, a 
65,000-seater football stadium due to be 
complete in time for the Gulf Cup in 2013.
Australasia and Far east
We had a record year in australasia and 
the Far East. t his is now Equipment 
Services’ largest region and is benefiting 
from healthy demand in the australian 
mining and infrastructure sectors. t he 
Sino Iron project described in the case 
study on page 12 gives an idea of the 
scale and complexity of the work in which 
we have been involved. another example 
is the v ictoria Desalination Plant, currently 
in the final stages of construction and the 
largest of its type built to date in australia. 
We have designed and supplied formwork 
and shoring systems to all areas of this 
major development over the past two 
years. Prospects in mining and natural 
resources remain good, driven in part by 
the country’s access to the fast-growing 
Chinese and Indian markets. t here is little 
sign yet of a resumption of growth in the 
australian commercial sector.
Elsewhere in the region Hong Kong 
performed well as further infrastructure 
contracts were let, and we anticipate that 
this will continue in 2012. a key project 
was our work on the new Cruise t erminal

skills but also our logistics expertise, as

from around the world within a very short 
lead time.

Demand in the u K reflected the 
pressures on the construction sector. 
n evertheless performance was resilient 
and we undertook a number of high-
profile projects and developed further 
innovative products that will maintain 
our position at the leading edge of 
the industry. Our specialist Paraslim 
composite bridge system was used to 
support the construction of the new M6 
Catthorpe v iaduct r eplacement at the 
intersection of the M6/M1 motorways. 
We also introduced ‘Megastair’, a stair 
and access system that will be used on 
the country’s two new aircraft carriers, 
and ‘ascent Screens’, a unique set 
of products which works in tandem 
with our climbing formwork system to 
shield concrete works and protect the 
surrounding environment from building 
debris. For the coming year, we see a 
number of attractive prospects, including 
Crossrail, commercial building work in 
London, waste-to-energy plants and the 
nuclear sector.
Our markets in Spain and Ireland were 
severely depressed in 2011. We have 
taken restructuring actions in both 
countries and have moved excess fleet 
out to markets with greater potential 
demand. a general election in Spain 
in n ovember 2011 saw a change 
in government, and a return to an 
infrastructure plan is also anticipated but 
with the benefit not likely to be felt until 
2013. In Ireland the outlook is somewhat 
improved but the country’s economic 
position leaves significant uncertainty 
over the infrastructure sector.
Americas
While we have made good progress 
in integrating and reconfiguring the u S 
operations that we acquired at the end 
of 2010, the recovery of the construction 
market remains slower than expected. 
Our Chilean operation performed well, 
responding to increased demand in 
reconstruction work and from the 
burgeoning mining sector. We expect this 
to continue in 2012.

Developments is responsible for two 
broad areas: directing the Group’s 
PPP investment activities, leading the 
bid process and managing equity 
investments; and taking the primary 
role in driving the Group’s strategic 
development, pursuing acquisitions, 
exploring new opportunities and 
leading major, complex bids in market 
sectors which require cross-divisional 
involvement. as it is a central function its 
costs are allocated to Group Centre and 
its results reflect the performance of our 
investments.
Our PPP equity investments continue 
to make a healthy contribution to Group 
earnings, with a total contribution to pre-
tax profit of £10.0 million. at 31 December 
2011 we had 22 signed contracts 
(31 December 2010: 21), of which 
19 are now operational and three under 
construction. During the year we were 
named preferred bidder for one more, 
the Holt Park wellbeing centre in Leeds, 
and reached financial close just before 
the end of the year. also in January 2012 
we were chosen as the successful bidder 
for the West Yorkshire Police PFI. t his 
will involve the construction of two new 
divisional headquarters, custody suites 
and a specialist operational training 
facility (with firearms ranges and public-
order and driver training facilities), and 
the provision of FM services for 25 years 
thereafter. We anticipate that the total 
value of our construction and FM services 
will be approximately £150 million.
We have made a significant investment 
commitment on the signed contracts, 
of which £45.1 million (31 December 
2010: £25.8 million) has already been 
paid and £13.0 million (31 December 
2010: £30.1 million) remained.
We expect our portfolio to be cash 
neutral over the medium term, with new 
investments being funded by disposals 
of mature projects. With our considerable 
expertise and track record in delivering, 
operating and financing using PPP 
structures, we believe we are well placed 
to benefit from the development of similar 
funding arrangements for public sector 
investments. Our bidding in 2012 will 
concentrate on education, health and 
strategic partnerships.

principal risks and uncertainties
We operate in a business environment in which a number of 
risks and uncertainties exist. While it is not possible to eliminate 
these completely, the established risk-management and internal 
control procedures, which are regularly reviewed by the Group 
Risk Committee on behalf of the Board, are designed to manage 
their effects and thus contribute to the creation of value for the 
Group’s shareholders as we pursue our business objectives. 
The Group continues to be dependent on effective maintenance 
of its systems and controls. Over and above that, the principal 
risks and uncertainties which the Group addresses through its 
risk-management measures are detailed below.
Bus Iness, economI c A nd pol It Ic Al env Ironment
potential impact mitigation and monitoring
Among the changes which could affect our business are:
• changes in our competitors’ behaviour;
• the imposition of unusually onerous contract conditions by  
major clients;
• shifts in the economic climate both in the UK and 
internationally;
• a deterioration in the profile of our counterparty risk; 
• alterations in the UK government’s policy with regard to 
expenditure on improving public infrastructure, buildings, 
services and modes of service delivery;
• delays in the procurement of government-related projects; and
• civil unrest and/or shifts in the political climate in some of the 
regions in which we operate
any one or more of which might result in a failure to win new 
or sufficiently profitable contracts in our chosen markets or to 
complete those contracts with sufficient profitability.
We seek to mitigate these risks by fostering long-term 
relationships with our clients and partners, our predominantly 
governmental/quasi-governmental medium-to-long-term 
revenue streams, the development of additional capabilities to 
meet anticipated demand in new growth areas of public service 
delivery, careful supply chain management and by operating in 
various regions of the world, including the Middle East, where 
we are able to transfer resources to maximum effect between 
the differing economies of that region. We also have in place 
committed financing of £246 million with a diversity of maturity 
dates between 2015 and 2017. We constantly monitor market 
conditions and assess our capabilities in comparison to those  
of our competitors. Whether we win, lose or retain a contract  
we analyse the reasons for our success or shortcomings and 
feed the information back at both tactical and strategic levels. 
We also constantly monitor our cost base and take action to 
ensure it is suitable given the prevailing market environment. 
mAjor contr Acts
potential impact mitigation and monitoring
As we focus on large-volume relationships with certain major 
clients for a significant part of our revenue, termination of one 
or more of the associated contracts would be likely to reduce 
our revenue and profit. In addition, the management of such 
contracts entails potential risks including mispricing, inaccurate 
specification, failure to appreciate risks being taken on, poor 
control of costs or of service delivery, sub-contractor insolvency 
and failure to recover, in part or in full, payments due for work 
undertaken. In PFI/PPP contracts, which can last for periods 
of around 30 years and typically require the Special Purpose 
Companies (SPCs) established by us and one or more third 
parties to provide for the future capital replacement of assets, 
there is a risk that such a company may fail to anticipate 
adequately the cost or timing of the necessary works or that 
there may be increases in costs, including wage inflation,  
beyond those anticipated.
Among our mitigation strategies are targeting work within, or 
complementary to, our existing competencies, the fostering  
of long-term relationships with clients, operating an authority 
matrix for the approval of large bids, monthly management 
reporting with key performance indicators at contract and 
business level, the use of monthly cost-value reconciliation, 
supply chain management, taking responsibility for the 
administration of our PFI/PPP SPCs, securing board 
representation in them and ensuring that periodic  
benchmarking and/or market testing are included in 
long-term contracts. business review

potential impact mitigation and monitoring
We enjoy demonstrable success in working with third parties 
both through joint ventures and associated companies in the UK 
and abroad. This success results in a material proportion of our 
profits and cash flow being generated from businesses in which 
we do not have overall control. Any weakening of our strong 
relationships with these business partners could have an effect 
on our profits and cash flow.
We have a proven track record of developing and re-enforcing 
such relationships in a mutually beneficial way over a long 
period of time and our experience of this places us well to 
preserve existing relationships and create new ones as part 
of our business model. The measures taken to limit risk in this 
area include: board representation, shareholders’ agreements, 
management secondments, local borrowings and rights of  
audit in addition to investing time in personal relationships.

potential impact mitigation and monitoring
The success of our business is dependent on recruiting, 
retaining, developing, motivating and communicating with 
appropriately skilled, competent people of integrity at all levels of 
the organisation.
We have a Group-wide leadership programme designed to 
support the strategic aims of the Company. We have various 
incentive schemes and run a broad range of training courses 
for people at all stages in their careers. With active human 
resources management and Investors in People accreditation in 
many parts of the Group, we manage our people professionally 
and encourage them to develop and fulfil their maximum 
potential with the Group.

potential impact mitigation and monitoring
The nature of the businesses conducted by the Group involves 
exposure to health and safety risks for both employees and third 
parties. Management of these risks is critical to the success 
of the business and is implemented through the adoption and 
maintenance of rigorous operational and occupational health 
and safety procedures.
A commitment to safety forms part of our mission statement 
and the subject leads every Board meeting both at Group and 
divisional level. Each member of the Executive Board undertakes 
dedicated visits to look at health and safety measures in place 
at our operational sites and we have ongoing campaigns across 
the Group emphasising its importance.
f InAnc IAl rI sks
potential impact mitigation and monitoring
We are subject to certain financial risks which are discussed in 
the Financial Review on pages 24 to 29.
In particular, we carry out major projects which from time to  
time require substantial amounts of cash to finance working 
capital, capital expenditure and investment in PFI projects. 
Failure to manage working capital appropriately could result in  
us being unable to meet our trading requirements and ultimately 
to defaulting on our banking covenants.
We recognise a pension deficit on our balance sheet. The 
deficit’s value is sensitive to several key assumptions which 
are discussed on page 28 of the Financial Review, and any 
significant changes in these may result in the Group having to 
increase its pension scheme contribution with a resultant  
impact on liquidity.
We have policies in place to monitor the effective management 
of working capital, including the production of daily balances, 
weekly cash reports and forecasts together with monthly 
management reporting.
A number of actions have been taken including closure of the 
Defined Benefit Scheme to further accrual for all non-passport 
members from the end of December 2009, the contribution of 
PFI investments to the pension scheme and additional employer 
contributions in excess of the income statement charge.

Issues arising within contracts, from the management of our 
businesses or from the behaviour of our employees at all levels 
can have broader repercussions on the Group’s reputation than 
simply their direct impact. 
Control procedures and checks governing the operation 
of our contracts and of our businesses are supported by

r evenue and operating profit
Across the Group, total gross revenues have been stable year on 
year. However our three principal trading divisions experienced 
different market conditions.
Strong revenue growth of 10 per cent in Equipment Services 
principally reflects increased activity from our newly acquired 
operations in North America. In Support Services revenues were 
broadly stable at £1,007.3 million (2010: £1,024.8 million), with 
measured work winning accompanying a continued focus on 
margin enhancement. Our UK and International Construction 
divisions reported declining revenues in continued challenging 
global construction markets.
A full-year operating margin on gross revenues of 3.2 per cent 
(2010: 3.2 per cent) again reflects a stronger second half 
than first half with an operating margin of 3.5 per cent 
(H1 2011: 2.9 per cent). Within this, the operating margin in UK 
Support Services strengthened from 3.1 per cent in the first 
half to 4.1 per cent in the second half, reflecting the benefits of 
ongoing operational efficiency improvements and procurement 
benefits. The improvement in margin over the year clearly 
demonstrates the significant progress made in the division as 
it tracks towards the medium-term target of a 5 per cent 
operating margin. As anticipated, the UK Construction margin, at 
2.5 per cent, is reverting towards more long-term norms and is 
expected to drift down slightly over the next few years, impacted 
by lower activity levels and increased competition. The full-year 
margin in Equipment Services was down slightly year-on-year 
at 8.8 per cent (2010: 10.3 per cent), having been adversely 
impacted by the effects of the Arab Spring and Eurozone 
conditions. Most encouragingly, however, the second half of 
2011 saw resumption in growth and, led by further increases 
in activity levels, the division is expected to return to a full year 
of growth in 2012 with further recovery towards medium-term 
margin expectations of 15 per cent.
Average and closing exchange rates used in the preparation of 
these results were:

Financial r eview
summAry
Financial highlights of 2011 included:
•	 A robust trading performance in line with expectations
•	 Increase in headline earnings per share of 15.2 per cent
•	 Continued improvement in margins at Support Services 
driven by significant operational efficiency improvements 
and procurement benefits
•	 Continued strong cash generation. Average net debt for the 
year was £3 million (2010: £20 million)
•	 Very low taxation charge, representing an effective rate of 
9.7 per cent (2010: 16.5 per cent) on profit before taxation, 
following management action taken to maximise tax 
efficiency on earnings remitted from the Middle East
•	 Net pension deficit under IAS 19 materially contained 
despite worsening market asset prices and falling liability 
discount rates
•	 Successful refinancing completed providing committed 
financing of £246 million with a diversity of maturity dates 
between 2015 and 2017. Core funding of £150 million in 
place for five years with bilateral arrangements running in 
parallel totalling £96 million providing additional flexibility and 
capacity. This is a clear demonstration of commitment from 
our banking group and provides significant headroom to 
fund our future growth.

new segmentation
Reflecting the growing significance of our International Support 
Service operations and some minor changes in the way a 
few elements of our business are reported and managed, 
the segmentation of our results has been amended with 
comparatives restated accordingly. Note 3 to the financial 
statements on pages 77 to 80 provides further details.
Investment revenue and finance costs
The net interest charge for the year of £1.0 million can be 
analysed as follows:
£million 2011 2010
Net interest on Group debt (6.3) (5.4)
Interest due on sub-debt 4.0 2.8
IAS 19: 
 Expected return on Scheme assets 35.3 32.3
 Interest cost on pension obligations (34.0) (34.5)
Group net interest charge (1.0) (4.8)
 
A continued strong focus on cash management during the year 
delivered a further significant reduction in average net debt to 
£3 million (2010: £20 million). The increase in net interest on Group 
debt reflects the full-year impact of the refinancing in April 2010.
The interest cost on Group debt is high relative to the amounts 
drawn down due to the fixed costs relating to the amortisation of 
upfront arrangement fees and a commitment fee payable as a 
percentage of undrawn committed facilities.
Interest receivable on sub-debt increased to £4.0 million  
(2010: £2.8 million) reflecting the increasing operational maturity 
of the investment portfolio and increasing associated returns.
The successful reassessment of the Interserve Pension 
Scheme’s (“the Scheme”) investment strategy, carried out 
over the past two years, together with relatively strong equity 
markets, has resulted in significant increases in pension fund 
asset values. These increases and the additional cash and 
asset contributions from the Group during the period, gave rise 
to increased expected returns on the Scheme assets of 
£35.3 million (2010: £32.3 million).
This resulted in a (non-cash) net interest credit in the 2011 
results relating to pensions. 
t axation
The tax charge for the year of £6.5 million represents an effective 
rate of 9.7 per cent on total Group profit before taxation. The 
factors underlying this low effective rate are shown in the table 
below.

*The Group’s share of the post-tax results of joint ventures and associates is included in profit 
before tax in accordance with IFRS.
The underlying tax charge and rate, before the benefits noted 
below, was slightly higher than in the previous year due to a 
higher incidence of losses in overseas tax jurisdictions that are 
not available for relief against other Group profits. The impact 
of this is expected to normalise downwards in future years as 
management action to stem these losses reduces their impact.
As previously disclosed, the Group has benefited from actions 
taken that have improved the tax efficiency of earnings remitted 
from a subsidiary in the Middle East. This has been achieved 
through a restructuring of investment holdings in the region, 
which will also have prospective benefits, and the conclusion 
of negotiations on the nature, and subsequent tax treatment, of 
an historical remittance. This has benefited the current year tax 
charge by £7.0 million (2010: £nil).

dividend
The directors recommend a final dividend for the year of 
13.0 pence, to bring the total for the year to 19.0 pence, an 
increase of 5.6 per cent over last year. This dividend is covered 
2.6 times by headline earnings per share and 2.3 times by free 
cash flow. 
net de Bt A nd CA sH Flow
Average net debt for the year was £3 million (2010: £20 million) 
and year-end net debt was £44.2 million (2010: £53.8 million), 
having benefited from free cash flow generation of £54.4 million 
(2010: £43.1 million).

The strong operating cash flow of £66.6 million, representing 
145 per cent conversion of operating profit before amortisation 
of intangible assets (2010: £46.3 million and 107 per cent 
respectively), was driven by continued management action 
to control capital expenditure and manage working capital 
efficiently. 
Despite a £5.8 million net outflow of advances received 
from customers (2010: £14.3 million outflow) working capital 
produced a net inflow of £9.5 million. On a three-year rolling 
basis this represents an aggregate net inflow of working 
capital of £40.6 million against a backdrop of continuing tough 
economic conditions.
Following a year in which proceeds from disposals exceeded 
new capital invested by £9.5 million, 2011 saw a return to a 
modest level of net capital expenditure of £5.5 million. This 
remains significantly below the annual depreciation charge. 
The strong cash generation of our operations in the Middle East 
and of our Investments special purpose vehicles has enabled 
us to make an investment of £3.3 million during the year in the 
acquisition of the trade and assets of an interiors business in 
Qatar and to remit dividends from associates and joint ventures 
of £20.6 million (2010: £32.1 million).
Tax paid of £3.2 million (2010: £6.3 million) remains considerably 
lower than the Consolidated Income Statement charge incurred 
by the Group, due principally to timing differences, the tax 
deductions for pension deficit payments and the actions taken 
to maximise the tax efficiency of the remittance of earnings from 
the Middle East noted earlier.
Investments and acquisitions outflow of £19.3 million in 
2011 reflects additional equity and sub-debt invested in PFI 
joint-venture companies, as a number of projects achieved 
operational status.
r eFInAnCInG
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, we have been successful 
in securing a long-term refinancing for the Group. This has seen 
our previous £250 million syndicated revolving credit facility, 
which was due to expire in October 2013, replaced with a series 
of committed facilities totalling £246 million (at current exchange 
rates). These new facilities run in parallel with each other and 
provide a diverse maturity profile extending, in total, five years 
to February 2017. The achievement of five-year funding in the 
current debt market is a clear demonstration of the commitment 
and backing we receive from our banking group.
The core of this financing is provided by a £150 million 
committed syndicated facility extending five years until February 
2017. This is augmented by two committed bilateral facilities 
totalling £46 million that run in parallel to the main facility and 
extend for four years until February 2016. The final element of 
financing is provided by a three-year, £50 million bilateral facility 
that matures in February 2015 with the option of two one-year 
extensions.
The new funding is subject to the same covenants as the 
previous facility and is on broadly similar commercial terms. It 
has been secured at slightly lower rates for borrowing and non-
utilisation.

These new funding arrangements provide us with increased 
certainty, greater flexibility, improved resilience, a diversity of 
maturity dates and sufficient balance sheet capacity to deliver 
our medium-term strategy.
ACquIs It Ions
We maintain a disciplined approach to reviewing potential 
acquisition opportunities, rejecting those which do not meet our 
strict valuation and other selection criteria. 
We announced on 29 March 2011 that, following several weeks 
of due diligence and expenditure of some £0.7 million on 
professional advisers, we were not continuing with the proposed 
acquisition of Mouchel Group plc.
Nevertheless, with a strong balance sheet, and significant 
available debt capacity and facilities, we remain well placed to 
take advantage of appropriate acquisition opportunities as they 
are identified.
pensI ons
At 31 December 2011 the Group pension deficit under IAS 19, 
net of deferred tax, was broadly stable at £42.2 million (2010: 
£37 .6 million):  
£million 2011 2010
Defined benefit obligation 695.0 642.3
Scheme assets (638.8) (590.8)
Deferred tax thereon (14.0) (13.9)
Net deficit 42.2 37.6
With the benefit of additional employer cash contributions 
significantly in excess of the Income Statement charge and an 
investment portfolio that outperformed the market in the period, 
the value of Scheme assets increased by £48.0 million during 
the year. However, corporate bond yields, which are used to 
discount Scheme liabilities, have fallen significantly during the 
year. As a result, the value of benefit obligations has increased 
by marginally more than the increase in the value of Scheme 
assets.
defined benefit liabilities and funding
The Group’s principal pension scheme is the Interserve Pension 
Scheme, comprising approximately 95 per cent of the total 
defined benefit obligations of the Group. 
The triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 
31 December 2011 is currently under way. This will determine 
an updated funding shortfall and an associated programme of 
deficit recovery payments. The Group is currently committed to 
a programme of cash deficit recovery payments of £22 million 
per annum, increasing by 2.8 per cent each year, until 2017. 
This deficit recovery plan was designed to eliminate a deficit of 
£224 million assessed as at 31 December 2008. This plan also 
included a bullet contribution of £61.5 million of PFI assets in 
November 2009.
Investment risks
Scheme assets are invested in a mixed portfolio that consists 
of a balance of performance-seeking assets (such as equities) 
and lower-risk assets (such as gilts and corporate bonds).  As 
at 31 December 2011, 44 per cent of the Scheme assets were 
invested in performance-seeking assets (2010: 48 per cent).
The agreed investment objectives of the Scheme are:
•	 to secure, with a high degree of certainty, liabilities in respect 
of all defined benefit members; and
•	 to adopt a long-term strategy which aims to capture 
outperformance from equities and move gradually into 
bonds to reflect the increasing maturity of the defined benefit 
membership with a view to reducing the volatility of investment 
returns.
The majority of equities held by the Scheme are in international 
blue-chip entities. The aim is to hold a globally diversified 
portfolio of equities, with an ultimate target of 50 per cent of 
equities being held in UK and 50 per cent in US, European and 
Asia Pacific equities.

Investments
The credit in the Income Statement relating to the performance 
of the Group’s share of the equity portfolio is analysed as 
follows:
£million 2011 2010
Share of operating profit 1.9 3.8
Net finance credit 7.5 2.8
Taxation (3.4) (2.4)
Share of profit included in Group Total 
 Operating Profit 6.0 4.2
 
This increased contribution reflects the increasing operational 
maturity of the remaining portfolio, with six projects having 
achieved operational status during the year.
Assets created under investment contracts have been assessed 
in relation to the balance of risks and rewards assumed by the 
Group and are accounted for as financial assets, classified 
as available-for-sale.  As such these assets are held at their 
assessed fair value at the balance sheet date, with movements 
over the period being taken directly to equity.  
Having achieved financial close on the Holt Park project in 
December 2011, at the balance sheet date the Group had 
£58.1 million of committed investment in 22 projects which had 
reached financial close. Of this, £45.1 million had been invested 
at that date, with the balance due to be invested over the next 
two years.
Subsequent to the year end, we were appointed selected bidder 
on the West Yorkshire Police project for the construction of 
two new divisional headquarters, custody suites and a specialist 
operational training facility. On financial close this will increase our 
committed investment and is expected to provide £150 million of 
construction and facilities management work over 25 years.

t re Asury rI sK mAnAGement
We operate a centralised Treasury function whose primary role 
is to manage interest rate, liquidity and foreign exchange risks.  
The Treasury function is not a profit centre and it does not enter 
into speculative transactions.  It aims to reduce financial risk by 
the use of hedging instruments, operating within a framework of 
policies and guidelines approved by the Board.  
l iquidity risk
We seek to maintain sufficient facilities to ensure access to 
funding for our current and anticipated future requirements, 
determined from budgets and medium-term plans.
Having successfully refinanced subsequent to the balance sheet 
date, we have access to committed syndicated revolving credit 
facilities totalling £150 million until February 2017 and £96 million 
of various bilateral agreements which expire between February 
2015 and February 2016.
market price risk
The objectives of our interest rate policy are to match funding 
costs with operational revenue performance and to ensure 
that adequate interest cover is maintained, in line with Board 
approved targets and banking covenants. 
Our borrowings are principally denominated in sterling and 
mostly subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.  We 
have in place interest rate caps and swaps which limit interest 
rate risk. The weighted average duration to maturity of these 
instruments is a little over two years.
Foreign currency risk
t ransactional currency translation
The revenues and costs of our trading entities are typically 
denominated in their functional currency.  Where a material 
trade is transacted in a non-functional currency, the entity is 
required to take out instruments through the centralised Treasury 
function to hedge the currency exposure. The instruments used 
will normally be forward currency contracts.  The impact of 
retranslating any entity’s non-functional currency balances into 
its functional currency was not material.
Consolidation currency translation
We do not hedge the impact of translating overseas entities 
trading results or net assets into the consolidation currency.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, profits and 
losses from overseas activities are translated at the average 
exchange rates applying during the year. The average rates used 
in this process are disclosed on page 24.
The balance sheets of our overseas entities are translated at the 
year-end exchange rates. The impact of changes in the year-end 
exchange rates, compared to the rates used in preparing the 
2010 consolidated financial statements, has led to an increase in 
consolidated net assets of £8.0 million (2010: £7 .7 million increase).
GoI nG Con Cern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Business Review. Our financial position, cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities and details of financial 
risk management are described in the Financial Review.
The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts, 
which provides a strong future workload and good forward 
revenue visibility. We have access to committed debt facilities 
totalling £246 million until a range of dates that extend beyond 
February 2015. As a consequence, the directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully 
despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.

We are dedicated to providing a 
sustainable business fulfilling our 
commitments to our shareholders, our 
customers, our employees and our 
communities to ensure we help deliver a 
better future. Our Head of Sustainability 
is Tim Haywood, the Group Finance 
Director. He leads the Sustainability 
Board, which is embedding these 
principles throughout the business.
The Sustainability Board, aided by 
the wider body of experts within 
Interserve and supplemented by 
external consultancy, has embarked 
on an extensive programme to assess 
the effectiveness of our sustainability 
processes and to determine how far 
sustainability concepts extend into all 
our day-to-day working. This programme 
recognises that while successful 
leadership is important, the responsibility 
for delivering a sustainable business is 
shared with all our employees, our supply 
chain and our clients.
Our sustainability policy includes the 
following commitments:
•	 to continue to operate safely and 
responsibly and seek to continuously 
improve these standards of operations;
•	 to develop a sustainable range 
of building and support services, 
underpinned by a sustainable business;
•	 to strive to improve our business 
performance, contributing to economic, 
social and environmental development;
•	 to help our customers create more 
value in their business;
•	 to provide our people with every 
opportunity to contribute to developing 
their talents; and
•	 to act as responsible members of our 
communities, by generating economic 
growth and supporting social, 
educational and cultural advancement.
Across the world we have achieved a 
number of accreditations in this area 
including Investors in People, ISO 14001, 
OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001 and PAS 99. 
Interserve is a member of the 
FTSE4Good and Kempen Social 
Responsibility indices.
How we vI ew sust AInABIl Ity
Sustainability is essential to the way 
we do business. We understand the 
fundamental interdependence of the 
social, economic and environmental 
aspects of sustainability and that the way 
we behave will ensure we have a positive 
impact in each of these areas.
social
Our approach to social responsibility 
provides opportunities for our employees, 
focuses on their wellbeing and reflects 
our involvement in the economies, 
markets and communities in which we 
operate. We are playing a crucial role in 
delivering social sustainability, economic 
regeneration and transformation by 
undertaking our work responsibly and by 
engaging in matters of local, national and 
global interest.
employee engagement
We believe in involving our people in 
matters affecting them as employees, 
and keep them informed of all relevant 
factors concerning the Group’s 
performance, strategy, financial status, 
charitable activities and other issues. We 
achieve this through formal and informal 
briefings, through our Group magazines 
and through our intranet. Employee 
representatives are consulted regularly 
on a wide range of matters affecting their 
current and future interests.
Since 2007 we have conducted a 
biennial, Group-wide survey to help 
us understand how our employees 
experience working in Interserve and 
what improvements we may be able to 
make at a local or central level.

economic
Economic success is an integral part 
of sustainable development, enabling 
the sharing of wealth to the benefit of 
society as a whole. We are aware of our 
responsibilities in the locations where 
we work and are passionate about the 
creation of sustainable employment and 
training opportunities for local people.
In November we introduced a 
revolutionary new design for schools 
which greatly reduced building costs and 
time. The PodSolve design is being used 
for Leeds East Academy and will benefit 
students through an improved and flexible 
learning environment, while cutting both 
costs and length of time for construction 
by 25 per cent.
environmental
In addition to the moral obligation to 
safeguard the environment, there are 
clear business advantages in taking 
a lead on environmental issues. It 
means we are better placed to help our 
customers comply with legislation and 
prepare for a changing climate, and 
especially it enables us to reduce our 
customers’ costs and their impact on the 
environment. From cutting down waste 
and water usage to better use of raw 
materials and fewer emissions, we keep 
our environmental impact, and those of 
our clients, to a minimum. 
Our Sustainability Report contains 
examples of our innovative work in this 
area, including our new Leicester office, 
the first certified Passivhaus, carbon-
neutral office in the UK. We have also 
started work on the two schools in Leeds 
which will also be Passivhaus.
In 2011 we once again participated in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project and we are 
currently working to achieve CEMARS 
accreditation for our carbon emissions 
reporting.
employee en GAGement : 
‘tH e BIG pIcture’
in order for our large and diverse 
workforce to feel a part of our 
vision, to focus on our goals and 
endorse our values, we have 
developed a major employee 
communications initiative called 
“The big Picture”. 
it has been designed, with the 
input of our senior managers, to 
educate and inspire our people 
and forms part of our induction

Health and safety
At the beginning of 2010 we reassessed 
which measures would best help us 
manage the way we work in order to 
make continual improvements in our 
health and safety performance. As a 
result we adjusted some of our KPIs to 
increase the focus on proactivity and on 
enhancing behavioural change.
The health and safety data in the adjacent 
table and chart cover Interserve and its 
subsidiaries as well as a joint-venture 
operation, KMI+, of which Interserve 
owns just over 30 per cent. The accident 
incidence rate (AIR) is the number 
of RIDDOR-reportable injuries per 
100,000 workforce.
With our formal safety management 
systems well established it is clear that 
further improvements in performance will 
predominantly come though behavioural 
change programmes and changing 
attitudes towards safety. This has been 
developed into our Aim to be Accident- 
Free campaign with each operating 
division delivering programmes of activity 
most relevant to their operations.

employee development
Over the course of the year our people 
engaged in more than 9,800 days’-worth of 
training, in addition to external courses and 
self-directed learning. We employed 78 
apprentices, had 298 people undertaking 
part-time or distance learning and 1,370 
on management development courses. 
Since the year end one of our apprentices, 
Tibby Choda, was named Young 
Carpenter of the Year 2012 in the BBC’s 
Young Talent of the Year competition.
The success of individuals committed to 
their personal training and development 
is recognised through the Interserve 
Training Trust, established in 1981. The 
Chief Executive presented 45 people 
from across the Group and around the 
world with awards in September at a 
ceremony in front of the entire Group’s 
senior management.
c haritable giving
We believe in contributing to the well-
being of the communities in which we 
work. For some years we have had a 
programme which operates at different 
levels: at Group level we select a charity 
every two years and make an annual 
donation; we encourage business units 
to run charitable events, either for the 
Group charity or for another cause that 
is important to the area or the people 
involved; and we offer support for 
employees to undertake sponsored 
activities.
In early 2012 we set up the Interserve 
Employee Foundation. The aim of the 
Foundation is to improve the quality of life 
for people in the communities where we 
live and work, using the skills, capabilities, 
resources and enthusiasm of Interserve 
employees. Ambassadors from all our 
business units and locations will promote 
the aims of the Foundation and help get 
employees involved in local projects. 
The Foundation was launched with an 
ambitious project to construct a learning 
centre in Chennai, India.
Our chosen charity for 2010 and 2011 
was Help for Heroes, a charity founded in 
2007 to provide direct, practical support 
to those wounded in UK military service. 
As a result of the fund-raising events 
and individual sponsored activities, 
over £49,000 was raised in 2011 to 
complement the Company donation 
of £25,000, making a total of nearly 
£160,000 over the two years. We have 
extended our support for a further year.
Beyond our chosen charity we involve 
ourselves in numerous local charities 
in the UK and internationally, both as a 
business and through the hard work of 
many individuals who take up causes 
that are close to them personally or to our 
clients. We gave a corporate donation 
of £10,000 to Great Ormond Street 
Hospital’s Raising the Roof campaign 
as well as £25,000 to the Safer London 
Foundation (the Metropolitan Police’s 
charity supporting community-led 
crime prevention/reduction projects), 
and several smaller donations to other 
charities brought the corporate total to 
£77 ,412 for the year.
environmental impact
We use a variety of indicators relevant 
to each of our operating companies to 
monitor environmental performance, but 
the following core impacts are identified 
for the Group as a whole:
•	 Greenhouse gas emissions from our 
use of energy, including electricity, gas, 
fuel in vehicles, transport and travel
•	 Use of resources including water and 
timber
•	 Generation and disposal of waste
We collect data in our wholly-controlled, 
UK operations
1
. This is based around our 
fixed office locations and the activities we 
support from them and includes office 
locations associated with contracts where 
we hold lease agreements and pay utility 
bills. It also includes the fuel we purchase 
for use in vehicles to deliver our contracts.
We believe that the increase in the 
figure for waste produced was due to 
improvements in our capturing data 
rather than to an actual increase in waste 
itself. It is also worth noting that we have 
increased the amount of recycling, so  
the waste potentially going to landfill  
has reduced.
1 
We have included the energy used on construction sites 
which we purchase directly and will have to account for 
under the carbon reduction commitment. We do not include:
	 •	 f u e l 	 u s e d 	 by 	 c o n tr a c t o r s 	 t o 	 d e l i ve r 	 th e i r 	 p a c k a g e s 	 of 	 wo r k

the Chairman’s Statement and the explanation of the Company’s 
business model, markets and strategy on pages 2 to 9, the 
Business Review (which includes the Chief Executive’s Q&A, 
Operational Review, Principal Risks and Uncertainties, Financial

The directors’ responsibility for the preparation of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements and the statement by the 
auditors about their reporting responsibilities are set out on 
pages 63 and 64, respectively, of this Annual Report.
Group results AnD DIvIDenDs
Financial reporting
The Group’s Consolidated Income Statement set out on page 65 
shows an increase in Group profit before taxation to 
£67.1 million (2010: £64.1 million). The detailed results of the 
Group are given in the financial statements on pages 65 to 
107 and further comments on divisional results are given in the 
Operational Review on pages 16 to 21. There have been no post 
balance sheet events that require disclosure or adjustment in the 
financial statements.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 6.0p per 10p ordinary share (2010: 5.6p) 
was paid on 25 October 2011. The directors recommend a 
final dividend of 13.0p per 10p ordinary share, making a total 
distribution for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 19.0p 
per 10p ordinary share (2010: 18.0p). Subject to approval of 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 
16 May 2012, the final dividend will be paid on 24 May 2012 to 
shareholders appearing on the register at the close of business 
on 10 April 2012. The shares will be quoted ex-dividend on 
4 April 2012.
The Company’s dividend reinvestment plan will continue to be 
available to eligible shareholders. Further details of the plan are 
set out in the Shareholder Information section on page 128.
EES Trustees International Limited, the trustee of the Interserve 
Employee Benefit Trust (the “Trust”), waived its right to receive 
a dividend over 1,089,702 shares held by the Trust in the name 
of Greenwood Nominees Limited in respect of the dividend 
paid in June 2011 (June 2010: 2,665 shares) and 1,083,263 
shares in respect of the dividend paid in October 2011 
(October 2010: 1,092,328 shares).
shAre c ApIt Al
General
The Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”) abolished the 
requirement for companies to have an authorised share capital 
and shareholder approval was obtained at the 2010 AGM to 
take advantage of this deregulating measure.  Accordingly, the 
Company no longer has an authorised share capital. 
The Company’s issued share capital as at 31 December 2011 
comprised a single class of ordinary shares. All shares rank 
equally and are fully paid. No person holds shares carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the Company.
No shares were issued during the year. The Company’s issued 
share capital at the end of the year stood at 125,804,346  
(2010: 125,804,346) ordinary shares of 10p each 
(£12,580,434.60) (2010: £12,580,434.60).  There has been no 
change since the year end.
Details of outstanding awards and options over shares in the 
Company as at 31 December 2011 are set out in notes 25 and 
27 to the financial statements on pages 99 and 100 respectively.
Section 618 of the 2006 Act provides the rules governing the 
sub-division and consolidation of shares. 
Issue of shares
Section 551 of the 2006 Act provides that the directors may not 
allot shares unless empowered to do so by the shareholders. A 
resolution giving such authority was passed at the AGM held on 
18 May 2011. This authority was not used during the year.
In accordance with the guidelines issued by the Association of 
British Insurers (the “ABI”), the directors propose Resolution 18 set 
out in the Notice of AGM to renew the authority granted to them 
at the 2011 AGM to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of one-third of the Company’s issued share capital plus a 
further one-third (i.e. two-thirds in all) where the allotment is in 
connection with a rights issue. 
Under section 561 of the 2006 Act, if the directors wish to 
allot unissued shares for cash (other than pursuant to an 
employee share scheme) they must first offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their holdings (a pre-emptive offer). 
Resolution 19 set out in the Notice of AGM will be proposed as 
a special resolution in order to renew the directors’ authority 
to allot shares for cash other than by way of rights to existing 
shareholders.  By restricting such authority to an aggregate 
nominal value of no more than 5 per cent of the Company’s 
total issued equity capital, the Company will be in compliance 
with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles (the 
“Principles”).
Shareholders should note that the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority do not require shareholders’ specific approval 
for each issue of shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis to 
the extent that under section 570 of the 2006 Act the provisions 
of section 561 are disapplied generally. If given, this authority 
will expire on the date of the next AGM of the Company. The 
Principles also request that in any rolling three-year period a 
company does not make non-pre-emptive issues for cash or of 
equity securities exceeding 7 .5 per cent of the company’s issued 
share capital without prior consultation with shareholders.  The 
percentage of shares issued by the Company on a non-pre-
emptive basis in the period 2009 to 2011 pursuant to employee 
share schemes (calculated by reference to the Company’s closing 
issued share capital at 31 December 2011), was 0.63 per cent.
Save for issues of shares in respect of various employee share 
schemes, the directors have no current plans to make use of 
the authorities sought by Resolutions 18 and 19 although they 
consider their renewal appropriate in order to retain maximum 
flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they 
arise. business review

r epurchase of shares
The Company has authority under a shareholders’ resolution 
passed at the 2011 AGM to repurchase up to 12,580,434 of 
the Company’s ordinary shares in the market. The shares may 
be purchased at a price ranging between the nominal value 
for each share and an amount equal to the higher of (i) 105 per 
cent of the average of the middle-market price of an ordinary 
share for the five business days immediately preceding the date 
on which the Company agrees to buy the shares concerned 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
and the highest independent current bid on the London Stock 
Exchange at the time the purchase is carried out. This authority 
expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM on 16 May 2012. 
No shares have been repurchased by the Company under the 
authority granted at the 2011 AGM. 
Resolution 20 set out in the Notice of AGM will be proposed as 
a special resolution in order to renew this authority. Although 
the directors have no immediate plans to do so, they believe 
it is prudent to seek general authority from shareholders to 
be able to act if circumstances were to arise in which they 
considered such purchases to be desirable. This power will 
only be exercised if and when, in the light of market conditions 
prevailing at that time, the directors believe that such purchases 
would increase earnings per share and would be for the benefit 
of shareholders generally.  Any shares purchased under this 
authority will be cancelled (unless the directors determine that 
they are to be held as treasury shares) and the number of 
shares in issue will be reduced accordingly.
Whilst the Company does not presently hold shares in treasury, 
the Treasury Shares Regulations allow shares purchased by 
the Company out of distributable profits to be held as treasury 
shares, which may then be cancelled, sold for cash or used 
to meet the Company’s obligations under its employee share 
schemes. The authority sought by this resolution is intended to 
apply equally to shares to be held by the Company as treasury 
shares in accordance with the Treasury Shares Regulations.
rIG hts A tt Ach InG to sh Ares
General
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the 
2006 Act and the Company’s Articles of Association. A copy 
of the Articles can be obtained on request from the Company 
Secretary. The Articles may only be changed by special 
resolution of shareholders which requires, on a vote on a show 
of hands, at least three-quarters of the shareholders or proxies 
present at the meeting to be in favour of the resolution or, on a 
poll, at least three-quarters in nominal value of the votes cast by 
shareholders or their proxies to be in favour of the resolution.
A shareholder whose name appears on the register of 
members may choose whether those shares are evidenced by 
share certificates (certificated form) or held in electronic form 
(uncertificated) in CREST.
voting
Subject to the restrictions set out below, a shareholder 
is entitled to attend (or appoint another person as his 
representative (a “proxy”) to attend) and to exercise all or any 
of his rights to speak, ask questions and vote at any general 
meeting of the Company.  A shareholder may also appoint 
more than one proxy, provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held 
by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the 
Company.
The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to a person 
who has been nominated under section 146 of the 2006 
Act to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”). He/
she may, however, have a right under an agreement with the 
registered shareholder holding the shares on his/her behalf to 
be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. 
Alternatively, if a Nominated Person does not have such a right, 
or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may have a right under 
such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding 
the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
In accordance with section 327 of the 2006 Act, in order to be 
valid, any form of proxy sent by the Company to shareholders 
or any proxy registered electronically in relation to any general 
meeting must be delivered to the Company’s registrars not later 
than 48 hours before the time fixed for holding the meeting (or 
any adjourned meeting). In calculating the 48 hour period no 
account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working 
day. Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in 
respect of the 2012 AGM are set out in the Notice of AGM.
Subject to any rights or restrictions for the time being attached 
to any class or classes of shares and to any other provisions 
of the Articles of Association or statutes, on a vote on a 
resolution at a general meeting on a show of hands every 
shareholder present in person, every proxy present who has 
been duly appointed by one or more shareholders entitled to 
vote on the resolution and every authorised representative of 
a corporation which is a shareholder of the Company entitled 
to vote on the resolution, shall have one vote. If a proxy has 
been duly appointed by more than one shareholder and has 
been instructed by one or more of those shareholders to vote 
for the resolution and by one or more of those shareholders to 
vote against it, that proxy shall have one vote for and one vote 
against the resolution. On a poll, every shareholder present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held.
A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting shall be 
decided on a show of hands unless the notice of the meeting 
specifies that a poll will be called on such resolution or a poll is 
(before the resolution is put to the vote on a show of hands or 
on the declaration of the results of the show of hands) directed 
by the Chairman or demanded in accordance with the Articles 
of Association.  
If a person fails to give the Company any information required 
by a notice served on him by the Company under section 793 of 
the 2006 Act (which confers upon public companies the power 
to require information to be supplied in respect of a person’s 
interests in the Company’s shares) then the Company may, no 
sooner than 21 days later, and after warning that person, serve 
a disenfranchisement notice upon the shareholder registered 
as the holder of the shares in respect of which the section 
793 notice was given. Unless the information required by the 
section 793 notice is given within 14 days, such holder will not 
be entitled to receive notice of any general meeting or attend 
any such meeting of the Company and shall not be entitled to 
exercise, either personally or by proxy, the votes attaching to 
such shares in respect of which the disenfranchisement notice 
has been given unless and until the information required by the 
section 793 notice has been provided. 40 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    GovernAnce    DIrectors’ report 
General meetings
No business may be transacted at a general meeting unless a 
quorum is present consisting of not less than two shareholders 
present in person or by proxy or by two duly authorised 
representatives of a corporation. Two proxies of the same 
shareholder or two duly authorised representatives of the same 
corporation will not constitute a quorum.
An AGM must be called on at least 21 days’ clear notice. All 
other general meetings are also required to be held on at least 
21 days’ clear notice unless the Company offers shareholders 
an electronic voting facility and a special resolution reducing 
the period of notice to not less than 14 days has been passed. 
The directors are proposing Resolution 21 set out in the Notice 
of AGM to renew the authority obtained at last year’s AGM to 
reduce the notice period for general meetings (other than AGMs) 
to at least 14 days. It is intended that this shorter notice period 
will only be used for non-routine business and where merited in 
the interests of shareholders as a whole.
The business of an AGM is to receive and consider the accounts 
and balance sheets and the reports of the directors and 
auditors, to elect directors in place of those retiring, to elect 
auditors and fix their remuneration and to declare a dividend.
Providing that notice is given to the Company no later than six 
weeks before an AGM or no later than the date on which the 
notice of an AGM is given, shareholders representing at least 
5 per cent of the total voting rights of all the shareholders who 
have a right to vote at the AGM or at least 100 shareholders who 
have that right and who hold shares in the Company on which 
there has been paid up an average sum per shareholder of at 
least £100, may require the Company to include an item in the 
business to be dealt with at the AGM.
Dividends
Subject to the provisions of the 2006 Act, the Company may, 
by ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be paid to the 
shareholders but the amount of the dividend may not exceed 
the amount recommended by the directors. The directors may 
also pay interim dividends on any class of shares on any dates 
and in any amounts and in respect of any periods as appear 
to the directors to be justified by the distributable profits of the 
Company.
l iquidation
If the Company is wound up the liquidator may, with the sanction 
of a special resolution of the Company, and any other sanction 
required by law, divide amongst the shareholders the whole 
or any part of the assets of the Company. He may, for such 
purposes, set such value as he deems fair upon any property 
to be divided and may determine how such division shall be 
carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of 
shareholders. The liquidator may also transfer the whole or any 
part of such assets to trustees to be held in trust for the benefit 
of the shareholders. No shareholder can be compelled to accept 
any shares or other securities which would give him any liability.
MoDIFI c At Ion oF r IGhts
If at any time the capital of the Company is divided into different 
classes of shares, the rights attached to any class or any of such 
rights may be modified, abrogated, or varied either:
(a) with the consent of the holders of 75 per cent of the issued 
 shares of that class; or
(b) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate 
 general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class.  
The rights attached to any class of shares shall not (unless 
otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that 
class or by the terms upon which such shares are for the time 
being held) be deemed to be modified or varied by the creation 
or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, convert any paid-up 
shares into stock, and reconvert any stock into paid-up shares 
of any denomination.
t r AnsF er o F sh Ares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of securities in 
the Company, or on the size of a shareholder’s holding, which 
are both governed by the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. In accordance with the Listing, Prospectus, and 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, certain employees are required to seek the approval of 
the Company to deal in its shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.
Subject to the 2006 Act, the directors may refuse to register any 
transfer of any share which is not fully paid (whether certificated 
or uncertificated), provided that the refusal does not prevent 
dealing in shares in the Company from taking place on an open 
and proper basis.
The directors may also decline to register the transfer of any 
certificated share unless the instrument of transfer is duly 
stamped (if stampable) and accompanied by the certificate 
of the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as 
the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be conducted through 
CREST and the directors can refuse to register transfers in 
accordance with the regulations governing the operation of 
CREST.
All share transfers must be registered as soon as practicable. 
Appo Int Ment A nD repl Ace Ment o F DIrectors
The Board must comprise of not less than three and no 
more than twelve directors. Directors may be appointed by 
shareholders (by ordinary resolution) or by the Board. Further 
information regarding the re-election of directors can be found 
on page 47 in the Corporate Governance report.
No person other than a director retiring at a general meeting 
shall, unless recommended by the directors for election, be 
eligible for election to the office of director unless, not less than 
seven nor more than 21 days beforehand, the Company has 
been given notice, executed by a shareholder eligible to vote at 
the meeting, of his intention to propose such person for election 
together with a notice executed by that person of his willingness 
to be elected. business review

Mr Balfour retired from the Board on 18 May 2011.
On 1 January 2011, David Paterson and Dougie Sutherland were 
appointed as executive directors and Keith Ludeman as a non-
executive director. 
Patrick Balfour retired from the Board following the conclusion 
of the 2011 AGM. He was succeeded as Senior Independent 
Director by David Trapnell, and David Thorpe took over from 
Mr Trapnell as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The directors acknowledge the new Corporate Governance 
Code provision which encourages board members to stand for 
annual re-election at the AGM and for the first time at the AGM 
on 16 May 2012 each director will submit himself for re-election. 
The directors’ beneficial interests in, and options to acquire, 
ordinary shares in the Company at the year end are set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 59 to 62 of this 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Between the year end and the date of this report, Steven Dance, 
David Paterson, Adrian Ringrose and Dougie Sutherland have 
notified the Company that they have purchased an additional 
82 shares each pursuant to the Interserve Share Incentive Plan 
2009. Further details are disclosed on page 59 in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. There have been no further changes in 
the shareholdings of the directors who held office at the year 
end.
The directors do not have any interest in any other Group 
company, other than as directors. No director has, or has had, 
a material interest, directly or indirectly, at any time during the 
year under review in any contract significant to the Company’s 
business.
On 26 September 2007 the rules of the Interserve Pension 
Scheme were amended in order to provide the directors 
of Interserve Trustees Limited, the corporate trustee of the 
Interserve Pension Scheme, with a qualifying pension scheme 
indemnity to the extent that insurance has not been taken out 
by the trustee to cover its liabilities, or such liabilities cannot 
be paid from the proceeds of any insurance taken out by the 
trustee. That qualifying pension scheme indemnity remains in 
force at the date of this report and is available for inspection by 
shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
In January 2011 an indemnity was given to the trustees of the 
Douglas Group Compass Pension Plan for any claim, costs, 
loss, damages and expenses which may be made against 
them or which they may pay or incur (save as a consequence 
of breach of trust committed knowingly and intentionally or as a 
result of negligence) in connection with the administration of the 
Plan and the winding-up of the Plan.  Two of the trustees were 
also directors of one or more Group subsidiary companies. This 
Plan was formally wound up on 7 January 2011.
In January 2012 an indemnity was given to the trustees of 
the Interserve Retirement Plan against all and any claims, 
costs, damages and expenses which may be made against 
them or which they may pay or incur in connection with their 
administration of the Plan and the winding-up of the Plan (other 
than liabilities arising as a consequence of breach of trust 
committed knowingly and intentionally).  One of the trustees was 
also a director of various Group subsidiary companies. This Plan 
was formally wound up on 31 January 2012.

The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counter parties to exercise termination rights in the event of a 
change of control in the Company:
•  Under the terms of the banking facility agreements listed 
on page 26 of the Financial Review, if any person, or group 
of persons acting in concert, gains control of the Company 
any lender (i) is no longer obliged to fund any loan, save for 
a rollover loan; and (ii) may, by not less than 15 days’ notice, 
cancel its commitment under the facility and declare its 
participation in all outstanding loans, together with accrued 
interest and all other amounts payable under the facility, 
immediately due and repayable.
The Group’s share schemes also contain provisions relating to 
the vesting and exercising of awards/options in the event of a 
change of control of the Group.
There are no provisions in the directors’ service agreements nor 
in any employees’ contracts providing for compensation for loss 
of office or employment occurring because of a takeover.

Charitable donations made by the Company during the 
year amounted to £40,610 (2010: £40,785). Details of the 
beneficiaries of donations are given on page 33 in the charitable 
giving section of the Sustainability Review.
No political donations were made during the period  
(2010: £nil). It is not the Company’s policy to make cash 
donations to political parties. This policy is strictly adhered to 
and there is no intention to change it. However, the definitions 
used in the 2006 Act for “political donation” and “political 
expenditure” remain very broad, which may have the effect of 
covering a number of normal business activities that would not 
be considered political donations or political expenditure in the 
usual sense. These could include support for bodies engaged 
in law reform or governmental policy review or involvement in 
seminars and functions that may be attended by politicians. 
To avoid any possibility of inadvertently contravening the 2006 
Act, the directors are again seeking shareholder authority at the 
AGM (Resolution 17) to ensure that the Company acts within 
the provisions of current UK law when carrying out its normal 
business activities.

It is the Group’s normal practice to agree payment terms with 
its suppliers and abide by those terms. Payment becomes due 
when it can be confirmed that goods and/or services have been 
provided in accordance with the relevant contractual conditions. 
The Group’s trade creditor days at 31 December 2011 were 
82 days (2010: 76 days). The Company’s trade creditor days 
at 31 December 2011 (calculated in accordance with the 2006 
Act) were 19 days (2010: three days). This represents the 
ratio, expressed in days, between the amounts invoiced to the 
Company in the year by its suppliers and the amounts due, at 
the year end, to trade creditors falling due for payment within 
one year.

o ur Diversity policy states:
“Diversity in all its forms is fundamental to the Group’s business. 
We operate in a variety of environments and geographies, in 
numerous roles, for a wide range of clients. To do this effectively 
we need an equally diverse workforce that understands our 
customers’ needs and stimulates innovative solutions.
Interserve values the benefits it gains from an international 
workforce with a rich diversity of skills, cultural backgrounds 
and gender. Our goal is to recruit, motivate, develop and retain 
outstanding people that reflect that diversity. We are committed 
to ensuring that every employee has equal opportunity to 
develop and progress at every level in the organisation based 
on personal contribution and ability, with the aim over time 
of realising the benefits of diversity in the development of our 
management and executive leadership. We will continue to 
monitor the extent to which our staff believe we are meeting this 
objective and are committed to taking action where necessary 
or helpful to promote equal opportunity.
The Group Board believes that diversity can bring insights and 
behaviours that make a valuable contribution to its performance. 
In considering new members, we will aim to select individuals 
best able to contribute to an effective, challenging and cohesive 
Board by blending a diversity of skills, experience, knowledge, 
independence, cultural background and gender. Given 
constraints on the size of the Board, this will be achieved by 
taking into account the overall contribution to diversity alongside 
other desired characteristics in new appointments rather than by 
setting specific targets on any single dimension of diversity. We 
would expect this to lead to greater diversity on the Group Board 
and divisional boards over time. We will monitor our success 
in developing the diversity of the Board as part of our annual 
evaluation of Board effectiveness.”
Our Construction business was the first construction company 
to be awarded the Investors in Diversity accreditation by the 
National Centre for Diversity.

the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The Report has been prepared solely for existing members 
of the Company in compliance with UK company law and the 
Listing, Prospectus, and Disclosure and Transparency Rules of 
the FSA. The Company, the directors and employees accept 
no responsibility to any other person for anything contained 
in the Report. The directors’ liability for the Report is limited, 
as provided in the 2006 Act. The Company’s auditors report 
to the Board whether, in their opinion, the information given in 
the Report is consistent with the financial statements, but the 
Report is not audited. Statements made in this Report reflect 
the knowledge and information available at the time of its 
preparation. The Report contains forward-looking statements 
in respect of the Group’s operations, performance, prospects 
and financial condition. By their nature, these statements 
involve uncertainty. In particular, outcomes often differ from 
plans or expectations expressed through forward-looking 
statements, and such differences may be significant. Assurance 
cannot be given that any particular expectation will be met. 
No responsibility is accepted to update or revise any forward-
looking statement, resulting from new information, future events 
or otherwise. Liability arising from anything in this Annual Report

corporate Governance
Dear Shareholder
The Board and management of Interserve Plc are committed to high standards of corporate governance. We recognise the role 
which strong governance provides in shaping and delivering effective strategy, managing risks and safeguarding shareholder 
interests.
The replacement of the Combined Code by the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 29 June 2010 means that the Company is reporting upon compliance with the new Code provisions for the first time in this 
report.
The Board provides entrepreneurial leadership, sets and subsequently keeps under review the overall Group strategy and monitors 
operational and financial performance.  In addition, it sets the core values and ethical standards, the key tenets of which are 
contained in ‘Conducting business with Interserve’, which sets out clearly how employees are expected to behave and applies across 
the Group.
In fulfilling its role we believe it is valuable for the Board to combine the knowledge and diverse experience of both executive and non-
executive directors, within an open and challenging Board culture.  Executive directors are appointed to the Board on merit, reflecting 
their ability to contribute as directors to the full range of issues and Board responsibilities. The two additional executive appointments 
at the start of 2011 fully met those criteria and have added considerably to the strength of the Board. Although these additions 
have resulted in us no longer having a majority of non-executive directors, I am satisfied – both through my own observations and 
our annual Board review – that the strength and independence of the non-executive Board members and our open style of debate 
continues to provide a fully effective governance check within the Board while maintaining the overall Board size at an optimum level. 
The Board fully embraces the belief that diversity in all its forms can bring insights and behaviours that make a valuable contribution 
to its performance. Our Board currently brings valuable diversity in executive and professional experience, but in considering new 
appointments we will seek further to widen our diversity. Our criteria are to appoint those individuals best able to contribute to an 
effective, challenging and cohesive Board taking into account the benefits of board diversity in its widest sense. We will monitor our 
success in developing the diversity of the Board as part of our annual evaluation of Board effectiveness.
Following the Company’s re-admission to the FTSE 250 on 21 September 2011, the Board is proposing to offer all its members for 
re-election at our 2012 AGM.

The Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”) requires the 
Company to disclose how it has applied the principles of 
the Code and whether there has been compliance with its 
provisions throughout the financial year. In the case of non-
compliance, the Company must specify those provisions with 
which it has not complied and give reasons for this. The Code 
may be found on the FRC website (www.frc.org.uk).
The directors consider that the Company has complied fully 
with the provisions of the Code applicable to it throughout the 
accounting period ended 31 December 2011 with the following 
exception:
• Provision B.1.2 of the Code requires at least half the board, 
excluding the Chairman, to comprise non-executive directors 
determined by the board to be independent. The Board 
comprised six executive and five non-executive directors plus 
the Chairman until the retirement of Patrick Balfour on 
18 May 2011 at the conclusion of the AGM. The Board 
believes that the diversity of skills and experience which 
the executive directors bring to the Board (particularly in 
relation to their own operating divisions) is more valuable 
than maintaining parity between the number of executive and 
non-executive directors. Furthermore, the Board considers 
its non-executive directors to be sufficiently independent and 
of such calibre and number that their views may be expected 
to be of sufficient weight that no individual or small group can 
dominate the Board’s decision-making processes.
the Bo Ar D
o peration of the Board 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision, whilst day-to-day operational decisions are managed 
by the Executive Board, as referred to on page 47.
In order to facilitate the efficient use of its time the Board has 
delegated certain of its powers to Board committees, details of 
which are set out later in this report. From time to time the Board 
also establishes certain other committees to deal with a specific 
issue which the Board has approved.
Key matters dealt with by the Board during the course of the year, 
in addition to ongoing monitoring of the operational and financial 
performance of the Group, were:
•	 setting the health, safety and environmental targets for the 
Group;
•	 reviewing the Group’s strategic direction, governance, ethics 
and values;
•	 setting the Group’s annual budget and plan;
•	 approval of the annual and half-year report;
•	 declaration of the interim and recommendation of the final 
dividend;
•	 ensuring the maintenance of a sound system of internal controls 
and an effective risk management and assurance strategy;
•	 monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s Health and Safety 
Policy;
•	 control over major acquisitions (including joint ventures), 
disposals and capital expenditure;
•	 implementation of a Board Diversity Policy;
•	 implementation of a Group-wide Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy;
•	 reviewing the results of the employee survey; and
•	 reviewing succession planning across the Group’s senior 
management.
Board composition and independence
The role of the Group Chairman and Chief Executive are split 
and clearly defined in written terms of reference. The Group 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board and 
creating the conditions for overall Board and individual director 
effectiveness, both inside and outside the boardroom. The Chief 
Executive bears primary responsibility for the management of 
the Company and of the Group and in leading the formulation 
of and, once set by the Board, implementing the strategy for the 
Group. The Chief Executive chairs the Executive Board and Risk 
Committee, leads the executive management team and investor 
communications and is responsible for social and ethical matters 
within the Group.
The Group Chairman and the non-executive directors are 
considered by the Board to be independent in character and 
judgement and free from any relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their 
judgement.
The non-executive directors have complementary skills, 
experience and qualifications in a wide range of economic 
sectors and so are able to bring independent judgement to bear 
on matters for consideration.
On 1 January 2011 David Paterson and Dougie Sutherland were 
appointed executive directors and Keith Ludeman appointed 
as a non-executive director. At the AGM on 18 May 2011 
Patrick Balfour retired from the Board, David Trapnell succeeded 
him as Senior Independent Director and David Thorpe was 
appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
As Senior Independent Director, David Trapnell is available to 
shareholders should they have any concerns which contact 
through other channels has failed to resolve or for which such 
contact may be inappropriate.  He also provides a sounding 
board for the Chairman and serves as an intermediary for the 
other directors when necessary.
As at 31 December 2011 the Board comprised of eleven 
members: the Group Chairman, six executive and four non-
executive directors.
meetings 
The Board normally meets monthly throughout the year and on 
an ad hoc basis to consider any matters which are time-critical. 
Attendance at Board and committee meetings is set out in the 
table overleaf.
The Board also holds a strategy day in January each year to 
review the strategic direction of the Group.
The Group Chairman held one formal session with the non-
executive directors without any executive directors being present 
and a number of informal discussions both with and without the 
Chief Executive being present. The non-executive directors also 
met once during the year, under the chairmanship of the Senior 
Independent Director, without either the Group Chairman or the 
executive directors being present.  46 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    GovernAnce    corporA te GovernAnce

 Mr G P Balfour retired from the Board on 18 May 2011
The Group Chairman, assisted by the Company Secretary, 
sets the agenda for Board meetings. The Group Chairman also 
ensures that Board members receive timely information and 
are briefed on issues arising at Board meetings to assist them 
in making an effective contribution. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for distributing Board papers and other information 
sufficiently far in advance of each meeting for the directors to be 
properly briefed, presenting certain papers to the Board and its 
committees, advising on Board procedures and ensuring the 
Board follows them.
The Board papers include information from management on 
financial, business and corporate issues. Matters requiring 
Board and committee approval are generally the subject of a 
written proposal and circulated as part of the Board papers.
Appointments to the Board
On appointment, new directors take part in an induction 
programme arranged by the Company Secretary. As part of this 
programme, Keith Ludeman, David Paterson and 
Dougie Sutherland received a detailed induction from the 
Company Secretary. In addition, Mr Ludeman undertook visits 
to sites covering all four of the Group’s UK divisional operations in 
order to gain an appreciation of, and familiarise himself with, the 
business of the Group. David Paterson and Dougie Sutherland, 
having already completed the Group’s private company director 
training course, were provided with specific training on the 
duties of a listed company director by the Group’s lawyers, 
Ashurst LLP . 
Given constraints on the size of the Board, board diversity will be 
achieved by taking into account the overall contribution to diversity 
alongside other desired characteristics in new appointments 
rather than by setting specific targets on any single dimension of 
diversity. The Board expects this to lead to greater diversity on the 
Board and in the divisional boards over time.
Historically, equipment and construction services were industries 
into which women did not enter in great numbers. However, 
the Board is encouraged that around half of all graduates now 
recruited by its Construction division are women. The support 
services industry has been more popular with women, thus 
Support Services has more women in senior roles.
 
During the course of the year the Board reviewed what initiatives 
were in place within the Group to develop gender diversity and 
reviewed feedback from the biennial employee survey which 
included, amongst other things, data on equality of treatment 
and gender engagement. 
commitment and development
There is an ongoing programme of site visits by the Group 
Chairman and executive directors which provides additional 
opportunities over and above the programme of Board site 
visits for the non-executive directors to visit various operations 
of the Group. The Group Chairman has also held a number 
of lunchtime meetings with invited managers from across the 
Company and its UK subsidiaries at which they were given 
the opportunity to discuss their work and talk freely about any 
issues of concern.
Presentations were made to the Board during the year covering 
topics of special significance. In addition, as part of an ongoing 
programme, the Board undertook three one-day visits covering 
a number of the Group’s operational sites in the UK and a three-
day visit encompassing all the Group’s operations in Qatar.
The majority of the non-executive directors attended one or 
more briefings or seminars relevant to their role during the year 
under review and each director completed the Group’s online 
anti-bribery and corruption training.
During the year a Group-wide leadership programme designed 
to support the strategic aims of the Company was introduced. 
The programme seeks to accelerate the development of high 
performing and high potential senior leaders. The learning 
experience involves a highly interactive process of exchanging 
new ideas, sound advice, tools and techniques, business 
concepts and best practices with tutors, mentors, coaches and 
peers from across the Interserve business.  Teamwork, involving 
community and business projects, insight workshops, mentoring 
and coaching, is a key component of the programme. 
Participants in the leadership programme are also provided 
with an opportunity to contribute to the development of the 
Group and offered a comprehensive way of exploring business 
issues and opportunities. As participants practise their own 
personal leadership style, they develop further insights and 
entrepreneurial and relationship skills to evaluate, develop and 
manage new business opportunities to provide sustainable 
growth and increased shareholder value.
Information and support
Individual directors may, after consultation with the Group 
Chairman, take independent legal advice in furtherance of their 
duties at the Company’s expense up to a limit of £10,000 in relation 
to any one event. In the case of the Group Chairman he must 
consult with the Senior Independent Director. All directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, 
whose appointment or removal is a matter reserved for the approval 
of the Board or any duly delegated committee thereof.  business review

Board performance evaluation
During the course of the year the performance of the directors 
was reviewed by the Group Chairman and the Chief Executive 
and, in the case of the Chief Executive, by the Group Chairman, 
having consulted with other directors. The Group Chairman’s 
performance was reviewed by the Senior Independent Director 
who held separate meetings with each of the directors and the 
Company Secretary. 
The overall time commitment of the non-executive directors in 
the attendance of Board meetings/visits was in the order of 
16 days in addition to the time taken to read Board papers 
and attend the four meetings held by the Group Chairman.
The Board also conducted a formal and thorough evaluation of 
its own performance with particular emphasis on the progress 
against the strategic objectives set at the strategy day. The 
evaluation identified:
•	 ways in which the operational performance could be more 
succinctly reported;
•	 an improved structure for meeting agendas;
•	 improvements in the Board evaluation process; 
•	 a desire to enhance the diversity of the Board; and 
•	 means of improving the effectiveness of communication with 
both investors and the wider business community.
The Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees also 
conducted a review of their terms of reference and their 
performance against them.
r e-election
With a considerable number of directors already standing for 
election or re-election in 2011 it was not felt necessary to move 
to annual re-election of all directors at that time. However, all 
directors will submit themselves for re-election at the next AGM 
on 16 May 2012.  
Biographical details for each of the directors standing for re-
election are set out on pages 36 and 37.
Indemnities
As permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association, 
qualifying third party indemnities have been in place throughout 
the period under review and remain in force at the date of 
this report in respect of liabilities suffered or incurred by each 
director. The Company also undertakes to loan such funds to a 
director as it, in its reasonable discretion, considers appropriate 
for the director to meet expenditure incurred by him in defending 
any criminal or civil proceeding or in connection with any 
application under section 661(3) or 1157 of the Companies 
Act 2006 on terms which require repayment by the director of 
amounts so advanced upon conviction of final judgment being 
given against him. The deeds of indemnity are available for 
inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office. 
The Company also maintains an appropriate level of directors’ 
and officers’ insurance in respect of legal actions against the 
directors. Neither the qualifying third party indemnities nor 
the insurance provide cover where the director has acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
execut Ive Bo Ar D
Below the Board is the Executive Board which comprises all the 
executive directors and the Company Secretary.  It is chaired by 
the Chief Executive. 
The Executive Board, which met 11 times during the course of 
the year, is responsible for the operational management and 
delivery against budget and forecast of the Group, implementing 
resolutions of the Board, formulation of strategy, annual 
budgets and other proposals for consideration by the Board, 
the identification and evaluation for consideration by the Board 
of risks faced by the Group and for designing, operating and 
monitoring a suitable system of internal control embracing the 
policies adopted by the Board. It is also responsible for devising 
and implementing suitable policies and procedures for health 
and safety, environmental, social and ethical, treasury, human 
resources and information technology.

t erms of reference
The committee has written terms of reference based on the FRC’s 
Guidance on Audit Committees and which set out clearly its 
authority and duties. These are available on the Company’s website 
at www.interserve.com and on request. The terms of reference 
are considered at least annually by the committee and were most 
recently amended in November 2010 to take account of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and approved by the Board.
meetings
The committee met five times during the year. The external 
auditors were present at four of the meetings and the Head of 
Internal Audit and representatives from PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (“PwC”), the provider of the internal audit function, were 
present at four and two of the meetings, respectively. The Group 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group 
Financial Controller attended the meetings by invitation.
The committee has taken the opportunity to seek the views of 
the external and internal auditors in private and both the external 
and internal auditors have the opportunity to address the 
committee in private at any time should they so wish.
o verview of actions
During the year the committee: 
•	 reviewed the 2010 annual report and financial statements and 
the 2011 half-year report. As part of this review the committee 
received a report from the external auditors on their audit of 
the 2010 annual report and their review of the 2011 half-year 
report;
•	 reviewed and approved the external auditors’ terms of 
engagement for the 2011 half-yearly review and for the audit of 
the 2011 annual report;
•	 received a briefing on audit matters from the auditors 
describing their approach to and scope of the audit, explaining 
their responsibilities regarding corporate governance and the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and their independence 
policies and procedures which encompassed their safeguards 
and procedures, remuneration and evaluation policies and the 
revisions to the APB ethical standards; 
•	 made a recommendation to the Board that the external 
auditors should continue in office for the next financial year;
•	 reviewed proposed changes to the Group’s internal controls;
•	 received a report from the external auditors on, and 
considered the effectiveness of, the Group’s accounting and 
internal control systems and monitored the actions taken by 
management in response;
•	 reviewed, prior to their consideration by the Board, the 
representation letters to be given to the external auditors 
in respect of the 2010 annual report and the 2011 half-year 
report;
•	 considered and agreed the scope and fees to be paid to the 
external auditors;
•	 reviewed the annual report and accounts for the Interserve 
Pension Scheme;
•	 received updates on new accounting developments, 
regulation and best practice; 
•	 monitored non-audit fees in comparison to the audit fees;
•	 reviewed audit effectiveness following the audit of the 2010 
annual report;
•	 reviewed the extent of the Group’s control over joint ventures 
and associated companies; and 
•	 reviewed its own effectiveness and its terms of reference.
The committee chairman reported to the Board on the work 
carried out by the committee, including any improvement 
actions required, and copies of the minutes of its meetings were 
included within the Board papers.
external audit
The committee considers and makes recommendations to the 
Board as regards audit matters. The committee also seeks to 
ensure co-ordination between the activities of the external and 
internal auditors and reviews the effectiveness of the audit at the 
end of the audit cycle.
external auditor objectivity and independence
As required by its terms of reference, the committee assessed 
the external auditors’ objectivity and independence and the 
effectiveness of the external audit process in March 2011 at the 
end of the 2010 audit cycle and again in December 2011 and 
concluded that Deloitte LLP remain independent. To assist the 
committee with its assessment of auditor independence, the 
committee has a policy which prohibits the auditors auditing their 
own work, making management decisions, entering into any 
arrangement in relation to audit work whereby a joint interest is 
created between the Company and the auditors in the outcome 
of the instruction, acting in the role of advocate for the Company 
or being appointed as recruitment consultants to the Company 
without the committee’s prior consent. The policy also contains 
a set of authority limits governing the award by management of 
various categories of non-audit work to the auditors.
The committee concluded from the regular reports it received that 
the nature and extent of non-audit fees, which related primarily to 
tax and VAT advice offered by Deloitte and the review of the half-
year report and which amounted to 17 per cent and 7 per cent 
of the overall audit fees, respectively (excluding accountancy and 
transactional advice given with regard to the aborted acquisition 
of Mouchel Group plc – which amounted to 48 per cent of the 
overall audit fee), did not compromise auditor independence. 
In all cases work performed by Deloitte was approved in line with 
Group policy.  In the case of the work on the aborted acquisition 
of Mouchel the committee concluded that Deloitte’s expertise 
and experience and knowledge of the Group made them best 
placed to efficiently deliver the service.  The committee was 
satisfied that the safeguards implemented by Deloitte, including 
the use of specialists independent of the audit, were sufficient to 
maintain auditor objectivity and independence.
Further details of the audit and non-audit fees paid to the 
auditors are included in note 4 to the financial statements on 
page 82. 
A change in audit partner is made every five years when the 
audit partner is rotated off the audit in accordance with latest 
guidance and best practice. A new audit partner was appointed 
in 2009 following interviews with the committee and the Group 
Finance Director. Any decision to open the external audit to 
tender is taken on the recommendation of the committee. 
There were no contractual obligations that acted to restrict the 
committee’s choice of external auditors.  business review

Internal audit
The function of internal audit is to provide an objective appraisal 
to the Board, through the Audit Committee, of the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the processes established to control the 
business and to assist the Board in meeting its objectives and 
discharging its responsibilities.
The internal audit programme of work was developed by PwC, 
based on interviews with executive management and the 
operational and finance management teams. The details of the 
internal audit programme are submitted to the Audit Committee 
for approval, and may be modified (subject to agreement of the 
Audit Committee) based on changing circumstances.
The overall internal audit programme is risk based. This means 
that a sub-set of all the business activities and financial reporting 
processes are subject to internal audit review each year.
The committee received a summary of each internal audit review 
covering the findings and proposed corrective actions for any 
gaps in the control environment that may have been found. 
The committee is required to approve the internal audit plan, 
monitor and assess its role and effectiveness in the overall 
context of the Company’s and the Group’s risk management 
system, review and assess the scope of and progress 
against the internal audit work plan and review and monitor 
management’s responsiveness to the internal auditor’s findings 
and recommendations. 
Reports received by the committee during the year in 
accordance with the 2011 internal audit plan covered matters 
such as: 
•	 the outcome of a back-to-basics review of the key controls 
within each business unit in the Group;
•	 reviews of tendering and bidding, payroll, HR functions, 
contract management, service delivery, work-in-progress and 
accrued income, procure to pay controls, financial controls 
health check, corporation tax and VAT controls, design and 
quotation procedures, key controls and a company car 
scheme in various parts of the business; 
•	 a review of investment portfolio management; and
•	 a review of Group Pensions Administration.
The committee agreed an internal audit work plan for 2012, 
which builds upon the work conducted over the previous two 
years, the objectives of which are to:
•	 provide assurance that certain existing and emerging key risks 
facing the Group as a whole or which are common to several 
businesses within the Group are being managed effectively;
•	 confirm that the Group’s core assurance procedures are 
being operated as intended, whether documented or 
undocumented, in accordance with good practice; and
•	 support the management and mitigation of key risks in 
specific businesses to confirm that they are being mitigated 
to a sufficient degree so as not to threaten the achievement 
of Group objectives or the sustainability of the individual 
businesses.
The committee also received reports on investigations 
conducted and actions taken as a result of notifications made 
under the Group’s whistle-blowing policy.
o verview
After undertaking a review of its own performance the 
committee concluded that it had been effective in discharging 
the obligations entrusted to it by the Board.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the 
AGM to answer questions about the work of the committee.

conflict or possibly may conflict with the interests of the Company.
The committee met twice during the year and reviewed the 
interests declared by each director which conflicted or may 
possibly conflict with the interests of the Company and the terms 
of the authorisations given in respect of those interests.  The 
committee reported its findings to the Board and in each case 
the Board concluded that the authorisations given, and the 
terms which had been applied thereto, remained appropriate.

The Board has overall responsibility for internal control, including 
risk management, the ongoing review of their effectiveness 
and sets appropriate policies having regard to the objectives 
of the Group. It formally reviews the Group’s register of risks 
and mitigation plans twice a year and discusses any significant 
developments in risk exposure as and when appropriate.
As discussed on page 47 , the Executive Board has a key role 
in risk management.  In order to assist it with discharging this 
responsibility the Executive Board constituted a Risk Committee.
The committee, which met four times during the year, comprises 
the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Head of Internal 
Audit (until September 2011), Group Health, Safety and 
Environmental Manager, Group Insurance Manager, the Group 
Company Secretary (who is its secretary) and a representative 
from each of the Group’s operating divisions. It has written terms 
of reference and provides copies of its meeting minutes to the 
Board.
The business covered during the year included a review of the 
Group’s pandemic influenza, business continuity and IT disaster 
recovery plans and testing, the risks presented by forthcoming 
legislation, bi-annual reviews of the Group’s prime risk areas and 
information security management.

c ontrol processes 
The Board has a continuous process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks the Group faces together 
with an ongoing process to embed internal control and risk 
management further into the operations of the businesses. This 
has been in place for the period under review and until the date 
of approval of this Annual Report and Financial Statements. The 
Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and Executive Board 
assist the Board in the application of these principles.
The Board has documented a risk management policy setting 
out the prime risk areas including the threats, risk indicators, 
control strategy and sources of assurance. The policy is included 
within the Group’s internal controls manual. Internal controls are 
normally reviewed by the Board in advance of the publication of 
the half-year and annual reports.
The Board received and reviewed bi-annual reports from the 
Executive Board on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control for the period under review and has implemented 
improvements from time to time in order to strengthen the 
control processes. 
Because of the limitations that are inherent in any system 
of internal control, the Group’s system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. 
The Group’s governance framework distinguishes between 
entities which are wholly controlled and joint ventures and 
associate companies in which the Group does not have overall 
control. For these joint-ventures and associate companies, 
systems of internal control are applied as agreed between the 
Group and the other joint-venture parties or members of the 
associate company, as the case may be. 
f inancial reporting
Based on submissions from the trading divisions, a budget is 
prepared by the Group for approval by the Board before the 
start of each financial year. Subsequently, based on submissions 
from the trading divisions, forecasts of prospective financial 
performance are prepared by the Group for approval by the 
Board as at the end of March, May and September of each year. 
Budgets and forecasts include the financial results, financial 
position and cash flows for each division and the Group Centre. business review

The Group has documented the accounting policies to be 
applied by all entities in the Group in submitting their financial 
statements for consolidation. These accounting policies are in 
compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards and 
are available on the Group’s intranet.
Each month, entities within the Group submit management 
accounts in local currency to the Group Finance team. The 
Group Finance team translates foreign currency submissions 
into sterling using published exchange rates, eliminates all 
intercompany trading and balances, and then prepares 
the consolidated management accounts of the Group. The 
consolidated management accounts include the financial results, 
financial position, cash flows and projections and are submitted 
to the Executive Board and subsequently the Board for review. 
Analysis is included on monthly and year-to-date financial data 
compared with the latest budgets or forecasts approved by 
the Board and also compared with prior year data. Analysis is 
prepared on both a divisional and consolidated basis. 
The management accounts of the Group are accompanied by a 
written report from the Group Finance Director explaining operating 
and financial performance, the cause and effect of variance from 
the approved budgets and forecasts and other information that may 
be relevant from time to time. The written report includes analysis 
on both a divisional and consolidated basis.
Monthly written divisional trading reports on the performance of 
each division are provided as part of the Board papers. These 
are then updated by oral reports from the executive directors at 
each Board meeting. 
The management accounts submitted by members of the Group 
for June and December are used to prepare the half-yearly and 
annual financial statements. The Group Finance team reviews 
the disclosures in the financial statements to ensure that they 
comply with the latest reporting standards adopted for use in the 
EU and seeks to ensure they are clear and understandable to 
the readers. The half-yearly and annual financial statements are 
reviewed by the Executive Board, the Audit Committee and the 
Board before publication.
The financial reporting process is reviewed periodically by 
internal audit in accordance with the programme approved by 
the Audit Committee each year. 
A summary of the key financial risks inherent in the Group’s 
business is given on page 29 and a description of how the 
Group manages those risks is set out on page 23. 
o perational controls
The principal features of the Group’s system of operational 
control are:
•	 An established management structure comprising the Board 
with its various committees and an Executive Board.
•	 Executive Board and Board review of the monthly finance and 
divisional trading reports. The Board determines appropriate 
action based on these reviews.
•	 Documented delegated authority limits from the Board to the 
Executive Board which are kept under regular review. Larger 
value proposals and business acquisitions and disposals are 
controlled by the Board.
•	 Manuals setting out Group policy and procedures, with which 
all Group companies must comply. These manuals set out 
the necessary levels of authorisation applicable for different 
transactions.
•	 The Group has certain key areas which are subject to 
central management or control, which include Company and 
subsidiary health, safety and environmental, legal, insurance, 
treasury, real estate, internal and external communication, 
and company secretarial. These functions report to members 
of the Executive Board and operate within defined limits and 
levels of authority.
•	 One or more members of the Executive Board and, in many 
cases, either the Chief Executive or the Group Finance 
Director, attend divisional board meetings.
•	 During the course of each year members of the Executive 
Board or other senior operational and financial management 
visit or review all trading companies, including those located 
overseas, to discuss and monitor the performance of those 
businesses.
•	 The Group has in place a whistle-blowing policy together with 
a Group response plan to set out a framework for dealing with 
any allegations of fraud, financial misreporting and any whistle-
blowing notification. A copy of the policy is available on the 
Company’s website at www.interserve.com.

The Company encourages two-way communication with 
both institutional and private investors. The Chief Executive, 
accompanied by the Group Finance Director, attended 53 
meetings with analysts and institutional investors during the year 
ended 31 December 2011. In addition, the Chief Executive, the 
Group Finance Director and the Group Chairman, accompanied 
by another member of staff or a representative from one of the 
Company’s joint brokers, attended a further 38, 39 and one 
meeting each, respectively.   
The Chief Executive arranges for the Company’s brokers 
to produce periodic notes of the feedback from institutional 
investors which are reported to the Board. All directors and the 
members of the Executive Board also have the opportunity to 
attend analyst briefings.
The Group’s annual and half-yearly results, interim management 
statements, trading updates and all announcements made 
through the RIS are published on the Company’s website at 
www.interserve.com. Copies of the presentations given to 
analysts on the announcement of the half-yearly and final results 
are also posted on the Company’s website.
Shareholders are also kept up to date with Company affairs 
through the annual and half-year reports, trading updates and 
the Company’s website.
All shareholders are given at least 20 working days’ notice of 
the AGM. It is standard practice for all directors to attend the 
AGM to which all shareholders are invited and at which they may 
put questions to the chairmen of the various committees or the 
Board generally. The proxy votes for and against each resolution, 
as well as abstentions (which may be recorded on the proxy 
form accompanying the notice of AGM) are counted before the 
AGM commences and are made available to shareholders at the 
close of the formal business of the meeting. The proxy votes are 
also announced through the RIS and posted on the Company’s 
website shortly after the close of the meeting. 52 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    GovernAnce     DIrectors’ remunerA tIon report
Directors’ r emuneration r eport 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s annual report on directors’ remuneration.
The Group’s management has delivered good results in 2011 against the background of challenging global economic conditions. In 
particular, headline earnings per share has increased by 15.2 per cent and good progress was made on a number of strategic fronts. 
Our share price increased by 39 per cent over the year, outperforming our sector by 47.7 per cent.
During the year the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) was again mindful of the general restraint on pay across the Group. 
The salaries of the executive directors were increased by 2.5 per cent from 1 July 2011 which was broadly in line with the average 
increase in salaries across the entire business. 
Our remuneration policy has been adjusted in a couple of respects.  Following the implementation of the final changes to the taxation 
of pension schemes, the Committee conducted a review of the pension arrangements for the most senior executives within the UK. 
From July 2011 the employer contribution for the most senior executives was increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of basic 
salary (subject to an employee contribution of 8 per cent) and provisions were introduced to permit the employer contribution to be 
taken as a salary supplement by those whose pension savings reach the lifetime allowance.  
The performance conditions for the annual variable pay arrangements have been set such that only a performance materially ahead 
of market expectations in terms of normalised earnings per share (“EPS”) would attract a significant payout of variable pay.
During the year I also undertook an exercise which confirmed that the mix of EPS and total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance 
conditions attached to the Company’s Performance Share Plan was aligned to the Board’s strategic ambitions, which are to grow 
EPS in a sustainable manner and to deliver long-term superior returns to shareholders.
The Committee has also specifically examined the alignment of the policy on long-term incentives to the Board’s belief that the 
Company has the capability to double earnings per share over five years.  In consequence the policy under the Performance 
Share Plan has been amended so that the award level will be increased but at the same time subject to tougher EPS targets.  
The Committee, however, remains mindful to strike an appropriate balance between incentivising senior management, providing 
stretching targets which support the Board’s strategic ambitions whilst, at the same time, not encouraging excessive risk taking.  
Accordingly, to help mitigate risk, tougher shareholding guidelines for executives have been introduced.
The modest increase to pension contributions and the increased Performance Share Plan award level brings total remuneration 
closer to (but not in excess of) mid-market levels for similar sized FTSE 250 businesses.
Executive pay remains a highly topical issue and the Committee continues to monitor best practice and regulatory guidance to 
ensure that our policy retains a good link between reward to executives and the performance of the business.
A resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and I very much hope that 
you will vote in favour.

This report has been prepared by the Committee on behalf of, 
and has been approved by, the Board of Interserve Plc. The 
report complies with the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”) 
and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. It also 
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and explains how the Company has 
complied with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.  A resolution to approve this report will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the 
Company.
The Company’s auditors are required to report to the 
Company’s members on the auditable section of this report and 
to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 2006 Act. The report 
has therefore been divided into separate sections containing 
unaudited and audited information. Pages 53 to 57 of this report 
contain unaudited information and pages 58 to 62 (beginning 
with Directors’ Emoluments and Compensation and ending with 
Directors’ Share Interests) contain audited information.

The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration 
of all executive directors, the Group Chairman and the Company 
Secretary. The terms of reference of the Committee are available 
on the Company’s website at www.interserve.com and on 
request.
The Committee’s role is, after consultation with the Group 
Chairman and/or the Chief Executive (except where conflicted), 
to set the remuneration policy and determine the individual 
remuneration and benefit packages of the Group Chairman, the 
Chief Executive and the senior management team, comprising 
the executive directors, the Company Secretary and the other 
senior executives below the Board who report to the Chief 
Executive. This includes formulating for Board approval long-
term incentive plans which require shareholder consent and 
overseeing their operation. The Committee also monitors the 
terms of service for, and level and remuneration structure of, 
other senior management.
The non-executive directors who have served on the Committee 
during the year are:
Patrick Balfour  
Lord Blackwell 
Les Cullen
Keith Ludeman
David Thorpe
David Trapnell 
all of whom the Board regards as independent.  Following the 
AGM on 18 May 2011, Patrick Balfour retired from the Board and 
the Committee, and David Thorpe succeeded David Trapnell as 
Chairman of the Committee upon the latter’s appointment as the 
Senior Independent Director.
The Committee meets as often as is necessary to discharge 
its duties and met seven times during the year ended 
31 December 2011. The Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director are invited to attend meetings as appropriate. They 
are not present when matters affecting their own remuneration 
arrangements are decided.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest 
in the Company (other than as a shareholder), any conflict of 
interest arising from cross-directorships, or any day-to-day 
involvement in running the business.
In determining the executive directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee consulted with and received recommendations 
from Adrian Ringrose, the Chief Executive. The Committee also 
received advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street, a subsidiary of 
Aon Corporation, and Trevor Bradbury, the Company Secretary, 
which materially assisted the Committee in relation to the 2011 
financial year. Hewitt New Bridge Street also carried out work for 
the Company by conducting an assessment of its performance 
in relation to the TSR element of awards made under the 
Interserve Performance Share Plan 2006. Aon Corporation also 
provides insurance broking services to the Company. 
r emuner At Ion pol Icy
Executive directors’ remuneration packages are designed to 
attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to 
improve the Company’s performance, to align the interests of 
the executive directors with those of the shareholders and to 
reward them for enhancing shareholder value but without paying 
more than is necessary.
The determination of the executive directors’ annual 
remuneration packages is undertaken by the Committee in 
accordance with this policy, taking into account the level of pay 
awards made to all other employees of the Company and the 
salaried employees of its subsidiaries, and will be the subject of 
regular review on this basis during this and future financial years.
The main elements of the remuneration package for executive 
directors for 2012 and beyond will be:
•	 basic annual salary and benefits;
•	 annual variable pay with a requirement to invest a proportion 
in Company shares;
•	 participation in a long-term incentive plan – the Interserve 
Performance Share Plan 2006 (details of the performance 
conditions of which are set out on pages 54 to 56); and
•	 pension arrangements.
The chart below shows the proportionate breakdown of the 
package at below target, target and maximum performance.  
The chart shows that a significant proportion of the remuneration 
package comprises performance-linked elements and the extent 
to which the remuneration level is conditional upon the level of 
performance delivered.  In particular, the value of awards under 
the Performance Share Plan is targeted to form a significant 
proportion of the overall package at outstanding levels of 
performance, following the changes to the policy for 2012, as 
described in this report.

The Committee has reviewed the policy to establish whether 
there is any element of the remuneration policy which could 
potentially encourage executives to take inappropriate levels of 
risk. It is satisfied that the packages are appropriately balanced 
so that the executives can be rewarded under performance-
linked elements of the package, but that the targets which are 
set represent a complementary blend of metrics with target 
ranges which are stretching and designed to promote the long-
term success of the Company, but not so demanding as to lead 
to them taking excessive risk.
The Committee has reviewed and is satisfied that the 
remuneration policy supports the Company’s strategic ambitions 
and is linked appropriately to the long-term success of the 
business.  The Committee has chosen to base the incentive 
targets on the visible outputs of the strategy, namely requiring a 
sustained and significant improvement in financial performance 
(as evidenced by EPS growth) and the delivery of superior stock 
market returns (as evidenced by relative TSR performance).
BAsIc A nnu Al s Al Ary A nD Benef Its
The executive directors’ salaries are reviewed by the Committee 
annually for implementation from 1 July in each year. Ad hoc 
reviews can also be made. In deciding upon appropriate salary 
levels, the Committee takes into account current remuneration 
trends, relative up-to-date information from the comparator 
group, the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and information on proposed increases in the remuneration of 
salaried employees and subsidiary company directors across 
the Group.  The Committee determined that, for the second 
consecutive year, executive directors’ salary levels should 
be increased by 2.5 per cent with effect from 1 July 2011, 
which was broadly in line with the overall increase for salaried 
employees and subsidiary company directors across the Group.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain 
benefits-in-kind, principally a fully-expensed car or car allowance 
and medical and permanent health insurance.
The fees of the Group Chairman and the non-executive directors 
are determined by the Board and reviewed on an annual interim 
and biennial full basis within the limits set out in the Articles of 
Association.  At the December 2010 full review the annual basic 
fees of the Group Chairman and the non-executive directors 
were increased by £10,000 and £3,000 respectively, from 
January 2011, the first increase since January 2008.  No further 
increases were agreed at the December 2011 interim review.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is designed to 
attract and retain non-executive directors of sufficient calibre to 
undertake the responsibilities entrusted to them. They neither 
receive variable remuneration nor do they participate in any 
incentive arrangements.
Annu Al v Ar IABle p Ay
The Committee establishes performance conditions annually 
which govern the variable pay of the executive directors under 
the annual variable pay arrangements for each financial year, 
subject to a maximum variable payment of 100 per cent of basic 
salary. Variable pay is not pensionable.
The Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether an 
executive director receives any variable pay and the size (if any) 
of such a payment.
Performance conditions for variable pay in 2012 are based 
on the achievement of normalised EPS
1
. The performance 
conditions have been set such that variable pay of between 
20 per cent and 100 per cent of basic salary will become 
payable upon achievement of between 96.5 per cent and 
111 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS
1
. A performance 
below 96.5 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS
1
 will result in 
no variable pay.
The variable pay arrangements for 2011 and 2012 specify that 
if an executive director’s shareholding in the Company is less 
than 100 per cent of his basic salary, a percentage of the net 
variable pay receivable in excess of 25 per cent of basic salary 
is required to be invested in Company shares according to the 
following arrangement:
a)  for the balance of any variable pay received between 25 per 
cent and 50 per cent of basic salary, 30 per cent of the net 
variable pay must be invested in Company shares and 
70 per cent may be retained; and
b)  for the balance of any variable pay received between 50 per 
cent and 100 per cent of basic salary, 50 per cent of the net 
variable pay must be invested in Company shares and 
50 per cent may be retained.
Company shares so acquired must be held for three years.
Since 2011, variable pay has been subject to clawback 
provisions. The Company has the right to reclaim some or all 
of the variable pay from the Executive Board in circumstances 
where the Company discovers that it materially misstated 
its financial results or made an error in the calculation of any 
performance condition, which resulted in an overpayment to 
and/or where there has been misconduct on the part of any 
member of the Executive Board.

Options may no longer be granted under the 1997 Scheme and 
there are currently no plans to grant any further options under 
the 2002 Scheme.
performance share plan
The Performance Share Plan 2006 (the “Plan”) was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM held on 17 May 2006 and is the sole 
long-term reward plan operated for senior executives. Details of 
awards made to the executive directors from 2008 to 2011 are 
set out on page 61.
For the awards made in 2009, the TSR element (representing 
50 per cent of the awards) will vest in full on 23 March 2012 as 
the Company achieved upper quartile (top 25 per cent) TSR 
performance against the peer group. However, none of the EPS 
element of those awards (representing the other 50 per cent) 
will vest as the stretching EPS performance conditions were not 
achieved.
As mentioned in the introductory letter, the Committee has reviewed 
the policy under the Plan for the awards to be made in 2012.
Award levels will be increased for 2012 from 100 per cent of 
basic salary to an award over shares worth 150 per cent of basic 
salary (at the date of grant) for the Executive Board.  Lower 
award levels will be granted to less senior executives. This is

items defined by the Committee. business review

Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    GovernAnce    DIrectors’ remunerA tIon report 55
an increase from the 100 per cent of basic salary award levels 
made in prior years, with the additional award level being subject 
to much tougher EPS performance targets, described below.  
This increase is considered to bring the overall remuneration 
levels closer to, but not exceeding, remuneration levels in 
equivalent FTSE 250 businesses and will increase the emphasis 
on rewarding long-term performance. 
The awards will vest no earlier than the third anniversary of the 
date of grant, provided that the performance conditions have 
been satisfied over a three-year period and the participant is still 
employed.
Dividends notionally accrue on awards from the date of award 
and an equivalent cash sum will become payable on vesting to 
the extent that the shares ultimately vest.
The performance conditions for the Executive Board will be 
structured as follows:
earnings per share growth
Recognising the increased award level under the Plan and the 
strategic focus on increasing earnings per share significantly and 
sustainably, vesting of two-thirds of an award will be dependent 
upon growth in normalised EPS
2
 (over a three-year performance 
period, commencing on the first day of the 2012 financial year). 
These targets have been made significantly more stretching, 
particularly at the upper end of the range, recognising the 
increased award level. The performance conditions are set out in 
the table below:

the approval stage for that investment and any other items defined by the Committee.
This sliding scale of EPS performance and vesting is shown 
graphically below:
Growth in normalised EPS will be determined by the Committee 
after verifying calculations made internally.
t otal shareholder return
Vesting of the other third of an award will be dependent upon the 
Company’s performance in terms of TSR, as measured against 
the TSR of each company in the comparator group listed below 
(the “Comparator Group”) over a three-year performance period, 
commencing on the first day of the 2012 financial year. TSR is 
calculated as the percentage change in the net return index from 
the start to the end of the performance period
3
. This essentially 
measures the return to an investor on a holding of Interserve 
shares. The Comparator Group is drawn from the Construction 
& Materials and Support Services FTSE sectors. Many of the 
Comparator Group companies are recognised by the Executive 
Board as competitors of the Company, which ensures that this is 
an effective incentive from their perspective.

The return index at the start of the performance period is the average of the net return index 
over the three months preceding the start of the performance period. The return index at 
the end of the performance period is the average of the return index over the last three 
months of the performance period.

TSR will be independently calculated and verified by the 
Committee.
There is no provision within the rules of the Plan for the re-testing 
of any of the above performance conditions.
The Committee considers that a combination of normalised EPS 
and TSR for the Executive Board remains the most appropriate 
measure of performance for awards made under the Plan. The 
EPS target rewards significant and sustained increases in value 
and delivers strong “line of sight” for the Executive Board whilst 
the TSR performance condition provides balance by rewarding 
good relative stock market performance and introduces an 
element of share price-based discipline to the package. The 
blend of these two complementary measures is considered to 
reduce the risk level of the Plan compared to the position if a 
single metric applied to the entire award.
Since 2011, PSP awards to the Executive Board have also been 
subject to the same clawback provisions set out on page 54.
For participants below Executive Board level the performance 
condition will be based solely on the targets for growth in 
normalised EPS set out above over the three-year performance 
period. This single EPS target has been chosen in order to 
provide a clearer “line of sight” for those participants.
All-employee share schemes
In order to support the Company’s Employer of Choice goal 
and to encourage share ownership, the Company currently 
provides two all-employee HMRC-approved share schemes for 
its employees. At the AGM held on 12 May 2009, the Interserve 
Sharesave Scheme 2009 (the “Sharesave Scheme”) and the 
Interserve Share Incentive Plan 2009 (the “SIP”) were adopted 
and approved. The executive directors are entitled to participate 
in both the Sharesave Scheme and the SIP .
Grants under the Sharesave Scheme were made in 
August 2009, May 2010 and April 2011.  Each grant enables 
eligible employees to invest up to £25 per month for a period of 
three years.  Participants are granted an option to acquire shares 
in the Company using the proceeds from their savings contract 
at an exercise price fixed shortly before they start saving.  For past 
grants, the exercise price has been set at 10 per cent below the 
average of the middle-market share price over the five dealing 
days immediately preceding the invitation date. The exercise of 
options on maturity is not dependent upon performance criteria.  
Details of options granted to the executive directors are set out 
on page 60.
It is proposed to make a further grant under the Sharesave 
Scheme to eligible employees in April 2012. In order to 
encourage a greater take-up rate, the exercise price for these 
awards will be set at 20 per cent below the average of the 
middle-market share price over the five dealing days immediately 
preceding the invitation date.
Under the SIP, eligible employees are offered the opportunity 
to invest up to £1,500 per tax year of pre-tax earnings to buy 
shares in the Company under a regular monthly share purchase 
plan or by up to two lump sum payments per tax year or by 
a combination of the two. Shares so purchased are placed in 
trust. The shares can be released from the trust to participants 
at any time, but income tax and national insurance contributions 
are payable on their value should they be released within five 
years of their purchase date. 
The directors’ share interests table on page 59 includes shares 
purchased under the SIP by the executive directors.
shareholding Guidelines
In June 2006 the Committee introduced Shareholding 
Guidelines for executive directors with the effect that executive 
directors are expected to retain no fewer than 50 per cent 
(increased to 100 per cent in February 2012) of shares net of 
taxes following an option exercise or award vesting, until such 
time as a shareholding equivalent to 100 per cent of base 
salary has been achieved. Shares purchased under the annual 
variable pay arrangements, Sharesave Scheme and SIP count 
toward this limit.  The executive directors’ shareholdings as 
a percentage of base salary, as at the date of this report, are 
shown below:

Dilution limits 
Under present dilution limits the Company is permitted to 
allocate a rolling ten-year aggregate of up to 10 per cent of its 
ordinary share capital (12,580,434 shares) under all its share 
schemes. At 31 December 2011 there remained headroom 
equivalent to 5,341,844 shares over which options may be 
granted under the Company’s share schemes.
It is currently anticipated that all exercises of options and awards 
made under both the 1997 and 2002 Schemes and the Plan will 
be satisfied by newly-issued shares.
pensI on A rr AnGements
Adrian Ringrose and David Paterson are members of the 
Defined Benefit section of the Interserve Pension Scheme (the 
“Scheme”) which was closed to further accrual on 31 December 2009.
All the executive directors are members of the Defined 
Contribution section of the Scheme under which employee 
contributions of up to 8 per cent of basic annual salary are 
matched by the employer. For those employees who have 
completed ten years’ pensionable service in the Scheme an 
additional contribution of 2 per cent of basic annual salary 
became payable by the employer from 1 January 2010. From 
1 July 2011 the employer contribution for the most senior 
executives in the Group was increased to 15 per cent of basic 
salary, conditional upon that executive maintaining his previous 
level of contribution to the Scheme.
Where the aggregate of the employer’s and employee’s pension 
contributions exceeds the annual allowance (currently £50,000), 
the employee’s contribution may be reduced to maintain the 
aggregate contributions below the annual allowance. Where the 
employer’s contribution exceeds the annual allowance it may be 
taken as a salary supplement. business review
 
overview governance financial statements
Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    GovernAnce    DIrectors’ remunerA tIon report 57
From 1 July 2011, where an employee’s pension savings have 
reached the lifetime allowance and he elects to make no further 
pension contributions the Company has a discretion, subject 
to the employee demonstrating to the Company’s satisfaction 
that he has reached the lifetime allowance, to receive the 
employer’s pension contribution as a salary supplement. In such 
circumstances, death-in-service cover would continue to be 
maintained by the Scheme.
All the executive directors participated during the year in the 
Company’s “SMART Pensions” arrangement. SMART Pensions 
is a salary sacrifice arrangement set up by the Company 
providing an option for employee pension contributions to be 
met by their employer following a corresponding sacrifice in their 
contractual pay. This scheme affords the Company a saving in 
employer’s National Insurance contributions.
In the event of death in service, members of the Scheme are 
covered for a lump sum benefit of four times basic annual salary 
plus a return of their Retirement Account. This benefit is payable, 
at the discretion of the Trustee of the Scheme, to one or more 
of their dependants. In addition, for members of the Defined 
Benefit section of the Scheme, a spouse’s pension would be 
payable based upon their pensionable service up to 
31 December 2009.
Executive directors may elect to retire after reaching the age 
of 60 and may, upon reaching 65 years of age, request the 
Company to agree to their deferring their retirement beyond the 
age of 65.
There are no unfunded or unapproved pension promises or 
similar arrangements for directors.
execut Ive DI rectors’ serv Ice contr Acts
The Company’s policy on the duration of directors’ service 
contracts is that all newly appointed executive directors should 
have contracts terminable at any time on one year’s notice save 
where it is necessary to offer longer notice periods to any new 
directors recruited from outside the Group, in which case such 
periods would be reduced to one year after an initial period.
Details of the service contracts of all the executive directors are 
summarised below. Each contract has an indefinite unexpired 
term and a notice period of one year.
Name Date of contract
S L Dance 10 January 2008
T P Haywood 30 November 2010
B A Melizan 10 January 2008
D J Paterson 1 January 2011
A M Ringrose 13 December 2001
D I Sutherland 1 January 2011
In the event of the termination of any service contract the policy 
of the Company would be not to make payments beyond its 
contractual obligations.
The service contracts provide that if the contract is terminated 
summarily (for reasons other than gross misconduct), the 
Company may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice equal 
only to the executive’s annual basic salary. The Committee feels 
that any payment at this level is not excessive (as there is no 
entitlement to other elements of the package) and considers that 
the certainty for the executive that this provision provides
ensures clarity all round. There are no provisions entitling the 
executive to terminate his employment or receive damages 
in the event of a change in control of the Company, or for 
compensation payable by the Company to increase beyond 
one times annual basic salary. Copies of the service contracts 
are available for inspection by shareholders at the AGM. The 
Committee will continue to keep under review the terms of 
executive directors’ service contracts.
None of the executive directors (save for Bruce Melizan who is 
an unremunerated director of the Safer London Foundation) hold 
directorships of other companies in which the Company does 
not have a direct or indirect interest.
Group cHAI rmA n AnD non-execut Ive DI rectors
Non-executive directors are appointed initially until the first AGM 
of the Company following appointment, when they are required 
to stand for election by shareholders. These appointments 
are terminable upon one month’s notice by either party, 
without compensation, save for the Group Chairman whose 
appointment is terminable upon six months’ notice by either 
party, without compensation. The fees of the non-executive 
directors are determined by the Board as a whole, taking into 
account amounts paid by other similar-sized listed companies. 
Details of non-executive appointments held during the financial 
year ended 31 December 2011 are as follows:

Variable pay for 2011 was based on the achievement of normalised EPS (i.e. basic earnings per share adjusted to remove the effects of IAS 36 Impairment of assets and IAS 39 Financial 
instruments, any return generated from the sale of any of the Group’s PFI investments in excess of the internal rate of return set by the Board at the approval stage for that investment, and any 
other items determined by the Committee). The performance conditions were set such that variable pay of between 10 per cent and 100 per cent of basic salary would become payable upon 
achievement of between 90 per cent and 115 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS.  A performance below 90 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS would result in no variable pay becoming 
payable. The operation of the variable pay scheme for the 2011 financial year resulted in a payment of 100 per cent of basic salary for each executive director, the details of which are shown in 
the table above.

Defined Benefit scheme 
Following the benefit changes to the Interserve Pension Scheme 
(the “Scheme”), Adrian Ringrose and David Paterson ceased 
to accrue any further benefits in the Defined Benefit section of 
the Scheme from 31 December 2009.  Their accrued pensions 
at that date were £72,337 per annum and £31,056 per annum 
respectively and these pensions will increase up to the point they 
draw their benefits broadly in line with price inflation.

Directors’ responsibility 
statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”) (UK 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law 
the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that 
period.
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
a)  the Company and Group financial statements in this Annual 
Report, which have been prepared in accordance with UK 
GAAP and IFRS, respectively, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company 
and of the Group taken as a whole; and
b)  the Directors’ Report contained in this Annual Report 
includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
sCope o F the A uDIt o F the FI nAnCIAl 
st Ate Ments
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistences we consider the implications for our report.
o pInIon on FI nAnCIAl st Ate Ments
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we

the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK

IAS 12 (amended) Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets
The impact of the sections of IFRS 9 currently issued will result in the Group’s project finance interests that are currently treated by the  
joint-venture companies as being available-for-sale, being treated as a debt carried at “fair value through profit or loss” or “amortised cost”.  
As a result, movements in the fair value will no longer be taken to “Other comprehensive income”.
The key impact of IAS 19 (revised) will be to remove the separate assumptions for expected return on plan assets and discounting of scheme 
liabilities, and replace them with one single discount rate for the net deficit. This will have the impact of increasing the interest charge related 
to pensions.
Except for IFRS 9 and IAS 19 (revised), listed above, the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods 
will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group. 
c ritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements management makes certain judgements and estimates that impact the financial 
statements. While these judgements are continually reviewed the facts and circumstances underlying these judgements may change resulting in a 
change to the estimates that could impact the results of the Group. In particular:
Revenue and margin recognition
The policy for revenue recognition on long-term and service contracts is set out in notes 1(d) and (e). Judgements are made on an ongoing basis 
with regard to the recoverability of amounts due and liabilities arising. Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcomes of these types of contracts, 
which require assessments and judgements relating to the recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in work scopes, contract programmes and 
maintenance liabilities.
PFI financial assets and derivative financial instruments
The Group’s interests in PFI/PPP investments are classified as “available-for-sale” financial assets by the joint-venture entities. The fair value of these 
financial assets is measured at each balance sheet date by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset. The discount rate used 
is based on long-term LIBOR plus a margin to reflect the risk associated with each project.
The Group’s PFI/PPP joint-venture and associate companies use derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate and inflation rate risks to 
which the concessions are exposed within their long-term contractual agreements. These derivatives are initially recognised as assets and liabilities 
at their fair value and subsequently remeasured at each balance sheet date at their fair value. The fair value of derivatives, assessed by discounting 
future cash flows, constantly changes in response to prevailing market conditions.  72 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    fInAncIAl st Atements    72 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    fInAncIAl st Atements

Measurement of impairment of goodwill 
As set out in note 1(b) the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually. In determining whether goodwill is impaired an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated is required. This calculation of value in use 
requires estimates to be made relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows expected from the CGU, and suitable discount rates based on 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the specific economic environment of the relevant CGU.
Retirement benefit obligations 
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits, the Group has disclosed in note 28 the assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit 
obligations. In the calculation a number of assumptions around future salary increases, increase in pension benefits, mortality rates, inflation, 
discount rates and the likely future return on scheme assets have been made. 
Property, plant and equipment 
The rental fleet in Equipment Services has a carrying value of £102.7 million (2010: £110.0 million). The great majority of equipment in the rental fleet 
is depreciated on a straight-line basis to a residual value of zero over 10 years. Asset lives are reviewed regularly in light of technological change, 
prospective utilisation and the physical condition of the assets. Due to the transportable nature of the rental fleet, the review for potential impairment 
is performed on a global basis. 
Carrying value of trade and other receivables 
Allowance for doubtful debt and provisions against other receivables, including amounts due on construction contracts and carrying value of 
accrued income, are made on a specific basis, based on estimates of irrecoverability determined by market knowledge and past experience.
1. AccountI ng pol Ic Ies
Interserve Plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and bound by the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated 
financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and 
associates. These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. As disclosed on page 29 the directors believe that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The significant accounting policies adopted by the directors are set out below and have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are 
considered material to the Group’s financial statements.
(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). 
The results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint-venture entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The results 
of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal 
respectively.
Minority interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity interest therein. Minority 
interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority’s share of the changes in equity since the 
date of the combination. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the associates, joint ventures and any newly acquired subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. When an entity has an accounting reference date other than 31 December, 
due to the influence of a co-shareholder or customer requirements, the consolidation includes management accounts, prepared using these 
Group accounting policies, drawn up for the year ended 31 December.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly-controlled operation, that company proportionately accounts for its share of the income and 
expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis. Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on 
the same basis.
(b) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquired company. The acquired company’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at 
their fair value as at the acquisition date. Before the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised), the cost of acquisition included any costs directly attributable 
to the business combination. Costs incurred on acquisitions completed since 1 January 2010, the date of adoption of the revision to IFRS 3, 
are expensed.

overview governance financial statements
Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    fInAncIAl st Atements    consolIDA teD    notes 73
(b) Business combinations (continued)
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP value at that date, subject to 
being subsequently tested for impairment. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is 
included within investments in associated undertakings.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquired company is initially measured at the minorities’ proportion of the net fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
(c) f oreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. These 
translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the average 
rate of exchange for the year. The balance sheets are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the 
translation of the opening net assets and financial results for the year at the closing rate is taken directly to reserves.
(d) r evenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of goods and services supplied to external customers, the value of work executed in respect of provision of 
services and construction contracts and the rental and sale of equipment, excluding VAT. Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction contracts (see below).
n on-construction revenue and investment revenue is recognised on an accruals basis.
(e) construction contracts
Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract activity at the balance sheet date. Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is only recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that it will be recoverable. Profit is only recognised on a construction contract when the final outcome can be assessed 
with reasonable certainty. Expected losses are recognised immediately. Stage of completion is determined by surveys of work performed by 
quantity surveyors in conjunction with clients.
(f) o ther intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are stated at fair value less accumulated amortisation and any impairment 
losses, provided that the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition. 
Operating software acquired as part of a related item of hardware is capitalised within property, plant and equipment along with the hardware 
acquired. Other software licences acquired are capitalised, along with the cost to bring the software into use, within intangible assets.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis, typically between three and ten years.
(g) property, plant and equipment 
(i) Owned property, plant and equipment – tangible fixed assets are carried at historical cost less any accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment losses. Properties in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation is charged so 
as to write off the cost of assets over their expected useful lives.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line or reducing-balance basis at rates ranging between:
Straight line Reducing balance
Freehold land n il –
Freehold buildings 2% to 5% –
Leasehold property over the period of the lease –
Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38%
(ii) Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives. The finance 
charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.

(h) Impairment of tangible and other intangible assets
The Group reviews, at least annually, the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets compared to their recoverable amounts to 
determine whether those assets have suffered an impairment loss (see note 11). Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
(i) Investments
Investments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date. Investments are financial assets and are classified as fair value through the profit or 
loss. Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
(j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method. n et 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution.
(k) Borrowing costs
Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.
(l) pf I bid costs and other pre-contract costs
In the case of PFI bid costs, on financial close of the project the Group recovers bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company. If 
the fee exceeds the amount held by the Group as an asset, the excess is credited to the balance sheet as deferred income and is released to the 
income statement over the construction period. If the agreed fee is less than the amount held by the Group as an asset, the loss is recognised as 
soon as it is anticipated.
Other pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it is 
virtually certain that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows. Virtual certainty of a contract 
award is a subjective assessment, but normally arises on appointment as preferred bidder or notification from the prospective customer of their 
intent to appoint Interserve. 
(m) leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(n) provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset 
but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any 
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using an appropriate rate that takes into account the 
risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    fInAncIAl st Atements    consolIDA teD    notes 75
(o) f inancial instruments
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the 
income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. Trade receivables are financial assets and classified as loans 
and receivables.
Cash and deposits
Cash and deposits comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and deposits are financial assets and are classified as 
loans and receivables.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Bank borrowings are other financial liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge 
its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk. To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are 
accounted for using hedge accounting.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is taken out and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each 
balance sheet date. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as, and effective as, hedges of future cash flows and 
net investments are recognised directly in the other comprehensive income statement. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the underlying hedged item is recognised 
in the income statement. However, when the transaction that is being hedged results in a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the gains 
and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of that asset or 
liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity at that time is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the 
income statement for the period.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised 
in the income statement as they arise. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value through the profit or loss (FVTPL).
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
(p) share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 n ovember 2002 that were unvested as at 1 January 2004.
The Group issues share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate 
valuation model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to value the share option plans and the Sharesave Scheme. A 
stochastic model has been used to value the Performance Share Plan.

(q) pf I projects
Treatment on consolidation
The Group’s investments in PFI jointly-controlled entities (“Joint ventures – PFI Investments”) are accounted for under the equity method.
Treatment in the underlying joint-venture entity
The joint-venture entities have determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar 
contracts. The balance of risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets is not borne by the entities, and therefore the asset provided is 
accounted for as a financial asset and is classified as available-for-sale.
Income is recognised on PFI projects both as operating revenue and interest income: a proportion of total cash receivable is allocated to 
operating revenue by means of a margin on service costs taking account of operational risks, and interest income on the financial asset 
is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method. The residual element is allocated to the amortisation of the 
financial asset.
The fair value of the financial asset is measured at each balance sheet date by computing the discounted future value of the cash flow 
allocated to the financial asset. Discount rates are determined using long-term interest rates, subject to a floor, plus risk factors specific to 
individual projects. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity until the asset is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income 
statement for the period.
(r) pensions
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff. For the defined 
benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at 
each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised directly in equity and presented in the 
statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the income statement is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during 
the year.
(s) t axation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the rates at which they are likely to reverse in the tax 
jurisdiction to which they relate.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which arise between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient profits in the future to enable the assets to be utilised and 
reviewed at least annually. Deferred tax liabilities are normally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are not discounted. 
Deferred tax is charged/credited to the income statement except to the extent that the underlying asset or liability is credited/charged to equity in 
which case the deferred tax follows that treatment to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
(t) exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that the Group consider to be non-recurring and significant in size or in nature.

(a) Business segments
The Group is organised into four operating divisions, as set out below. The Group internally reviews and allocates resources to each of these 
operating divisions and each has a divisional managing director who reports into and forms part of the Executive Board.
–   Support Services: provision of outsourced support services to public- and private-sector clients, both in the UK and through Middle East 
associates.
–  Construction: design, construction and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure, both in the UK and through Middle East associates. 
–  Equipment Services: design, hire and sale of formwork, falsework and associated access equipment. 
–  Investments: transaction structuring, and management of, the Group’s project finance activities. Investments’ segmental figures represent the 
Group’s share of the associated special purpose companies. 
Costs of central services, including those in Developments relating to managing our PFI investments and central bidding activities, are shown in 
“Group Services”.
Reflecting the growing significance of our international Support Services operations and some minor changes in operational reporting structures, 
the business segmentation has been revised. The principal changes are:
–  the Support Services activities carried out by our Middle East associates, principally the Madina sub-group, have been moved from 
Construction to Support Services;
–  the Engineering business unit has been moved from Support Services to Construction; and
–  the Education facilities management business unit has been moved from Construction to Support Services.

Change in deferred contingent consideration for subsidiaries acquired in prior years (0.6) – (0.6)
At 31 December 2011 198.1 0.9 199.0 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are 
those regarding the discount rates, cash flows, growth rates and margins during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The revenue growth rates are based 
on current Board approved budgets and forecasts and are extrapolated based on expectations of changes in the market.  The Group produces 
three-year plans and then projects a further year based on growth rates of 2.5%, followed by a terminal value based on a perpetuity calculated at 
a nominal 2.5% growth which does not exceed current market growth rates.
The rate used to discount the future cash flows is 13.0% (2010: 12.2%) and is based on the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
As part of this annual review a sensitivity analysis was performed on the impairment test of each CGU, including an increase in the discount rate 
of up to 2.0% or the limiting of growth over the plan years to 2.5%. n o impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill in either Support Servcies 
or Equipment Services would occur as a result of adopting these sensitivities. business review

Total facilities 250.0 250.0 250.0 
During April 2010 the Group entered into a syndicated loan facility of £250 million maturing in October 2013. Fees paid as a result of entering into 
this new facility are held as a prepayment and are being amortised over the expected life of the facility of 36 months.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group has secured long-term refinancing (see note 32).
The majority of the Group’s borrowings bear interest at floating rates which are set according to published LIBOR rates. The remainder bear 
interest at rates that are determined by bank base rates. The Group has access to committed borrowing facilities that expire in one to two years. 
Amounts are drawn down against these facilities on a short-term basis but the ageing of the total amount borrowed is classified according to the 
maturity of the facilities. Contractual interest on bank loans, that will accrue between the year end and the date of rollover of the amounts drawn 
down, is £0.4 million and is all due for payment within one year (2010: £0.9 million within one year). 94 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    fInAncIAl st Atements    94 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011    fInAncIAl st Atements

Financial assets comprise trade and other receivables (excluding construction contracts, prepaid and accrued income), long-term debtors and 
cash and deposits. Financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values. Financial liabilities comprise trade 
and other payables (excluding construction contracts, accruals, deferred income and other tax and social security), bank borrowings, finance 
leases, loan notes, long-term creditors and interest rate hedges.
The Group has the following categories of financial assets and liabilities:

Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are held at amortised cost. The directors consider these values to approximate their 
fair values. The interest rate hedges are held at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into three levels based on the degree to which 
the fair value is observable, as defined by IFRS 7 paragraph 27:
–  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
–  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within “Level 1”, that are observable either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
–  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data.
Classification of financial assets/(liabilities) held at fair value according to the definitions set out in IFRS 7 paragraph 27: 
31 December 2011 
£million
31 December 2010 
£million
Level 2 (1.8) (2.2)
Derivatives used for hedging financial liabilities are considered to be within the grouping referred to as “Level 2”. Their fair values are calculated 
based on the valuation models operated by the relevant counterparty bank, based on market interest rates in force on the date of valuation.
n o financial instruments have been transferred between Levels during the year.
Exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed by the Group’s requirement to trade with counterparties 
with strong credit ratings as determined by international credit rating agencies. The transactional banking requirements are met by local banks in 
each location with significant cash balances being remitted to Group treasury where short-term cash surpluses or cash not available for use by 
the Group is deposited with investment grade rated banks. business review

Where the Group has overseas operations, the revenues and costs of the business will typically be denominated in local currency. Gains 
and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of individual Group 
companies are recognised in the income statement. The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage material currency 
exposures that arise on cashflows from sales or purchases not denominated in functional currencies immediately those sales or purchases are 
contracted. Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, Group companies did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or 
losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2011.
The Group does not hedge anticipated future sales and purchases.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of foreign operations’ net assets into the consolidation currency are recognised directly in equity. 
The Group does not hedge these translation differences.
The Group’s exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is shown below where a change in value of foreign currencies against sterling would have 
the following impact on the results of the Group:

(b) market price risk – interest rate hedges
The Group seeks to control its exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate swaps to limit the impact on the interest charge in the 
income statement. Contracts in place at the year end were as follows:
31 December 2011 31 December 2010
Nominal 
value 
£million Maturity Strike price
Nominal 
value 
£million Maturity Strike price
Interest rate swaps Current 20.0 2012 3.62% Current 20.0 2012 3.62%
Current 30.0 2013 3.56% Current 30.0 2013 3.56%
The fair value of interest rate hedges at 31 December 2011 is estimated at (£1.8) million (2010: (£2.2) million). The contracts are designated as 
cash flow hedges and to the extent that the hedges are effective hedges, changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity. The fair 
values of the hedge instruments are calculated based on the valuation computer models operated by the relevant counterparty bank valuation 
models. n o charges have gone through the income statement in the year (2010: £nil ) in respect of changes in the fair value of the hedges. 
A gain of £1.1 million (2010: loss of £0.6 million) was credited through other comprehensive income in respect to changes in fair value of 
the hedges. 
The use of interest rate caps and swaps, where appropriate, diminishes the impact of an interest rate change. The impact of a 1% change in 
interest rate to the Group’s results is shown in the table below:

(c) c redit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances 
for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. To manage this risk, credit references are taken and where appropriate parent company guarantees are sought along with monthly 
monitoring of age and recoverability of trade receivables.
Apart from receivables due from customers related to HM Government, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure 
spread over a  number of counterparties and customers.
(d) l iquidity risk
The Group seeks to maintain sufficient facilities to ensure that it has access to funding to meet current and anticipated future funding 
requirements determined from budgets and medium-term plans.
The maturity of financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of interest rate hedges above, are discussed in the specific asset and 
liability notes.
(e) c apital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns, whilst seeking to optimise the debt 
and equity balance, in order to maximise the return to stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes cash, 
deposits and borrowings (note 19), and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The Group has, over recent years, had a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders. The Group may adjust the capital 
structure of the Group by returning capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements but is subject to covenants in its loan agreements which seek to maintain 
the level of debt and interest that the Group may service at reasonable levels by reference to the Group’s earnings which ultimately limits the 
amount of debt that the Group can take on.

The Company and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. 
Appropriate provision has been made in these accounts for all material uninsured liabilities resulting from proceedings that are, in the opinion of 
the directors, likely to materialise.
The Company and certain subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, given performance guarantees and provided 
indemnities to third parties in relation to performance bonds and other contract related guarantees. These relate to the Group’s own contracts 
and to the Group’s share of the contractual obligations of certain joint ventures and associated undertakings. The Group acts as guarantor for 
the following:

(a) executive share option schemes
The executive share option schemes provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group’s shares on the date of 
grant. The vesting period was generally three to four years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the 
options lapse. Furthermore, options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

 (b) performance share plan 
The Performance Share Plan is a “free” share award with an effective exercise price of £nil, half of which is subject to a Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) performance condition with performance compared to a comparator group. The other half is subject to an Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
performance condition. The vesting period is three years. Further details of these conditions are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 52 to 62. Awards are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest.

(c) sharesave scheme 
The Sharesave Scheme is an all-employee HMRC-approved share scheme. The scheme involves employees saving a set amount from their 
salary for a period of three years. At the end of the three-year period the employee is offered the opportunity to purchase shares based on the 
amount saved at an option price set at the start of the period. The option price is set at a 10% discount of the average share price over five days 
trading prior to the offer date of the scheme.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous two years. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.
28. Def IneD Benef It ret Irement schemes
The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits. For each of these pension 
schemes, valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the 
requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2009.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. As permitted by IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised outside profit or loss and presented in other comprehensive income. The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the 
present value of the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. The cost of providing benefits is determined 
using the projected unit credit method.
In February 2011, the RMD Ireland Pension Scheme was closed to future accrual of benefit and as a result a £0.4 million curtailment gain has 
been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2011.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used to assess the present value of the defined benefit obligation:
2011 2010 2009
Retail price inflation 3.10% pa 3.40% pa 3.50% pa
Consumer price index 2.10% pa 2.80% pa n/a
Discount rate 4.80% pa 5.40% pa 5.60% pa
Pension increases in payment:
LPI/RPI 3.00%/3.10% 3.30%/3.40% 3.40%/3.50%
Fixed 5% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00%
3% or RPI if higher (capped at 5%) 3.60% 3.70% 3.70%
General salary increases 3.85-4.60% pa 4.15-4.90% pa 4.25-5.00% pa
The expected rate of return is derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that 
the pension schemes were invested in at 31 December 2010 and making a deduction of 0.4% (2010: 0.4% pa) for the expenses incurred in 
running the schemes (where these are not met separately). For the Interserve Pension Scheme, which represents the majority of plan assets, the 
expected rate of return on assets during 2011 (net of expenses) was 6.0% pa (2010: 6.0% pa).
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation allows for future improvements in mortality and implies for the 
majority of the obligation (that associated with the Interserve Pension Scheme) that a 65-year-old current pensioner is expected to live until age: 
male 86.0 (2010: age 85.9) and female 87.9 (2010: age 87.9). A future pensioner who is currently aged 45 and retires at age 65 is expected to live 
until age: male 87.8 (2010: age 87.7) and female 89.1 (2010: age 89.0).

Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group has secured long-term refinancing. This has seen the previous £250 million syndicated revolving 
credit facility, which was due to expire in October 2013, replaced with a series of committed facilities of £225 million and A25 million (combined total 
of £246 million, at exchange rates on 29 February 2012). These new facilities run in parallel with each other and provide a diverse maturity profile 
extending, at most, five years to February 2017 .

Intro DuctI on
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Interserve 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the Company

framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone

AuDItors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
scope of the A uDIt of the f InAnc IAl 
st Atements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report.
o pInIon on f InAnc IAl st Atements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2011;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
o pInIon on other m Atters prescr IBeD By the 
c omp AnIes Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
•	 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.
mAtters on wh Ich we A re requ Ire D to report 
By except Ion
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.

A) AccountI ng pol Ic Ies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.  The accounting 
policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the previous year.
The particular policies adopted by the directors are described below. 
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention. 
f oreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.  These translation differences are dealt 
with in the profit for the year. 
property, plant and equipment 
Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.  Depreciation is provided on a 
straight-line basis at rates ranging between: 
Freehold land n il
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property Over period of lease
Computer hardware 33.3%
Computer software 33.3%
Furniture and office equipment 33.3%
Plant and equipment 10% to 20%
The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue. 
provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any 
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using an appropriate rate that takes into account 
the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance 
cost. 
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. 
pensions
The Company operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff:  the Interserve Pension Scheme which is 
of the defined benefit type and the Interserve Retirement Plan which is of the defined contribution type.  The Company also set up a new defined 
contribution section of the Interserve Pension Scheme with effect from 1 n ovember 2002.  Actuarial valuations of the Interserve Pension Scheme 
are carried out every three years.
For the purposes of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the main 
Group scheme, the Interserve Pension Scheme, on a consistent and reasonable basis.  Therefore, the Company will account for contributions to 
the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.  n ote 28 to the Annual Report and Financial Statements of the Group sets out details of 
the IAS 19 net pension liability of £56.2 million (2010: £51.5 million).
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes 
during the year.
The defined benefit scheme was closed on 31 December 2009 with the exception of passport members.  All non-passport members transferred 
to the defined contribution scheme as at 1 January 2010.

t axation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay 
less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the 
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial 
statements.  Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell 
the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries or associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.  Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
discounted.
f inancial instruments
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value.  Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income 
statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.  The Company uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.  To the extent that such instruments are matched 
to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date 
a derivative contract is taken out and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in fair value of derivative 
instruments that are designated as, and effective as, hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in the other 
income statement. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled through 
the income statement in the same period in which the underlying hedged item is recognised in the income statement. However, when the 
transaction that is being hedged results in a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity 
are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of that asset or liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument recognised in equity at that time is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised 
in the income statement as they arise. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value through the profit or loss. Derivatives embedded 
in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics are not 
closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after n ovember 2002 that were unvested as at January 2004. The Company issues share-based 
payments to certain employees of the Group headed by the Company. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value for grants pre-2006 was measured 
by the use of the Black-Scholes model and subsequently a stochastic model was used. n ote 27 to the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
of the Group sets out details of the share-based payments. The total value of equity-settled share-based payments is credited to the profit and 
loss reserve of the Company. Share-based payments to employees of subsidiaries of the Company are recharged to the relevant employer and 
the recharged income is credited to the profit and loss account of the Company.

secure, online access to their shareholding. Facilities include:
•	 Electronic communications 
This offers shareholders the option of receiving an email notification that shareholder communications such as annual reports, half-yearly reports 
and notices of shareholder meetings are available for access on the Company’s website. It also provides an online proxy voting facility. You may 
request a hard copy of the shareholder documents or change your election at any time.
•	 Account enquiry 
This allows shareholders to access their personal shareholding, including share transaction history and dividend payment history, and to obtain 
an up-to-date shareholding valuation.
•	 Amendment of standing data 
This allows shareholders to change their registered postal address, add, change or delete dividend mandate instructions and change their 
preferred method of communication.

DIrect DI vIDen D pAyments
Dividends can be paid automatically into shareholders’ bank or building society accounts. This means that you will receive your dividends more 
quickly as the payment is made directly into your account on the payment date (you do not have to wait for the cheque to clear) and is more secure 
than receiving a cheque through the post. The service also helps Interserve improve its efficiency by reducing postage, printing and cheque clearing 
costs. A tax voucher is issued each time a dividend is paid to the shareholder’s registered address. To register for this service, please contact Capita 
Registrars (telephone: +44 (0)20 8639 3399; facsimile: +44 (0)1484 600911; email: ssd@capitaregistrars.com or go to www.capitashareportal.com).
DIvIDen D r eInvestment p l An
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan provided by Capita IRG Trustees Limited is a convenient way to build up your shareholding by using your cash 
dividends to buy additional shares in Interserve Plc. If you would prefer to receive shares for your next dividend instead of cash please complete an 
application form online at www.capitashareportal.com or call Capita IRG Trustees on +44 (0)20 8639 3402.

ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme, is a free service for shareholders wishing to give shares to charitable causes. It is particularly useful for 
shareholders who wish to dispose of a small number of shares where the market value makes it uneconomic to sell on a commission basis. Further 
details are available at www.sharegift.org.uk or by telephoning +44 (0)20 7930 3737.
Benef Ic IAl owners of sh Ares w Ith ‘‘ Inform At Ion r Ights’’

under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 are required to direct all communications to the registered holder of their shares rather than to the 
Company’s Registrar, Capita Registrars, or to the Company directly.

wArn Ing to sh Arehol Ders reg Ar DIng unsol IcI te D Investment cont Acts
In recent years many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based ‘‘brokers’’ who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn 
out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly known as “boiler rooms”. The “brokers” can be 
very persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or 
offers of free reports into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•	 Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
•	 Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register/home.do. 
•	 The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors and any approach 
from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any other appropriate action can be 
considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml.
•	 Inform Capita Registrars’ compliance department on +44 (0)20 8639 2041 or email compliance@capitaregistrars.com. 
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found at www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk.
